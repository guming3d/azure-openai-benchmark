article: More than 200 acres of the wild and 'magical' heathland that inspired author Thomas Hardy have been bought for the nation by the National Trust. The £650,000 acquisition of Slepe Heath, Dorset, will connect existing protected heathland areas as part of efforts to conserve the landscapes of Hardy's novels. Slepe Heath, whose windswept landscape was immortalised as fictional Egdon Heath in Hardy's Return Of The Native, is an important site for wildlife, including rare birds such as Dartford warblers, nightjars and woodlarks, the National Trust said. Visitors to the 240-acre site, which rises 100ft above its low-lying surroundings, are given panoramic views of the area including Corfe Castle (above), Poole Harbour and the Purbeck Hills . Visitors to the 240-acre site, which rises 100ft above its low-lying surroundings, are given panoramic views of the area including Corfe Castle, Poole Harbour and the Purbeck Hills. The acquisition of the former forestry plantation will connect the protected lowland heath of Hartland Moor, which is already looked after by the National Trust and Natural England, and the Arne reserve owned by the RSPB. Slepe Heath, whose windswept landscape was immortalised as fictional Egdon Heath in Hardy's Return Of The Native, is an important site for wildlife . Laurie Clark, National Trust Purbeck general manager, said: 'Slepe Heath is somewhere you can get that little bit closer to a true wildness. Thomas Hardy immortalised much of the area in Dorset as Wessex  in his books . 'It's a magical and wonderfully atmospheric place where visitors can experience Hardy's fictional Egdon Heath, the setting for the Return of the Native. 'Dorset's heathland is among its crown jewels in terms of both wildlife and landscape. 'By looking after Slepe Heath we can ensure that this heathland remains open and protected for everyone to continue to enjoy.' The National Trust said Hartland Moor and the Arne reserve were grazed by cattle in a way that conserved the landscape for wildlife, and the purchase of Slepe Heath would unite the sites into a single grazing area. The move forms part of efforts to improve habitat for wildlife on a 'landscape scale' under the Wild Purbeck Nature Improvement Area scheme, one of 12 such large-scale areas designated across the country by the Government. The acquisition was made possible by a legacy left to the National Trust, and is the largest area of lowland heath the Trust has acquired for more than a decade.

chatgpt: The Egdon Heath, immortalized in Thomas Hardy's classic novel Return Of The Native, has been preserved for posterity thanks to a legacy left to the National Trust. The  plateau that forms the core of Egdon Heath - Slepe Heath - is a wildlife haven, providing shelter and food for a variety of rare species of birds such as the Dartford warbler, nightjar, and woodlark. Now, this area will remain untouched and protected from future development. Slepe Heath is located on the boundary of Dorset and Hampshire in southern England. It covers an area of about 205 hectares and is managed by the National Trust as part of the Purbeck Heaths National Nature Reserve. This heathland is a habitat for a large number of rare and endangered plants and animals. The Slepe Heath is closed to the public and is treated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), mainly due to the heath's unique features, its heather and gorse habitats providing the perfect place for all types of vegetation and wildlife. The heathland is composed of a mix of bracken, heather and gorse. The tops of the hills and ridges provide an unobstructed view of the surrounding landscape. The plateau also contains large areas of bare ground, providing a natural habitat and breeding ground for some species of butterflies and moths. The Dartford warbler, which is becoming increasingly rare, is just one of the many bird species that call the heathland home. The nightjar is another rare bird that can be found here. It is a nocturnal bird and has a unique way of flying. It hovers in mid-air and feeds on insects that it catches in its wide-open mouth. The woodlark is another bird that has found a home in the Slepe Heath. Slepe Heath was secured as a nature reserve thanks to the generosity of a local resident. This generous donor left a legacy to the National Trust, which enabled them to purchase the land and environ. Without this support, this special area of wildlife and natural beauty could have been lost. The preservation of the Slepe Heath not only protects these rare species of birds but also serves as a living example of the natural beauty that has been preserved for future generations. The National Trust has taken on the responsibility of ensuring that this unique habitat is not disrupted and remains protected so that visitors can continue to enjoy it for years to come. Although Slepe Heath is closed to the public, the Purbeck Heaths National Nature Reserve does provide public access to the surrounding area. Visitors can enjoy the panoramic views from the top of the hills and enjoy walking through the heathland. The location also offers birdwatchers an opportunity to see rare species in their natural habitat. The preservation of Slepe Heath as a natural wildlife habitat is a testament to the foresight of those who have gone before us. The National Trust's acquisition of this precious land serves as a symbol of the importance of protecting the environment for future generations.
