article: Check your Facebook mail lately? Didn't think so. Apparently not many others did, either. So after three-plus years, the world's largest social media outlet is pulling the plug on its little-used e-mail service, the company confirmed Tuesday. "We're making this change because most people haven't been using their Facebook e-mail address, and we can focus on improving our mobile messaging experience for everyone," Facebook said in a statement. For those who do have a Facebook mail account, messages will be forwarded to the primary e-mail address listed in a user's account, the company said. The changes are planned to roll out in March, and users can turn off that forwarding option if they prefer not to have their personal inboxes flooded with these messages. "It's a little bit of bowing to the inevitable," said Justin Lafferty, editor of the trade site Inside Facebook. The e-mail addresses, which showed up as messages for Facebook users, never took off, and when Facebook tried to make them the default e-mail accounts for all users in mid-2012, "a lot of people were unhappy with that," he said. "It was kind of rolled out to everyone regardless of what they wanted," Lafferty said. With last week's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, the fast-growing messaging service, Facebook  is focusing more on mobile messaging than e-mail these days. Facebook ventured into the e-mail field in November 2010, adding the service to the messaging system already used heavily by its 1.2 billion users. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the system would complement, not compete, with entrenched e-mail giants such as Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. "We don't expect anyone to wake up tomorrow and say, 'I'm going to shut down my Yahoo account or my Gmail account and switch exclusively to Facebook.' But we do expect a shift to more real-time  communication," he said. Lafferty said the reversal is unlikely to be remembered in the company's annals -- much like the service itself. "Many people probably weren't even aware of the change," he said.

chatgpt: Facebook has announced that it will be shutting down its email service in March. According to the social media giant, few of its 1.2 billion users actually use the email service. As a result, the company believes this move is a natural step in streamlining its products and services. Some analysts believe Facebook's decision to shut down its email service is "a little bit of bowing to the inevitable." Despite being one of the largest tech companies in the world, Facebook has struggled to attract users to its email offering. One reason for this is that Facebook's email service was not intuitive to use. Users had to go through a series of steps to find their inbox, and the interface was generally difficult to navigate. This made the email service unappealing to users who were already accustomed to using other email providers like Gmail or Yahoo. To make the transition as smooth as possible for users, Facebook said that messages from the accounts that will be deactivated will be forwarded to a user's primary email address. This will ensure that users do not miss any important messages following the shutdown. While some are surprised by Facebook's move, others say it's about time the company did away with the service. "Facebook is not known for its email service, and it's no secret that its users have not embraced it, so this move makes sense," said one industry analyst. Facebook's decision to pull the plug on its email service is the latest in a string of moves to streamline its offerings. Last year, the company announced that it would be consolidating its messaging services across Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram Direct. This move was aimed at making it easier for users to stay connected with friends and family across different platforms. Overall, Facebook's move to shut down its email service is not unexpected. While the company was once seen as a serious contender in the email space, it is clear that it has since fallen behind its competitors. By focusing on its core products and services, Facebook will be better positioned to meet the changing needs of its users going forward.
