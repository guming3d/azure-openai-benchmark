article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- The Other Hundred, a photo-book project featuring 100 photo stories of people across 91 countries, launched its first exhibition in Hong Kong on Thursday. The project takes aim at media rankings such as the Forbes Billionaire List and is instead dedicated to people whose lives deserve recognition but who would never make the cut, said Chandran Nair, creator of the project and CEO of the Global Institute For Tomorrow (GIFT), an independent pan-Asian think tank based in Hong Kong. "The goal of The Other Hundred is both to inform and to provoke thought. The implication of many of the rich lists and articles put out by the media is that being rich is the only way to succeed or live a life of meaning. The reality is that the majority of the people are not rich and we wanted to tell their side of the story," Nair said. "It's ridiculous there are such lists like the world's 100 most beautiful people when they really look nothing like me or you," Nair added. GIFT received 12,000 submissions from 1,500 photographers in 156 countries. Nair, together with five other judges selected 100 for the accompanying photo book, published in July. The book includes short essays by acclaimed writers, such as author Pankaj Mishra, renowned Chinese poet Bei Dao and award winning journalist Amy Goodman. While the project aimed to shed light on the unspoken majority, Nair said that it does not attempt to celebrate poverty or criticize wealth. "We're trying to provoke people to define for themselves what it means to have a rich and fulfilled life. We're not trying to criticize those who seek material wealth, but the reality is that not everyone aspires to be rich, and not everybody can," Nair said. "You can tell the world is crying out for a more nuanced look at the human condition." One of the winning photographers, Theodore Kaye, said that he appreciated how the project also challenged the commercialization of the editorial market for professional photographers like himself. "There's a lot of pressure to deliver what the media wants and everybody at some point is going to bow down to it," Kaye said. "The project shows how life as it is for normal people and things as they truly are." What was most important, said Nair, was photographers' connection to the photo narratives. "We didn't want to pick the photographer who parachuted into Afghanistan and got the photo of the exotic young girl in the shadows. We want a name to put to the faces and a story to tell," Nair said. The exhibition will move next to Mumbai, New York, Beijing and Berlin in 2014. GIFT plans to follow the project with "The Other Hundred Entrepreneurs" in 2015.

chatgpt: The Other Hundred project, which features 100 photo stories, has launched its first exhibition aimed at challenging traditional media rankings like the Forbes Billionaire List. The exhibition features stories from all over the world, including Tokyo, Lagos, and Mumbai, and will move on to New York, Beijing, and Berlin in 2014. The Other Hundred's CEO, Chandran Nair, said that the project was created as a response to the media's focus on the super-rich and their luxurious lifestyles. He pointed out that the Forbes Billionaire List, for example, only features the wealthiest 0.00003% of the world's population, leaving out "the rest of us". Nair said that The Other Hundred aims to "provoke people to define for themselves what it means to have a rich and fulfilled life". The exhibition is divided into ten themes, each featuring stories of ten people from ten different countries. The themes are: A Good Education, A Place to Call Home, Hopes and Aspirations, Making Ends Meet, Growing Old Gracefully, Tough Beginnings, Small Business, Family Ties, Love and Marriage, and Fun and Games. The photo stories range from a group of female firefighters in Mexico to a young refugee living in Jordan. Nair believes that The Other Hundred's approach to storytelling is unique in that it seeks to show the diversity of life experiences and values around the world. He pointed out that the media often presents a narrow view of what success looks like, centered around material wealth and corporate power. The Other Hundred, on the other hand, presents stories of people who have found success in other ways, such as by staying connected to their communities or pursuing their passions. The exhibition's launch was attended by photographers, artists, and journalists from all over the world. They praised the project's focus on human stories and its efforts to challenge traditional media rankings. Several also noted how the project brought together different perspectives and experiences. One photographer featured in the exhibition, Oscar Pena, said that his photo story about a group of garbage collectors in Guatemala was "a celebration of the dignity of work". He said that through his work, he hopes to challenge the idea that certain types of work are less important or less respectable than others. The Other Hundred project was first launched in 2013 via a call for nominations for untold stories of people from around the world. The project's team received more than 10,000 nominations, which they narrowed down to 100 photo stories. The project's website features all 100 stories as well as additional interviews and articles. The project has been praised for its emphasis on diversity, creativity, and community engagement. It seeks to create a space for new voices and perspectives in a media landscape often dominated by a few big players. The next leg of the exhibition promises to be just as exciting, as it travels across the globe to showcase even more stories from all walks of life. In conclusion, The Other Hundred project, which launched its first exhibition, aims to challenge traditional media rankings like the Forbes Billionaire List. Through its 100 photo stories, the exhibition presents a diverse set of life experiences and challenges people to consider what it means to have a rich and fulfilled life. The project has been praised for its focus on human stories and its efforts to give voice to different perspectives and experiences. The exhibition will move on to several other cities in 2014, promising even more exciting stories to come.
