'We are dedicated to football and we try to do it in the best way. In a personal manner, I can say that the club have worked and taken good care of the guys in La Masia - that is what you can see.

chatgpt: FIFA has upheld the transfer embargo placed on Barcelona after the club was found guilty of signing underage players. The news will come as a blow to the Catalan giants, who had launched an appeal against the ban. Barcelona's appeal was dismissed by FIFA's Appeals Committee, meaning the club will be unable to sign any new players until January 2016. The Camp Nou outfit was accused of breaking the rules on the transfer of players aged under 18, with FIFA initiating disciplinary proceedings against the club in April. Despite the setback, Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano has refused to be drawn into the legal dispute surrounding the club. The former Liverpool man instead chose to praise the way the Catalan club treats its young players. Speaking in a recent interview, Mascherano said: "There is a lot of recognition for the club and the way they work with the kids. The model that has been implemented in recent years is very good." He went on to add that Barcelona's famed La Masia academy was a key part of the club's success in recent years. Under the club's model, young players are nurtured from a young age and given the opportunity to develop their skills in the club's youth teams. "The La Masia academy is the foundation of the team," Mascherano said. "It's where the club is nurtured and it's where we develop players for the first team. We all have to feel proud to be part of the club and the youth system." The Argentine international's comments come amid what has been a turbulent time for Barcelona. The club has been hit by a number of off-field issues in recent months, including the suspension of club President Josep Maria Bartomeu and the sentencing of former President Sandro Rosell. Despite the ongoing legal disputes, Barcelona remains one of the most successful clubs in modern football. The Catalan giants have won four of the last six La Liga titles and last year secured their fifth European Cup triumph under the guidance of coach Luis Enrique. As the club prepares to defend its title, the news of the upheld transfer ban will be a significant blow. However, with Mascherano's praise for the club's youth system still ringing in their ears, there is hope that Barcelona can continue to thrive on the back of their acclaimed academy.
