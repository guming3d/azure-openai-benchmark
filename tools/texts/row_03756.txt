article: New York (CNN) -- In addition to phone records and email logs, the National Security Agency uses Facebook and other social media profiles to create maps of social connections -- including those of American citizens. The revelation was disclosed by the New York Times on Sunday, using documents provided to the newspaper by former government contractor Edward Snowden. "We assume as Americans that if somebody in the government is looking at your information, it's because they have a reason, because you're suspected of a crime," Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School, told CNN. But the documents do not specify how many Americans' social connections have been analyzed, or whether any have been implicated in wrongdoing. NSA: Some used spying power to snoop on lovers . Change in policy . The surveillance began after a policy change in November 2010. Prior to then, the "chaining" of a foreign person's contacts had to stop when it reached an American citizen or legal resident. The policy change was intended to help the NSA "discover and track" connections from a foreign intelligence subject to an American citizen, the leaked documents show. It allows NSA analysts to use social media, geo-location information, insurance and tax records, plus other public and private sources to enhance their analysis of phone and email records, The Times reported Sunday. The "metadata" from phone and email records in the database include details such as who a person called or e-mailed. A PowerPoint slide provided to the newspaper by Snowden shows how analysts use software to create diagrams of where a person was at certain times, their traveling companions, their social networks and email correspondents. Defending the practice . President Barack Obama has ordered a review of NSA's data collection practices because of Snowden's leaks. But the president has defended the use of such methods to gather intelligence on terrorists and other threats. In response to the latest disclosure, the NSA again emphasized it does not listen to phone calls or read emails of Americans without obtaining a court order. But the newly disclosed system "tells an extraordinary amount about who you are ... who your closest allies and friends and colleagues are," Greenberg said. "To pretend that you have to read the information to be going into what a person is doing is making a false distinction." Opinion: Give Apple your fingerprint? It's your call . David Simpson reported and wrote from Atlanta, and Pamela Brown reported from New York.

chatgpt: In 2010, the National Security Agency (NSA) initiated a social mapping program that was not disclosed until recently. The latest disclosure in The New York Times comes from documents provided by Edward Snowden, who was a former NSA contractor. The program involved collecting metadata on people's social connections and interactions online. The program allowed for the monitoring of internet and phone communications. However, the NSA has repeatedly stated that they are not listening to calls or reading e-mails without court permission. Instead, they collect metadata such as the time, duration, and frequency of communications. According to legal experts, the newly disclosed system, also known as Socmint, "tells an extraordinary amount about who you are." The system was designed to help identify potential terrorist threats by analyzing social networks and identifying connections between individuals. However, many believe that the program raises major concerns about privacy and government overreach. The collection of metadata has been a controversial issue for many years. In 2013, Edward Snowden leaked classified documents revealing the extent of the NSA's surveillance programs. Since then, there has been a significant effort to reform surveillance laws to protect individuals' privacy rights. The NSA is expected to release more information about the program in the coming weeks. However, civil liberties advocates argue that the program goes beyond what is necessary to protect national security and is a violation of Americans' right to privacy. The social mapping program has been in operation for over a decade, and the NSA claims that it has been an invaluable tool in identifying threats and preventing terrorist attacks. However, many are worried that the program may be used to target individuals or groups based on their social connections or online activity. The disclosure of the social mapping program is just the latest in a series of revelations about the NSA's surveillance programs. The agency has faced criticism from civil liberties groups and privacy advocates for its collection of metadata and the use of bulk data collection programs. In conclusion, the latest disclosure about the NSA's social mapping program is raising major concerns about privacy and government overreach. Many believe that the program goes beyond what is necessary to protect national security and violates Americans' right to privacy. With more information expected to be released in the coming weeks, the debate over the NSA's surveillance programs is likely to continue.
