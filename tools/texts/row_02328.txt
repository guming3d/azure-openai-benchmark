article: It's the show which celebrates some of the most extreme body modification imaginable… and should you be uncomfortable with having your eyeball tattooed then look away now. These unsettling pictures show in excruciating close-up every detail of the process, carried out at this year's Venezuela Tattoo Expo in Caracas, which bills itself as being the biggest event of its kind in Latin America. Eyeball tattooing is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the bizarre procedures people have endured for the sake of (body) art. Implants, dental work, ear tunnels and even carving off bits of their own flesh have all been experimented with as enthusiasts compete for the most diabolical look. Ouch! Luis Alfonso has his eye tattooed black at Caracas's International Tattoo Festival . Hold him down: One twitch could be disastrous as Mr Alfonso's eye is injected with a dye . Extreme: It may seem a modern conceit, but eyeball tattooing was first described in 150AD by the Romans . Scary: A man with both eyes tattooed black, named only as Alex, poses for a photograph by revealing his tongue, which has been cut down the middle to give it a reptilian-style split .

Sub-dermal implants form ridges around her entire skull, while her tattoos have a distinct supernatural theme . Ms Cristerna, pictured, has heavily modified her teeth to fit in her her vampire-inspired image . As well as extreme modification to her face, she offers people the key to her heart, pictured . This Venezuelan man is known, unsurprisingly enough, as Red Skull. He appeared at the four-day event .
