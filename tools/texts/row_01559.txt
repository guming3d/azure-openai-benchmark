chatgpt: Two corrections officers who were on duty at the Ohio prison where notorious kidnapper and rapist Ariel Castro hanged himself on September 3 have been placed on paid leave. Caleb Ackley, 26, and Ryan Murphy, 27, have not been disciplined in the past and the reason for the leave is currently unclear. Castro was being held in protective custody away from other inmates at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, after being sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years for his heinous crimes. However, he managed to hang himself just 33 days into his sentence, shocking the nation and prompting an internal investigation by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. The victims of Castro's crimes – Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight – have remained silent on the matter, declining to comment on the suicide or the actions of the two corrections officers. The prison has not released many details about the specific events leading up to Castro's death, but according to reports, guards were required to check on him every 30 minutes. It's not clear if Ackley and Murphy were responsible for this task, or if they were present during the moments that led to Castro's death. Regardless of their specific involvement, it's clear that Castro was able to take his own life while in the custody of the state – a failure that is likely to result in significant scrutiny for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. The agency has already faced criticism from the families of Castro's victims, who were outraged at the light sentence he received. Castro abducted the three young women over the course of several years, holding them captive in his Cleveland home where he raped, tortured, and impregnated them. In May 2013, Berry managed to escape with her six-year-old daughter, prompting a national manhunt for Castro. The revelations about the women's captivity shocked people across the country and resulted in a renewed focus on human trafficking and similar issues. However, Castro's suicide has largely overshadowed those efforts, with many people asking how such a high-profile prisoner was able to take his own life while in the custody of the state. For their part, Ackley and Murphy remain on paid leave as the investigation into Castro's death continues. As more information becomes available, it's likely that they will face increased scrutiny from both the prison system and the public at large, with many people eager to find out how this tragedy was allowed to occur.
