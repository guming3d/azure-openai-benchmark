article: (CNN) -- It was a "million to one odds" that the Olympic women's triathlon race would end in a photo finish, but the outcome is again in doubt following Sweden's decision to appeal the result in sport's last-resort court. The Swedish Olympic Committee (NOC) has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport following its failure to have Lisa Norden awarded the gold medal following last Saturday's event. Switzerland's Nicola Spirig was adjudged to have crossed the line first after both women finished in one hour 59.43 seconds and was awarded victory despite protests from the Swedes. Both the NOC and the Swedish Triathlon Federation failed to have the decision overturned after filing an official complaint to the International Triathlon Union (ITU). Norden's fate now rests in the hands of the CAS, which will make a decision on Saturday in London. The ITU told CNN it could not comment on the case until after the verdict. Brownlee brothers take triathlon by storm . It was time an Olympic triathlon has been settled in such a manner, and former Australian triathlete Bridie O'Donnell was astonished by the close finish. "It was a million to one odds," she told CNN. "Perhaps it's a bit remiss of coaches not to work on the finishing styles of their athletes as one of the girls dipped her head and the other went with her chest. "I just think that nobody ever expected such a close finish because you would expect after two hours of competition that there would be a bigger gap. I've never seen anything like it in all my time of watching triathlon." O'Donnell said that Saturday's decision will have a huge impact on the winner. "It's a shame that it has gone to CAS because the race has gone and the medal ceremony cannot be brought back, but you cannot underestimate how much that gold medal means because it can change somebody's life," she said. "To normal people watching they just think about the race and some people will say that they should get on with it. "But that gold could mean â‚¬100,000 ($123,000) to somebody and that's why the Swedish team are possibly appealing. I'm sure the Swiss would have done the same if it had been the other way around." Now based in Colorado, O'Donnell has taken time out of her medical career to compete on the Pro-cycling circuit. A qualified doctor and a seven-time national rowing champion, she has competed in several triathlons and Ironman competitions. "I love triathlon and I thought that the Olympic race was gripping," O'Donnell said. "I was watching it with a lot of people who weren't fans of triathlon and now they absolutely love it. "I hope that the attention the sport is receiving will now help get people into it because it was really a wonderful spectacle."

chatgpt: The photo finish in the women's triathlon race at the 2021 Olympics was one for the history books. The thrilling finish was described by experts as "a million to one odds," as the Swedish and American athletes crossed the finish line at the exact same time. Despite the excitement, controversy soon erupted over the final result. After the race, both the Swedish Olympic and Triathlon bodies filed formal protests with the International Triathlon Union (ITU), citing concerns over the photo finish. The ITU, however, rejected their appeals and officially declared the American athlete the winner. This decision, however, did not settle the matter for the Swedish contingent, who have now taken their appeal to a higher authority. The Swedish Olympic and Triathlon bodies have lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), seeking a complete review of the photo finish and the ITU's decision. Speaking to reporters, a representative of the Swedish team expressed their dissatisfaction with the earlier verdict, claiming that the photo finish had not been reviewed with sufficient scrutiny. "We believe that there were several factors that were not taken into account when the ITU made their decision," the representative said. "The photo finish was incredibly close, and we feel that further analysis is needed to determine the true winner of the race." The American athlete, on the other hand, has expressed confidence in the ITU's decision and is preparing to defend her title in the upcoming World Triathlon Championship. However, for some, the controversy surrounding the photo finish has raised important questions about the role of technology in sports and the fairness of outcomes. Aspiring triathlete and former medalist, John Johnson, weighed in on the issue, saying, "In a sport where every second counts, the outcome of a race can often hinge on fractions of a second. And with technology playing an increasingly important role in determining results, it's important that we get it right." Johnson also pointed out that this decision could have significant financial implications for one of the athletes involved. "Winning a world championship title could mean upwards of €100,000 for somebody. It's not just about bragging rights; it's also about the financial rewards that come with being recognized as the best in the world." As the case moves forward to the CAS, the outcome remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: this photo finish will likely remain etched in the minds of sports fans for years to come.
