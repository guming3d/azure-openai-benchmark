Celtic 'hid' from calls and emails from Legia Warsaw about the ineligible player that cost the Polish club their place in the Champions League, according to the chairman of their country's FA. Celtic were gifted a place in the play-off round of Europe's top tier competition despite losing 6-1 on aggregate to Legia in the third qualifying round - courtesy of an admin mistake with the victors bringing on an ineligible player. Legia were stripped of their Champions League status and Polish FA chairman Zbigniew Boniek claims Celtic were unreachable as the saga unravelled, with calls and emails that could have seen their opponents put through ignored.

Ineligible: Bartosz Bereszynski (right) was deemed to be playing illegally, seeing Legia stripped of their place . Bartosz Bereszynski is a Polish international who has won two caps for his country. He started his career at Lech Poznan in 2009 before joining Legia Warsaw in 2013. The 22-year-old was suspended for the match having picked up a three match ban last season after being sent off against Apallon in the Europa League. He could have served two matches of his suspension in the second round against St Patrick's but Legia failed to register the defender for those matches allowing Berg to choose from his full compliment of 25 players. Boniek claims that the Glasgow club's consent would have seen Legia allowed to stay in the competition but Celtic simply disappeared off the radar on the day. 'Had Celtic officially given up their place, Legia could have stayed in Champions League,' Boniek said in quotes translated by  Polish journalist Robert Blaszczak. 'Celtic were unreachable that day. Didn't return the calls or reply to e-mails. They just hid and waited.' The Champions League play off round paired Cletic with Slovenian side Maribor while Legia are left to face Aktobe of Kazakhstan in the Europa League play off. The Polish club will be hoping to reach the final in their home city at the end of the season - although they are also expected to launch an appeal against UEFA's decision.

chatgpt: Polish football club, Legia Warsaw, have been denied a place in the next round of the UEFA Champions League after fielding an ineligible player during their game against Scottish champions, Celtic. Bartosz Bereszynski came on as a substitute for just four minutes during the match, but it has cost the club dearly. The Polish side beat Celtic 6-1 on aggregate in the third qualifying round, but their Champions League dreams were shattered when UEFA ruled that Bereszynski should not have taken part. Legia Warsaw were expelled from the competition and are now hoping for a successful appeal. Legia Warsaw's chairman, Zbigniew Boniek, spoke out on the issue and accused Celtic of being unsporting in the affair. He claimed that the Scottish champions could have allowed them to keep their place in the competition, as Bereszynski's involvement had little impact on the result. "They won the match 6-1, they should have let us keep our place. They could have shown some fair play," he said. Celtic, however, have remained quiet on the matter, with some suggesting that the Scottish side were simply taking advantage of an administrative error made by their opponents. The Polish FA chairman, Zbigniew Boniek, has expressed his disappointment at Celtic's lack of sportsmanship in the affair. "They didn't even attempt to discuss the issue with us. They just hid and waited," he said. Legia Warsaw have now been relegated to the Europa League play-off, rather than progressing to the top-tier of the Champions League. The club has announced its intention to appeal the decision, and Henning Berg, the club's manager, has stated that they will take the matter "all the way" if necessary. Berg, who also talked about the incident, noticed that around the world, rules whose penalties and consequences are disproportionate to a fault coming from a bureaucracy are changed. In the case of the Legia scandal, he thinks there is just proper ground for UEFA to revisit their decision, seeing as the punishment doesn't match the crime. The news of Legia Warsaw's expulsion has been met with disappointment from fans, who expected their team to make it to the Champions League group stage. The club has enjoyed a successful season so far and remains a strong contender in the Europa League, but the loss of a place in the highest tier of European football will undoubtedly sting. In conclusion, the aftermath of the Legia Warsaw-Celtic affair has raised questions about sportsmanship and fairness in football. While Legia Warsaw admits the mistake and will accept a sanction of sorts, many in the club and the football community believe that the punishment does not fit the crime. Fans of the club will undoubtedly be hoping for a successful appeal as their team prepares for the Europa League playoffs.
