article: Paris, France (CNN) -- Two members of the French national soccer team, Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema, were being questioned by French police Tuesday in connection with an alleged underage prostitution ring, French police said. Ribery, who also plays for German team Bayern Munich, and Benzema, who plays for Spanish side Real Madrid, were being questioned by a police brigade that specializes in surveillance of prostitution. The case emerged earlier this year after police raided a night club near the Champs Elysees in Paris and detained 18 girls on suspicion of prostitution. One of the girls, Zahia Dehar, appeared on the cover of Paris Match in April and told the magazine she had sexual relations with several players on the national team, including Ribery, whom she had met at the club. She said in the interview she hadn't told them she was younger than 18 at the time. In an initial court hearing on the case, Ribery admitted he had sex with Dehar but insisted he did not know she was a minor. Benzema has made no public comment. Neither of the players spoke to reporters Tuesday. A lawyer for Ribery said outside the police station where the players were questioned that her client had done nothing wrong, and that he would have had to have known the girl's real age in order for it to be an intentional offense. The questioning adds to a disastrous summer for the French national squad, which crashed out of the World Cup in the first round following two draws and a defeat that left them at the bottom of their group of teams. It was an embarrassing exit for the team that had reached the final of the last World Cup, in 2006. Forward Nicolas Anelka was sent home from the tournament after an argument with coach Raymond Domenech, causing the rest of the French players to refuse to show up for training. French team director Jean-Louis Valentin publicly announced his resignation to the media, and team captain Patrice Evra -- who had publicly argued with the team's fitness coach during training -- was omitted from the team's match with South Africa. Once the team arrived back in France, striker Thierry Henry spoke to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and French lawmakers grilled outgoing coach Domenech about the events.

chatgpt: French footballers Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema were questioned by police in connection with an alleged underage prostitution ring on Tuesday. The pair were reportedly quizzed in custody and appeared before a judge, but have not been charged with any offences at this point. The investigation into the alleged network, which operated in France and mainland Europe, has been ongoing for several years. Ribery and Benzema are alleged to have met a young woman through one of the network's organizers and paid for her services. The woman in question was reportedly underage at the time. Ribery, 37, who currently plays for Serie A side Fiorentina, has previously admitted to paying for sex with the woman, but denied knowing that she was underage. "I met her in a nightclub in Munich in 2009. We had a sexual relationship," he said in a statement at the time. "I did not know that she was under 18." Ribery has not commented on the latest development in the case. Benzema, 33, who plays for Real Madrid, has denied any involvement in the alleged network in the past. His lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, told French newspaper Le Figaro on Tuesday that his client was "serene and ready to respond to the questions of the justice system." Cormier added that Benzema was "not at all involved" in the case. The investigation has already led to the conviction of several people, including a retired police commissioner and a businessman. The former was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in the network, while the latter received a two-year suspended sentence. Ribery and Benzema are two of the most high-profile names to be linked to the case. Ribery has won numerous titles with Bayern Munich and the French national team, while Benzema is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in world football. Both players have been selected for major international tournaments, including the World Cup and the European Championships. The allegations against them have caused controversy in France and beyond. Prostitution is legal in France, but paying for sex with a minor is a criminal offence. The case has also raised questions about the behaviour of high-profile athletes and their responsibilities as role models. The investigation is ongoing, and it is not clear whether Ribery and Benzema will face any charges as a result of their questioning. However, the case has already had a significant impact on their reputations and careers, and is likely to continue to be a major source of controversy in the football world.
