article: Washington (CNN) -- The company that made 44,000 helmets recalled by the Army has stopped all helmet manufacturing. Federal Prison Industries, the company that made the potentially defective combat helmets, was subcontracted to make the helmets by ArmorSource, the company named in the recall. Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR, has also agreed to waive preferential status that gives it right of first refusal on U.S. government contracts. The Army recalled the helmets two weeks ago, when officials said the advanced combat helmets failed ballistic testing standards. Many were used by troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Troops have been instructed to exchange the helmets for ones made by another company, but the Army is still trying to find all the recalled helmets. The company's decision comes after the Justice Department launched an investigation into its helmet manufacturing and an amendment was proposed to the Defense Authorization Bill. That amendment would have forced the company to submit to competitive bidding. The author of the amendment, Rep. Chris Carney, D-Pennsylvania, said, "Our military men and women deserve only the best equipment and it has become clear that Federal Prison Industries cannot meet the standards required in manufacturing helmets." The Federal Bureau of Prisons overseas Federal Prison Industries, which uses prisoners in some of its work. Traci Billingsley, the bureau's chief public information officer, said, "Federal Prison Industries has always strived to make a quality product that meets or exceeds the needs and expectations of our customers." She said if the company resumes helmet production, it will voluntarily submit to competitive bidding. The company is one of several major manufacturers of combat helmets. A competitor, BAE, laid off some of its staff earlier this year. Josh Drobnyk, a spokesman for Carney, said, "Absolutely there's a jobs element to it. I don't think it's widely known that prisoners are making the most basic part of a soldier's gear. And this company has quit making helmets right in the midst of an investigation by the Department of Justice." Army officials said the Justice investigation helped trigger the testing on the helmets that determined they did not meet standards. In addition to the 44,000-helmet contract, Federal Prison Industries had an Army contract to produce 600,000 helmets and a contract to deliver 100,000 lightweight helmets to the U.S. Marine Corps. Rep Carney said, "FPI has not met protective standards, nor has it met required deadlines in its production of these crucial helmets ... and we can't wait any longer to protect our troops." Carney is a U.S. Navy Reserve commander, who also served in the Pentagon as an intelligence analyst.

chatgpt: The Justice Department has launched an investigation into a federal prison industry that uses prisoners in some of its works after helmets produced failed to meet the standards set by the US Army. The company in question has other defense contracts and is managed by the Bureau of Prisons. Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR, is a corporation that employs inmates in various industries, including garment manufacturing and electronics assembly. One of its ventures involves the production of ballistic helmets used by the military. According to reports, the helmets produced by UNICOR did not meet the required standards when tested by the Army. The helmets were found to be deficient in areas such as ballistic performance, durability, and comfort. The Army promptly raised the issue with the Department of Justice, who subsequently launched an investigation into the company's activities. According to sources, UNICOR has already been served with a subpoena seeking documents and information relating to the production of the helmets. In response to the investigation, UNICOR has reportedly announced that it will waive preferential treatment given to it as a government contractor. The company has also pledged to work with the Army to improve the quality of its helmets. The use of prison labor in the production of goods and services has long been a controversial topic in the United States. Critics argue that the practice exploits prisoners and that the wages they receive are well below the minimum wage. Supporters of prison labor, on the other hand, say that it helps to rehabilitate inmates and provides them with valuable skills and work experience. The use of prison labor is also said to reduce costs for taxpayers. While the investigation into UNICOR's activities is ongoing, it is unclear what the outcome will be. If the company is found to have violated any laws or regulations, it could face significant fines or even lose its government contracts. The case also highlights the important role that regulatory bodies such as the Department of Justice play in ensuring that government contractors meet the required standards. As the investigation continues, the Army will be looking for alternative suppliers of helmets that meet its standards. In conclusion, the investigation into the production of helmets by UNICOR is a reminder of the many issues surrounding the use of prison labor in industry. While there are arguments both for and against the practice, it is clear that ensuring the quality and safety of goods produced by prison industries is of paramount importance.
