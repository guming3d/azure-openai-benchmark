chatgpt: Manchester City midfielder David Silva has been ruled out of the upcoming Premier League clash against rivals Manchester United after suffering a knee problem. The Spaniard limped off the field during the Capital One Cup defeat against Newcastle in midweek, and it has now been confirmed that he will be sidelined for the big game against United. Silva's injury could also cause him to miss the crucial Champions League tie against CSKA Moscow next week. This setback comes as a blow to City, who are currently fighting for success in multiple competitions. City manager Manuel Pellegrini expressed his concerns about Silva's injury at a press conference: "David has a problem in his knee. It's not serious, but he's not able to play this weekend. We hope that he will be ready for the next game." Meanwhile, midfielder Yaya Toure is set to play against United on Sunday, which will be a relief to City fans. Toure's presence will be vital for City, as they look to defeat a strong United side in the eagerly anticipated match. Toure has recently been at the centre of controversy, when his agent made comments suggesting that the player felt unappreciated by City management. However, Pellegrini has clearly stated that Toure is a valuable member of the team, and will continue to play an important role. "There's no doubt that Yaya is an important player for us," Pellegrini stated. "He's a great professional, and he's always given his best for this club. I don't think his agent's comments have affected him, he's a top-class player." The City vs United match is one of the most highly anticipated fixtures of the season, and both teams will be looking to come out on top. City will be hoping to keep their position at the top of the table, while United will be looking to close the gap. With Silva out of the picture, City will be looking to their other star players, including Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling, to step up and deliver a memorable performance. As the countdown to the game begins, fans from both sides will be eagerly anticipating an exciting and intense match, full of thrills and spills from start to finish. Only time will tell who will come out on top in this city derby.
