According to officials, Grisham and the child were pretending to play with guns when Grisham took it too far. The game involved the child pretending to shoot the man with his finger while Grisham would then pull the trigger of his pistol while aiming at the boy. However, this time, police said that there was a bullet sitting in the chamber, and it discharged when Grisham pulled the trigger. The incident took place in Grisham’s home in Missouri, and the child was rushed to a nearby hospital in critical condition. According to reports, Wilson underwent emergency surgery, and the bullet was successfully removed from his head. However, he remains in critical condition, and it is not yet clear if he will survive the incident. The news of the incident has shocked the local community, and many are expressing their outrage and sadness at what happened. The child’s family has said that they are devastated by the incident and are praying for their son’s recovery. Grisham has been charged with first-degree assault and is being held in custody without bond. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison. The incident has raised questions about gun safety and the responsibility of gun owners. Many are calling for stricter gun control measures to prevent incidents like this from happening in the future.

According to the Giffords Law Center, over 350 children under the age of 18 are shot and injured or killed by guns every year in Missouri. The incident has sparked a debate about how to prevent gun violence and protect children from accidental shootings. Many are calling for gun owners to take more responsibility for their weapons and make sure they are secured at all times.
