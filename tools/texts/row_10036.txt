article: Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon defended his government's approach to combating crime and drugs Monday during his final state of the nation address. More than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, when Calderon took office and announced plans to deploy troops to combat cartels. He steps down in December. "What's clear ... is that we've made advances Mexicans should feel proud of," the president said, adding that it may take years for his government's efforts to come to full flower. "Mexico has started along the path toward a life full of liberty and security." Calderon, who spoke at the National Palace, voiced support for the role of government troops in the drug war. Critics contend too many officials have ties to the cartels, are corrupt and are doing as much to help the traffickers as to stop them. Alleged drug cartel figure extradited . Mexican authorities recently accused four top military officials, including a former deputy defense secretary, of connections with organized crime in what could be one of the highest-profile corruption cases in recent history. Though Calderon admitted mistakes have been made, he said such abuses are the exception, not the rule, and described the military as the nation's first line of defense. As he has in the past, he criticized the United States for providing criminals with almost "unlimited access" to weapons. The president also hailed progress made on the economic front during his administration. Roughly 2 million jobs were created, he said, stressing that security and growth go hand in hand. He highlighted investments made in infrastructure, particularly along rural roads. Calderon, who belongs to the right-wing National Action Party, will be replaced by Enrique Pena Nieto, a member of the rival Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Candidate refuses to accept results . Some political opponents of Pena Nieto, whose party governed Mexico for more than 70 years until 2000, have warned that negotiating with drug cartels and gangs could be on his agenda -- an accusation that Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied. Calderon urged the next government to continue the fight against organized crime. Pena Nieto has pledged to focus more on reducing violence and less on catching cartel leaders and blocking drugs from reaching the United States. He has called for a "new debate" on the drug war, in which the United States would play a significant part. Pena Nieto will be sworn into office on December 1.

chatgpt: Mexico will soon have a new President taking office in December. Outgoing President Felipe Calderon's term ends this year and his successor will be Enrique Pena Nieto from the rival party. Mexico has been plagued by drug violence for the past decade, with more than 47,500 people losing their lives since 2006. Calderon has been in office since 2006 and has been credited with launching an ambitious war on drugs. However, the efforts have not been without controversy, with critics accusing Calderon of using heavy-handed tactics and militarizing the conflict. Observers also point out that the drug cartels have only grown stronger under his watch, expanding their operations to other parts of the country and even beyond Mexico's borders. With Pena Nieto taking over, many are hopeful that he will bring a fresh approach to the issue. The President-elect has promised to focus on addressing the root causes of the violence, such as poverty and lack of education, rather than just cracking down on the drug cartels themselves. Pena Nieto has also pledged to improve law enforcement and strengthen the country's justice system. The new President will face many challenges, however. The drug cartels remain powerful and entrenched, with an estimated 60,000 members operating across the country. They also have links to corruption within the government and law enforcement, making it difficult to tackle the issue head-on. Despite the difficulties, Pena Nieto has stated that he is committed to reducing the violence and bringing peace and stability to the country. He has emphasized the need for unity and cooperation across all levels of society and has promised to work with other countries in the region, such as the US, to address the issue. Mexico's drug violence is not just a domestic issue, but has wider implications for the international community. The country is a major supplier of illegal drugs to the United States and other countries, and the violence has spilled over into neighboring countries such as Guatemala and Honduras. The situation also poses a threat to Mexico's economic development, as foreign investors and tourists are deterred by the instability and violence. As Mexico prepares for a new chapter in its history, many are hopeful that the change in leadership will bring a fresh approach to the issue of drug violence. Pena Nieto faces a daunting task, but with the support of the international community and the determination of the people of Mexico, he may be able to make progress in bringing an end to the bloodshed that has plagued the country for too long.
