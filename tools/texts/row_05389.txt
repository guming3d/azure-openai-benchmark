The agave Americana is already higher than its owners' bedroom window and its amazing growth shows no sign of slowing . Sharon McMullan, 54, and her 66-year-old husband Bill bought the plant at a garden centre. It remained dormant for years, producing nothing but spiky green leaves. But following a series of mild winters, it has unexpectedly burst into life – producing the towering stem in a matter of weeks. Mrs McMullan, a grandmother from Paignton in Devon, said: ‘The flower prong is nearly as tall as the house. You can see it getting taller on a daily basis. 'It’s outside the bedroom window now and it doesn’t seem to have stopped yet. For years the plant remained dormant, producing nothing but spiky green leaves . But following a series of mild winters, it has unexpectedly burst into life - producing the towering stem in a matter of weeks . ‘We’re a little bit worried it could fall down in a storm and land on a neighbour’s car. 'But my grandchildren love it – they call it the Giant Beanstalk.’ She added: ‘I haven’t done anything special, I wouldn’t say I’m much of a gardener.’ Agaves – which are native to Mexico and used to make tequila – flower only once before the  plant dies. During the flowering, a tall stem or ‘mast’ grows from the centre of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of short  tubular flowers. A spokesman for the Royal Horticultural Society said:  ‘Normally they would be happier in hotter climates such as Spain or Portugal but mild winters here are protecting them and allowing them to flourish.’

The McMullans were thrilled to see the new growth on the plant, which has long been a fixture of their home. They said it was like "a gift from the plant" and were excited to watch it grow and thrive.  Neighbors and friends have also been intrigued by the plant's sudden burst of life. Many have taken a keen interest in the plant and have asked the McMullans for tips on how to care for their own plants.
