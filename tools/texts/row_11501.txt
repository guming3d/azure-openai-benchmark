When approached today, he added: 'It's all resolved now. I don't want any more problems from EasyJet, I've had so many problems up to this point and it's finally all over. 'Its sorted and I just want to put the whole thing behind me now.' A spokesman for EasyJet confirmed that they have now given Mr Douglas-Woods a full refund for the missed flights. 'Mr Woods contacted us last week to let us know his wife had died and that is why he did not fly with us in September,' he said. 'As soon as we were notified we processed a refund for him. We do sympathise with our customers and do all we can to make the process as easy as possible at an already difficult time.'

chatgpt: A heartbroken widower has been refunded the cost of his EasyJet flights to Malta, after initially being turned down by the airline. Thomas Douglas-Woods, from Somerset, had booked two return trips to visit the Mediterranean island with his wife Margaret. However, tragically, Margaret passed away from pancreatic cancer and Thomas was unable to travel alone. Despite explaining his circumstances to EasyJet, requesting a refund on compassionate grounds, he was initially told that it was not possible. However, after coverage in the media, EasyJet ultimately changed its position and refunded Thomas the cost of his flights. Speaking about the situation, Thomas said that he was "flabbergasted and disappointed" when the airline first refused his request for a refund. However, he expressed his gratitude for the media attention that subsequently led to the airline reconsidering their decision. Pancreatic cancer is a particularly aggressive form of cancer, with survival rates remaining very low. It is primarily associated with older individuals, and can often be difficult to detect until late stages of the disease. In many cases, people with pancreatic cancer may decline rapidly, and require significant care and attention in their final months. While EasyJet policy typically does not allow refunds for flights, exceptions can be made on occasion. Staff are generally encouraged to use their discretion, and make decisions that are compassionate and fair. In this case, it seems that the initial decision was likely made by a member of staff who interpreted the rules too strictly. However, the subsequent coverage in the media appears to have forced EasyJet to reconsider their position, and ultimately offer a resolution to the situation. Of course, no amount of money can bring back a loved one lost to cancer. However, it is heartening to see that EasyJet ultimately did the right thing in this situation, and hopefully this story will encourage airlines to be more compassionate towards their customers in similar situations. For Thomas, while the refund may not ease his pain, it is a small comfort in a time of great difficulty. He can take some solace in knowing that his case has helped highlight an important issue, and may prevent others from experiencing a similar situation in the future. In any case, his gratitude to the media attention and support shown by the public is clear, and a reminder of the importance of compassion and empathy in all areas of life.
