article: David Cameron's plans to curb immigration do not go far enough and leave Britain at risk of 'immensely serious social dangers', a Conservative backbench manifesto claims. Brian Binley, treasurer of the powerful 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said tougher controls were needed on migrants' access to welfare and the jobs market. In a pamphlet for the respected Civitas think-tank, he said immigrants' country of origin should be made to pay for social security costs until they have made a significant contribution to the Exchequer. Scroll down for video . Brian Binley (pictured), treasurer of the powerful 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said tougher controls were needed on migrants' access to welfare and the jobs market . There would also be automatic deportation for anybody given a one-year prison sentence or two court fines – a far tougher regime than is currently in place. The document will increase pressure on the Prime Minister to toughen up the Tory Party's position on immigration controls. In November, Mr Cameron promised to stop EU migrants claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and getting access to social housing for four years. But he disappointed his backbenchers by stopping short of more robust action, including a temporary ban on migrants – the so-called emergency brake. It emerged that No10 dumped the idea after German Chancellor Angela Merkel made it clear it would not win EU support. In November, Mr Cameron promised to stop EU migrants claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and getting access to social housing for four years . The pamphlet by Mr Binley, one of the party's most senior backbench figures, reflects widespread concern among the rank-and-file that the UK has 'surrendered control over its borders'. It states: 'Emerging policies have failed to be wide-ranging and ambitious enough. Failure to address public immigration concerns would carry immensely serious social dangers.' Mr Binley, who co-authored the pamphlet with the academic Dr Lee Rotherham, continues: 'The free movement of workers as permitted under EU rules means that the UK has lost control of the supply side of its workforce. 'This would not be an issue but for the fact that it is subsidising its own native workforce to remain unemployed and our long-term uncompetitiveness by hiring in outside labour. 'This may be advantageous to the productivity of the companies in these areas, but it is disadvantageous to the taxpayer who has to effectively subsidise them by dole payments, while the UK workers affected fail to better themselves and rise up the employment ladder.' He also accuses Labour of 'cynically' encouraging mass immigration, adding: 'Those who endorse a level of mega-immigration that exceeds the ability of society to integrate the newcomers are deliberately attempting social change by different means.' Mr Cameron sparked controversy this year by excluding immigration from his six key election themes. The Office for National Statistics is expected to confirm this month that net migration is still 250,000 a year.

chatgpt: Brian Binley, treasurer of the 1922 Committee, has expressed concerns about the current Prime Minister's approach to immigration, stating that he is "too soft" on the issue. Binley believes that tighter controls are needed on migrants' access to welfare and jobs. He has also called for anyone given a one-year prison sentence to be automatically deported. Binley's comments come after a series of high-profile cases in which immigrants have been found guilty of serious crimes, but have been allowed to remain in the UK. This has led to increased pressure on the Prime Minister to take a tougher stance on immigration. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Binley outlined his concerns, saying that "it is clear that the current Prime Minister is failing to address the issue of immigration in a meaningful way. We need to see much tougher controls on migrants' access to welfare and jobs, and we need to be much more aggressive in the way we deal with those who break the law." Binley went on to call for automatic deportation for anyone given a one-year prison sentence, stating that "we cannot continue to allow criminals to remain in this country once they have served their sentence. This is simply not acceptable, and it undermines the rule of law." The 1922 Committee, of which Binley is treasurer, is a powerful group of Conservative MPs who are responsible for overseeing the party's leadership. The group has been critical of the Prime Minister's handling of a number of issues, including Brexit and immigration. Binley's comments are likely to increase pressure on the Prime Minister to take action on immigration. The issue has been a contentious one for many years, with some Conservative MPs calling for tighter controls on immigration, while others argue that the country benefits from the contributions of immigrants. The Prime Minister has previously stated that the UK needs to have "controlled immigration," but has also expressed a willingness to allow "talented" individuals to come to the country. However, critics argue that the current system is too open, and that it allows too many people to come to the UK. Binley's comments reflect this concern, and suggest that there is a growing consensus within the Conservative Party that tougher action is needed on immigration. Whether the Prime Minister will take notice of this remains to be seen, but it is clear that the issue is likely to remain a contentious one for some time to come. In conclusion, Brian Binley's comments have increased the pressure on the Prime Minister to take a tougher stance on immigration. They reflect a growing consensus within the Conservative Party that tighter controls are needed on migrants' access to welfare and jobs. The issue is likely to remain a contentious one, with both sides of the argument presenting strong cases.
