article: By . Lucy Waterlow . There's no need to be disappointed about this week's news that resveratrol (found in red wine and chocolate) won't help you live longer, as scientists are now championing a different antioxidant in the fight against ageing. Called glutathione, it is molecule produced by the body to fight free radicals. Dr Yannis Alexandrides, a Harley . Street plastic surgeon and founder of a new supplement containing the ingredient, said: 'Glutathione is the body's most powerful . antioxidant and detoxifying agent, but outside the science community, . few people have even heard of it. Beauty boost: Three 111SKIN capsules must be taken a day to stimulating the production of glutathione - which is said to combat the signs of ageing . 'It's now time to raise . awareness on thismolecule that delivers incredible health . benefits, and even helps slow the aging process.' Glutathione has such a powerful regenerative effect on cells, when someone takes a paracetamol overdose and the liver goes into failure, to reverse the effect and ultimately stop them dying, they are given a pure Glutathione drip. But the makers of the new supplement,  111SKIN, have used it to create a product aimed at those who want younger looking skin. Three capsules must be taken a day to stimulate the production of glutathione, with the theory being that the body's cells ability to fight free radical damage is . then strengthened, and the ageing process is delayed. As with much of the 111skin range, the supplement was developed with the help of astronauts. Dr Alexandrides explains: 'My team of scientists . previously worked on the Soviet Space Programme, and their role was to . keep astronauts in orbit in peak health and this meant harnessing the . ability to raise the levels of the most powerful antioxidant in the . body. 111 Skin Radiant Skin Beauty Dose capsules, left, contain Glutathione. It can also be found in fruit and vegetables including avocado . 'They discovered that NAC supplements combined with key vitamins in . their purest form, effectively stimulated the production of glutathione, and they patented their formula unique to 111SKIN.' Dr Alexandrides claims their formula is more effective than other  glutathione supplements currently on the market which have been found to be ineffective when taken orally because it is poorly absorbed and broken down by the stomach. 111SKIN launches at Harrods in August with a bottle of 90 capsules costing £75. In the meantime, it's available via their website 111skin.com. Dr Alexandrides said: 'It's . always been our goal to bring these supplements to a wider market, and . as environmental and lifestyle aggressors increase on earth, we knew . that space would dictate the future for wellbeing.' For those who would rather not take three tablets a day - or shell out £75 for the capsules - but still want to see if they can tackle the signs of ageing with glutathione, simply eat more foods containing the antioxidant. Glutathione can be found in numerous fruit and vegetables including broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, red peppers, avocados, peaches, watermelon and tomatoes.

chatgpt: A new supplement containing glutathione, a molecule produced by the body to fight free radicals, has been developed by scientists who worked on the Soviet Space Programme. This new supplement promises to tackle signs of ageing and improve overall health. Glutathione, an antioxidant produced naturally in the body, plays a crucial role in cellular function and protecting cells from oxidative stress. The molecule helps to detoxify the body and supports a healthy immune system, making it an attractive target for anti-ageing treatments. The new supplement, developed by a team of scientists who worked on the Soviet Space Programme, contains high levels of glutathione and other anti-ageing compounds. The scientists used their experience in space medicine to create this new formula that can help to combat the effects of ageing and support a healthy lifestyle. According to the scientists, the new supplement provides a range of benefits including improved skin health, increased energy, and reduced inflammation. They claim that regular use of the supplement can help to ward off the effects of ageing and support overall health and wellness. The supplement has gone through extensive testing to ensure its safety and effectiveness. The scientists used a combination of clinical trials and laboratory studies to determine the optimal dosage and formulation for the supplement. One of the key benefits of the new supplement is its ability to support healthy ageing. As people get older, their bodies produce less glutathione, which can lead to an increase in oxidative stress and other age-related illnesses. This new supplement helps to provide the body with the necessary nutrients to support healthy ageing and protect against free radical damage. The new supplement is also attracting attention in the beauty industry due to its skin health benefits. Glutathione is known to help brighten the skin and reduce the appearance of dark spots and other blemishes. By including this molecule in their supplement, the scientists have created a product that can support both internal and external health. While the new supplement is not a cure for ageing, it is a promising development in the fight against age-related illnesses and the effects of ageing on the body. The supplement is a safe and effective way to support healthy ageing and maintain overall health and wellness. In conclusion, the new supplement containing high levels of glutathione and other anti-ageing compounds promises to tackle signs of ageing and support overall health and wellness. Developed by scientists who worked on the Soviet Space Programme, the supplement has gone through extensive testing to ensure its safety and effectiveness. With its ability to support healthy ageing and improve skin health, this new supplement is becoming an attractive option for those looking to improve their overall health and wellness.
