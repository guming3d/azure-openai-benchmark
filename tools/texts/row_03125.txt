article: (CNN) -- Researchers have solved the first step in treating the common cold, by mapping its entire genome, or genetic map, teams from the University of Maryland and the University of Wisconsin-Madison reported Thursday. The common cold, also known as the human rhinovirus infection . "We have the pieces all in place. They can't go in any other way. Now we have to understand what the pictures are telling us," said Dr. Stephen B. Liggett, professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and director of its Cardiopulmonary Genomics Program. The research was published in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday afternoon. Technically known as the human rhinovirus infection, the common cold is responsible for half of all asthma attacks and is a factor in bronchitis, sinusitis, middle-ear infections and pneumonia. The coughs, sneezes and sniffles of colds impose a major health care burden in the United States -- including visits to health care providers, cost of over-the-counter drugs for symptom relief, often-inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and missed work days -- with direct and indirect costs of about $60 billion annually.  How mapping the cold genome may lead to a cure Â» . "We generally think of colds as a nuisance, but they can be debilitating in the very young and in older individuals and can trigger asthma attacks at any age," Liggett said. "Also, recent studies indicate that early...infection in children can program their immune system to develop asthma by adolescence." Finding a cure for the common cold has been elusive. That's because the rhinovirus is so complex. Made up of at least 99 different strains, it can infect different people with different symptoms. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living. By mapping the genome of the common cold and assembling the results into a "family tree," scientists can see how the virus strains are related, as well as their differences. Liggett, who is also the study's senior author, says this is a breakthrough in solving the common cold puzzle because. "At least now we have an understanding of which virus one might have." Now that the pieces are together, drug companies can work on developing new treatments that would either halt or prevent the cold virus before it begins to spread. Researchers found that human rhinoviruses are organized into about 15 small groups. So the idea of one drug fits all probably won't work, Liggett says. "Our mindset right now is to consider more along the antiviral treatment, rather than vaccines, but always keep an open mind to the new technology of vaccine development." Investigators are so optimistic with their findings that they predict the development of new drugs within the next two to five years, depending on Food and Drug Administration approval, which could mean one day soon, runny noses caused by colds may be a thing of the past.

chatgpt: In a significant milestone for medical research, scientists have mapped the entire genome of the common cold virus for the first time. The achievement has given researchers hope that a cure for the common cold may finally be found, as they now have a much better understanding of how the virus works. The research was conducted by a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who spent several years studying the cold virus and its genetic makeup. By mapping the entire genome of the virus, the researchers were able to identify the specific genes and proteins that are responsible for causing the symptoms of the common cold. According to the researchers, the study could be a major step forward in the development of new treatments for colds. Colds are responsible for direct and indirect costs of about $60 billion annually in the U.S. alone, so any breakthrough in combating the virus could have a significant impact on public health and the economy. Scientists have been searching for a cure for the common cold for decades, but their efforts have been hampered by the complexity of the virus. The cold is caused by a family of viruses, with hundreds of different strains that are constantly evolving and mutating. Previous studies have focused on individual strains of the virus, but the University of Wisconsin-Madison team took a different approach. They sequenced the entire genome of every known strain of the virus, giving them a comprehensive understanding of how the virus works as a whole. The researchers identified several key genes and proteins that are essential for the cold virus to replicate and spread. By targeting these genes and proteins, scientists may be able to develop new treatments that can either prevent the virus from spreading or help the body fight off the infection more effectively. The team also identified several potential targets for vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of the virus. Current cold vaccines are only effective against specific strains, so a universal vaccine would be a major breakthrough in combating the virus. The researchers caution that there is still much work to be done before a cure for the common cold can be developed. However, they feel that their study provides a solid foundation for future research in this area. The mapping of the cold virus genome is just one example of the exciting breakthroughs that are being made in medical research. With advances in technology and a growing understanding of the human body, scientists are making rapid progress in developing new treatments for a wide range of illnesses. The potential impact of these breakthroughs on public health and the economy cannot be overstated. The development of a cure for the common cold may seem like a small victory in the grand scheme of things, but it could have significant implications for millions of people around the world. As the University of Wisconsin-Madison team continues to study the cold virus, they are hopeful that their work will lead to a breakthrough in the near future. Whether it takes months or years to develop, a cure for the common cold could be just around the corner thanks to the efforts of these dedicated researchers.
