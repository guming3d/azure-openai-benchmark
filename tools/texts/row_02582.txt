article: By . Lizzie Edmonds . Mafia mobsters are not all psychopaths despite their reputation for being gangsters who kill, traffic drugs and kidnap, a new study claims. Italian researchers Schimmenti and colleagues, who are based in the birthplace of the mafia Sicily, went to a prison in Palermo to interview 30 convicted mobsters. They questioned 39 prisoners in the same institution who were jailed for non gang-related crimes. The researchers then used the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) to determine whether any of the subjects showed psychotic characteristics. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972). Researchers have found that of 30 mafia mobsters they interviewed, none showed psychopathic characteristics . The 20-item list of personality traits and recorded behaviors associated with psychopathy - such as pathological lying, lack of empathy and an impulsive nature - is a common assessment used to determine whether someone has the personality disorder. Interviewees are assessed and given a score - with those marked above 30 being deemed a psychopath. The researchers discovered that none of the Mafia members they questioned scored over 30. Conversely, 10 per cent of the comparative group did. The report observed of the mafia members: 'This means that they were less ‘manipulative’, ‘Machiavellian’, ‘narcissistic’, ‘unemotional’, ‘parasitic’ and/or ‘impulsive’ than the other participants. 'Further, during the interviews, they often expressed concerns for their children and their families, and they had never ceased to write and call them. Such expressions of attachment were less apparent among the comparison men.'Even criminal actions for most of the Mafia members were led by loyalty to their families or adherence to the family’s ‘mission’ rather than personal interest. Palermo, Sicily - where the researchers who conducted the study, Schimmenti and colleagues, are based . 'It is possible that these individuals compartmentalized their lives and behaviors –on the one side, the Mafia affairs, on the other side, their positive feelings and affects towards relatives and friends.' The study also noted that Mafia members are less likely to have substance abuse problems than others in prison. Of the mafia members, the researchers found 57 per cent had been jailed for violent offenses, 23 per cent for murder and the remainder for crimes such as kidnapping, trafficking drugs and fraud.

chatgpt: Italian researchers have conducted an interesting study on convicted mobsters in Palermo jail. The researchers have used the Hare Psychopathy Checklist to test whether the interviewees had any psychotic characteristics. The checklist is a standardized tool used to diagnose psychopathy and assess its severity. The study was conducted on thirty convicted mobsters. The researchers questioned them about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. There were none of the thirty interviewees who showed any psychotic characteristics which were a surprising finding for the researchers. Psychotic disorders are mental illnesses characterized by abnormal thinking and perceptions. Symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior. Psychopathy, on the other hand, is a personality disorder characterized by antisocial behavior, impulsivity, and a lack of empathy or remorse. The Hare Psychopathy Checklist is a diagnostic tool used to diagnose psychopathy. It consists of a series of 20 items, each of which is scored on a scale of 0 to 2. It assesses the individual's behavior, personality traits, and past history. The Italian researchers used this checklist to question thirty convicted mobsters in Palermo jail. They found that none of them showed any psychotic characteristics. This is surprising because previous studies have suggested that individuals who engage in criminal behavior often suffer from psychotic disorders. However, none of the thirty interviewees in this study showed any signs of mental illness. The researchers were interested in conducting this study because they wanted to understand the psychological profile of convicted mobsters. They sought to understand why individuals join organized crime and engage in criminal behavior. The findings of this study suggest that the mobsters in Palermo jail do not suffer from mental illness. It also suggests that the individuals who engage in organized crime may have a different psychological profile compared to those who engage in other forms of criminal behavior. Overall, this study provides a new perspective on the psychological profile of convicted mobsters. It suggests that more research should be conducted to understand the reasons why individuals join organized crime and engage in criminal behavior. This research could help policymakers and law enforcement agencies develop more effective strategies to combat organized crime.
