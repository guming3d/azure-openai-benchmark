article: Police in Texas have arrested a teen for posting a photo of a replica gun pointed at a police car along with a caption reading in part: 'Should I do it?' Montrae Toliver, 17, was arrested on Monday for allegedly making a terroristic threat. Fort Worth police say he posted a photo on Twitter of a pellet gun pointed at the front of what appears to be a parked police car in the distance. Montrae Toliver, 17, of Fort Worth, Texas, was arrested on Monday for allegedly making a terroristic threat . A separate tweet from the same account said the gun is an Airsoft replica, which was confirmed by Fort Worth officers investigating the photo, department spokeswoman Tamara Pena said. Someone saw the photo on Twitter, took a screenshot and submitted it to Fort Worth police's Facebook page, she said. 'Either way, it's a threat,' Pena said. 'And so it's going to be looked into.' The message accompanying the photo read, 'Should I do it? They don't care for a black male anyways!' The killings of two unarmed black men by white police officers in Missouri and New York this summer touched off protests and a national debate over police conduct that intensified after grand juries declined to indict the officers. Fort Worth police say Toliver posted this photo on Twitter of a pellet gun pointed at the front of what appears to be a parked police car in the distance. The message accompanying the photo read, 'Should I do it? They don't care for a black male anyways!' Tensions escalated further after two New York City police officers were killed last weekend by a man who suggested in online posts that their slayings were in retaliation for the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. Pena did not know if Toliver had received a bond, and his name was not yet listed in jail records Thursday evening. A phone number for Toliver's family could not be found. The photo in the tweet was taken on the 1100 block of Mustang Ridge Drive. Teens and parents in the neighborhood confirmed Toliver was a student at Northwest High School, where he is involved in athletics.

chatgpt: Seventeen-year-old Montrae Toliver was arrested on Monday on charges of making a terroristic threat. According to Fort Worth police, Toliver posted a photo on Twitter that showed a replica gun pointed at a police car in Fort Worth, Texas. Along with the photo, he wrote, "Should I do it? They don't care for a black male anyways!"  The photo was seen by someone on Twitter, who took a screenshot and submitted it to the Fort Worth police's Facebook page. The police department investigated and tracked down Toliver, who was taken into custody on Monday.  Speaking to reporters, Fort Worth Police Chief Joel Fitzgerald said, "We take any threat against our officers very seriously, and we will pursue all legal means to bring those responsible to justice." He added, "In light of the recent tragic events across the country, this type of behavior cannot be tolerated." The incident comes just weeks after a gunman targeted police officers in Dallas, killing five and injuring several others. The attack has heightened fears of violence against law enforcement officials across the country, and police departments around the country are being extra vigilant. Toliver has been charged with making a terroristic threat, which is a third-degree felony in Texas. If convicted, he could face up to ten years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. The incident has sparked anger and concern in the Fort Worth community. Many residents have expressed their support for the police, and are calling for harsh punishments for anyone who threatens law enforcement officials. "This is a serious offense, and it cannot be taken lightly," said one Fort Worth resident. "We need to send a message that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated." Others, however, have criticized the police department for overreacting to the situation. Some argue that Toliver's post was simply a joke, and that he never actually intended to harm anyone. Fort Worth police say they are taking the matter very seriously, and that they are treating Toliver's post as a legitimate threat. They say they will continue to investigate the incident and will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. The case has raised many questions about the use of social media and the limits of free speech. While everyone has a right to express their opinions, the line between free speech and criminal behavior can sometimes be blurry. As this case shows, making a threat – even if it is just a joke – can have serious consequences.
