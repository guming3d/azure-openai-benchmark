chatgpt: Everton manager, Roberto Martinez, has spoken out about England's disappointing exit from the 2014 World Cup. In a recent interview, Martinez claimed that small margins were ultimately responsible for the Three Lions' early elimination from the tournament in Brazil. Despite the disappointment surrounding the elimination, Martinez was quick to praise the young players on the English squad. He spoke highly of their performances and noted their potential for the future. "I was really impressed by the young players that were involved in the England squad," Martinez said. "I think they showed that they belong at that level and they'll only get better with more experience." Amid calls for manager Roy Hodgson's resignation, Martinez urged the public to remain patient with the current England setup. He believes that Hodgson has the potential to build a competitive team in the future. "I think it's important that we don't rush to judgment and we give Roy Hodgson and his staff the time to develop this team," Martinez stated.
