LinkedIn has 'shown a great deal of integrity by fully cooperating with investigators and stepping up to the plate without hesitation to help make workers whole,' said David Weil, the administrator of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division, in a statement. A spokeswoman said that talent is LinkedIn's No. 1 priority, adding that the company was eager to work closely with the Labor Department to reach the settlement. 'This was a function of not having the right tools in place for a small subset of our sales force to track hours properly,' said Shannon Stubo, vice president of corporate communications. The Labor Department's investigation revealed that LinkedIn, based in Mountain View, California, failed to record and compensate workers for all hours worked, violating provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In addition to the settlement payment, LinkedIn will train all employees that 'off-the-clock work' is prohibited for all non-exempt workers, the Labor Department said. Taking action: The Department of Labor announced Monday that LinkedIn has agreed to issue $3.3 million in overtime back pay as well as $2.5 million in damages to 359 current and former employees . The FLSA requires that non-exempt workers, who are not salaried managers, be paid the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25 plus overtime pay at the minimum rate of 1.5 times the regular hourly rate for hours worked past 40 in a given work week. LinkedIn's shares closed at $202.50 on Monday, up 0.4 percent on a day when the major U.S. stock indexes bounced back after Friday's sharp selloff. Last week, LinkedIn reported a 47 percent jump in second-quarter revenue, surpassing analysts' expectations. The website's membership jumped by a third to 313 million in the quarter that ended June 30.

The career networking company has agreed to pay $3.3 million in retroactive overtime wages, as well as an additional $2.5 million in damages. These payments will be distributed among employees in California, Illinois, Nebraska and New York. The investigation found that LinkedIn had failed to properly compensate their employees for overtime hours worked. The company had incorrectly classified certain employees as exempt from overtime pay, despite their job duties requiring them to be paid accordingly. In a statement, a spokesperson for LinkedIn acknowledged the company’s failure to comply with labor laws, stating: “LinkedIn has made every effort possible to ensure full compliance with overtime wage laws. However, we recognize that there were certain errors made in our payroll processes that resulted in some employees not receiving the correct compensation for their overtime hours.” The spokesperson went on to say that LinkedIn has taken steps to correct these issues and has worked closely with the Department of Labor to ensure proper payment to all affected employees. This is not the first time LinkedIn has been found to be in violation of labor laws. In 2014, the company paid $6 million in a settlement regarding similar overtime wage violations. It is clear that the company must do more to ensure compliance with labor laws. The US Department of Labor is responsible for enforcing labor laws that protect the rights of American workers. The department investigates and enforces violations of these laws, including overtime pay, minimum wage, and child labor regulations. This investigation serves as a reminder to all employers to ensure compliance with labor laws to protect the rights of their employees. Failure to do so can result in significant financial consequences and damage to a company’s reputation. In conclusion, LinkedIn’s violation of wage laws has resulted in the company making significant payments to employees to rectify the issue. The company must do more to ensure compliance with labor laws to prevent further violations in the future. This serves as a reminder to all employers to prioritize the fair treatment of their employees and compliance with labor laws.
