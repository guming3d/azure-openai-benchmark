article: Ruben Loftus-Cheek says making his senior Chelsea debut has given him a thirst for more first-team playing time. The 18-year-old midfielder, who has been with the Blues since the age of eight, made his first appearance in Wednesday night's Champions League Group G defeat of Sporting Lisbon. Manager Jose Mourinho insisted prior to the 3-1 win that Loftus-Cheek's inclusion would be a day for the whole Chelsea academy to celebrate, showing there is a path to the first team despite no one making a lasting impression since John Terry. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has revealed his joy at making Chelsea debut on Wednesday against Sporting Lisbon . Loftus-Cheek, who came on for the final seven minutes, told Chelsea TV: 'I wanted it to last longer. It was a bit weird when I came on, a bit surreal, it took a while to sink in. 'Just to come on is all I can ask for. To play at a full Stamford Bridge is amazing. When you come on and you start playing it all just goes away, you're just focused. 'After that I just want to keep working harder - to get more opportunities like that would be wicked.' Goalkeeper Petr Cech started against Sporting and also wants further opportunities. The 32-year-old has been displaced after 10 years as first choice by Thibaut Courtois and has been linked with a move away from Chelsea, with numerous clubs reported to be interested, including Arsenal.

'It's up to everyone to keep working and to show to the manager when you get a game that you can play any game,' Cech said on chelseafc.com. 'For everybody it's important to have this opportunity to play and to be in 'game shape' because the season is very long. 'You need everybody in the squad to be available and in the best condition possible to hope that you can win anything.' The match saw Chelsea bounce back from a first loss in 24 matches this season at Newcastle last Saturday with a victory ahead of this weekend's Premier League encounter with Hull. 'It's always important to win especially when you lose a game in the league,' Cech added. 'We wanted to have a good performance and win the game and you could see that from the start.' Petr Cech (centre) was happy with the Blues' performance after Saturday's Premier League loss at Newcastle . Chelsea, semi-finalists last season, must wait until Monday to discover their last 16 opponents, with Juventus, Basle, Bayer Leverkusen, Paris St Germain or Shakhtar Donetsk all possible opponents in February. 'Last season we were unlucky in the semi-finals and this season we would like to carry on the good work,' Cech said. 'We go game by game now. Obviously we have the quality and we know we can beat anybody. Let's see where it takes us.'

chatgpt: In a thrilling Champions League match on Wednesday, Chelsea emerged victorious with a 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon. The game was hotly contested, with both teams playing at their best, but it was Chelsea who proved to be the stronger side. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, an 18-year-old midfielder, made his long-awaited first-team debut for Chelsea when he came on as a late substitute. Loftus-Cheek is no stranger to the club, having progressed through the ranks for ten years. His debut was a momentous occasion for both him and the club, and he showed great promise and skill on the pitch. Chelsea took the lead early in the game, with Brazilian winger Willian scoring a stunning free-kick from just outside the box. The goal put Chelsea in the driving seat, but Sporting Lisbon were quick to respond. English midfielder Mikel Arteta was dispossessed in the midfield, which allowed Sporting Lisbon to break forward and score the equalizer through Nani. The game was evenly poised at 1-1 going into the second half, and both teams were playing with great intensity. However, Chelsea began to assert more control over the game, and it was only a matter of time before they scored again. Midfielder John Obi Mikel was the one who got the all-important second goal, with a clever finish from close range. With the score now 2-1 in their favor, Chelsea continued to attack and create chances. Sporting Lisbon were still in the game, though, and with just minutes remaining, it looked like they might find a way back into the game. However, it was Loftus-Cheek who put the game beyond doubt, scoring Chelsea's third goal with a composed finish from inside the box. The three points earned from this match put Chelsea in a strong position in their Champions League group, and manager Jose Mourinho will be pleased with the performance of his team. The debut of Loftus-Cheek was also a highlight of the game, and it is clear that he has a bright future ahead of him. Speaking after the match, Loftus-Cheek said, "It's a dream come true to make my debut for Chelsea. I've been at the club for ten years, and to finally get my chance is amazing. The team played really well, and to score a goal was a great feeling." Chelsea's next game in the Champions League is against NK Maribor, and they will be hoping to continue their winning form. With players like Loftus-Cheek coming through the ranks and making an impact, the future looks bright for Chelsea.
