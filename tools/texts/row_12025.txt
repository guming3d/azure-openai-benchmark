article: Washington (CNN) -- In a huge, seven-day operation covering all 50 states and four U.S. territories, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested 2,901 convicted criminal immigrants as part of the "Cross Check" enforcement operation, ICE officials announced Wednesday. ICE officials trumpeted the arrests at a news conference designed to highlight "the Obama administration's ongoing commitment to prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens and egregious immigration law violators." ICE Director John Morton said all those arrested had prior criminal convictions, including 1,282 who had multiple convictions. More than 1,600 of those arrested had felony convictions including manslaughter, attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, drug trafficking, child abuse, sexual crimes against minors and aggravated assault. Forty-two of them were gang members and 151 were convicted sex offenders, officials said. ICE officials acknowledged that despite the large number of arrests, there were still an estimated 1 million convicted criminal aliens in the United States. Morton said one of the issues ICE is trying to deal with is the lack of notification to immigration authorities when offenders are released from jail. Most of the people detained -- 2,642 -- were men. Those arrested came from 115 countries, with immigration fugitives accounting for 681 of those detained in the operation, Morton said. Of the people arrested, 386 were illegal re-entrants. "The results of this targeted enforcement operation underscore ICE's ongoing commitment and focus on the arrest and removal of convicted criminal aliens and those that game our nation's immigration system," Morton in a statement released before the news conference. "Because of the tireless efforts and teamwork of ICE officers and agents in tracking down at large criminal aliens and fugitives, there are 2,901 fewer criminal aliens in our neighborhoods across the country." ICE began conducting large-scale operations to target convicted criminal aliens in December 2009 and since then, nine regional and national Cross Check operations -- including last week's -- have resulted in the arrest of more than 7,400 convicted criminal aliens.

chatgpt: According to the latest report from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), there are still approximately one million convicted criminal immigrants currently residing in the United States. This disconcerting figure was revealed after the "Cross Check" operation that spanned all 50 states and four U.S. territories.  During the operation, ICE officials identified and arrested a total of 7,400 criminal aliens. Among them, nearly 1,300 had multiple convictions, highlighting the alarming trend of repeat offenders among this group of individuals.  The "Cross Check" operation was conducted to improve public safety and target those who pose a threat to the country. This is part of a larger effort to keep the country safe and secure, despite the challenges faced in immigration enforcement. The fact that there are still so many convicted criminal immigrants living in the U.S. raises concerns about the effectiveness of current immigration policies. There have been a number of calls for stricter immigration policies and increased enforcement, with some criticizing the lack of progress made in reducing the number of criminal immigrants in the country. ICE officials have stressed the importance of this type of operation and stated that efforts to identify and arrest criminal aliens will continue. They have also emphasized the need for collaboration with state and local law enforcement agencies to improve the effectiveness of these operations. The issue of criminal immigrants has become a contentious topic in recent years, with lawmakers and policymakers grappling with how to address the problem. This latest report highlights the magnitude of the issue and the need for continued efforts to ensure public safety and security in the United States. In response to the report, some have called for reforms that would streamline the immigration system while also enhancing the ability of law enforcement to target criminals. Others have called for greater investment in resources and technology, arguing that these measures could help to better identify and apprehend criminal immigrants. Overall, the issue of criminal immigrants remains a complex and challenging topic, and one that will likely continue to generate debate and discussion in the years ahead.
