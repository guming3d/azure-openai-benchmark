article: By . Hamish Mackay . European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley has withdrawn from the USPGA Championship due to a shoulder injury. The 47-year-old missed the Alstom Open de France at the beginning of July as a bout of bursitis affected the mobility in his left shoulder and the condition has ruled him out of next week's major tournament at Valhalla Golf Club. The Irishman undertook a scan during the Scottish Open and a period of rest has now been prescribed. Recovery: Paul McGinley says he was forced to pull out of the USPGA as his shoulder needs time to recover . McGinley said: 'The scan showed that I really needed to rest my shoulder for a couple of months if I am to address the injury properly and so, because of that, I have regrettably had to withdraw from the USPGA Championship. 'It's a pity because I would have loved to have teed up at Valhalla but I assessed the situation over the past couple of weeks during my family holiday and I think this is the sensible decision. 'It's not just during the week of the tournament itself that is the problem, it is the fact that the injury also hampers my normal preparation for events and you do not want to be going into any tournament - far less a major championship - not properly prepared.' The news will not be welcomed by European fans. The Ryder Cup is less than two months away and while there has been no suggestion that McGinley is in danger of missing the tournament, it will undoubtedly affect his preparation and form going in to it. Leader: McGinley is the European captain for the Ryder Cup, which runs from 23-28 September . Preparation: The Irishman said it is not just his play that is affected by his shoulder but also his preparation .
