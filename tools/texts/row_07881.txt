Never has there been a more legitimate reason to ask 'Is it a bird, is it a plane?' Amateur photographer Bob Carter captured this amazing photo of a seagull crossing the path of an aircraft's vapour stream on Sunday. He could not believe his luck when he looked back at his snaps to see how perfectly the jet's path had dovetailed with the bird's position in the sky - creating the appearance of a 'super bird'. The photos were taken in Hull by the River Humber using a Pentax K-X. Perfect shot: Amateur photographer Bob Carter took this amazing picture of a seagull in Hull over the weekend. Mr Carter, 55, said he was buzzing when he realised he had taken the perfect image on his first attempt. He told MailOnline: 'I am out and about a lot taking photos and I had this picture in my mind about a week ago. 'We have had a lot of cloud, but one sunny day I saw the contrail and I saw the gull heading towards it, and incredibly I got it on the first shot. 'I was amazed. I expected it to take thousands of shots and I got it just right. 'I took two shots in succession and and less than a second later it was well away from the contrail. â€˜I was buzzing when I got it. It genuinely looks like the vapour is coming from the gull.' Mr Carter, a former care worker, added he was always looking for quirky photo ideas and he hopes to turn his hobby into a profession. Coincidence: The seagull moments after the first 'perfect' shot was taken - a long way from the vapour trail . Vapour trails or contrails are artificial clouds that form behind aircraft. They are made of numerous liquid droplets or ice crystals and emerge from the exhaust of aeroplanes. It . can also be created when areas of low pressure form around the edge of . the wing, creating vortices - tubes of circulating air - that leave . trails behind the wing's tips. The low pressure in these areas mean that cold air can condense, leaving trails of water or even ice behind the plane. When a plane passes through a cloud, water vapour and ice from the clouds are sucked into the vortices, adding to the effect. 'Is it a bird, is it a plane?' was a phrase coined in the Superman cartoon series. The superhero is here depicted by Christopher Reeve in the 1978 film.
