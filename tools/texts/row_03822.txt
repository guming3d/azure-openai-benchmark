article: Washington (CNN) -- Attention, campers. National parks are becoming "no drone" zones. The National Park Service announced Friday it is prohibiting drones -- properly called unmanned aircraft -- from all NPS-controlled lands and waters. That includes 84 million acres in every state and territory, including monuments, battlefields, historic sites, seashores, rivers and trails. It all comes down to noise and safety, said Director Jonathan Jarvis in a statement announcing the policy. "We have serious concerns about the negative impact that flying unmanned aircraft is having in parks, so we are prohibiting their use until we can determine the most appropriate policy," Jarvis said. The Federal Aviation Administration already has greatly curtailed the outdoor use of drones for commercial purposes, pending rules that it is developing. But hobbyists have been relatively free to operate drones in public areas, provided they stay below 400 feet and are flown away from populated areas and full-scale aircraft.

A lawyer who represents drone enthusiasts called the NPS' temporary ban "overly broad" and said he expects it will be greatly narrowed when it goes through the federal rule-making process. "It's very broad in that it sweeps in every national park-controlled location, including things like beaches and forests where there really aren't the same sensitivities to noise, and where model airplanes have been allowed for decades," said Brendan Schulman. The NPS said individual parks have been enacting drone bans for a number of reasons. Last September, an unmanned aircraft flew above visitors seated in the Mount Rushmore National Memorial amphitheater. Park rangers confiscated the drone because of concern for visitor safety, the NPS said. In April, a loud drone interrupted visitors enjoying a quiet Grand Canyon sunset. And volunteers at Zion National Park in Utah witnessed a drone disturb a herd of bighorn sheep. All previously issued permits for drones will be suspended until reviewed by a senior NPS official, who also must approve any new special use permits. Superintendents who have previously authorized the use of model aircraft for hobbyist or recreational use may allow such use to continue, the statement said. Schulman said Friday's action by the NPS also calls into question the validity of that fine, saying that the agency has stated it needs the new regulation because earlier regulations do not cover unmanned aircraft. In a separate case, Raphael Pirker earlier this year successfully challenged an FAA prohibition on commercial use of drones after the FAA fined him $10,000 for using a small drone to take promotional videos of the Virginia Medical Center. The FAA has appealed that decision. Florida university library to lend drones to students .

chatgpt: The National Park Service (NPS) has announced a temporary ban on the use of drones in all national parks. The ban comes after safety and noise concerns were cited by park officials. The move has caused debate among drone hobbyists and industry experts. The temporary ban was announced earlier this week and affects all 84 million acres of national parks maintained by the NPS. The ban has been implemented due to safety concerns and noise pollution caused by drones, which can disrupt wildlife and visitors. In a statement, the NPS said, "We have serious concerns about the negative impact that drones have on visitor experience, wildlife and safety, and we're taking the necessary steps to protect the parks and all who visit them." However, some drone hobbyists have criticized the new policy, saying it is too broad and does not distinguish between commercial and recreational use of drones. Attorney Brendan Schulman, who represents hobbyist drone operators, stated, "We're not opposed to reasonable regulation, but we object to the overly broad prohibition." Schulman has also raised concerns about the economic impact of the drone ban on the industry which could result in lost business for drone operators, retailers and manufacturers. Similarly, industry experts have also expressed concern about the ban. Brian Wynne, president of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), said, "The NPS' decision is overly restrictive and could have a chilling effect on the broader drone industry." The NPS is not the first organization to impose restrictions on drone use. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has also issued guidelines regarding drone operation, which require special registration and clearance for commercial use. As the use of drones becomes increasingly popular among hobbyists and commercial operators, government officials and industry experts continue to grapple with the issues surrounding their use. While the NPS' temporary ban on drones may be controversial, officials believe that the safety and well-being of park visitors and wildlife must be protected. The NPS has stated that the ban is temporary and will be reviewed after the agency completes an assessment of the impacts of drones on parks. Until further notice, drone use within national parks is strictly prohibited.
