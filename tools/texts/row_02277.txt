chatgpt: Two activists, Sam Hatfield and Fiona Skelton, made headlines recently after they stripped off at several iconic landmarks in London. The two were pictured outside Buckingham Palace as 'Crusaders without clothes' as part of their 'Nakedme' art project, which aims to promote nudity and body positivity. Their protests also included stripping off at Trafalgar Square, in front of Nelson’s Column, and at The Shard, one of London's most recognizable skyscrapers. They were met with a mixed response from passers-by, with some supporting their cause while others laughed or looked shocked. The duo have described their efforts as a way to challenge societal norms surrounding nudity and create a safe space for people to embrace their bodies. Both Hatfield and Skelton have dealt with insecurities regarding their own bodies, particularly in relation to societal standards of beauty. "We wanted to create a space where everyone could be naked and feel comfortable in their own skin," Skelton said in an interview. "We want to challenge people's perceptions of nudity and show that it's a natural and beautiful thing." Their 'Nakedme' art project includes a collection of photographs and videos featuring individuals of all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds, taken in various locations around London. The photos aim to capture the diversity and beauty of the human form. The reaction to Hatfield and Skelton's protests has been mixed, with some praising them for their bravery and others criticizing them for public nudity. However, the duo are determined to continue their efforts and promote body positivity. "We know that not everyone is going to agree with what we're doing, but we hope to start a conversation about body positivity and challenge the idea that nudity is always sexual," Hatfield said. "We want to create a world where people feel confident in their bodies and can express themselves freely, without shame or judgment." Although their protests may be controversial, they have certainly caught the attention of the public and sparked discussions about body positivity and the societal standards that dictate the way we view our bodies. Whether or not their efforts will have a lasting impact remains to be seen, but Hatfield and Skelton have certainly succeeded in starting a conversation about the role of nudity in our society.
