article: (CNN) -- The Canadian woman who was rescued last week after being stranded and alone for 49 days in a Nevada wilderness was upgraded to good from fair condition Tuesday, an Idaho hospital spokesman said. Rita Chretien, 56, is tolerating solid food very well, continuing her physical therapy and showing high spirits, according to a statement by St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center in Twin Falls, Idaho. Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for her husband, Albert, who left his wife in their van on March 22 so that he could find help. "She is enjoying solid foods and had a dinner of salmon, rice and green beans last night," the spokesman's statement said Tuesday. "This morning she had a breakfast burrito with homemade salsa. A 'bowl of soul' coffee was brought to her from a local coffee house. It included a sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg and a dollop of whipped cream, which Rita said was delicious." Doctors said the indicators of her recovery are "very good," the spokesman said. Scores of men and women had searched for the Chretiens since the Penticton, British Columbia, residents were last seen March 19 leaving a Shell gas station convenience store in Baker City, Oregon. On Friday, more than a month later, hunters wandered into the area where the van was sitting. Rita Chretien shot up from her spot in the 2000 Chevrolet Astro's back seat when she heard them outside, mustered strength to open the door and stepped out shoeless. She waved. While the odds are dwindling that Albert Chretien will be found alive, authorities haven't ruled it out. Rita Chretien lived off the little food she had -- beef jerky, some trail mix, fish oil pills and one piece of hard candy per day. She went outside for a walk once a day, using the sunlight to melt snow for drinking water and going to a nearby stream. She read a few books (some several times) and the Bible and recorded her thoughts in a journal. The Chretiens were en route to a trade show convention in Las Vegas when they turned off the highway onto a forest service road that led into Nevada, intending to enjoy the "scenic route," her son said, who'd heard the full story from his weakened mother. The couple took some wrong turns and had thought, based on their map, that their road was better than it was. Pictures released by the sheriff's department show the van in an extremely remote area with no visible roads. The van was stuck in caked mud, with a shovel pictured near the back of the van, indicating that someone had been trying to free the vehicle from the mud. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this story.

chatgpt: Rita and Raymond Chretien, a couple from British Columbia, Canada, went on a road trip to explore the southwestern United States in March. However, their trip turned into a nightmare when they got lost in the remote Nevada wilderness on March 19. After several days of driving off-road in search of a shortcut, the couple's GPS stopped working, and they became stranded without any means of communication. The couple survived on a small supply of potatoes, rice, and dog food they had brought with them on their trip. They also melted snow for drinking water. They remained stranded for weeks, with no means of contacting anyone. But eventually, Rita Chretien managed to get out and find her way to a nearby highway. Rita was found alive on Friday, 49 days after the couple got lost. She was discovered by a group of hunters who were passing by the area. She was severely malnourished but conscious and able to speak. She was immediately taken to a nearby hospital where she is being treated for dehydration and malnourishment. However, her husband, Raymond Chretien, is still missing. A search and rescue operation is currently underway to find him. The couple had been driving a van when they got stranded in the middle of nowhere. The van was found partially submerged in a creek, but there was no sign of Raymond. Rita told rescuers that her husband had left the van to go find help and never returned. The search effort has been extensive but has so far proved fruitless. Searches have been conducted by helicopter, drone, and ground units of the Elko County Sheriff's Office, with the help of local volunteers. Despite this setback, the rescue team remains hopeful that Raymond can still be found alive. They believe the area where he went missing is a remote but survivable location. The search will continue until he is found. The story of Rita and Raymond Chretien's ordeal has captured the attention of people around the world. Their story of survival against the odds is a testament to the human spirit and the power of hope. In conclusion, Rita's rescue after being lost in the Nevada wilderness for 49 days serves as a beacon of hope that her husband, Raymond, will also be found alive. As the search intensifies, the world watches and prays for their safe return.
