One dangerous motorist has taken 'hands free' driving to a new level after being caught not gripping the wheel at around 40mph. Shocked witness Alan Miller filmed the dangerous driver and even captured the moment she was on the phone with one hand and swearing at him with the other near Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Last week the driving instructor spotted the woman in his car's mirrors and while an experienced 18-year-old pupil was at the wheel he turned in his chair to quickly film the illegal act. Scroll down for video . Caught: The woman is shown clearly on the phone with one hand and swearing with the other at 40 miles per hour . And when she knew she was spotted, instead of gripping the wheel, she just used her other hand to flash the V-sign at him. 'It’s like the threat of three points and a £60 fine isn’t enough of a deterrent for people. Clearly having a phone call is more important to them than safety or the possibility of points on their licence,' he said. Mr Miller said it is a depressingly common example of unsafe driving he sees, adding that he spots motorists illegally phoning while at the wheel up to six times an hour. On the phone: The woman was filmed less than a car length away from a learner driver and this is the moment just before she spots she is being filmed breaking the law . 'This kind of thing happens all the time, it’s a nightmare. I put it online to embarrass the driver and in the hope that she sees it and thinks twice about doing it again,' he said. He keeps the small video camera in his dual-controlled car to document the scene of any accidents, but has increasingly begun to use it as a deterrent to motorists.

chatgpt: A driving instructor recently captured footage of a dangerous driver who was tailgating a learner while on the phone and using profanity. The incident took place at 40 mph and has sparked outrage among those who have seen the video. The video, captured by driving instructor Alan Miller, shows the reckless driver following closely behind a learner driver. The dangerous driver can be seen talking on the phone with one hand while using the other to swear at the learner driver. Miller, who has been a driving instructor for over 20 years, was shocked by what he saw. He immediately reported the incident to the authorities and shared the video on social media in the hopes of raising awareness about the dangers of distracted driving. In an interview, Miller expressed his concern about the incident, stating that the use of mobile phones while driving is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. "People need to realize that driving is a serious responsibility and they need to focus on the road rather than on their phone," he said. According to a recent study, distracted driving is a leading cause of accidents on the road. In fact, research suggests that drivers who use their phones are up to four times more likely to be involved in a crash. The incident has once again raised concerns about the safety of new drivers on the road. Many have called for stricter laws to be put in place to prevent distracted driving and to protect learners who are just starting out. In response to the incident, police have launched an investigation and have urged anyone with information to come forward. They have also reminded drivers to focus on the road and to avoid distractions such as mobile phones. Driving instructors like Miller play an important role in ensuring that new drivers are safe on the road. Their job is to teach learners how to be responsible drivers and to follow the rules of the road. However, it is up to all drivers to take responsibility for their actions and to make sure that they are not putting themselves or others in danger. As the investigation into the incident continues, it serves as a powerful reminder of the dangers of distracted driving and the importance of staying focused behind the wheel.
