Unity, a year 7 pupil at Portsmouth High School, said: 'It was a bit scary knowing that daddy might be in trouble. 'I wasn't really sure what to do so I phoned mummy but it did feel a bit like I was on my own. 'I sort of knew what I was meant to be doing because daddy had told me a lot about this sort of thing - but I never thought I'd experience it first hand. 'I was thinking of getting daddy in safely but there were two parts to that - making sure he was still okay while he was down below crouched over - and to get the boat back. 'It was quite easy until it came to mooring up, it was tricky doing it on my own. I think daddy is quite proud of me." Unity's father phoned earlier that morning to say he felt unwell after staying overnight aboard the Achilles 24 with his daughter. And when he collapsed she reacted quickly, using the outboard motor to power back to Emsworth, despite hardly being able to see from her place at the helm.

The 47-year-old said: 'Unity's very practical and very down to earth - she just got on with it. 'I was very proud of her and so was her dad. He was there and conscious, so he was able to advise her if she needed it but in fact she didn't.'
