article: 'Law & Order SVU' is tackling racial profiling head on in an upcoming episode that winds together the controversial Trayvon Martin case and the Paula Deen scandal. In the episode, Cybill Shepard plays Jolene Castille, a famous southern chef. But instead of making a racial slur, like Deen, she guns down an unarmed, hoodie-wearing black teen she thought was following her on the Upper West Side, mirroring the Trayvon Martin slaying. According to TV Guide, Castille claims she killed the teen in an act of self-defense because she knew police were chasing a rapist of the same description.

The episode, which also stars Jeffery Tambor and Leslie Odom, Jr., will air in October. On Wednesday, pictures emerged from the SVU set, sparking rumours the show was taking on the George Zimmerman trial. And Executive Producer Warren Leight confirmed it to Entertainment Weekly. '(Jeffrey) Tambor is a defense attorney representing a very high-profile celebrity woman chef who thought she was being pursued by a rapist and turned around it was a teenager. And she shot him,' he said. Odom will play a minister of the slain child. Inspiration: The tragic case of Florida teen Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a self-appointed neighborhood watch rep George Zimmerman, inspired the episode . Deen: Emmy nominee Cybill Shepard, left, plays Jolene Castille, a famous southern chef inspired by Paula Deen . Leight told the magazine the episode will also deal with New York's stop-and-frisk policy. He said the show would ask the tough questions. 'Is racial profiling justifiable? Can self-defense involve racial profiling? We're diving right into that,' he said. 'Can that happen in New York? Absolutely.' The NBC sex-crimes drama is known for ripping plot lines straight from the headlines. Last season, an episode depicted a violent love affair between two pop stars in a story that uncannily resembled Rihanna and Chris Brown's abusive relationship. Filming: Ice-T, left, and Richard Belzer, right, film scenes of the episode on Wednesday . Protests: The filming prompted a small protest in support of Trayvon Martin, right . Leight said this season will feature more real crimes than usual because 'it's almost like we've been bombarded with headlines.' He added that the Zimmerman trial, reflected in the script, was so polarising it even divided the SVU team. 'When the script was published it became a litmus test for everybody here,' he said. 'It was really interesting to see people read that script and have different interpretations about who did what and whether or not they deserved prison for it. It was fascinating.'

chatgpt: In the world of entertainment, controversy is always a key ingredient to success. And it seems like the latest episode of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" is no exception. Pictures emerged from the set, showing Cybill Shepard in character as Jolene Castille, a famous southern chef who kills an unarmed black teenager in New York City. The storyline follows Castille's claim that she acted in self-defense because she believed the teen was the same person described by police as a rapist on the loose. However, as the investigation progresses, questions arise as to whether Castille's actions were racially motivated. "Can self-defense involve racial profiling? We're diving right into that," the show's executive producer said. This episode has sparked comparisons to the George Zimmerman trial, where the neighborhood watchman shot and killed unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in 2012. Zimmerman claimed self-defense, but the case became a lightning rod for discussions on racial profiling and vigilantism. The parallels between the two cases are not lost on the public, with many already taking to social media to express their opinions on the fictionalized version of events. It's clear that the show's creators are not shying away from tackling controversial issues head-on. But this isn't the first time "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" has made headlines for addressing current events. The long-running show has always prided itself on incorporating real-world issues into its storylines, from sexual assault to police brutality. While some may see this as simply a way to attract attention, others argue that it's important for popular media to address issues that affect society as a whole. Whatever the motivation, it's undeniable that shows like "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" have become important platforms for social commentary. As for the Jolene Castille storyline, viewers will have to wait to see how it plays out. But one thing's for certain â€“ the debate over self-defense and racial profiling is far from over, both in the fictional world of television and in real life.
