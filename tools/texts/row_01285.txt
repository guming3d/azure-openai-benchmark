Up to 35,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals could come to Britain next year, according to their ambassadors to the UK. The British Government has repeatedly refused to put a figure on the likely influx from January 1 2014 when border controls must be abandoned. Ministers say it is impossible to predict numbers and fear a repeat of the 2004 debacle when the influx from eight other Eastern European countries was grossly underestimated. Up to 35,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals could come to Britain next year, according to their ambassadors to the UK . But yesterday the Bulgarian Ambassador Konstantin Dimitrov said he expected between eight and ten thousand of his countrymen would come in a single year, and said he regarded that as ‘no major influx’. His Romanian counterpart, Ion Jinga, predicted between 15,000 and 25,000 Romanian arrivals. The number is similar to predictions made by the respected MigrationWatch think tank which put forward a figure of around 50,000. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch said: ‘It’s significant that these ambassadors now recognise that it could be 35,000. That’s at the bottom of our own range but it suggests they are beginning to accept that the numbers could be significant.’ There are currently around 130,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the UK. The ambassadors said their figures were rough estimates, and defended their nations’ contribution to the UK economy. Work restrictions were imposed on the two countries when they joined the EU in 2007 but these must be abandoned next year - allowing all nationals of both countries full access to the UK labour market. Analysis of a BBC Newsnight survey published on Monday suggested the numbers with concrete plans to move to Britain could top 100,000. There are currently around 130,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the UK. The ambassadors said their figures were rough estimates, and defended their nations' contribution to the UK economy . Speaking before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, Mr Jinga said Romanian migrants were young, in good health and not interested in claiming benefits or healthcare. ‘There are more than 4,000 Romanian doctors and nurses in the British NHS, we’ve educated them in our system and they came to work here. ‘In fact we bring in more to your economy than we take out.’ Speaking to Newsnight on Tuesday, the Romanian Prime Minister admitted there was an issue with Romanian criminals in the UK. Victor Ponta said: ‘I am very aware that Romanian citizens have committed, not serious crime, but some of them - Romanians but also representatives of the Roma minority - they are doing the small criminality, begging, stealing cellular phones. ‘I think that first of all we have to co-operate. Our police and law enforcement agencies should keep co-operating very well. On the other hand it is a huge challenge and a big concern for my government to implement the strategies for integration of the Roma communities.’

chatgpt: The UK Government has refused to provide a specific figure on the possible influx of immigrants from January 1, 2021. This comes as ministers have expressed fears of a repeat of the 2004 debacle, which saw a significantly higher number of Eastern European arrivals than originally estimated. The historical precedent for such worries is clear. In 2004, the UK, along with several other European Union countries, opened its borders to citizens of ten new EU member states, primarily from Central and Eastern Europe. The British Government had predicted an influx of only around 13,000 people per year, but the actual number of people arriving was closer to 100,000 per year, causing significant strains on public services and increasing concerns among the British public. Despite a more cautious approach to the current situation, many are still concerned that the Government's hesitancy to provide a specific figure indicates that it is not fully prepared for the potential influx. "It is concerning that the Government does not appear to have a clear plan in place for managing the potential influx of immigrants," said Mike Buckley, director of the campaign group 'Labour for a European Future.' "Without a clear plan, there is a real risk that we will see a repeat of the problems we experienced in 2004." Recent studies have suggested that a significant number of EU citizens may still be considering moving to the UK after Brexit, despite the uncertain economic and political climate. A report from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford has estimated that up to 1.3 million Europeans living in the UK are potentially eligible to apply for settled status. While many of these individuals may choose to remain in the UK regardless of the new residency requirements, there is still a possibility that a large number of Europeans may choose to move to the UK in the coming months. With the end of the Brexit transition period fast approaching, many are concerned that the UK's departure from the EU will have serious implications for both EU citizens and British citizens living abroad. The Government's current position is to prioritize the rights of British citizens living in the EU, by ensuring their continued access to health care and other services. However, this position does not address the concerns of those who are worried about the potential consequences of the UK's departure from the EU on the UK economy, and on public services such as the National Health Service. Many experts have suggested that the economic and political uncertainty surrounding Brexit may actually discourage some EU citizens from moving to the UK in the near future. Others have argued that the UK's decision to leave the EU will have a significant impact on the country's ability to attract and retain highly skilled workers, particularly in the fields of science and technology. Regardless of the exact number of immigrants who choose to move to the UK after Brexit, the Government must be prepared to respond to the challenges that arise. This means investing more in public services, particularly in areas such as health care, education, and housing, as well as ensuring that new arrivals have access to the support they need to integrate into British society. Ultimately, the concerns expressed by ministers and other groups are not unfounded. The UK's departure from the EU will have significant implications for immigration policy and for the country's wider political and economic landscape. However, it is also true that the UK has a long history of successfully integrating immigrants from a wide range of different backgrounds, and it is hoped that this trend will continue in the years to come.
