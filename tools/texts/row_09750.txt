article: (CNN) -- A British woman could face the death penalty after being found with an estimated $2.6 million worth of cocaine in her luggage by Indonesian authorities. Lindsay June Sandiford, 55, was found to have blocks of cocaine weighing almost 4.8 kilograms in her suitcase after she arrived on the island of Bali on a Thai Airways flight earlier this month, government officials said. Sandiford, described by British media reports as a housewife, did not speak as she was paraded at a press conference Monday wearing a prison-issue orange t-shirt. Three other Britons -- one woman and two men -- and an Indian man are also being questioned, Bali police narcotics chief Mulyadi told reporters. They are accused of being part of an international syndicate, he said. Under Indonesia's extremely strict drugs laws, Sandiford could face execution, according to the head of Bali's Customs and Excise Agency monitoring division, Made Wijaya. "The main reason is because narcotics can massively endanger the young and, thus, whoever is caught with drugs should be severely punished. If three people can consume one gram of cocaine, then this operation has potentially saved up to 14,000 lives," Wijaya told journalists at Monday's press conference. "This is the biggest drug bust this year, and this is the first cocaine smuggled into Bali in the last three years." The British Foreign Office said it is "aware" of the arrests and is "ready to provide consular assistance." Mulyadi -- who like many Indonesians uses one name -- revealed Sandiford was detained by customs officials on May 19 in the departure hall at Ngurah Rai International airport in Bali. Officials seized the black suitcase, which contained several packages containing cocaine. He said Sandiford claimed the suitcase was to be delivered to an unknown person as ordered by a British woman identified as RLD. According to Mulyadi, Sandiford then agreed to cooperate with Indonesian authorities and a meeting was set up with RLD on the island two days later. Police were then able to arrest RLD along with her British partner, identified as JAP, another British man known as PB, and an Indian man identified only as NA. The four were shown to reporters at Bali's police headquarters wearing balaclavas on Monday. Joseph Netto and Rudy Madanir contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A 55-year-old British woman was apprehended at the Mumbai airport on Sunday, after blocks of cocaine weighing 4.8 kilograms were found in her luggage. The woman was travelling alone and heading to Delhi when she was caught by the Mumbai unit of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). With the arrest of the British national, three more people have been taken into custody, including one woman and two men, all British nationals, and an Indian man.  The four accused individuals are believed to be part of an international drug syndicate that operates in several countries. The DRI has reportedly tracked the activities of the syndicate for a while, and this seizure was a significant breakthrough. According to sources, the British woman had arrived in Mumbai on a tourist visa and stayed in a hotel for a few days. The drugs were discovered hidden in her suitcase during screening at the airport. The three other accused persons were allegedly in contact with the British woman and were arrested shortly after her apprehension. During questioning, the four accused individuals confessed to their involvement in smuggling drugs into and out of India. They reportedly used various methods to evade detection, such as hiding drugs in food items, electronic goods, and other everyday items. The DRI has stated that the bust is part of their ongoing efforts to curb the illegal drug trade in the country. With the seizure of almost five kilograms of cocaine, the authorities have dealt a severe blow to the operations of the drug syndicate.  The British High Commission in New Delhi has been informed of the case, and the accused individuals will be prosecuted as per Indian law. The authorities are expected to conduct further investigations to track down other members of the syndicate and prevent them from further endangering the lives of innocent citizens. Drug trafficking is a significant problem in India, with the country being a destination, as well as a transit point for several drugs. The narcotics trade is often associated with organized crime, terrorism, and money laundering. The Indian government has been taking steps to tackle the issue, and the seizure of drugs and arrest of drug traffickers are part of their efforts to make India a safer place.
