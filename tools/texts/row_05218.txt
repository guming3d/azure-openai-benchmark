article: A police investigation has been launched after a 12-year-old schoolgirl discovered classmates sharing an indecent photograph of her online. The case has raised fears that more children are being coaxed into sharing compromising pictures which are then distributed without their knowledge. Officers have urged other potential victims to come forward in a bid to crack down on the abusive practice. The girl's mother said that her daughter, who is now 13, had sent a picture of her cleavage to a male friend. Sharing: St Kentigern's Academy is one of three schools in Blackburn, West Lothian where indecent photographs of schoolgirls have been shared among pupils . But she was then included in a Facebook conversation which saw her photograph shared with other classmates, along with other compromising pictures of young girls. She immediately quit the thread of messages, but the pictures are believed to have been shared among pupils at three schools in Blackburn, West Lothian - Armadale Academy, Bathgate Academy and St Kentigern's High. Her mother said: 'My daughter feels very embarrassed and shocked. This shouldn't be happening. It's across the schools in West Lothian. The officer I spoke to said the more people he spoke to, the more he heard about it happening.' She added that friends of her daughter had also been persuaded to send topless or nude pictures to boys they knew, and called for school authorities to do more to safeguard pupils. 'The parents should be made aware of this,' she said. '[The schools] have known about this for months.' Schools: Pupils at Bathgate Academy, left, and Armadale Academy, right, have also been sharing the photos . Police Scotland confirmed that they had received a formal complaint about the abusive behaviour in November last year, and called for other children affected by the issue to speak to them. A spokesman said: 'Police in West Lothian are investigating following allegations that indecent images of a 13-year-old girl were shared on social media. 'Inquiries are ongoing and we urge any other victims to come forward. 'Tackling the creation and sharing of indecent images is a priority for Police Scotland, with all complaints received thoroughly investigated. 'We provide specialist support to victims and target offenders to bring them to justice.' A West Lothian Council spokesman added: 'We take the online safety of our pupils very seriously and are currently working closely with police on this matter. 'Schools and parents both have an important role to play in helping make young people aware of the dangers of inappropriate internet communication.'

chatgpt: A schoolgirl from a British high school sent a suggestive photograph of her cleavage to a male classmate, who then shared the image with several other pupils via Facebook. The incident has sparked an investigation by local authorities into how young girls are being manipulated or coerced into taking inappropriate pictures. According to reports, the girl willingly shared the photograph with the male classmate, who then convinced her to take more explicit images, which he was able to distribute through social media channels. It is unclear whether the girl was fully aware of the repercussions of sharing such images, and whether she was coerced or manipulated into sharing the images. The incident has raised questions about the need for better education, particularly around online safety and cyberbullying. Parents and educators alike are being urged to be more proactively involved in teaching children the dangers of online platforms and the importance of respecting one another's privacy. "It is essential that we educate our young people about the dangers of sharing explicit images and the consequences that can follow," said a spokesperson for the local police. "Parents and educators have a responsibility to teach children about the risks associated with social media channels and how to use them safely." The school where the incidents occurred has been contacted but has yet to comment on the incident. It is unclear whether any disciplinary action will be taken against the pupils involved, or whether the police will continue to investigate the matter further. However, the incident highlights a growing problem in the UK and other countries worldwide. Cases of sexting among young people are increasing, with more and more teenagers sending suggestive or explicit images via smartphones, social media or other digital channels. A study by the NSPCC found that one in seven young people under the age of 18 have been asked to share explicit pictures of themselves, and one in 10 have shared such images with others. The charity has called for greater action to be taken to protect children from online exploitation and harassment. "Children and young people need to know that sending explicit images of themselves can be dangerous and can have serious consequences, both online and offline," said an NSPCC spokesperson. "We need to do more to protect our children from the risks associated with this type of behaviour and to ensure that they feel empowered to protect themselves against online exploitation and harassment." The incident involving the schoolgirl is just one of many cases that have been reported in recent years. As technology continues to advance and young people increasingly use social media and other digital channels to communicate, it has become more important than ever to ensure that children are properly educated and protected from online risks.
