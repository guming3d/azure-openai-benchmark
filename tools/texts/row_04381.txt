She died last week only two months later. ‘She was surrounded by family and went peacefully. Our family would like to thank everyone for their prayers and support as well as ask for privacy during this time,’ her family posted to Facebook. Her death came just over one month after she was sedated to stem her suffering from complications of the aggressive tumor, according to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.
