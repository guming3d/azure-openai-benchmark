article: BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- German investigators Thursday acknowledged "credible information" indicating that one of the world's most wanted Nazi war criminals died almost 20 years ago in Egypt. The former the hotel in Cairo where Heim spent his final days. The announcement from the Baden-Wuerttemberg State Criminal Investigations Office came a day after German public broadcaster ZDF reported similar findings about Aribert Heim, wanted since 1962. ZDF said research it conducted with the New York Times showed that Heim died in Cairo in 1992 of intestinal cancer. Witness accounts and documents, including a passport, prove that Heim lived under the false name of Tarek Farid Hussein, ZDF said. CNN spoke to Heim's son, Ruediger Heim, who said his father fled Germany to Egypt via France, Spain and Morocco. Ruediger Heim told CNN he visited his father in Cairo several times, including in the final weeks of his life when the terminal cancer was discovered. The German investigators said they were was checking the new information. "This information has not yet been verified due to time constraints," the office said in a statement. But German authorities said they already had hints that Heim was living and working in Egypt. The office said it received information in 1965 and 1967 indicating Heim was working in the country, but Egyptian authorities at the time, acting on a German request, did not find any conclusive evidence. "Our main goal now is, in cooperation with the Egyptian authorities, (to) identify the remains of Aribert Heim," the office said. The chief Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Efraim Zuroff, said the news about Heim's death, if true, is deeply disappointing. "I personally feel a tremendous sense of disappointment that he escaped justice," Zuroff told CNN. But he emphasized that he had not seen the evidence that Heim was dead. "There is no body and no grave, so we can't do a DNA test," he said, adding that "there are people who have a vested interest in convincing us that he is no longer alive." He said he expects to see the documentary evidence of Heim's death on Thursday. Heim would be 94 years old if he were still alive. Zuroff described Heim as "the most wanted Nazi war criminal," and said the Simon Wiesenthal Center was about to raise the reward for information about him from €315,000 ($405,000) to €1 million ($1.3 million) when it heard the reports of his death. During World War II Heim was a doctor at the Mauthausen concentration camp, where he was known to inmates as "Dr. Death" for performing often-fatal experiments on prisoners. After the war, he was initially cleared of wrongdoing, but in 1962 German authorities issued an arrest warrant for him. CNN Berlin Bureau Chief Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report .

chatgpt: Aribert Heim, a notorious Nazi war criminal known as "Dr. Death," is believed to have died in Egypt in 1992, according to a report by the German broadcaster ZDF. Heim, who performed cruel and inhumane experiments on prisoners during the Holocaust, had been on the run for decades before his death in Cairo under the alias Tarek Farid Hussein. Heim's heinous acts during the Holocaust earned him the infamous nickname "Dr. Death." As a member of the SS, Heim worked in concentration camps, including Mauthausen in Austria, where he conducted unspeakable experiments on prisoners. He injected inmates with toxic substances, removed organs without anesthesia, and performed other horrific procedures. Despite being wanted by authorities for decades after the war, Heim managed to evade justice and was believed to be living under an assumed identity in various countries. There were numerous alleged sightings of him over the years, but he always managed to slip away. ZDF's report claims that Heim had been living in Egypt since the 1960s, under the name Tarek Farid Hussein. According to official records, Hussein died of cancer in August 1992 at the age of 78. The broadcaster claims that it spoke to a woman who had a relationship with Hussein, and that she was able to identify him as Aribert Heim. Nazi hunter groups have said that they expect to receive documentary evidence of Heim's death on Thursday, which could provide definitive confirmation of his fate. Although the news is long overdue, it brings some closure to those who were victimized by Heim's actions. The search for justice for survivors of the Holocaust and their families has been ongoing since the end of the war, and efforts to bring perpetrators to justice have been a significant part of that process. Many former Nazis were convicted at the Nuremberg trials, but there were others who managed to evade justice. The efforts of Nazi hunters, groups and individuals who have dedicated themselves to tracking down and bringing Nazi fugitives to justice, have been instrumental in the arrest and conviction of numerous war criminals over the years. Though Heim eluded capture, this discovery provides a small measure of justice to those who were victimized by his horrific acts. Despite the passing of many years, the memory of the Holocaust still resonates with people around the world. The search for justice, however delayed, is critical to honoring the memory of those who were persecuted and murdered during that dark period of history. While there is still much work to be done, the confirmation of Heim's death brings hope that justice can be served, even decades after the fact. As time goes on, the importance of bringing those who committed atrocities to justice only grows stronger, and the efforts of those who work tirelessly to achieve that goal should be lauded.
