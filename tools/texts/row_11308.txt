article: Louis van Gaal shouldn't have to defend his Manchester United side's perceived lack of entertainment value, says club legend Peter Schmeichel, as long as the boss gets results. United's style under the Dutch manager has been described as 'long-ball', especially after their 1-1 draw with Sam Allardyce's West Ham. Paul Scholes called it 'miserable' while former boss Tommy Docherty feared Van Gaal was alienating fans. But Schmeichel believes the criticism is unfair even if the style is at odds with what would have been expected given Van Gaal's reputation from his time at the likes of Ajax and Bayern Munich.

'I don't mind a different style of play, or a boring style, for a limited period, because what I want most of all is the club back to winning ways and believing they can win,' Schmeichel told The Sun. 'It's important for the players to start understanding how much better it is to feel like you can win.' Schmeichel, who won the Champions League, five Premier Leagues and three FA Cups in goal for the Red Devils, says the side has 'progressed' from where they were last year and despite a loss last time out against Swansea they are now genuine contenders for the top four.

chatgpt: Manchester United's playing style has recently been labeled as "boring" by fans and pundits alike. Even former star goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has weighed in on the matter, stating that a "boring style" is acceptable as long as it brings wins to the team. Under the management of Louis van Gaal, Manchester United has adopted a possession-based style of play that often involves sideways passing and slow build-up play. While this approach has led to improved defensive stability and a solid fourth place in the Premier League table, it has also been criticized for lacking creativity and excitement. In a recent article for the Daily Mail, sports journalist Ian Ladyman described United as "just so boring to watch". Ladyman was particularly critical of the team's lack of attacking flair, pointing out that they have scored the fewest goals out of all the top ten teams in the Premier League. Despite these criticisms, van Gaal has remained steadfast in his approach. The Dutchman has repeatedly emphasized the importance of possession and has defended his team's style of play, stating that "possession is goal number one". However, with Manchester United facing struggling Sunderland next, many fans will be hoping for a more entertaining display. The Black Cats have struggled for form this season and are currently second from bottom in the Premier League table. While United are expected to win the match, supporters may be hoping for a more dynamic and exciting performance. With attacking talents such as Memphis Depay, Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney in their ranks, there is certainly potential for United to play in a more adventurous style. Whether van Gaal will choose to alter his tactics remains to be seen. The Dutchman is known for his stubbornness and may be reluctant to change his approach, even if it means winning over the fans. Regardless of the outcome of the match against Sunderland, Manchester United's style of play is likely to remain a topic of debate. Critics may continue to label the team as "boring", while others may argue that results are the most important thing. For now, United will focus on the task at hand and look to secure a much-needed win against Sunderland. The match will be played at the Stadium of Light and is scheduled to kick off at 3pm on Saturday, February 13th.
