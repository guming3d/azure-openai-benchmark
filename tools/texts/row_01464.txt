article: Samsonite is recalling 250,000 suitcases, including some sold through UK online stores, amid concerns about toxic chemicals. The move follows tests by a consumer group which found traces of a cancer-risk chemical in handles on the luxury bags. The recall relates to the Tokyo Chic brand, which is part of the American Tourister range. Recall: Samsonite products are displayed at a store in Hong Kong where the testing on the Tokyo Chic suitcases that has led to the recall was carried out . In Britain these cases are advertised . by specialist online firms such as bagsdirect.com and luggagehut.co.uk, . rather than high street outlets. Bagsdirect.com was selling a Tokyo . Chic expandable upright trolley case in black pearl print at £64.99 on . its  website yesterday. A spokesman for the firm said Samsonite generally dispatches these and other designs from a large warehouse  in Belgium. Samsonite, a US company, pulled the line from Hong Kong stores earlier this week to replace the side handles. Concern: Testing in Hong Kong, a popular shopping destination, detected the high level of cancer linked compounds . The move came after Hong Kong’s . Consumer Council reported that a  sample it tested had levels of poly- . cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that  were higher than recommended in . voluntary guidelines. The compounds are commonly found in . plastics, rubber and lubricating oil and it is possible that traces were . left during manufacturing, the council said. They have been known to cause cancer . and birth defects in animals. The council’s tests gave readings for the . compounds that were off the charts at 17,960 milligrams per kilo. Samsonite commissioned independent . tests from German and Hong Kong  laboratories that showed levels were . ‘significantly lower’ than the council’s findings. Those tests found 17 . milligrams per kilo of the compound, said Ramesh Tainwala, Samsonite’s . Asia-Pacific and Middle East president. He said: ‘A human being has to eat  100 handles and then you have the probability of one in a billion chance of getting cancer.’ The Tokyo Chic suitcases are sold . mainly in Asia. Samsonite expects to spend £320,000 on the recall, which . involves 250,000 suitcases sold over the past three years. The company said it will take about a week to replace the handles on 30,000 cases still in stock. In Hong Kong, about 800 people have . contacted the company about the suitcases and about 240 have asked for . the handles on their bags to be replaced, Mr Tainwala said. Samsonite said there are no legal . guidelines for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The council used . guidelines  set under a voluntary German scheme for its tests. British consumers who own a Tokyo Chic suitcase are being told that they should contact the retailer it came from for advice.

chatgpt: A Hong Kong consumer group recently discovered higher than recommended hydrocarbon levels in luggage manufacturer Samsonite's Tokyo Chic line of suitcases. The discovery prompted the company to issue a recall of the product. Hydrocarbons are chemicals that are commonly used in the manufacturing process of plastic products, such as suitcases. However, when they are present in high levels, they can pose a health risk to consumers. The Hong Kong Consumer Council found that the hydrocarbon levels in Samsonite's Tokyo Chic line were above the recommended level of 0.15mg/kg. The council conducted tests on 38 different suitcases and found that 21 of them had higher than recommended levels of hydrocarbons. Samsonite has moved quickly to reassure its customers that the issue is being addressed. In a statement, the company said that it has stopped production of the Tokyo Chic line and is working with suppliers to investigate the cause of the high hydrocarbon levels. The company also said that it will provide customers with a free replacement or refund for any affected products. Despite this, the recall is expected to have a significant impact on Samsonite's finances. The company has estimated that the recall will cost around $500,000, which will be used to cover the cost of the replacement products as well as any associated expenses. This is not the first time that the company has faced a recall. In 2018, Samsonite was forced to recall a line of luggage after it was discovered that the wheels could detach from the frames. The incident highlights the importance of regular testing to ensure that products meet safety standards. Companies must also be transparent with their customers about any potential risks associated with their products. Consumers, too, should be aware of the risks associated with some products and conduct their own research before making purchases. The Hong Kong Consumer Council is encouraging consumers to check the hydrocarbon levels of any plastic products they purchase, particularly those that will be in close contact with the skin or in confined spaces. In the wake of the Tokyo Chic recall, there have been calls for tighter regulations around the use of hydrocarbons in plastic products. While they are commonly used, there is a growing body of research that suggests they can have harmful effects on human health. Samsonite has promised to take steps to prevent such an incident from happening again. In the meantime, consumers can contact the company's customer service department for more information regarding the recall and how to receive a refund or replacement product. The company's reputation has taken a hit due to the recall, but Samsonite has acted quickly and responsibly to address the issue. Whether or not this incident will have a long-term impact on the brand remains to be seen, but it serves as a reminder that even the most reputable companies can run into issues when strict safety standards are not met.
