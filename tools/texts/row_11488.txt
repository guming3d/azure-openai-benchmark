chatgpt: Director Quentin Tarantino narrowly avoided a serious injury on the set of his latest film after a dog bite "narrowly missed" his jugular vein and carotid artery, according to doctors. The incident occurred during the shooting of Tarantino's upcoming film, "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood." The dog in question reportedly belonged to one of the stuntmen on set and was being walked by its owner when it attacked Tarantino. The director was reportedly sitting in a car at the time of the attack and was bitten on the neck. According to a statement from Tarantino's representatives, the director was immediately taken to hospital for treatment following the incident. Doctors reportedly found that the bite had "narrowly missed" both the director's jugular vein and carotid artery, two of the main arteries that supply blood to the head and neck. The statement added that Tarantino was "grateful" to the doctors and nurses who treated him, and that he was expected to make a full recovery. It is not yet clear how the incident will affect the production schedule for "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood." The film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, is set in 1969 Hollywood and follows the story of a TV actor and his stunt double as they try to make a name for themselves in the film industry. The movie also features Margot Robbie as actress Sharon Tate, who was murdered by members of the Manson Family in 1969. Dog attacks on film sets are not uncommon, and there have been several high-profile incidents in recent years. In 2015, a dog attacked and bit actor Tom Hardy on the set of "Legend," while in 2017, a German shepherd reportedly attacked a crew member on the set of "A Dog's Purpose." Despite the dangers, many productions continue to use live animals, as they believe it adds to the realism of the film. However, incidents like this highlight the need for strict safety protocols to be put in place to protect both the animals and the cast and crew. Overall, the incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers involved in filmmaking, and the importance of ensuring that every precaution is taken to protect those involved in the production.
