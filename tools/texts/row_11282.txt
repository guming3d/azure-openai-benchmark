article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- At least 2,800 dead pigs have been fished from a Shanghai river since Friday, but authorities insist that tap water in the city is still safe to drink. State news agency Xinhua said labels tagged to the pigs' ears indicated they came from the upper waters of the Huangpu River, which flows through the center of Shanghai and is a source of the city's drinking water. It's not clear why the pigs had been dumped in the river, though local media reported earlier this month that a disease had killed thousands of pigs in a village south of Shanghai. "We will continue to trace the source, investigate the cause, co-operate with neighboring areas and take measures to stop the dumping of pigs into rivers," the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission said in a statement posted on their website on Monday. As of Sunday, water quality on the Songjiang section of the river, where most of the pigs were found, remained normal and the incident has had "no significant effect on tap water supply," the commission added. However, local residents and users of of the popular Twitter-like microblog service Sina Weibo have expressed concern that the dead pigs would make the city's tap water unsafe to drink. "Huangpu river is the source of drinking water for more than 20 million Shanghai residents. And this horrific incident was only made public when residents started posting pictures on Weibo," business investor Xue Manzi said in a post on his account. The agricultural commission said it had tested organ samples from the pig carcasses and the results suggested the animals had contracted a type of porcine circovirus. According to Professor Fred Leung, who specialises in animal diseases at Hong Kong University, this is a fairly common disease in pigs and not usually fatal on its own. Pictures showed sanitation workers with sticks retrieving the bloated bodies of small pigs caught up in reeds and debris at the side of the river. A local newspaper in Jiaxing, a city in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai, reported on March 6 that tens of thousands of pigs had died of an animal disease in a major pig farming village in the past two months. "According to our records, 10,078 pigs died in January, another 8,325 died in February. More than 300 pigs die everyday in our village, and we barely have any space left to dispose of the dead pigs," a local villager was quoted by the paper as saying. Chen Yi, a veterinarian at the Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the Global Times newspapers that farmers are required by law to dispose of dead animals at community disposal sites or bury them with disinfectant. CNN's Zhang Dayu reported from Beijing .

chatgpt: Shanghai, China - In a concerning development, pig carcasses retrieved from a river in Shanghai have tested positive for porcine circovirus, according to local authorities. More than 2,800 dead pigs were found floating in the waterway, sparking fears among local residents about the safety of their tap water. Authorities have announced that the local tap water remains safe to drink, despite the disturbing discovery. However, residents have expressed concern about the potential health risks of consuming water that has been in contact with the contaminated pig carcasses. The news comes amidst reports of a significant rise in the number of pig deaths across China. Earlier this year, more than 10,000 pigs reportedly died in a neighboring province, raising questions about the overall health and safety of China's pork industry. Porcine circovirus is a common disease among pigs that can cause respiratory and digestive issues. It is possible for humans to contract the virus, although cases are rare. Officials in Shanghai have stated that they are conducting further investigations into the cause of the mass pig deaths, and have launched a cleanup effort to remove the carcasses from the river. The incident has also raised questions about the disposal methods used by local pig farms, and the quality of China's water supply. The discovery of the dead pigs has caused significant public outcry in China, with citizens taking to social media to voice their concerns. Many have criticized the government's response to the situation, saying that officials have been slow to act and have not provided enough information about the potential health risks. The Chinese government has faced increasing scrutiny over its handling of public health issues in recent years, following a number of high-profile incidents involving contaminated food and water. The discovery of the porcine circovirus in the pig carcasses is likely to fuel further concerns about food and water safety in the country. The situation in Shanghai is ongoing, and officials have urged residents to remain vigilant and take any necessary precautions to protect their health. In the meantime, the government has promised to strengthen its monitoring and enforcement efforts to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.  As for now, it is highly recommended that the people of Shanghai maintain precaution and take necessary measures to prevent themselves from any possible outbreaks of diseases or infections.
