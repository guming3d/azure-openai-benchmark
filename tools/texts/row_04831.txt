article: (CNN) -- McLaren's Lewis Hamilton has apologized for causing a collision with Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi which ended the Briton's involvement in Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix. The 2008 world champion Hamilton overtook the Sauber racer on the 13th lap heading into the corner known as Les Combes, but the 26-year-old failed to see Kobayashi making a counter move. The two cars subsequently made contact with Hamilton spinning into the barriers and out of the race. The crash prompted the Briton  to apologize to Kobayashi and his McLaren team via the social-networking site Twitter. "After watching the replay, I realize it was my fault today [Sunday] 100%. I didn't give Kobayashi enough room though I thought I was past," tweeted Hamilton. 20 years of Schumacher: Is his legacy on the line? "Apologies to Kamui and to my team. The team deserves better from me. Best wishes, Lewis." Hamilton's retirement from the Spa race left him fifth in the drivers' standings, 113 points behind the Red Bull of championship leader Sebastian Vettel. Vettel, who claimed the world title in 2010, took the checkered flag in Belgium ahead of teammate Mark Webber, with Hamilton's McLaren colleague Jenson Button recovering from 13th on the grid to take third position. Button, a world champion in 2009, was pleased with his performance and the condition of his car. "Our car is the best it's been all year, and I feel better than I ever have in Formula 1," the 31-year-old told McLaren's official web site. "We just need to stop the little mistakes from happening so that we can win even more races." Meanwhile, Polish driver Robert Kubica underwent surgery on Sunday for the final time on arm injuries sustained during a pre-season rally crash. Renault driver Kubica crashed out of the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy in February, and was subsequently replaced by German driver Nick Heidfeld for the beginning of the 2011 season. Renault released a statement which said the surgery was a "total success," after the former Sauber driver awoke from the procedure in good spirits. "Robert underwent one last scheduled operation in Italy, aimed at recovering the full mobility of his right elbow," read the statement. "The surgeons are happy to report that they have been able to complete 100% of their task and did not encounter any complications. They have described the outcome of the operation as 'a total success.' "On waking up, it was immediately clear Robert was in good spirits. Why? Well, as soon as he opened his eyes, he asked for the results of today's race! He will now rest in hospital for a few days before resuming his rehabilitation and training program."

chatgpt: Lewis Hamilton has taken full responsibility for the crash he had with Kamui Kobayashi on Sunday's race. The British driver admitted his fault in the incident which caused him to crash out of the race. He collided with Kobayashi on the 13th lap which resulted in his early exit from the Singapore Grand Prix. Hamilton expressed his regret over the incident and apologized to his team and fans who were rooting for him. "I made a mistake and I apologize for that," he said. "I let the team down and all the people who support me. It was my fault and I take full responsibility for it." This was a surprising turn of events for the Mercedes driver who is known for his strong racing skills. He had been leading the championship table before the incident and was a favorite to win the race. Hamilton's mistake has cost him valuable points in the championship race and has given his rivals an advantage. Meanwhile, Robert Kubica, who had suffered serious arm and leg injuries after a rally crash earlier this year, has undergone several surgeries to aid his recovery. Renault released a statement saying that the latest procedure was a total success and that the Polish driver is on course for a full recovery. Kubica underwent multiple surgeries since his accident in February, including one in which an external fixator was inserted to stabilize his bones. The latest surgery was done to remove the fixator and assess the progress of his healing. "Robert is doing well and showing positive signs of progress," Renault's statement read. "The team is closely monitoring his recovery and we are hopeful that he will be able to return to racing in the near future." Kubica's injuries have forced him to miss the entire 2011 season, and it is not yet clear when he will be cleared to return to racing. Renault had brought in Bruno Senna to fill in for Kubica this season, and the Brazilian has been doing well in the team. The news of Kubica's successful surgery was a relief for his fans who have been eagerly waiting for updates on his recovery. There is hope that the talented driver will be able to bounce back and continue his career in Formula 1. In conclusion, Lewis Hamilton's frank admission of responsibility for his crash with Kamui Kobayashi has shown his character as a true gentleman of the sport. Meanwhile, Robert Kubica's successful surgery has given hope to his fans that he will be able to make a full recovery and return to racing soon.
