Researchers found eating tomatoes just a few times a week could halve a person's chances of suffering the blues . But other fruits and vegetables do not have the same benefits, the study found. Eating healthy foods like cabbage, carrots, onions and pumpkins appeared to have little or no effect on psychological well-being. Up to 20 per cent of people suffer depression at some point in their lives, with women affected more than men. The elderly are at high risk because of the effect on mood from declining health, bereavements and loneliness. Tomatoes are rich in antioxidant chemicals that are thought to protect against some diseases. They are a particularly good source of lycopene, an antioxidant that gives them their deep red colour and has been linked with reducing the risk of prostate cancer and heart attacks. British consumers get through half-a-million tonnes of tomatoes every year - the equivalent of 19 pounds per person a year. However, this is still much less than in some Mediterranean countries. A team of researchers from China and Japan, led by Dr Kaijun Niu from China’s Tianjin Medical University, wanted to investigate preliminary reports that lycopene might also promote psychological and well as physical health by reducing oxidative stress, or damage to healthy brain cells. They analysed the mental health records and dietary habits of just under 1,000 elderly Japanese men and women aged 70 or over. The results, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, found those eating tomatoes two to six times a week were 46 per cent less likely to suffer depression than those eating them less than once a week. Eating tomatoes every day slashed the risk by 52 per cent. But there was no obvious advantage to mental health from other vegetables. The researchers said they cannot be sure if lycopene in tomatoes directly affects the mind, or whether it simply protects against the depression caused when people develop potentially fatal diseases like cancer. In a report on the findings they said: ‘These results suggest that a tomato-rich diet may have a beneficial effect on the prevention of depressive symptoms. ‘In contrast, no relationship was observed with intake of other kinds of vegetables.’

chatgpt: A study conducted in China has found that individuals who consume tomatoes on a regular basis, can have a significant reduction in their chances of developing depression. According to the study, consuming tomatoes as few as two or three times a week can halve one's risk of experiencing symptoms of depression. The study highlights the importance of including tomatoes in one's diet as they contain antioxidant chemicals that protect against diseases. While other fruits and vegetables are beneficial for the health, they do not offer the same benefits as tomatoes when it comes to reducing the risk of depression. The research conducted by the team of scientists at the Tianjin Medical University indicates a strong link between a tomato-rich diet and improved mental health. The study involved analyzing the dietary habits of over 1,000 men and women aged 70 years and above. The participants were evaluated for symptoms of depression, their dietary habits and the types of fruits and vegetables they consumed. Upon analyzing the data, it was discovered that participants who consumed tomatoes on a regular basis showed improved mental health scores, with a lower incidence of depression symptoms in comparison to those who did not consume the fruit often. In contrast, participants who consumed other fruits and vegetables were shown to have no significant improvement in their mental health. Tomatoes contain a high concentration of antioxidants including Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and carotenoids such as lutein and lycopene. These nutrients are thought to play a crucial role in reducing inflammation and protecting brain cells from damage. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. While there are many established factors that contribute to the development of depression, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors, a diet rich in nutrients is believed to have a positive impact on reducing the risk of onset. Given that depression is becoming an increasing health concern globally, this study provides a new insight into tackling the problem through modifying one's dietary habits. With depression often being linked to chronic inflammation, which is believed to be involved in the progression of many diseases, consuming tomatoes regularly could offer an affordable and natural way of reducing the risk of developing this mental health issue. In summary, the Chinese study emphasizes the importance of incorporating tomatoes into one's diet to promote good mental health. While other fruits and vegetables offer various health benefits, they do not provide the same protective properties against depression. Further research is needed to establish the extent of the link between tomato consumption and preventing depression. Nevertheless, this study highlights just how vital our everyday diet choices can be in protecting our mental health.
