However, the demonstration did not go as planned, as the armoured glass of the vehicle was found to have fist-sized dents caused by bottles and eggs. This realization has prompted the German government to demand an explanation from the police force, especially after ordering 78 of these vehicles.

But instead of being a success, the event turned sour as the attendees saw that the armoured glass was easily damaged by the thrown bottles and eggs.

While the police force is investigating the matter seriously, it remains to be seen how they will handle the outcome of their investigation and what future measures they will put in place to avoid such events from occurring again.
