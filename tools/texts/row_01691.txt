article: (CNN) -- Attention cruise passengers: You now have more protection when things go awry. On Wednesday, Cruise Lines International Association announced the adoption of a new passenger bill of rights. "The Cruise Industry Passenger Bill of Rights codifies many longstanding practices of CLIA members and goes beyond those to further inform cruise guests of the industry's commitment to their comfort and care," said Christine Duffy, president and CEO of CLIA, in a statement. The new policy comes on the heels of a series of high-profile setbacks for the industry. From mechanical failures to a deadly accident off the coast of Italy, incidents in the past year-and-a-half have battered the industry's reputation for safety. Among passengers' rights are an emergency power source in case of a main generator failure and a ship crew "properly trained" in emergency procedures. Generator failure played a key role in the days-long stranding of the Carnival Triumph in February after an engine fire knocked out power. In the case of the January 2012 Costa Concordia disaster off the coast of Italy, which killed 32, many passengers recounted a chaotic evacuation of the sinking ship. Another provision of the cruise industry rule mirrors the Department of Transportation's tarmac delay rule for airline passengers in giving cruise passengers the right to disembark a docked ship if adequate food, water and restroom facilities are not available onboard. The organization's new policy also provides the right to emergency medical attention, timely information related to itinerary changes and mechanical problems and full or partial refunds for voyages that are canceled or ended early due to mechanical failures. The bill also assumes responsibility for passenger transportation and lodging in cases when mechanical issues cut voyages short. The full bill of rights will be published on each cruise line's website, in addition to a toll-free number for passengers to call with questions about shipboard operations. The bill of rights is effective immediately for passengers who purchase cruises in North America for any itinerary on CLIA's more than two dozen North American member cruise lines, which include Carnival, Costa, Disney, Holland America, Royal Caribbean and others. The industry organization is also planning to request global recognition of the new policy from the International Maritime Organization.

chatgpt: The cruise industry trade group, Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), has recently announced a comprehensive passenger bill of rights for North American cruise lines that are members of the group. This move comes after a series of highly publicized failures, including prolonged power outages and botched evacuation plans, which prompted the industry to take a hard look at its safety procedures. Under the new policy, cruise lines will be required to provide passengers with certain guarantees aimed at ensuring their safety and well-being. Among the key requirements outlined in the bill of rights is the need for an emergency power source, which will be mandated for ships that carry at least 1,000 passengers. This means that, in the event of an electrical failure, ships will be able to maintain basic services like lighting, heating, and air conditioning. Additionally, the bill of rights calls for crew members to be extensively trained in emergency evacuation procedures, ensuring that they can take swift and effective action in the event of an emergency. The CLIA's passenger bill of rights also includes provisions for passenger compensation in the event of a major disruption or cancellation. The bill specifies that passengers will be entitled to refunds or credits, depending on the length of the delay or cancellation. This is expected to be a welcome policy for passengers who have experienced significant setbacks in the past, including long delays or missed connections due to unforeseen circumstances. The announcement of the passenger bill of rights has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts. Some analysts have praised the move as an important step toward increasing passenger safety and restoring confidence in the industry. Others have expressed skepticism, arguing that such policies may not go far enough to address the root causes of safety lapses in the cruise industry. Despite these concerns, the CLIA has maintained that the new policy represents a significant step forward for the industry, and that it will continue to work with its members to ensure that safety remains a top priority on all North American cruise lines. The organization has also emphasized the need for passengers to remain vigilant and informed about safety procedures and emergency protocols, in order to help prevent and mitigate potential risks. Overall, the CLIA's announcement of a comprehensive passenger bill of rights represents a significant development for the cruise industry, and one that is likely to have far-reaching implications for passengers, crew members, and industry stakeholders alike. As the industry continues to evolve and grow, it will be critical for all parties involved to remain committed to safety and transparency, and to work together to ensure that passengers can enjoy safe, enjoyable, and truly memorable voyages at sea.
