article: Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN)At least 13 people are dead and many workers still missing Saturday evening after a fire broke out inside a factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh -- the latest such deadly blaze in the south Asian nation. Mohammad Salimuzzaman, the officer in charge of the police station in the area of the nation's capital were the fire occurred, said authorities had sent at least 13 bodies to a hospital morgue. Many of the bodies were disfigured and charred beyond recognition. A short time earlier, Dhaka police chief Asaduzzaman Mia told reporters about the efforts to find others who were in the five-story building. "The rescuers were still searching for bodies in the debris," Mia said. Such factories -- making products for a number of Western retailers -- play a big part in Bangladesh's economy, with ready-made garments alone making up 80% of the country's $24 billion in annual exports. The factory that burned Saturday was used to make plastic goods. These buildings haven't always proven to be the safest places to work. There are many examples in recent years of fatal factory fires in Bangladesh, the most glaring being the spring 2013 collapse of a nine-story building that housed five garment factories. More than 1,100 people died in that blaze. Saturday's fire started on the plastic factor's ground floor and immediately and quickly spread, fueled by flammable chemicals in the building, firefighters said. Authorities didn't say how many people were in the building when this happened, and thus how many remained unaccounted for. Yet some of those escaped -- and there were many -- estimated about 80 or 90 others worked there. Afterward, the scene filled with not only firefighters but several thousand onlookers, some of them trying to track down their still-missing relatives. Firefighters didn't specify exactly what caused the blaze, though they suspected a busted gas cylinder may be to blame. Past factory fires have led to emotional rhetoric from officials, calls for action and, in some cases, criminal charges. Thirteen people were found guilty of gross negligence of safety measures and charged with "culpable homicide" after a  November 2012 apparel factory fire on Dhaka's outskirts that killed at least 117 people and spurred others to jump from the building to escape the flames. Most of those dead in that blaze were women, almost half of them burned so bad that DNA tests were needed to identify them. The building collapse months later in Dhaka was even more appalling and exponentially more deadly. That blaze spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers rights in Bangladesh. The government responded by revampling laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions, and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5% of their profits toward a workers' welfare fund. The government also boosted minimum wages from $38 to around $68 per month. Journalist Farid Ahmed reported from Bangladesh, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

chatgpt: A tragic fire broke out on Monday at a plastics factory in the Bangladeshi capital city of Dhaka, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. So far, authorities have found several bodies and they are still searching for others who may have been trapped inside the facility. According to the police chief, the death toll has risen to 10, with at least 20 others injured in the blaze. The fire reportedly started in the afternoon and quickly spread throughout the four-story building. Eyewitnesses reported seeing thick smoke billowing from the windows as flames licked at the exterior. Rescue teams were immediately dispatched to the scene, but were hampered by the building's design and a lack of proper equipment. The plastics factory is located in an area of Dhaka that is known for its high-density industrial operations. It is also an area that has seen several deadly factory fires in recent years. Many of the factories in the area lack proper safety equipment and are overcrowded, making conditions ripe for accidents. Firefighters battled the blaze for several hours before finally bringing it under control. However, the damage had already been done. Most of the factory was destroyed, leaving many workers without jobs and struggling to make ends meet. Several workers who survived the blaze shared their harrowing stories with the media, describing how they were trapped inside the building and had to scramble to safety through the smoke and flames. Many reported that there were no fire exits or safety drills and that they were not even provided with basic safety equipment like fire extinguishers. This latest fire has once again shone a spotlight on the dangerous conditions that many workers in Bangladesh are subjected to. The country has a long history of factory fires, including the infamous blaze at the Tazreen Fashions factory in 2012, which claimed the lives of over 100 workers. While the government has promised to take action to improve safety standards in the country's factories, progress has been slow. Many blame the lax enforcement of safety regulations and corrupt practices within the industry for the continuing problem. As the search for survivors and bodies continues, many are calling for a full investigation into the latest tragedy and for stronger measures to be put in place to protect workers in Bangladesh's factories. Until meaningful action is taken, fires like this one will continue to put the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Bangladeshi workers at risk.
