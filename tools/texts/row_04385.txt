article: (CNN) -- Syrian military airstrikes killed more than 20 people in a province bordering Turkey, an opposition group said Saturday. Warplanes carried out the attacks in the mountainous Latakia province in the overnight hours, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on its Facebook page. The group estimates Syria's civil war, now in its third year, has killed more than 106,000 people and created more than 1.8 million refugees. Syria was high on the agenda in a meeting Friday between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and their Russian counterparts, Sergey Lavrov and Sergey Shoygu. But no concrete commitments emerged from the talks at the State Department. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the leaders had "exchanged views on Syria and the importance of supporting a political process to end the violence." "Our goal is the same. We need to start a political process," Lavrov said before the four met. He urged the holding of a second conference on Syria in Geneva, saying the priority must be to "fight terrorists and force them away from Syria." The Syrian government also refers to the rebel fighters as terrorists. Rebel fighters . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Wednesday that at least 62 Syrian rebel fighters had been killed in an ambush in the Damascus countryside. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said that Al-Nusra Front "terrorists" had been ambushed and killed in the same region and that non-Syrian fighters were among the dead. The Al-Nusra Front, or Jabhat al-Nusra, a militant Sunni Islamist movement, is one of the rebel groups taking up arms against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. A day earlier, the Observatory reported that Syrian rebels and an al Qaeda-affiliated group had captured a government air base near the key city of Aleppo. Fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and various rebel battalions destroyed several tanks and killed a number of regime soldiers as they fought for control of the Menagh air base, the Observatory said. At least 10 rebel fighters, including foreigners, also died, the group said. The Islamic State of Iraq is the rebranded name for al Qaeda in Iraq. The group changed its name after its founder, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed by a U.S. missile strike in 2006. The Menagh air base is north of Aleppo, Syria's largest city and financial hub. For many months, rebels have tried to wrest control of the city in their attempt to end four decades of rule by al-Assad's family. CNN's Khushbu Shah contributed to this report .

chatgpt: Attacks have rocked Syria's Latakia province, which spans the coastline and is strategically located on the Turkish border. The conflict has left over 106,000 people dead, with countless others displaced and seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Both the United States and Russia, who have been involved in negotiations to end the fighting, have reiterated the importance of a political process to bring about a peaceful resolution. While violence continues to rage in various parts of the country, this latest spate of attacks serves as a grim reminder of the devastating consequences of war. While the origins of the most recent violence are unclear, the ongoing turmoil is not new for residents of Latakia. Over the past several years, they have experienced firsthand the horrors of a bloody civil war that has left an estimated 1 million people displaced. With no end in sight, civilians are left to endure the escalating violence and uncertainty that has become a daily reality. The situation is compounded by the fact that many basic necessities such as food, water, and medical supplies are in short supply. The United States has been vocal in its support for a political solution that would bring an end to the bloodshed. They have also joined other countries in providing aid to assist those affected by the conflict. Russia, another key player in the negotiations, has also made it clear that the violence must end. Their involvement in the conflict has been particularly controversial, with allegations of human rights abuses and supporting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Despite the efforts of the international community to bring about an end to the fighting, the situation in Syria remains volatile. Attacks such as those in Latakia serve as a grim reminder of the devastating impact of a conflict that has left countless men, women, and children dead or displaced. As the world watches and waits, the hope remains that a lasting peace can be achieved, bringing an end to the senseless violence that has engulfed Syria for far too long. Until then, the people of Latakia and other areas ravaged by conflict remain in a desperate state, struggling to survive amid the chaos and destruction of war.
