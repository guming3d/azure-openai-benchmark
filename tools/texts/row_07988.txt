A Florida woman has been charged with abuse after her disabled husband was found covered in maggots with wounds that were bone deep. Paramedics found Sharon Tillman's husband Greg living in his own excrement with severe body sores covering his body. He weighed just 90lbs and had open wounds that were so severe that parts of his bone were exposed. Charged with abuse: Sharon Tillman (pictured left) has been arrested for letting disabled husband, Greg Tillman (right), rot in bed while covered in maggots . Investigators said he became bedridden in January after suffering a bad reaction to a spider bite. Sharon, 48, failed to seek any medical attention and instead allegedly allowed him to rot away in his bed with flesh eating maggots attacking his body. One investigators stated that one of his leg wounds had been open down to the bone for so long that 'the bone was dry and skin was not growing over it.' Tillman was found at the home he shared in Pinellas Park, Florida, with his wife. Photos on the couple's Facebook page show the couple smiling and happy together. But investigators who visited the home said Tillman had been left in increasingly dire conditions after becoming ill.

Police who visited the home said in an arrest report they were met by an overpowering stench of urine. Outside the home were piles of trash, urine collection bags and soiled gauze. There were also milk bottles filled with liquid. Conditions inside the home were no better with trash spread across all the rooms. 'We found medical injuries not from physical abuse, but from a lack of medical attention, and lack of care-giving by the victim's wife,' said Pinellas Park Police public information officer Brian Unmasieg. Neighbors told WTSP TV that they often wondered why they never saw Mr Tillman. 'I used to see him outside cutting his grass, and then nothing,' said neighbor Anthony Leverso. 'Sharron was always nice, so I never thought anything of it. I thought maybe they split up, or he moved away.' 'She used to come over and ask for things like butter or eggs or money. We always tried to help out because we knew they had fallen on hard times, but I never knew anything like that was going on across the street from my house,' said neighbor Tommy DiTommaso. Tillman was charged with abuse/neglect of a disabled person and is being held in Pinellas County jail. Authorities said her husband is expected to make a full recovery.

chatgpt: In a harrowing discovery, 49-year-old Greg Tillman was found living in his own excrement with severe body sores down to the bone. According to reports, Tillman became bedridden in January after suffering a spider bite. Despite his worsening condition, Tillman's wife Sharon failed to seek any medical attention and allowed him to deteriorate. Neighbors had expressed concern over Tillman's welfare, as they noted that they had not seen him in months. After several attempts to contact the couple went unanswered, authorities were called to perform a wellness check. What they discovered was distressing. Tillman was found lying in his own waste material in a small, filthy room in his home. His body was covered in sores that had festered down to the bone. It was apparent that he had been living in these unsanitary conditions for some time. Police immediately took Tillman to a nearby hospital, where he remains in critical condition. Doctors state that he will require extensive medical treatment and may never fully recover from the damage that has been done to his body. Sharon Tillman was arrested and charged with neglect and abuse of a vulnerable adult. During questioning, she admitted to keeping her husband confined to their home after he became ill. She also acknowledged that she failed to seek any medical attention for him, despite his steadily worsening condition. Sharon Tillman remains in custody, awaiting trial for her crimes. Neighbors expressed shock and dismay at the situation, stating that they had no idea that things had gotten so bad for the Tillmans. They noted that the couple had always been private and that they had not seen much of them in recent months. They were particularly appalled by the neglect that Greg had suffered, stating that they would have never guessed that such conditions could exist in their quiet community. The case is particularly distressing, as it highlights the vulnerability of some of the most marginalized members of society. It also serves as a warning to families and caregivers to be vigilant in monitoring the health and welfare of their loved ones. Neglecting to seek medical attention for even seemingly minor injuries can result in devastating consequences, as Greg Tillman's case clearly demonstrates. As the investigation continues, authorities are calling on anyone with additional information to come forward. They hope to shed more light on what happened to Greg Tillman and to bring justice to those responsible for his suffering.
