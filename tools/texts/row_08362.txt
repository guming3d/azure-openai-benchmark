Pope Francis challenged business leaders assembled in Davos today to put their wealth at the service of humanity . Pope Francis challenged business leaders assembled in Davos today to do more for the poor and ensure 'humanity is served by wealth and not ruled by it.' In a message to more than 2,500 participants at the annual World Economic Forum, the pontiff urged industrialists and bankers to promote inclusive prosperity. 'I ask you to ensure that humanity is served by wealth and not ruled by it,' Pope Francis said in the message read at the opening ceremony by Cardinal Peter Turkson, president of the Pontifical Council for Peace and Justice. The Argentinian pope, who has identified strongly with the poor since his election last year and severely criticised capitalism, acknowledged that business had helped lift millions out of poverty, even if it had led to widespread social exclusion. 'The growth of equality demands something more than economic growth, even though it presupposes it. 'It demands first of all 'a transcendent vision of the person',' he said in the message. 'It also calls for decisions, mechanisms and processes directed to a better distribution of wealth, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality.' Rising income disparity and attendant social unrest were flagged as the biggest threat to the world in the WEF's annual 'Global Risks 2014' report last week. Inequality has been widening since the 1980s but the issue has risen up the agenda since the financial crisis that erupted in 2008.

A new generation of young pe, who lack jobs and hope of social improvement, is fuelling pent-up frustration, with a wave of protests from Thailand to Brazil. The richest 85 people in the world now have as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population, or some 3.5 billion people, according to a report from the charity Oxfam this week. Oxfam said there a need for some economic inequality to reward those with talent, skills and ambition but the current extreme situation was 'damaging and worrying'.

chatgpt: In a speech delivered to the 2,500 participants at the annual World Economic Forum, a prominent business leader acknowledged the crucial role of businesses in lifting millions out of poverty. However, he also warned that the rising income disparity and social unrest pose the biggest threat to the world today. The annual World Economic Forum brings together international business leaders and policymakers to discuss global issues and challenges. Participants gathered to hear from prominent speakers, including the business leader who delivered the address. In his speech, the leader acknowledged the role that businesses have played in contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction. He cited examples of companies that had created jobs and contributed to the growth of local economies. However, he also noted that the benefits of globalisation and technological advancements had not been evenly distributed. Despite the progress made in poverty reduction, the leader warned that the world still faced significant challenges. Rising income inequality and social unrest, he argued, threatened to destabilise societies and economies, creating a cycle of poverty and social upheaval. The widening gap between the rich and the poor, he said, was not only a moral issue, but also a political and economic one. The leader called for increased collaboration between businesses, governments, and civil society organisations to address these challenges. He stressed the need for businesses to consider their social and environmental impact, and to work towards creating more equitable and sustainable economies. Many of the participants in the audience agreed with the leader's assessment of the world's challenges. Some voiced their concerns that the increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few would lead to further social unrest and instability. Others suggested that government policies should be more robust in addressing income inequality, through measures such as progressive taxation, public investment in education and healthcare, and the protection of workers' rights. The leader's speech sparked a lively debate among the participants, with many highlighting the need for collective action to address the world's most pressing challenges. While acknowledging the progress that had been made, they emphasised the need for continued efforts to create more inclusive and sustainable economies. As the forum drew to a close, many participants left with a renewed sense of purpose and the commitment to do their part in addressing the challenges facing the world. The leader's message had reminded them that they had a responsibility not only to their shareholders, but also to the wider society and the planet.
