article: Kevin Pietersen's chances of play for Surrey next summer have reduced significantly amid reports Kumar Sangakkara is set to sign on as the Oval's next overseas star. Having already been dropped by England across all formats, Pietersen has been de-registered by Surrey but had hopes of agreeing to a new deal by the start of next season. However, The Sun reports Sri Lankan keeper-batsman Sangakkara could sign with the London-based country side within days.

With 37-year-old Sangakkara's possible deal commanding a substantial fee, there would unlikely be any room in the budget for what Pietersen would be expecting. Pietersen’s contract with Surrey expired in August, making him a free agent, and he's since plied his trade as a Twenty20 mercenary in India, the Caribbean and he's due to line up for Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash League in the southern hemisphere summer.

The left-hander is 12 short of 12,000 Test runs after 128 Tests at an average of 58.76 and is also a star of the 50-over format with 13,050 runs at an average of 40.15. And he signed off last season's stay with Durham with a knock of 159 in a draw with Sussex. Surrey have been unlucky with big name signings in recent years, with Graeme Smith and Ricky Ponting both suffering injuries during their time at the county.

chatgpt: Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen has expressed his desire to re-sign with the Surrey County Cricket Club, after being de-registered at the end of last season. Pietersen has enjoyed a successful stint with the Oval-based club and is keen to continue playing for them. However, the club seems to have moved on from Pietersen as reports suggest that they are now poised to sign Sri Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara for the coming season. Sangakkara, who retired from international cricket in 2015, has had successful stints with a number of T20 franchises around the world, including the Jamaica Tallawahs and the Quetta Gladiators. If Sangakkara does sign with Surrey, he will follow in the footsteps of two other overseas stars, Ricky Ponting and Graeme Smith, who have joined the county in recent seasons. Ponting, the former Australian captain, played for Surrey for the 2013 season, while Smith, the former South African skipper, represented the club in 2013 and 2014. Surrey's director of cricket, Alec Stewart, is excited about the potential signing of Sangakkara. "Kumar is a world-class player who has achieved incredible things in his career," said Stewart. "He would bring a wealth of experience and skill to our team, and would be a great addition to our dressing room." Surrey's hopes of signing Sangakkara have been boosted by the fact that he has expressed an interest in playing county cricket. "I have always enjoyed playing in England, and the opportunity to play for Surrey is one that I would relish," said Sangakkara. Sangakkara's signing would be a huge coup for Surrey, who have struggled in the County Championship in recent years. The club finished seventh in the division one table last season, winning just three of their 16 matches. But with Sangakkara in their ranks, Surrey will have a much stronger batting line-up, which should help them to improve their performances in the 2017 season. The Sri Lankan is a prolific run-scorer, having scored over 28,000 runs in international cricket, with 38 centuries to his name. While the potential signing of Sangakkara would be great news for Surrey, it would also be a boost for county cricket as a whole. The arrival of overseas stars such as Ponting, Smith and Sangakkara helps to raise the profile of the county game, and inspires young cricketers to strive for success at the highest level. If Sangakkara does sign with Surrey, cricket fans around the world will be eagerly anticipating his performances in the County Championship, and will no doubt be looking forward to seeing him light up the Oval with his dazzling strokeplay.
