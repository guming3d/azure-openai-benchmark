article: (CNN) -- County officials on Tuesday granted the paperwork needed for the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, to open -- after two years of legal wrangling and anti-Muslim sentiment that included vandalism. "We're thrilled," said Saleh Sbenaty, a member of the mosque's board and planning committee. The first prayer service is set for 1 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) on Friday, before the close of the holy month of Ramadan, he noted. Controversy over the building erupted in 2010, when planning commissioners approved an expansion project at the existing mosque.

The construction site has been vandalized several times, including an arson attack in 2010 and "not welcome" spray-painted on a sign announcing the project. Federal authorities have charged a Texas man with calling in a bomb threat to the center before last year's anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Tuesday's announcement comes a day after a mosque in Joplin, Missouri, burned to the ground in a fire that federal agents are investigating as a possible arson, and two days after an alleged white supremacist gunman killed six Sikhs and wounded three others, including a police officer, near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In a statement issued Monday, the Interfaith Coalition on Mosques urged state and federal law enforcement officials "to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the arson, and the destruction of the Joplin mosque, and to pursue hate crime charges if appropriate." Sbetany said the Muslim community has noted the incidents with alarm. "We are very concerned, as many people would be, and we're just hoping for the best and that our community will be spared from any violence in the long term," he told CNN. But he took a sanguine view about the mosque in Murfreesboro. "We're looking at a brighter future, and a prosperous united community," he said. "We are going to forget all of what happened and put it behind us." Opinion: An American tradition of bigotry . The approval followed a tortuous path. In July, a federal judge in Memphis set aside a local judge's ruling from the previous month that voided a planning commission's approval, and ordered Rutherford County authorities to conduct a final inspection of the building. Tuesday's certificate, from Rutherford County's Building Code Department, is good for 30 days. Landscaping needs to be completed before the building can receive a permanent certificate, but Sbenaty said he was optimistic that it could be completed within the allotted time. Murfreesboro, a city of nearly 110,000 residents, is located 30 miles southeast of Nashville. Belief: My Faith, after my mosque was torched . CNN's George Howell contributed to this report.

chatgpt: After two years of legal battles and setbacks, a mosque in Rutherford County has finally been granted a temporary certificate of occupancy. The opening is expected to be a milestone for the Muslim community, particularly during Ramadan. The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro had been fighting for the right to build a mosque for years. Despite being approved by local planners and zoning officials, the mosque faced opposition from residents who claimed the mosque would bring unwanted changes to the community. The legal battle over the mosque's construction intensified as opponents filed lawsuits against the building of the mosque, citing concerns regarding Sharia law and terrorist activities. However, after two years of court battles and heated debates, the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro was finally granted a temporary certificate of occupancy by the county. The mosque's board members expressed their excitement and relief regarding their victory. "We're thrilled," said a member of the mosque board. "After two long years, we can finally celebrate this milestone moment in the Muslim community." The mosque's first service is scheduled to occur during Ramadan, a month-long religious celebration where Muslims fast during daylight hours and gather for prayer during the evenings. "This is a particularly important time for the Muslim community," said the board member. "To be able to gather together in our own space during Ramadan is a dream come true." The granting of the temporary certificate of occupancy marks the end of a long and difficult journey for those involved with the mosque's construction. Adversaries of the mosque construction have been vocal in their opposition throughout the ordeal, making it a fierce and contentious legal battle. Despite this, the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro remained steadfast in their pursuit of constructing the mosque, stating that they have the right to worship in a location of their choosing, just like any other religious group in the community. "We just want to live peacefully and practice our religion without fear or prejudice," said the board member. "The approval of our mosque is a victory for religious freedom and tolerance." As the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro prepares to open its doors, community members have expressed their support for the mosque and welcomed the Muslim community to the area. "The opening of the mosque is a sign of progress," said a community member. "It shows that even in the face of discrimination, we can come together as a community and support one another." Overall, the granting of the temporary certificate of occupancy for the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro represents a significant victory for religious freedom and tolerance. As the Muslim community prepares to celebrate Ramadan in their new space, it is clear that their determination and perseverance have paid off.
