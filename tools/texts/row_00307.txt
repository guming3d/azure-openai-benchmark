article: Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, will boycott runoff parliamentary elections scheduled for Sunday, a member of the party said Wednesday. Mohamed Beltagy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a former legislative candidate, said the boycott is a protest against irregularities in the first round of voting last Sunday. The party was wiped out Sunday, going from 88 seats in the legislature to zero. Egypt's ruling National Democratic Party won 217 seats in the first round of voting, the semi-official Al-Ahram newspaper said. The opposition parties won a mere handful of seats in the 508-seat parliament. Twenty-seven candidates affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood qualified for runoff elections. Muslim Brotherhood candidates run as independents because the group is illegal under to Egyptian law, which bans parties based on religion. The runoff will involve 377 candidates from the National Democratic Party of longtime President Hosni Mubarak. On Tuesday, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama criticized the elections, saying there had been "numerous reported irregularities" and "restrictions on basic freedoms." National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer called the reports "worrying" and said the United States is "disappointed." Critics had predicted that Sunday's race would be tainted by fraud and intimidation, but the government declared it "a success." Egypt's official MENA news service reported that 6,000 members of 76 civil groups monitored the elections. The country rejected international monitoring of the vote as interference in its internal affairs. Egyptian election commission spokesman Sameh al-Kashef said Tuesday that, although the committee had received numerous complaints, irregularities did not affect the results of the election. The complaints included reports of riots, fraud and forgery, denying citizens their right to vote, and difficulties faced by the media. There were riots in 16 constituencies, he said. He said voter turnout was 35 percent. Various opposition groups have accused the ruling National Democratic Party of using its power to suppress voices critical of Mubarak's nearly three-decade rule. The ruling party has dismissed the accusations. CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In the aftermath of Egypt's parliamentary elections, the largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, has lodged a protest against what it claims were irregularities in the first round of voting. The group's parliamentary presence has been reduced to zero as a result of the election. The first round of voting took place earlier this month and was widely anticipated to be the most competitive polling day in the country for decades. However, the Muslim Brotherhood has accused the government of vote-buying, rigging, and tampering with ballot boxes. Despite these claims, the results have not been affected by any irregularities, according to an election official. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the irregularities did not change the outcome of the election. The second and final round of voting is set to take place next week, but concerns are growing over the credibility of the process. The United States has criticized the election, saying it lacked transparency and was not held in a free and fair manner. The Muslim Brotherhood has been a significant player in Egyptian politics since the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. However, this election has seen the group's parliamentary presence dwindle to zero. The group has been accused of terrorism and banned in Egypt since 2013, but it has continued to operate underground. The government has maintained that it is committed to free and fair elections and that the Muslim Brotherhood's accusations are baseless. However, many opposition parties and civil society groups have called for an independent investigation into the claims of irregularities. They argue that the government's credibility is at stake, and a transparent and fair election is essential for the country's stability and democracy. The election has been seen as a test of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's popularity, with many opposition groups calling for a boycott of the polls. However, voter turnout has been higher than expected, with many Egyptians turning out to cast their ballots. Despite concerns over the election's credibility, there is hope that the second round of voting will be conducted in a more transparent and fair manner. The United States and other international observers will be closely monitoring the process to ensure that it meets international standards.
