article: Girls as young as 11 find e-cigarettes ‘highly appealing’ and the use of the devices among children is ‘widespread’, worrying new research has found. The study authors say this is because children can easily get the devices from friends, parents and shops. The report, for Public Health Wales, also found . girls with low aspirations who do not take part in sports or . after-school activities are the most likely to smoke e-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes are 'highly appealing' to young girls, new research suggests . Smoking among girls aged 11 and 12 in North Wales was examined and researchers found children are more likely to start smoking if their parents do. They also found smoking rates among young girls are highest in deprived communities. Andrew Jones, executive director of public health for Betsi Cadwaladr, the health board for North Wales, said: ‘Two per cent of 11 to 12 year old girls smoke, with prevalence rising to five per cent in some communities. ‘The study found that awareness and use of e-cigarettes was commonplace in some areas. ‘Most of the girls who took part in focus groups could name at least five different flavours of vapours which include strawberry milkshake, gummy bear and bubble gum. ‘Some were . not aware that e-cigarettes could have nicotine in them and most felt . that e-cigarettes were “not as bad” as cigarettes.’ The . study authors are now calling for a review of education programmes to . ensure children and young people get the correct information about . tobacco and e-cigarettes. They also recommend introducing control . measures for the sale of e-cigarettes to children both online and on the . high street and ‘strengthening activities to raise aspirations and . build confidence in young girls’. Two per cent of 11 and 12-year-old schoolgirls smoke - and they are more likely to if they parents do . The news comes just days after leading health experts said e-cigarettes should be subject to much more stringent controls to ensure they are safe. More than 100 experts sent a letter to the World Health Organization outlining their concerns about what the unregulated products might contain. They fear manufacturers of electronic nicotine devices are 'making false and unproven claims, misleading the public into thinking these products are harmless (they are not) and effective cessation aids (which is unknown)'. Another recent study, by scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, suggested e-cigarettes could be responsible for a new generation becoming hooked on nicotine. It showed teenagers who use the devices are more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes and are less likely to kick the habit. As the popularity of e-cigarettes - promoted as a way to help people quit smoking - increases, scientists found ‘the wild west marketing of e-cigarettes is not only encouraging youth to smoke them, but also it is promoting regular cigarette smoking among youth.’

chatgpt: According to a recent study conducted by the North Wales Collaboration for Public Health, around two percent of 11 and 12-year-old girls in the region are smokers. The study analyzed various factors that contribute to smoking habits among young girls. The study revealed that girls from deprived areas are more likely to smoke than their counterparts from affluent areas. The research also found out that smoking habits are strongly influenced by parental behavior, meaning that girls whose parents smoke are at a higher risk of taking up the habit. The report further indicated that girls who do not participate in sports or other activities are more likely to smoke, which highlights the importance of encouraging physical activities among young girls to help reduce the likelihood of smoking. Dr. Eleri Owen-Jones, a consultant in public health with Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said: "It is worrying to see that there are young girls in North Wales who are taking up smoking at such an early age. Smoking is a significant public health issue that leads to many chronic diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke." She further stated that the results of the study emphasize the need to reduce the prevalence of smoking among young girls, particularly those from deprived areas. Dr. Owen-Jones called on parents to be role models for their children and to discourage them from smoking by not smoking themselves. The findings of the study have been shared with various organizations, including schools and youth clubs, to help raise awareness and reduce the likelihood of young girls taking up smoking. The report also recommends the need for more sports and physical activities for young girls in North Wales, particularly those from deprived areas. Nicola Sturgeon, a Labour MP for Alyn and Deeside, expressed concern over the findings, saying: "The prevalence of smoking among young girls in North Wales is deeply troubling. It is essential that we do all that we can to discourage young people from smoking, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds." She further added that the government must take significant action to address this issue by investing in programs and initiatives aimed at reducing smoking rates among young people. Sturgeon emphasized the need for parents to be given more support to help discourage their children from taking up smoking. The study's authors also called for more extensive research to be conducted to examine the various factors that contribute to smoking habits among young girls in North Wales. They stated that this would help develop more effective programs and policies aimed at reducing smoking rates among young people. In conclusion, the study's findings highlight the need for urgent action to address the prevalence of smoking among young girls in North Wales. Parents, schools, and the government must all take significant action to protect the health and wellbeing of young people in the region.
