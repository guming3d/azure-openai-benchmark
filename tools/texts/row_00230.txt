chatgpt: Basketball England has announced the formation of a licence review committee that will be tasked with considering all options, including a tender process. This announcement came as a surprise to the British Basketball League (BBL), which said it was "not advised of this release in advance". The committee will be responsible for reviewing the current licences granted to teams that play in the BBL and Women's British Basketball League (WBBL). It will also be tasked with making recommendations on whether or not to renew existing licences or issue new ones. According to a statement issued by Basketball England, the committee will take a "thorough and independent" approach to its review of the licences. The statement also noted that the committee's work will be conducted in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, including the BBL and WBBL. The announcement has raised concerns among some members of the BBL, who fear that the licence review could lead to an upheaval of the league. The BBL has expressed disappointment with the lack of prior consultation, particularly as it has been working on its own reform programme in recent months. In a statement, the BBL said it would be seeking further clarification from Basketball England on the implications of the licence review. The league also expressed the hope that the review would not undermine the progress that has been made in recent years in professional basketball in the UK. The announcement of the licence review comes at a time when the BBL is on the cusp of major expansion, with the addition of a new team, the London City Royals, in the coming season. The BBL has also been working to improve its finances and bring in new sponsors and investors. Overall, the announcement by Basketball England has been met with a mixture of surprise, confusion and concern among those involved in the world of British basketball. While the licence review may ultimately lead to positive changes, there are also fears that it could destabilise the sport at a crucial time. The coming months will be critical in determining the future direction of basketball in the UK.
