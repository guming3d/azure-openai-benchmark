Neymar's injury has left many Brazilian fans concerned about the team's chances of success in the tournament. The 22-year-old, who is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world, has been instrumental in Brazil's success so far. As he walked out of the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte following Brazil's win over Chile, Neymar was seen sporting bandages on his left knee. While the extent of the injury hasn't been revealed, it is clear that he is carrying some sort of injury.
