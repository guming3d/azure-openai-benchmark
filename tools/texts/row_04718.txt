Three studies found no evidence of any significant weight loss. The web advert said the black cropped leggings ‘have 'SlimTech' technology which is designed to accelerate fat loss’. Wearing them ‘reduces muscular tiredness’, ‘smooths and moisturises the skin, helping to reduce cellulite’, and ‘lifts, tones and moisturises’, it claimed. The friction caused when wearers move was said to break the microcapsules, releasing the slimming ingredients on to the skin. These include red algae, a Japanese shrub called sophora japonica, and copaiba, a stimulant derived from South American trees, which ‘have been proven to be effective in slimming, smoothing, toning and moisturising’.

chatgpt: Debenhams, the popular UK department store, is in hot water after their claim that 'Slimtech' leggings slim down wearers has been debunked by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA ruled in favor of the complainant, a consumer who purchased the leggings under the impression that they would help them lose weight. The consumer claimed that the product did not live up to the marketing claims. Debenhams advertised the leggings as containing a mineral that could help users lose weight. The retailer claimed that the leggings were tested by a reputable third-party research laboratory, which found that Slimtech leggings could speed up slimming by up to 18 percent. However, upon investigation, the ASA found no evidence to support these claims. The ASA's ruling found that the research provided by Debenhams was not conducted in a scientifically robust manner, and therefore was not reliable. The ASA stated that the evidence presented did not demonstrate that Slimtech leggings could aid weight loss. Debenhams was quick to respond to the ASA's findings, stating that they were disappointed by the ruling but accepted its decision. The company has since removed all marketing materials and claims related to Slimtech leggings from their website and stores. "This was a very disappointing outcome, as we have always been committed to providing our customers with products that are effective in aiding weight loss," a spokesperson for Debenhams said. "We will be reviewing our marketing practices and procedures to ensure that we comply with ASA guidelines in the future." This is not the first time that Debenhams has come under fire for making false marketing claims. In 2014, the retailer was criticized for advertising an anti-cellulite cream that did not live up to its claims. The ASA's ruling on Slimtech leggings reinforces the importance of truth in advertising. Consumers need to be able to trust the claims made by companies when they purchase products. It is essential that companies thoroughly test their products before making bold marketing claims, especially when it comes to health and weight loss. In conclusion, it is clear that Debenhams' claims about Slimtech leggings aiding weight loss were unsubstantiated. Consumers should be cautious when purchasing products that promise to aid weight loss and should always do their research before making a purchase.
