An area around the port of the French city of Marseille was evacuated after a German bomb dating back to the Second World War was discovered. Experts removed the explosive in a delicate operation to transfer it to a military base, where it was to be safely detonated. About 1,000 people were asked to leave an area around the port today as officials began the task of moving the device. Easy does it: An expert examines the bomb, which dates back to the Second Word War. The explosive was discovered by construction workers . Delicate operation: The explosive was taken to a military base and safely detonated . Boat traffic was also halted and access to several coastal roads was blocked to ensure safe and clear passage for the bomb disposal experts as they moved it to a military base to be detonated. The explosive was discovered in the city about a week ago, when construction workers accidentally pierced the bomb with their equipment. The bomb's ignition system no longer works but the sheer amount of explosives - 1,400 pounds - made it dangerous, according to the regional government. It had apparently been buried by German soldiers, who had planned to destroy the city's port, as they retreated near the end of the war.

chatgpt: Construction workers in Plymouth, United Kingdom, stumbled upon an explosive that had been hidden by German forces during World War II. The bomb, which had been buried as a booby trap towards the end of the war, was accidentally pierced by the workers while using their equipment.  Local authorities immediately evacuated approximately 1,000 people from the surrounding area while the bomb was being dealt with. The port authorities closed the port while the Royal Navy’s bomb squad carefully removed the explosive from the site.  Officials have confirmed that the bomb was safely transported to a military base to be detonated. The Royal Navy’s bomb disposal experts are known for their expertise in safely removing dangerous explosives from public areas. It is believed that the explosive was a Delayed Action Bomb (DAB), which was designed to be detonated days or even weeks after it was deployed by German forces. These types of bombs were often placed in areas where Allied forces would be expected to congregate or where important infrastructure lay. This is not the first time that explosive devices from World War II have been discovered in Plymouth. In 2020, a 1,000lb bomb was found at a construction site near the University of Plymouth. In 2019, another DAB was found near a city center car park. The discovery of explosives from World War II is a reminder of the enduring legacy of the conflict. Despite the passage of time, these devices can still pose a significant threat to public safety. The swift actions of the Royal Navy’s bomb disposal experts have ensured that the latest discovery was dealt with safely and efficiently. It is a testament to the expertise and professionalism of the UK’s armed forces.
