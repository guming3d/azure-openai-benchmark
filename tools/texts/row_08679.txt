Iran has decided to spare the life of a convicted drug trafficker who survived a hanging, media reports on Wednesday quoted Justice Minister Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi as saying. The reports follow calls from within Iran and appeals from international rights groups against the man found alive in a morgue facing execution for a second time. 'The convict who survived (the death penalty) will not be executed again,' Pour-Mohammadi said late Tuesday in remarks reported by the official IRNA news agency. 'After putting much effort to prevent the second execution of this convict, we have received a positive response,' he said without elaborating.

chatgpt: A startling discovery has been made in the aftermath of a recent execution in Iran. The execution of a 37-year-old man in Bojnourd prison had been carried out and he was pronounced dead after 12 minutes. However, the next day, staff at the morgue were shocked to discover that the supposedly deceased man was still alive. The man, whose name has not been released, had been sentenced to death by the Iranian regime on charges of drug-related crimes. He was scheduled to be executed by hanging on Wednesday, May 12th. The execution was carried out as planned, and after 12 minutes, he was certified dead and taken to the morgue. However, the following day, staff at the morgue were reportedly conducting a routine check when they noticed the man was still breathing. They immediately alerted prison authorities, who rushed the man to a nearby hospital for emergency medical treatment. The man's current condition is unknown, and authorities have not released any further information on the incident. The shocking discovery has raised serious questions about the use of the death penalty in Iran and the potential for mistakes to be made during executions. Amnesty International has condemned the execution, stating that it is a violation of human rights and that Iran must immediately halt all executions. The organization has long campaigned against the use of the death penalty in Iran, which is one of the world's leading executioners. In recent years, the Iranian regime has come under increasing international pressure over its use of the death penalty, particularly in cases involving drug offenses. Many human rights groups argue that the use of the death penalty for drug-related offenses is an extreme measure that fails to address the root causes of drug addiction and trafficking. The Iranian regime, however, maintains that the death penalty is necessary to combat the country's drug problem, which is said to be one of the biggest in the world. According to official figures, around 4,000 people are executed in Iran every year, with many more on death row. The case of the man who was mistakenly pronounced dead and taken to the morgue has once again highlighted the dangers of using the death penalty, particularly in countries with poor human rights records. While Iran may see the death penalty as a necessary tool in the fight against crime, the risks of errors and miscarriages of justice are clearly too high to be ignored. It is hoped that this incident will lead to a renewed debate on the use of the death penalty, not just in Iran, but around the world. As human rights organizations continue to speak out against the practice, it is essential that governments and lawmakers take action to ensure that justice is served without resorting to methods that violate basic human rights.
