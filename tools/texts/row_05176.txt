The competition, which was initiated in Las Vegas 12 years ago, has grown in popularity over the years and now takes place in over 50 countries worldwide. The competition saw extravagant and intricate designs, with subaquatic scenes and Geisha girls atop sharp and lengthy false nails. The artists, who had carefully crafted their designs over several weeks or even months, presented their immaculate work under the watchful eyes of a panel of judges. Some of the entries included bejewelled designs, floral patterns, and even mini portraits of famous personalities. The contestants themselves donned equally flamboyant outfits, complementing their extravagant nail designs. The event felt like a vibrant and colourful carnival of beauty, art and style. "I have been participating in this competition for the last five years," said one artist. "It is a wonderful opportunity for us to showcase our creativity, and every year the competition gets tougher as the level of competition keeps increasing. But there's nothing more satisfying than walking away with the top prize." The judges, who were also from different parts of the world, had a tough time selecting the winners from among so many talented artists. "We were amazed by the level of creativity and attention to detail that we saw in these designs," said one judge. "It was inspiring, to say the least." After a long and gruelling evaluation process, the winners were finally announced. The top prize went to an artist who had created a stunning and intricate design featuring a miniature garden with a fountain and a variety of flowers. Her incredible attention to detail and use of vibrant colours won her the top prize, along with plaudits from the judges. "This competition is a wonderful platform for us artists to showcase our talents to the world," said the winning artist. "I'm proud to have won the top prize, and I hope this recognition will help me further my career in this field."
