chatgpt: Legendary cyclist Lance Armstrong has been named in the Astana squad for the upcoming Tour de France. Armstrong, who is bidding for an unprecedented eighth victory in the world's most famous cycling race, will be part of a formidable lineup assembled by the Kazakh team. Despite a decade-long hiatus, the American continues to be one of the most recognizable names in the sport. However, Armstrong faces stiff competition this year from the likes of Alberto Contador. The 2007 Tour de France champion is widely regarded as the race favorite, having won the grueling event twice before. The Spanish rider will undoubtedly be one to watch as the peloton navigates the treacherous, mountainous passes of the French Alps and Pyrenees. Unfortunately, not all riders have been welcomed with open arms at this year's Tour de France. Belgian cyclist Tom Boonen has been barred from the competition after testing positive for cocaine. The incident marks yet another controversy for the Quick-Step Floors team, which has struggled to maintain a clean image in recent years. Boonen, a former world champion and winner of numerous classic races, had been hoping to add a Tour de France victory to his impressive resume. Despite the absence of Boonen, the Tour de France promises to be as thrilling as ever. With Armstrong and Contador leading the charge, fans can expect a fierce battle for the coveted yellow jersey. The Astana team will also be bolstered by the likes of Jakob Fuglsang, who won the recent Critérium du Dauphiné, and Fabio Aru, a promising young rider with a knack for climbing. As always, the Tour de France is sure to be a test of both endurance and skill for the world's top cyclists. With Armstrong's legacy on the line, Contador looking to cement his own place in the history books, and a host of other talented riders vying for glory, this year's race promises to be one for the ages. Cycling enthusiasts around the world will be eagerly watching as the peloton sets off on this epic journey across the French countryside.
