article: These new computer-generated images put into context the huge scale of the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) has released a series of powerful posters illustrating the sheer size of the warships. The computer-generated images show the warships dwarfing some of the country's most recognisable landmarks. Scroll down for video . Sheer scale: This computer-generated image puts into context the huge size of the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy . Another notable poster is of the under-construction HMS Queen Elizabeth berthed alongside in Portsmouth, Hants. The ACA is a consortium of defence companies behind the construction of Portsmouth's newest carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. Ian Booth, programme director of the ACA, said: 'These posters depict the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers in front of the Houses of Parliament and in Portsmouth. 'They're stunning images and show that two really spectacular ships can be expected once construction is complete.' A computer-generated image released last year showed how HMS Queen Elizabeth would look alongside at Portsmouth Naval Base. The images reveal the length of the ship is the equivalent of 28 London buses and is almost three times the size of Buckingham Palace. Around 80,000 tonnes of steel will be used for the two ships, three times that used in Wembley Stadium . Naval might: A computer generated image showing the size of the new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier if it was in Portsmouth . Massive: This comparison of the new aircraft carrier shows it size in comparison to a London bus, Buckingham Palace and a Type 45 destroyer . The carriers are 280m in length, 65,000 tonnes and capable of transporting 40 aircraft - twice the capacity of HMS Illustrious. They are being constructed at shipyards around the country and taken for assembly at Rosyth in Scotland. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance is formed of BAE Systems, Babcock, Thales and the Ministry of Defence. Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said: 'This is superb and great news - it's going to benefit the city and the country on many different levels. 'I can't wait to see the work being completed and then seeing these ships in Portsmouth.'

chatgpt: Digital images released by the Royal Navy have revealed the largest warships ever to be built, with the ability to carry up to 65,000 tonnes and transport 40 aircraft. The HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales stand at a towering 280 metres long, longer than three football pitches. These impressive carriers are set to become the flagship vessels of the British Navy, expanding the nation's military capability significantly. Constructed with a total of 65,000 tonnes of steel, equivalent to the weight of nearly 10,000 elephants, these behemoth ships will be powered by four gas turbines and two diesel engines. The carriers are able to travel at speeds of up to 25 knots, making them some of the fastest ships in the British Navy's fleet. The vessels will have the capability to house and launch a strike force of F-35B stealth fighter jets, Merlin helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales will be able to take on a range of missions, from humanitarian operations to high-intensity warfare. These developments will see the Royal Navy's ship-to-ship combat, amphibious assault, and carrier strike capabilities increase significantly. It's not only the sheer size and power of these vessels that sets them apart from other naval ships, but their technological capabilities are also groundbreaking. The HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales have an Integrated Command System, which enhances their capabilities as a command and control platform. This system also provides a seamless flow of information, allowing the crew to better respond to complex situations. The ships also have advanced self-protection systems, which not only detect incoming threats but also take action in response. This feature is essential given the evolving nature of modern naval warfare. The HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales were built in six sections at various shipyards around the United Kingdom, including Glasgow, Portsmouth, and Barrow. The ships are part of a Â£6.2 billion project, and their delivery marks a significant milestone in the future of British naval warfare. These new carriers will be a key component in projecting Britain's military power across the globe, and with their cutting-edge technology, enhanced firepower, and unparalleled size, they will undoubtedly be among the most significant and impressive vessels in the world. In an era where national security is at the forefront of global issues, the Royal Navy's acquisition of these supercarriers ensures that Britain is well-equipped to face any challenges and maintain its position at the forefront of modern naval warfare.
