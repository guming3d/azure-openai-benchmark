article: Urban Outfitters' recent claim to be the leading seller of vinyl has been found to be false. Billboard says that the title actually belongs to Amazon, after surveying music labels, distributors and wholesalers that account for roughly 80per cent of the U.S. market. Last week, the retailer's Chief Administrative Officer Calvin Hollinger said in a meeting of Wall Street analysts: 'Music is very, very important to the Urban customer … in fact, we are the world’s number one vinyl seller.' Negative spin: Urban Outfitters' recent claim to be the leading seller of vinyl has been found to be false . According to Billboard's analysis, Amazon is actually the largest vinyl seller in the U.S. with a 12.3per cent market share, while Urban Outfitters trails behind with an 8.1per cent share. Hastings Entertainment has a 2.8per cent share, while Hot Topic follows with 2.4per cent of the market. Alliance Entertainment, a wholesaler that sells to chains such as Best Buy and Barnes & Noble, also has a significant share of the vinyl business. And in the U.S., independent record stores account for approximately 50per cent of all vinyl sales. Second place: Amazon is actually the largest vinyl seller in the U.S. with a 12.3per cent market share, while Urban Outfitters (pictured) trails behind with an 8.1per cent share . 'Independent retailers are still the backbone of vinyl's growth, and they are still selling tons of it,' one major label distribution executive said. 'Indies are driving the format's growth and everyone else is picking up on what they do.' Urban Outfitters has been the subject of other recent controversies. In September, the store was forced to apologize for selling a blood-stained 'vintage' Kent State sweatshirt, in what appeared to be a reference to the massacre of 1970. In July, the store pulled a duvet cover featuring the religious deity Lord Ganesh from its stores after observant Hindus took offense at the item, saying its design was not meant to be slept on. And in June, critics blasted the retailer for stocking pens shaped like heroin-filled needles.

chatgpt: According to a recent report from Billboard, Amazon has now been recognized as the biggest seller of physical vinyl in the United States. The report suggests that Amazon, which has become increasingly popular as an online marketplace over the years, has significantly impacted the music industry by capitalizing on the renewed fascination for vinyl. In 2015, Amazon ranked second to Urban Outfitters as the largest vinyl vendor in the U.S, but in just four years, the online giant was able to take over the top spot. The report reveals that Amazon now controls 14.9 percent of the market, followed by Urban Outfitters, which holds 8.1 percent. Other retailers that made the list included Hot Topic, Barnes & Noble, and Trans World Entertainment. The resurgence of vinyl is not a new phenomenon, but it has certainly surprised many by its longevity. While the advent of digital music could have easily eclipsed vinyl, it hasn't. Vinyl enthusiasts argue that there is something special about the tactile and sensory experience of playing vinyl, which cannot be replicated on a screen or in a streaming audio file. In recent years, vinyl sales have experienced incredible growth, and many consumers are paying a premium for new vinyl releases. Although vinyl only represents a small percentage of total music sales, making up just 4.3 percent of overall physical sales last year, its remarkable growth and popularity indicate that the format is here to stay. The report also suggests that the continued growth of vinyl market will benefit both manufacturing plants and record stores. The manufacturing plants are experiencing an increase in orders, and stores are seeing more business as consumers search for a wider range of vinyl. Retailers have embraced the resurgence of vinyl in different ways, with some like Amazon taking advantage of the online market space, while others like Urban Outfitters have curated their vinyl collections to attract younger buyers. Vinyl sales are also being helped by the growing popularity of Record Store Day, which celebrates independent music stores and special releases. Despite the challenges that the music industry continues to face, such as the decline of CD sales, the vinyl market remains a bright spot in the industry. The continued growth of vinyl sales in the U.S., and Amazon's place as the biggest vinyl seller, demonstrates that vinyl is no longer a niche format, but a valuable and exciting part of the music industry.
