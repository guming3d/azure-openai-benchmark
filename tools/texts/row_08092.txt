article: A dental expert has claimed that the effects of gum disease have been exaggerated to sell mouthwash and expensive toothbrushes. Paul Batchelor, a senior lecturer at University College London's dental public health unit, has insisted that gum disease - or periodontitis - is a normal part of ageing and bleeding when you brush does not mean your teeth will fall out. He explained that brushing regularly with a fluoride toothpaste is the best method of protecting your teeth from decay - a more serious problem. Scroll down for video . Dental expert Paul Batchelor says gum disease is a normal part of ageing and bleeding gums can be treated by brushing properly with a fluoride toothpaste . In the British Dental Journal, he argued that pricey scales and polishes offered by dentists to treat gum disease will do little if people do not look after their teeth on a regular basis. Mr Batchelor told The Times: 'It's an overstated problem. If you don't brush your teeth you will tend to get some inflammation and bleeding, but that will not have the impact that has been suggested. 'To say it will end with all your teeth falling out if you don't do something about it, that's over-egging the pudding. 'You're creating a problem and then people will buy something.' He explained only 10% of people need treatment for gum-related problems and dentists should focus on smokers and those with a poor diet. He added that people should not ignore bleeding gums because they indicate poor brushing which can then lead to tooth decay. Mr Batchelor says the problem of gum disease is 'overstated' to sell pricey products, like mouthwash and electrical toothbrushes. 'You're creating a problem and then people will buy something' But Francis Hughes, Professor of Periodontology, Kings College London, said gum disease can be treated by dental professionals to prevent long term tooth loss in more severe cases. He said: 'We are beginning to have a much better understanding of the impacts of periodontitis. 'We learn that periodontitis is not a silent disease, but has significant impacts on patients' quality of life, not just in terms of tooth loss, but also in terms of function, comfort, aesthetics and self esteem.' He added: 'It is clear that we as dental professionals can genuinely do something about the condition. 'Time and time again periodontal treatment has been shown to be highly effective in preventing long-term tooth loss and reversing many of the condition's other adverse effects.'

chatgpt: LONDON - A dental expert in the UK, Paul Batchelor, has claimed that gum disease is a normal part of ageing, but emphasized that brushing regularly with fluoride toothpaste can solve the problem. According to Batchelor, expensive scales and polishes will do little if people do not look after their teeth. Batchelor made the statements while responding to a debate on whether scales and polishes should be standard on the NHS. He argued that patients can avoid gum problems by maintaining good oral hygiene rather than regular expensive dental visits. He explained that teeth should be brushed twice daily with fluoride toothpaste and also used correctly to remove plaque. Batchelor urged dental professionals and patients to work together to prevent dental problems, rather than always attempting to treat them afterward. He said, “We need to empower patients to take charge of their own oral health and not rely on constant dental intervention. After all, prevention is better than cure.” Gum disease is a common issue faced by people of all ages across the world. The condition often leads to bleeding gums and tooth loss, and it has a bigger impact on older people. Many believe that regular trips to the dentist for costly scales and polishes are the solution to gum disease; however, according to Batchelor, this is not the entire solution. He emphasized that prevention is key to maintaining healthy teeth and gums. Brushing teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste and using correct technique is the perfect remedy to fight against gum problems. Many people do not brush their teeth properly, which leads to plaque build-up, cavities, and gum problems. Batchelor advised that dental professionals should provide advice to patients on the proper technique for brushing and the importance of regular brushing. Additionally, he recommended that people should avoid smoking, limit alcohol and sugar intake, and maintain a balanced diet for good oral health. Batchelor asserted that the NHS should invest more money in educating people about how to maintain their oral health. More resources should be allocated to providing information on how to brush teeth correctly, creating awareness on preventive dental measures, and encouraging good oral health habits. In conclusion, the dental expert's statements have crucial implications for dental professionals and their patients. Regular expensive scales and polishes are not the entire solution for gum disease. Instead, prevention in the form of good oral hygiene, brushing with fluoride toothpaste, and maintaining a balanced diet is key to maintaining healthy teeth and gums. It is critical to educate people on the importance of these factors to enhance their oral health and prevent dental problems.
