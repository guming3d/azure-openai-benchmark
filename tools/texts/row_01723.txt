article: (CNN) -- Police in the Seychelles investigating the deaths of two former U.S. Navy SEALs have video surveillance showing the private security guards enjoying a night out before the men were found dead in a cabin of the Maersk Alabama, a source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN. The video led police to two women -- who, the source says, authorities believe to be prostitutes -- seen with the American security guards during the evening. Those women reportedly have identified a location where they say the two men purchased heroin. Video from several surveillance cameras show the security guards in a restaurant and a casino and on a public street in the Seychelles at night while the Maersk Alabama was in port. As CNN reported last week, autopsy results indicate the Americans found dead on the container ship on February 18 died of respiratory failure, coupled with suspected heart attacks. Traces of narcotics and hypodermic needles found with the bodies suggested the deaths resulted from drug overdoses, Seychelles authorities said. Further forensic analysis will be carried out to establish if the two men, 44-year-old Jeffrey Reynolds and 43-year-old Mark Kennedy, had consumed a substance that may have caused their deaths. "The police preliminary investigation report includes suspicion of drug use, as indicated by the presence of a syringe and traces of heroin which were found in the cabin," according to police. Toxicology results are not expected for another three weeks, but police spokesperson Jean Toussaint says a criminal investigation continues, and "solid evidence could lead to formal arrests in the deaths." Toussaint confirmed to CNN that the women seen with the men on surveillance video are cooperating with police, but would not give details on the investigation. The two men worked for Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm. Trident Group President Tom Rothrauff said both were former Navy SEALs. The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was the target of an attempted hijacking in the pirate-infested waters off East Africa in 2009, an incident that inspired the 2013 film "Captain Phillips." The shipping giant Maersk, which hired the Trident Group to guard its ships, said last week that Trident would be conducting random drug tests of its employees. "Based on our experience with the contractor, this is an isolated incident," Maersk said. But it said new drug tests would start immediately and the company's shore leave policy was under review. Police said the ship arrived on February 16 in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with a 24-man crew and had been expected to leave two days later. The bodies were found February 18 by a colleague who had gone to check in with one of the men in a cabin, Seychelles police said. The Maersk Alabama has since left the Seychelles capital of Port Victoria.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck aboard the Maersk Alabama on February 18, as two American crew members were found dead on the ship. According to authorities, traces of narcotics and hypodermic needles were discovered with the bodies, indicating possible drug use. Sources revealed that surveillance footage showed the two men enjoying a night out after the ship docked. The footage captured the two men and two women spending time together before the men returned to their quarters on the ship. Reports suggest that the two women on the footage identified a location where the drugs were purchased. Authorities are investigating the source of the narcotics and whether the men had any previous history of drug use. The Maersk Alabama, which gained notoriety after a 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates, has been at the center of several incidents in recent years. However, this latest tragedy has left the crew and families of the deceased in shock. Maersk has released a statement expressing their condolences and confirming that an investigation is underway. The company has stated that they take the safety and well-being of their crew members seriously and will be providing support to those affected by this tragedy. The incident has also sparked discussions about the prevalence of drug use within the shipping industry. The long hours and isolation can be challenging for many crew members, leading some to turn to substances to cope with the stress. Several organizations, including the Maritime Labour Convention and the International Transport Workersâ€™ Federation, have called for increased support and resources for crew members struggling with addiction. These groups have also urged shipping companies to prioritize crew welfare and mental health in their policies. The tragedy onboard the Maersk Alabama serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers faced by crew members and the urgent need for greater support and resources for those struggling with addiction. As the investigation continues, authorities and the shipping industry must work together to address this critical issue and prevent further losses of life at sea.
