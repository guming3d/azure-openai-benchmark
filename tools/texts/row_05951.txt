The footage, which was posted on Wednesday, shows two men speaking Arabic while Fijian troops sit cross-legged behind them.

Scroll down for video . It's been confirmed the 45 Fijian soldiers are 'safe and alive' whilst being held by Nusra Front terrorists . A Fijian U.N. peacekeeper, among the 45 held captive in Syria, has been identified as Captain Savenaca Rabuka . Most of the 15-minute video is films the two men speaking Arabic but near the end, a Fijian soldier says the troops have been treated well by the Nusra Front. 'We're all safe and alive,' he said. 'I would like to assure you that we have not been harmed in any way. 'I deeply understand with the limited resources that they have [the Nusra Front], they have provided the best for us and we really appreciate it.' Fijian government spokeswoman Sharon Smith-Johns said the soldiers shown in the video are those being held by the Nusra Front. She identified the soldier who speaks as Captain Savenaca Rabuka. At the beginning of the video, the men speaking in Arabic say that God had helped the Nusra Front soldiers and other fighters 'liberate' the Quneitra border crossing which marks the area between Syrian-controlled territory and the Israeli part of the Golan Heights. The video surfaced a day after Fiji may have jumped the gun by announcing that the peacekeepers would soon be released. Two men speak Arabic for the majority of a recently released 15 minute YouTube video . At a Wednesday morning news conference in Suva, Fiji's military chief said they had been told by U.N. headquarters in New York that the Nusra Front had agreed to release the men later this week without any conditions or demands. The South Pacific nation later tried to retract the comments, but by then they had been reported around the world. It is unlikely Fiji would have been given the green light to release any specific information by the U.N., which typically doesn't comment on sensitive captive situations until they are resolved. The Nusra Front had earlier listed three demands for releasing the Fijian peacekeepers it took captive August 28. The group had demanded to be taken off the U.N. terrorist list, wanted humanitarian aid delivered to parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, and wanted compensation for three of its fighters it says were killed in a shootout with U.N. officers.

chatgpt: In a recent development, a Fijian soldier has claimed that their captivity in Syria will soon come to an end. The soldier revealed that they were informed of their impending release on Tuesday. This news comes after a video was uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday, showing the 45 UN peacekeepers, accompanied by two Arabic men, in the background. The 45 troops have been held captive by Nusra Front terrorists in Syria since August 28. The announcement of their release has brought a ray of hope for their families and colleagues who have been anxiously waiting for their safe return. The identity of the two Arabic men in the video is yet to be established. However, their presence in the captivity site has raised alarm bells among the authorities. The United Nations and the Fijian government have been working tirelessly to secure the release of their troops and have expressed concern over the safety and well-being of the captured peacekeepers. The Fijian government has been in contact with the captors and has been trying to negotiate their release. However, the situation has been complicated due to the ongoing conflict in Syria and the conflicting interests of various factions involved in the conflict. The release of the Fijian peacekeepers has been a long-standing demand of the international community. The UN has condemned their captivity and has called for their immediate release. The Fijian troops were deployed to the Golan Heights in Syria as part of a UN peacekeeping mission. The Golan Heights is a disputed region between Israel and Syria and has been a hotbed of conflict for several years. The UN peacekeeping force was deployed to the region to monitor the ceasefire between Israel and Syria. However, in recent years, the region has become increasingly dangerous, with several attacks carried out against the UN peacekeepers. The Fijian peacekeepers were abducted while they were on patrol in the Golan Heights. Their captors, the Nusra Front terrorists, have demanded a ransom and the release of their imprisoned fighters in exchange for the release of the peacekeepers. The captivity of the 45 peacekeepers has sent shockwaves across the international community. The Fijian government has urged the UN and other international organizations to help secure the release of their troops. The situation in Syria remains tense, and the release of the Fijian peacekeepers will be a positive step towards ensuring peace in the region. In conclusion, the news of the imminent release of the 45 Fijian peacekeepers has brought hope to their families and colleagues. The exact timeline of their release is yet to be determined, but the announcements made by their captors indicate that their release is imminent. The UN and the Fijian government have been working hard to secure their release, and this news is a positive development towards ensuring peace in the region.
