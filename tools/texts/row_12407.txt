article: Confidence is running high in the England camp and Chris Robshaw believes his side have developed the composure to lose their ‘nearly men’ tag and finally challenge for the elusive Grand Slam. England have finished second in every RBS 6 Nations since Stuart Lancaster took over in 2012, but the Red Rose side are now the bookies’ favourites to win the championship after their opening-round victory over Wales. Robshaw’s side trailed 10-0 after just eight minutes at the Millennium Stadium, but the 28-year-old skipper believes previous heartbreaks ensured there was no panic in the face of adversity — contrasting Friday’s performance to the 30-3 defeat in 2013.

The good thing was that no-one went off script. It was still reasonably early in the game and the guys stuck to doing their jobs. ‘We had a great win, but it’s a start to the campaign for us and that’s all. It’s about how we back it up because we’ve had some great wins in this tournament but unfortunately we haven’t picked anything up. We’ve got a triple crown, but the big prize at the end has eluded us three times. That’s our main objective.’ Robshaw led England to victory in the Six Nations opener against Wales at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff .

They will have nothing to lose.’

chatgpt: England has won its Six Nations opener against Wales at the Millennium Stadium, with a final score of 21-16. The victory puts England, captained by Chris Robshaw, in a strong position to win the Grand Slam, a feat they have not achieved since 2003. England's performance was not without its flaws, however. The team struggled in the first half of the match, conceding a try to Wales within the first few minutes. This early setback did not deter the team, though, and they fought back to take the lead, thanks to tries from Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson. Wales continued to press England throughout the match, and it was not until the final whistle that England was able to secure the win. This victory is a promising start to the tournament for England, and has put the team in a strong position to win the Six Nations. Captain Chris Robshaw is now setting his sights on winning the elusive Grand Slam, a feat that has eluded England for almost 20 years. Speaking after the match, Robshaw said: "It's a great start for us, but we know we've got a long way to go. We want to win the Grand Slam, and that's what we'll be aiming for in every game." England now face Italy in their second game of the tournament on Saturday. Italy are not expected to provide a significant challenge for the English team, but coach Eddie Jones has warned against complacency. "We're not taking anything for granted," Jones said. "Italy are a good side, and they will be looking to cause an upset. We'll need to be focused and disciplined if we want to come away with another win." Despite the challenges ahead, England fans are optimistic that their team has what it takes to win the Six Nations and the Grand Slam. The team's victory over Wales has given them a strong start to the tournament, and has demonstrated the team's resilience and determination in the face of adversity. As the Six Nations continues, all eyes will be on the England team to see if they can maintain their winning streak and secure the Grand Slam. With the likes of Chris Robshaw and Owen Farrell leading the charge, England fans are hoping that this year will finally be the year that their team takes home the coveted title.
