Hailey's mother posted it to Facebook, where it was seen by another user and shared on Reddit. 'I . make poor choices with social media,' the sign reads. 'As punishment, I am selling my . iPod and will be donating the money to the Charity Beat Bullying... Because bullying is wrong.' After the image was shared on reddit last week, numerous commenters accused Hailey's mother, Cara Schneider, of using her own bullying tactics against her daughter. Shamed: A mother snapped this picture of her teenage daughter after she allegedly caught her bullying online. The photo has since gone viral, but some commenters have accused the mother of being the bully . 'Humiliating your child to teach her not to humiliate other children? Gee, I wonder where she gets it!' one wrote. 'This is terrible parenting,' another added. 'It's things like this that make kids hate their parents. This will only make her behave worse out of spite.' But Schneider has defended her actions and said she does not regret posting the photograph as she wants her daughter to act appropriately towards others, the Examiner reported. She explained that the photo was just the latest way to discipline her daughter following a long line of other methods, including grounding her and making her carry out manual labor. She added that the photograph was posted on a Facebook page for a local yard yard sale so that the iPod could be sold, and that she had no intention of other people posting it elsewhere; she had shared it on Facebook before another user posted it to the reddit page without her knowledge. No regrets: The girl's mother, Cara Schneider, right, said she does not regret posting the picture on a Facebook group for a yard sale because she wants her daughter to act appropriately towards others . 'I'm not worried about the negative that has been said about her punishment,' she wrote on her Facebook page. 'I am her mother and I did what I thought was best given the circumstances. I've tried other punishments, and this fit the crime. I don't regret a thing.' Other reddit users supported her parenting choices. 'This makes me happy, because so often people only get caught after it's far too late to help the victims,' one wrote. 'Brava, mom. Brava.' She's not the first parent to shame their teenager publicly. Last year, a dad made his 15-year-old daughter wear a t-shirt showing his face and the message 'Try Me!!' to school after she disobeyed him over curfews.

chatgpt: A North Carolina mother recently made headlines after she imposed a unique form of punishment on her teenage daughter for making poor choices with social media. The mother, whose identity has not been disclosed, snapped a now-viral photo of her daughter holding up a sign that read, "I make poor choices with social media."  According to reports, the mother was fed up with her daughter's behavior on social media and decided to take matters into her own hands. As a form of punishment, the mother forced her daughter to sell her iPod and donate the money to an anti-bullying charity.  The mother posted the image of her daughter with the sign on Facebook, where it quickly gained attention from users across the platform. However, it wasn't until a user shared the image on Reddit that the story gained national attention.  Many commenters accused the mother of bullying her daughter and publicly shaming her. However, the mother stood by her decision and explained that she wanted her daughter to understand the gravity of her actions on social media.  "I love my daughter more than anything in the world, and I only want what's best for her," the mother said. "I want her to understand that her actions online have real-world consequences and that she needs to think before she posts."  The mother's decision to publicly shame her daughter has sparked a larger conversation about the role of social media in today's society. Many parents have weighed in on the matter, with some applauding the mother for taking a firm stance on her daughter's behavior and others expressing concern over the potential effects of public humiliation on a child's mental health.  Child psychologists have warned against using public shaming as a form of discipline, citing the potential for long-term emotional damage. "Public shaming can be incredibly harmful to a child's self-esteem and sense of self-worth," said Dr. Samantha Smith, a child psychologist. "It's important for parents to find other ways to discipline their children that don't involve public humiliation."  Despite the backlash, the mother says that she stands by her decision and hopes that her daughter learns a valuable lesson from the experience. "I know that what I did was controversial, but I stand by it," she said. "As a parent, it's my job to teach my child right from wrong, and I hope that this experience helps her make better choices in the future."  The incident highlights the growing struggle that parents face in navigating their children's behavior on social media. With more and more young people experiencing cyberbullying and other negative effects of social media, it's important for parents to remain vigilant and proactive in teaching their children about responsible online behavior.  As for the mother and daughter in question, they say that they are working on repairing their relationship and moving forward from the incident. "We've had some difficult conversations, but we're both committed to learning and growing from this experience," the mother said. "At the end of the day, I just want my daughter to be happy, healthy, and safe."
