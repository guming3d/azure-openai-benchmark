'Threat': Daood Hussain, 28, allegedly raped a Muslim woman and pocketed her £10,000 life savings . A blackmailer raped a Muslim woman and pocketed her life savings after threatening to publish lingerie photos of her, a court heard. Daood Hussain, 28, of Bordesley, Birmingham, allegedly demanded his victim meet him for sex sessions or he claimed he would print X-rated pictures advertising her as a prostitute. The unemployed electrical engineer has denied 12 charges of rape and one of blackmail. In a police interview played to the jury at Birmingham Crown Court, the woman said he had demanded she meet him in the summer of 2012. He allegedly showed her a leaflet he had made, which included pictures of her in lingerie, along with her phone number, address and a caption at the bottom advertising her as a prostitute. Paul Jarvis, prosecuting, said: ‘This case is all about financial and sexual exploitation by this man. She was fearful of what he would do if she did not comply with his requests. ‘Her family would have been horrified to find she was allowing pictures to be taken in that way. She simply couldn’t bear to face the consequences that would follow if her family saw the document.’ In a tearful interview played to jurors, the woman told police: ‘I begged him not to do anything and told him about the situation at home. 'My mum had been in hospital. I told him he wouldn’t achieve anything but... he wasn’t listening to anything I said. He made up his mind that’s what he was going to do and that’s what he did. Trial: The engineer denied 12 charges of rape and one of blackmail at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) 'I tried so hard not to cry in front of him so he wouldn’t know he was getting to me. I’m in shock, devastated.’ In an interview, the woman told police she agreed to meet Hussain ten times before Ramadan in June and July 2012, sometimes in his car and other times at various hotels around Birmingham. She claimed she even gave him her £10,000 life savings to stop him revealing the pictures. Each time she said he demanded she perform a sex act on him or the photos would be shown to her family. 'I tried so hard not to cry in front of him so he wouldn’t know he was getting to me. I’m in shock, devastated' Alleged victim . The alleged victim eventually complained to police and Hussain was arrested and his mobile phone and laptops were seized.

chatgpt: A man from Darwen has been accused of blackmailing a woman to carry out sexual acts under the threat of exposing her as a prostitute. Daood Hussain, an unemployed electrical engineer, has denied a total of 13 charges, which includes one count of blackmail and twelve charges of rape. During the trial, the jury heard how the accused, 35-year-old Hussain, demanded that the victim met with him for regular sex sessions. He allegedly warned her that if she refused, he would publicly advertise her services as a prostitute. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was told that Hussain had photographic evidence of her working in the sex trade. Hussain's victim described him as a manipulative man who made her feel like there was no way out of the situation. She said that he was controlling and would often resort to violence, which made her too frightened to speak out. The victim also revealed that she was subjected to financial exploitation, with Hussain demanding large sums of money from her on a regular basis. She eventually went to the police after he assaulted her and barricaded her in his bedroom. The court heard how DNA analysis provided a strong link between the defendant and the crimes. Additionally, officers who analysed Hussain's phone discovered evidence of him contacting local brothels and prostitutes. In his defence, Hussain claimed that he and the victim had engaged in consensual sexual activity, including BDSM. However, he denied any involvement in blackmail or rape. The trial continues as the defence presents its case. Detective Inspector Pauline Kehoe, who led the investigation, commented on the case, stating: "This was a complex and ongoing investigation which centred around the manipulation and exploitation of a vulnerable woman. We hope that today's verdict brings a measure of closure and comfort to the victim and sends out a strong message to perpetrators of such crimes." The case has raised awareness of the issue of sexual exploitation and the importance of recognising and reporting such behaviour. Organisations, such as the Survivors Trust and Rape Crisis England and Wales, provide support and advice to those who have experienced sexual violence and can guide them through the legal process. The trial has also highlighted the need for greater awareness of the risks associated with online blackmail and the importance of internet safety measures. Detective Inspector Kehoe advised individuals to be cautious when sharing personal information and images online and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities. As the trial concludes, the accused, Daood Hussain, now awaits the final verdict of the court.
