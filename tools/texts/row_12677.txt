article: (CNN) -- A Nevada man accused of viewing pornography and fondling himself aboard a Southwest flight was arrested, federal authorities announced Monday. Daniel Drinan, 63, was taken into custody Saturday night at Denver International Airport on charges of committing lewd, indecent or obscene acts in public aboard an aircraft, the U.S. Justice Department said Monday in a news release. Drinan appeared Monday in a Denver court, where he was advised of his rights and appointed an attorney, said Justice Department spokesman Jeffrey Dorschner. Federal prosecutors did not ask that Drinan be detained and the judge let him walk free on personal recognizance -- and on the condition that he not fly, including to future court appearances -- said Dorschner. The arrest followed a Saturday night flight between Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland and Denver. An affidavit filed in conjunction with the criminal complaint states that Drinan sat down, hooked up his laptop computer to the airline's Wi-Fi Internet service and began viewing pornography. A person seated nearby noticed a man fondling himself and ultimately alerted a flight attendant, the Justice Department said, citing the affidavit. A male flight attendant arrived and, after finding the suspect's genitalia exposed, told him to "put his pants back together," according to the federal department. Drinan allegedly tried to use his laptop at times to hide his activity, investigators said. He is scheduled to be arraigned on September 19, according to Dorschner. Drinan's location could not be confirmed Monday night, nor could it be determined which attorney was representing him. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Denver Police Department are investigating the case, with Assistant U.S. Attorney James Allison in charge of the prosecution, according to the Justice Department. If convicted, Drinan could be sentenced to as many as 90 days in jail and be compelled to pay a $250 fine.

chatgpt: A 63-year-old man was arrested on Saturday night when his Southwest flight landed at Denver International Airport. Daniel Drinan has been accused of viewing pornography and fondling himself on the aircraft. Upon landing, authorities immediately took him into custody. According to reports, multiple passengers on board the flight witnessed Mr. Drinan's inappropriate behavior and notified the flight attendants. The attendants then alerted the Denver Police Department, who were waiting for the airplane to arrive at the gate. Drinan was quickly apprehended by the police and escorted off the plane. Drinan appeared in court on Monday morning and was released on his own recognizance, which means he did not have to post bail. However, the judge ordered that he cannot travel on any flights until his next court appearance.  A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines released a statement, saying that the airline has a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate behavior and will fully cooperate with the authorities in this matter. This is not the first time an incident like this has occurred on an airplane. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of passengers behaving inappropriately on flights, including sexual harassment and assault. In response, airlines have increased their efforts to train their staff to handle these situations and have implemented stricter rules on aircraft behavior. The incident involving Drinan shows that airlines are serious about ensuring a safe and comfortable environment for their passengers. Passengers are encouraged to report any inappropriate behavior they witness during a flight, as quick action from the attendants and authorities can prevent a situation from escalating. As for Drinan, he faces charges of indecent exposure and lewd conduct. His next court date is yet to be determined.
