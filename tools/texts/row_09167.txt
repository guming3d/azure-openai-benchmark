The Independent Press Standards Organisation, whose chairman is Sir Alan Moses (pictured), will oversee editorial standards for the majority of national and regional newspapers and magazines . IPSO, the new Press regulator, begins work today with a commitment to be 'rigorous, independent, fair and transparent'. The Independent Press Standards Organisation, whose chairman is the retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Alan Moses, will oversee editorial standards for the majority of national and regional newspapers and magazines, including the Daily Mail. It has far tougher rules than the previous regulator, the Press Complaints Commission. The watchdog will have the power to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing and can require editors to publish up-front corrections. IPSO will also include a standards and compliance arm, with investigative powers to call editors to account. It will require all newspapers to have their own effective complaints-handling procedures. Yesterday, Sir Alan said: 'IPSO aims to help rebuild public trust in the Press through independent, fair and transparent regulation. Its role as an independent regulator is to provide support and redress for victims of Press abuse. To raise standards is to protect the public from abuse. 'The board and I believe that the freedom of the Press can best be maintained by supporting and enhancing standards through an independent regulator. 'To achieve that aim we are committed to establishing and demonstrating our independence. Where standards have been breached we will apply sanctions and seek redress. Where we see patterns of poor behaviour we will pursue change. 'Democracy depends on a free but fair Press. Through independent regulation IPSO will make an important contribution to that vital objective.' IPSO said subscribing publications will be expected to deal fairly and swiftly with complaints from readers. It will also monitor the complaints handling procedures of its subscribing publications with expectations of clarity, efficiency, fairness and transparency. A majority of the 12 members of IPSO's complaints committee, expected to be confirmed today, will be from outside the industry. They are expected to include the former broadcaster and campaigner against miscarriages of justice David Jessel, Jill May of the Competition Commission, and Lara Fielden, vice-chairman of the London Probation Trust. Among the industry members are expected to be Elisabeth Ribbans, former managing editor of the Guardian, and Peter Wright, Editor Emeritus of Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail.

chatgpt: The UK press will now be under tougher regulation than ever before, as the new Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) rolls out its powers to protect the public from serious and systemic wrongdoing. The IPSO has been created to replace the previous regulator, the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). With its introduction, media outlets will now face the possibility of being fined up to £1 million if they are found guilty of wrongdoing. The IPSO is comprised of a board of independent experts, including the retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Alan Moses, who serves as the regulator’s chairman. Moses is a well-respected figure in the legal community, with years of experience dealing with complex cases. He has vowed to uphold the highest standards of journalism across all mediums, promising to vigorously investigate any claims of wrongdoing. The move to implement a new press regulator has been driven by a series of high-profile cases that have exposed some of the worst misdeeds of the UK press. These cases have highlighted the need for a more robust and effective system to hold the press accountable for its actions. The IPSO is uniquely positioned to be able to fulfill this role. With a wide-ranging remit, the regulator will have the power to investigate media outlets of all sizes, and across all mediums. Its powers will include the ability to impose fines, force corrections to be published, and even demand apologies from offending outlets. The IPSO’s introduction has been widely welcomed by many in the media industry, who see it as a step forward for press accountability. However, some have also expressed concern that the new regulator may be too strict and limit the ability of the press to conduct meaningful investigative journalism. Despite these concerns, the IPSO remains resolute in its mission to protect the public from harmful and unethical journalism. Its introduction marks a significant step forward for press accountability in the UK and a clear indication that no one is above the law, no matter how influential or powerful they may be. With its expert board of independent adjudicators and its sweeping powers, the IPSO will be an invaluable tool in protecting the public from wrongdoing by the UK press, ensuring that the highest standards of journalism are maintained across all media platforms.
