chatgpt: Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund will face off on Saturday in a highly anticipated Bundesliga clash at the Allianz Arena in Munich. The hosts sit comfortably at the top of the table, undefeated after nine matches played so far, whilst Dortmund are languishing in 15th position, having amassed only seven points from their first nine outings. The buildup to the match has been fraught with tension, with Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp expressing his anger at comments made by Bayern Munich about Marco Reus. Reus, who was signed by Dortmund from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2012, was rumoured to be a potential transfer target for Bayern during the summer. Although a move failed to materialise, the Bavarian club's interest in the midfielder reportedly caused some unrest amongst Dortmund fans. Last week, Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge made some comments about Reus during an interview with German newspaper Die Welt. "Marco Reus is a great player, but he's not born to play for Bayern," Rummenigge said. "In my view, money doesn't play a role if a player wants to join Bayern. He has to give his heart to the club." Klopp did not take kindly to Rummenigge's words. "I don't know why Karl-Heinz Rummenigge made those comments," he said at a press conference. "If he wants to win the game on Saturday by talking about Reus, then he can try. But I know that Marco is a fantastic player and he will be ready to play." Despite the off-field distractions, Bayern will be expected to continue their impressive run of form on Saturday. The team boasts a goalscoring record that is unmatched in the Bundesliga so far this season, having scored 28 times in their nine matches. Dortmund, on the other hand, have struggled to find the back of the net on a regular basis, scoring just ten goals and conceding 17 in their first nine games. The Dortmund players will be hoping to turn their fortunes around against their fierce rivals, however, and will be buoyed by the fact that they have won their last two encounters against Bayern in the Bundesliga. The two teams also faced each other in the German Super Cup earlier this season, with Dortmund emerging victorious on penalties following a 3-3 draw. The stage is set for an enthralling encounter, with both teams desperate for a positive result. Bayern will be keen to extend their lead at the top of the table, whilst Dortmund will be hoping that a win will kick-start their season and move them away from the relegation zone. Whatever the outcome, it promises to be a match that will be remembered for a long time to come.
