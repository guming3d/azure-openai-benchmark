article: "Here comes the sun" indeed, and it was just barely all right. Two years ago, modern infrastructure came very close to a serious disruption. The culprit? One of the largest solar storms in recorded history. Plasma exploding from the surface of the sun in a coronal mass ejection barreled through space and crossed through Earth's orbital path on July 23, 2012. If the flare had erupted about one week earlier, Earth would have been squarely in the line of fire, Daniel N. Baker wrote in a study published in the journal Space Weather. (Baker is with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado). This is not the first time solar activity has threatened Earth. A massive solar storm in 1859, dubbed the Carrington Event after the English astronomer who witnessed it, caused the northern lights to appear as far south as Cuba; and it caused telegraph lines to spark, setting fire to a number of buildings, according to Science@NASA editor Dr. Tony Phillips. "According to data from the STEREO-A spacecraft (a solar observatory), the solar storm of July 23, 2012, was every bit as potent as the Carrington storms," he said. Baker said that had our planet been in the path of the storm, it would not be inconceivable that we would still be "picking up the pieces." Phillips agrees. "As society relies more and more on high technology such as GPS, the Internet, satellite communications and smart power grids, we also expose ourselves more and more to the dangers of stormy space weather." He added that power outages after the storm could have persisted for many months.  If the solar storm had hit, much of Earth's technology would be rendered inoperable: from radios and GPS systems to toilets. Though human beings would not be physically harmed directly, a study by the National Academy of Sciences estimates that damage from a coronal mass ejection of similar magnitude could exceed $2 trillion in the United States and pose risks to national security. While Earth did get lucky in 2012, humans should not get too comfortable. Despite the relatively mild conditions on the sun, solar storms are unpredictable. According to Baker, "incredibly powerful" space weather is possible at any time. Space weather: Fine, with a chance of solar flares . NASA cameras capture huge solar flares .

chatgpt: A recent study has found evidence that a coronal mass ejection (CME) passed through Earth's orbit on July 23, 2012. This event could have had catastrophic consequences for GPS, the internet, electrical systems, and national security. According to the study's author, intense solar storms are possible at any time, and the impact of such storms on our technology-driven society could be devastating. The CME in question was particularly large and fast-moving, and had it directly hit Earth, it could have caused trillions of dollars in damage. The potential damage from a CME comes from the fact that it sends out a massive burst of charged particles that, when they hit Earth's atmosphere, can interfere with our technology in a number of ways. GPS systems, for example, rely on accurate timing from GPS satellites, and a CME can disrupt those signals, making it difficult or impossible to use GPS devices. The internet, too, relies on a complex system of networks and servers, and a CME can disrupt those systems as well. Electrical systems are also vulnerable, as the charged particles can induce currents in power lines and transformers, potentially causing blackouts and other problems. National security is another concern, as many critical infrastructure systems, such as power plants and communication networks, rely heavily on technology. A CME that disrupts those systems could leave us vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security threats. The study's author emphasizes that while this particular CME passed by Earth without causing any damage, it serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of intense solar storms. We can't predict when the next one will occur, but we can take steps to prepare ourselves. One important step is to invest in more resilient technology that can survive the effects of a CME. For example, NASA has been working on new GPS systems that are less vulnerable to such disruptions. Similarly, power companies could invest in better grid systems that can better withstand a CME-induced surge. However, the study also highlights the need for better monitoring and warning systems. If we can predict when a CME is coming, we can take steps to minimize its impact. The study's author suggests that we need a dedicated space weather agency, similar to the National Weather Service, to better monitor space weather and provide timely warnings. Overall, the study is a sobering reminder of the potential dangers of space weather, and the need to take steps to protect our technology and our society from its effects. While we can't prevent a CME from occurring, we can prepare ourselves and take steps to minimize its impact.
