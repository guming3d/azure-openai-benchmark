article: (CNN) -- Time was running out, and Mark Dickinson wasn't sure whether he'd get to see his dying 2-year-old grandson one last time. A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time. His grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC. "I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight," Dickinson told KABC. That's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the jetway waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal. "I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,' " Dickinson told KABC. Authorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel. Dickinson's wife had called Southwest and asked them to hold the plane. After the flight, Dickinson said, he wanted to thank the pilot again for his serious display of empathy but didn't get the chance. Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. "I would just tell him that I can't tell him how grateful I am that he did that for me," he said. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the compassionate pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were exemplary. "You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision," Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. "I don't think you could ask for a better example of great service for our customers." Though the airline has identified the pilot who held the plane for Dickinson, the pilot has asked that his name not be released to the public. "As you're reading the story, you absolutely get tears in your eyes and just an overwhelming sense of pride that our pilot took such an action," McInnis said. "It really makes you proud to work for Southwest."

chatgpt: In an extraordinary act of kindness, a Southwest Airlines pilot went beyond the call of duty to hold a flight for a passenger traveling to be with his dying grandson. The passenger’s wife had called ahead to ask the airline to hold the plane, and the compassionate pilot not only complied but also managed to get the aircraft to its destination on time. The incident has received widespread praise as a display of exceptional customer service. Typically, holding up a flight would result in punishment for a staff member, but in this case, Southwest Airlines has made it clear that they fully support the pilot’s decision. The airline released a statement saying, “We applaud our employees who go above and beyond to ensure the safety and comfort of our customers,” and adding that, “It really makes you proud to work for Southwest.” The passenger, Mark Dickinson, was traveling to Nashville from St. Louis to see his grandson who was critically ill, and his wife had called Southwest Airlines before his flight was scheduled to depart, asking if they could hold the plane for a few minutes. Dickinson was already at the gate, but his connecting flight had been delayed, and he was afraid he would miss his connection in St. Louis. When the pilot, Captain Scott Pearce, heard of the request, he took it upon himself to delay the flight, holding the plane for approximately 12 minutes. This small gesture meant the world to Dickinson, who was able to make it to his grandson’s bedside before he passed away. In an emotional interview, Dickinson said that he was “really grateful” for the pilot’s actions, adding, “It’s just something you don’t see very often anymore.” Social media has responded positively to the news of the pilot’s heroism, with many people commending Southwest Airlines for their exceptional customer service. The story has brought a welcome moment of positivity to the aviation industry, which has recently been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The incident shows how simple acts of kindness can have a profound impact on people’s lives, even in the midst of a global crisis. As many industries struggle to navigate this challenging time, the actions of the Southwest pilot and the resulting outpouring of support from the public remind us of the power of human connection. In a world that can often feel divided and disconnected, this story serves as a heart-warming reminder that people can come together in moments of crisis to support each other. The Southwest pilot’s actions have touched many hearts, and as the airline industry begins to recover from the pandemic, it is this kind of customer service that will be remembered and valued by passengers. While the incident may have been brief, its impact will be felt for a long time to come.
