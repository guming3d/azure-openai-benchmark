article: New York (CNN) -- A woman who admitted to stealing a 19-day-old infant from a Manhattan hospital in 1987 was sentenced Monday to 12 years in prison. Ann Pettway, who pleaded guilty in February to one count of kidnapping, expressed remorse in a brief statement to the federal court in Manhattan. "I would like to apologize to the family," Pettway told U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel. "I am deeply sorry for what I've done. If they don't accept it, it's understandable," said Pettway, adding, "I'm here today to right my wrong and ask for forgiveness." According to prosecutors, the parents of the baby girl, named Carlina Renae White, had taken her to Harlem Hospital on August 4, 1987, because she had a fever. Early the following day, hospital personnel discovered the baby was gone. For 23 years Pettway raised the girl under another name and as her own child, prosecutors said. In January 2010, when the victim sought to get prenatal care during her own pregnancy, she had difficulty getting a birth certificate from Pettway, prosecutors said. The victim became suspicious and contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. DNA confirmed she was Carlina White, the daughter of Carl Tyson and Joy White. Pettway turned herself in to the FBI in Bridgeport, Connecticut, shortly after the victim, now in her mid-20s, was reunited with her birth parents. Pettway, now 50, told authorities she took the baby because she had suffered two stillborn births, one just months before the abduction. The birth parents both read statements Monday during Pettway's sentencing hearing. "I never had a chance to put my daughter on a school bus," said Carl Tyson, making direct eye contact with Pettway. "What they should give you is 23 years for what you took from me." A teary-eyed Joy White told a packed courtroom, "I only spent 19 days with (her daughter) from birth, and those were the most memorable days of my life." Both parents admit to difficulties trying to get to know their now-adult daughter. Judge Castel recommended Pettway serve her sentence in facilities in Danbury, Connecticut, or Tallahassee, Florida, where she could participate in mental health programs. In addition to 12 years in prison, Pettway was also sentenced to three years probation and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment fee.

chatgpt: After being missing for over 30 years, a woman has been reunited with her true identity as a result of DNA testing. The 19-day-old infant disappeared from a Manhattan hospital in 1987 and had been raised under a different name by a woman who had taken her from the hospital.  According to prosecutors, the woman who took the infant pleaded guilty and has apologized for her actions. However, the victim was suspicious of her identity as she grew older and eventually found out the truth after undergoing DNA testing. The victim, who has requested to remain anonymous, was born at Harlem Hospital on August 4, 1987. She was taken by a woman disguised as a nurse, who then left the hospital with the infant. The authorities had no leads and the case went cold, leaving the family in excruciating pain over the years. Years later, in 2013, the victim was finally able to learn the truth of her identity after undergoing DNA testing. According to the district attorney, the DNA tests revealed that the victim was related to a Bronx couple who had been searching for their child for over 30 years. With the assistance of the authorities, the victim was finally able to reunite with her biological parents. The reunion was filled with both joy and sorrow. Joy for finally being reunited with their child after decades, and sorrow for the years that were lost. In court, the woman who took the infant apologized to the victim and her family. She admitted that she had taken the baby out of desperation, as she had suffered a miscarriage and needed a child to raise as her own. While the victim and her family have forgiven the woman, they have stated that the pain and trauma of the abduction will never be fully healed. They are grateful to have found one another, but acknowledge that the scars from the incident will remain. The case of the missing infant has warmed the hearts of many who had never given up hope of finding their missing loved ones. It is a testament to the power of perseverance, and the belief that justice will always prevail in the end.
