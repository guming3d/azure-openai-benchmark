article: With terrorist threats, homophobic attacks, and diplomatic tensions, many have questioned whether Sochi is ready to hold the Winter Olympic Games. Now, just days away from the landmark event, the first images have emerged of the city's unprepared hotels. And it seems the doubtful were right. 'Utter farce': Journalists have taken to Twitter to lambast the hilarious conditions of their hotels in Sochi . Journalists checking in were left stunned as they arrived for bookings made last summer to be told they would have to wait indefinitely. The few that did get rooms, were met with stray dogs, half-built walls, and toxic yellow water spitting from the sinks. One hotel lobby had no floor - but staff had found time to hang a framed photo of Vladimir Putin. Mark MacKinnon tweeted: 'For those of you wondering, when's there's no lobby in your hotel, you go to the owner's bedroom to check in.' Another guesthouse warned toilet users not to flush loo roll but instead put it in the plastic bin by the door. One reporter was told to wait a day for their room, which had no running water, no internet - and no door to access it. Nearby, hotel managers advised guests not to splash water on their faces as it 'contains something dangerous'. Having book 11 rooms five months ago, CNN's team were told to share one. The shocking images and anecdotes comes after it emerged Russia exceeded its budget by millions to spend $32billion on the games. Russia insists widespread fears for human rights are unfounded despite a video by Human Rights Watch incorporating clips from some of the worst examples of homophobic violence in Russia which has been filmed and uploaded to the internet. However, Vladimir Putin has sanctioned action to be taken on the city's large population of stray dogs. In a bid to make the area presentable to welcome in people from around the world, the animals are being fed poison on the streets and left to die. The strategy has outraged animal rights activists - and baffled journalists arriving in Sochi today who claim the city is brimming with ailing dogs. Meanwhile, a top U.S. counterterrorist official says there are 'a number of specific threats' aimed at the Winter Olympics that start this week in Sochi, Russia - with the greatest danger coming from the Caucasus Emirate, which has threatened to attack the games. Russia has mounted a massive security operation for the Olympics, deploying more than 50,000 police and soldiers amid threats from Muslim insurgents.

chatgpt: Journalists who had recently checked into hotel accommodations in Russia for the upcoming games were left shocked and taken aback by the dire state of the facilities. Tweets and posts of pictures were shared, depicting rooms with yellow and dirty water, lobbies with no floors and even stray dogs lurking around. The alarming conditions in the hotels come amid news that Russia has exceeded its budget by millions for the games this week. This development is causing concern as fears rise over looming threats of homophobic and terrorist attacks. Many spectators and athletes alike have expressed concern about their safety due to the anticipation of potential incidents. Last month, a Russian lawmaker urged authorities to 'eliminate' any gay athletes ahead of the games, prompting widespread condemnation. Meanwhile, reports of terrorist plots have put additional pressure on the Russian authorities to ensure that the games are safe and secure. In December, two separate bombings in the southern Russian city of Volgograd killed 34 people and injured scores of others. Russia has reportedly spent $51 billion on preparing for the games, a staggering amount compared to the previous record set by China of $40 billion spent in 2008. However, with the issues surrounding the hotel accommodations and concerns about safety for spectators, athletes, and journalists, it is becoming clear that the expenditure has not brought improvement in the expected areas. These problems have not gone unnoticed by the International Olympic Committee, which stated that it was working with the Russian authorities to ensure that the accommodation problems are resolved. The IOC released a statement affirming that "We have experienced all the normal teething problems that are associated with the organisation of such a large and complex event." The Russian authorities have stated that they will take swift action to rectify the hotel conditions and ensure the safety of the games. However, with the games just days away and the eyes of the world on Russia, the country will be under tremendous pressure to ensure that everything runs smoothly. The incidents surrounding the upcoming games highlight the ongoing challenges facing Russia, both in terms of planning and security. It remains to be seen how these issues will be resolved and how they will impact the games moving forward.
