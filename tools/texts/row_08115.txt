article: (CNN) -- Europe's top soccer teams will play their Champions League semifinals this week after opting to undertake grueling bus journeys to avoid the flight restrictions enforced due to the volcanic ash from Iceland which has paralyzed air travel in the region. Titleholders Barcelona have begun a 1,000-kilometer road trip from northern Spain to Italy for the first leg of Tuesday night's semifinal against Inter Milan. The Catalan club's Web site reported that the squad left on Sunday afternoon for a 634 km trip to Cannes in France, where they will stay overnight before completing the further 351 km to Milan. Spanish leaders Barcelona drew 0-0 with city rivals Espanyol on Saturday night, but midfielder Sergio Busquets told reporters on Sunday afternoon that the difficult schedule was no excuse for not performing well at Inter's San Siro. "We are in with a chance to reach another final and we don't want to throw that away. We have been having a lot of big games and it's not the ideal way to travel to Milan, but there can be no excuses," he said, according to Barcelona's Web site. "Maybe spending so long together on a coach will bring us closer and help us focus on beating Inter. It's a long time on the road and we're not really used to that, but with music and a film or two, I'm sure the trip won't seem so long." French club Lyon also have a long journey ahead for the first leg of their last-four clash with German leaders Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Lyon had to travel 600 km home following Saturday's 2-2 draw with French champions Bordeaux which effectively ended both side's domestic title hopes with five matches to play. The squad will be back on the bus again for a 750 km trip to Bavaria, stopping overnight in the Swiss city of Zurich before arriving in Germany on Tuesday. "Seven hours on the bus wasn't easy. We didn't sleep, but it was a good chance for a chat," captain Cris said in quotes carried by Bayern's Web site on Sunday. "It'll be a total of 10 hours on the bus, which is hard," the Brazilian said of the next stage of the journey. "But there's no choice and we have to accept it." European football's governing body UEFA said on Sunday that decisions about Thursday's semifinals of the second-tier Europa League would be made in the next few days. Liverpool must travel to Spain to play Atletico Madrid, while fellow English club Fulham must go to Germany to take on Hamburg in the first legs of their last-four ties. The UEFA Women's Champions League semifinal between Umea IK and Lyon in Sweden scheduled for Sunday was postponed as the French side could not travel.

Barcelona will begin their bid to reach the final with an away trip to face Inter Milan in Italy. With the first leg taking place at the iconic San Siro stadium, Barcelona will be hoping to get off to a flying start against the Italian giants.

The French side will be looking to cause an upset against the reigning Bundesliga champions, who have been in ruthless form in recent weeks. Lyon have shown that they are capable of springing surprises during this season's competition, having knocked out Manchester City in the quarter-finals. However, they will need to produce another memorable performance if they are to progress to the final. While the Champions League semifinals will go ahead as scheduled, UEFA is yet to make a decision on Thursday's Europa League semifinal fixtures.

The governing body has put in place strict safety protocols to ensure the safety of players and staff, including regular testing and limited travel arrangements. Fans across the world will be eagerly anticipating the two heavyweight fixtures in the Champions League semifinals, with Barcelona and Bayern Munich the current favourites to reach the final. However, Lyon and Inter Milan have shown that they are not to be underestimated, and both sides will be keen to defy the odds and progress to the showpiece event.
