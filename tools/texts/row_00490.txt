article: Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Polls closed in Bangladesh's parliamentary elections Sunday amid a boycott by major opposition parties and violence that left at least 16 people dead, officials said. Officials announced some results Sunday night. But disputes over the vote appeared to be far from over, with the country's largest opposition party calling for a fresh round of protests starting Monday against what they called "farcical polls." Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad, Bangladesh's chief election commissioner, said cold weather and the opposition boycott fueled a low turnout nationwide. But a senior leader of the ruling Awami League said people "spontaneously cast votes and rejected (the) opposition's violent activities." "It's a victory of democracy," Tofail Ahmed told reporters. Police officials reported violence in many parts of the country as opposition activists hoping to foil elections clashed with officers. Police in some areas told CNN they fired tear gas and shots at protesters who tried to attack polling stations. The capital of Dhaka was largely peaceful, but voter turnout was low. "Presence of voters today is lower than any other time of voting," said Gazi Aslim Uddin, a presiding officer at a voting station in old Dhaka. Opposition protesters don't trust Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her administration and want a neutral caretaker government to oversee the vote to make sure it is fair. But that caretaker system was scrapped a few years ago. With mistrust mounting, Bangladesh has seen a series of incidents of deadly street violence over the elections in recent months. Local civic groups and international communities urged the government to cancel the voting and reschedule the elections. The largest opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and its allies boycotted Sunday's elections and enforced a general strike to thwart voting. Attackers torched about 150 polling centers and election materials nationwide. The boycott was expected to ensure a victory for the ruling Awami League party. Violence stopped voting at some centers, the country's chief election commissioner said, and officials plan to hold new polls at those locations on January 24. Senior BNP leader Osman Farruk demanded cancellation of the elections results and called for fresh elections under a neutral caretaker government. The election unrest underscores persistent problems in the South Asian nation, a country grappling with grinding poverty, political instability and development challenges.

chatgpt: Election-related violence has overrun the country leading to the deaths of at least 16 people, as the nation struggles to come to terms with the aftermath of the recent polls. The country's largest opposition party has been vocal in its criticism of what it calls "farcical polls", and has launched protests in the wake of the election outcome.  Despite the widespread violence, some government officials are hailing the recent vote as a "victory for democracy." One leader of the ruling Awami League stated that the election results were a testament to the people's desire for continuity and progress. In a speech to supporters, the leader went on to express his gratitude to voters for coming out in large numbers and safeguarding the country's democratic future. However, the opposition views the election outcome differently. They have accused the Awami League-led government of rigging the polls in their favor and suppressing dissenting voices. The opposition party has called for a fresh round of elections to be held under the supervision of an independent body, alleging that the government failed to ensure a level playing field. Reports of violence, intimidation, and irregularities in polling stations have further fueled the opposition's claims. Despite the challenges, the country remains optimistic about the future of its democracy. The government has promised to address the concerns raised by the opposition and work towards building a more inclusive political environment. There are hopes that this will translate into greater respect for human rights, accountability, and transparency in governance.  The international community has also taken note of the violence surrounding the polls. Several countries have expressed concern about the situation and called for an end to the violence. The United Nations has urged all parties to exercise restraint and resolve disputes through peaceful means. As the country navigates its way through this challenging period, it is clear that the road ahead will not be easy. Still, there is hope that the government and opposition can come to the negotiating table and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution that serves the interests of all citizens. Only then can the nation move forward towards a brighter, more prosperous future.
