article: The show will go on. Alan Jackson and Kid Rock will kick off SeaWorld's "Bands, Brew & BBQ" this weekend, bucking a trend of artists dropping the show to avoid controversy over how the Orlando, Florida, theme park treats its orcas. The concert event runs Saturdays and Sundays February 1 to March 9. The exodus from SeaWorld's calendar began soon after CNN broadcast the documentary "Blackfish" in October. The film tells the story of the killing of a SeaWorld trainer by an orca in 2010. It raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity. Country star Trace Adkins pulled out this month. Other acts that have canceled include: Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Martina McBride and 38 Special. Pat Benatar, Beach Boys cancel . Only Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery remain on the event calendar from the original list. Their representatives have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment. Online petitions and social media postings targeted the acts who had signed on to play at the park. "We're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld," SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck has said. "The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals." SeaWorld says the documentary ignores the park's conservation efforts and research. "More than 11 million people a year visit SeaWorld parks, and most will see a killer whale presentation during their visit," said Gollattscheck. "Over the course of our 50-year history hundreds of millions of people have experienced killer whales in our parks. There is tremendous appeal in that kind of inspirational and educational experience, and we anticipate that killer whale display will continue for generations to come."

chatgpt: The critically acclaimed documentary "Blackfish" is causing a stir in the entertainment industry, as artists have started fleeing from commitments on the SeaWorld calendar. The film explores the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity, highlighting the dangers of coercing the magnificent animals into performing for human audiences. The allegations in the documentary have raised alarm bells for artists who previously agreed to perform at SeaWorld. SeaWorld has been one of the biggest marine parks in the world, and in recent months, the park has faced backlash over its treatment of animals. The documentary has hit especially hard, as artists are now refusing to perform at events held by SeaWorld. This has led to the park being criticized for its treatment of marine life and the conditions in which they are kept. SeaWorld has responded to the backlash with a series of statements, assuring the public of the park's commitment to animal welfare. The park claims that it maintains high standards of living arrangements for their animals. SeaWorld says it provides extensive medical care, as well as a nutritious diet that is specifically designed for the animals under their care. The park has also been emphasizing its conservation and research efforts, which it says the documentary ignores. They argue that the work they do with animals in captivity benefits research on the health and behavior of the species. The pressure, however, continues to mount. This week, a number of musicians cancelled performances at SeaWorld Events. Gretchen Wilson, Martina McBride, and Trace Adkins, who had initially agreed to perform in the park, have all cancelled their performances citing the allegations in the documentary as their reason. Blackfish has drawn worldwide attention for its detailed account of the inhumane treatment of killer whales in the US. The documentary features interviews with former SeaWorld trainers, who talk about the conditions in which the animals were kept and the dangers involved in working with them. The furor caused by the documentary has resulted in the park's shares plummeting, with activists calling for SeaWorld to be closed down. The documentary has raised important questions about the ethics of keeping animals in captivity, and has put pressure on parks such as SeaWorld to rethink their practices. The fallout from Blackfish is a reminder of the need for continued scrutiny of the industry, as well as a call to action for individuals and corporations to take responsibility for the welfare of the animals under their care.
