article: When Japan hosts the summer Olympics in 2020, prime minister Shinzo Abe is determined to make it an event to remember. And what better way, he claims, than to include robotic competitors to show off the world’s technical achievements. Mr Abe made the comments during a tour of robotics factories in Tokyo and Saitama, where he also announced the creation of a taskforce to treble the size of the Japanese robotics industry. Prime minister Shinzo Abe made the comments during a tour of robotics factories in Tokyo and Saitama, where he also announced the creation of a taskforce to treble the size of the industry . The industry could help revitalise the country's economy, and Mr Abe hopes to increase its market for machines to 2.4 trillion yen (£13.8 billion or $24 billion). 'In 2020, I would like to gather all of the world's robots and aim to hold an Olympics where they compete in technical skills,' Mr Abe said. 'We want to make robots a major pillar of our economic growth strategy. 'We would like to set up a council on making a robotic revolution a reality in order to aid Japan's growth.' There are also a number of smaller competitive events such as the RoboCup (pictured) and contests such as the Darpa Robotics Challenge . This isn’t the first time that a robotics competition has been organised on a large-scale. In 2010, China launched a humanoid battle that included 16 events. There are also a number of smaller competitive events such as the RoboCup and the Darpa Robotics Challenge. Meanwhile, Switzerland is currently gearing up to host the world’s first cyborg Olympics in 2016. Japan is currently a leader in the sector. The country recently unveiled a chatty humanoid robot that its makers say can understand people's emotions. Other robotic accomplishments include a realistic robotic newsreaders and a droid with reflexes so fast it can never be beaten at the game 'rock, paper, scissors'. In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots. Now, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions. Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming. Pepper . uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to . study gestures, expressions and human speech tones. The . 48-inch (121 cm) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two . large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest. It was developed jointly with Aldebaran Robotics, which designs, produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots.

chatgpt: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, during a visit to several robotics factories, has announced the creation of a new task force that aims to triple the size of the country's robotics industry. Mr. Abe said that he hopes to expand the market for robotic machines to ¥2 trillion ($18.51 billion) by 2020, which would be a significant increase from the current market size of ¥600 billion ($5.55 billion). The creation of this task force is in line with Prime Minister Abe's goal of promoting innovation and growth in the Japanese economy. Speaking to reporters during his visit, he emphasized how robotics will become increasingly important in the future, saying, "I believe that the incorporation of robots will advance our society and industry." The task force, which will be led by government officials and representatives from the private sector, will be responsible for developing a strategy to increase the market size of the robotics industry. The group will work to remove any obstacles that may hinder the industry's growth and encourage more investment in this sector. There are currently several smaller competitive robotic events taking place in Japan, such as the RoboCup and the Darpa Robotics Challenge. These events showcase the latest advancements in robotics technology, and provide a platform for researchers and engineers to share their knowledge and ideas. Prime Minister Abe's announcement is expected to further boost innovation and competitiveness in the robotics industry, particularly for Japanese companies like Fanuc and Yaskawa, which currently dominate the sector. These companies produce industrial robots that are used in factories for tasks such as welding, painting and assembling. The task force will focus on promoting the use of robotics in various fields, including healthcare, agriculture, and construction. The Japanese government sees robotics as a way to address various challenges, such as an aging population, labor shortages, and increasing healthcare costs. Moreover, Japan has been particularly focused on leading the way in the development of humanoid robots, or robots that look and move like humans. These robots can serve as companions for the elderly and disabled, and can also be used in various service industries. The task force's efforts will also help to address Japan’s decline in workforce productivity, which has been a major concern for the government. Robots could boost productivity by taking over more tedious and dangerous tasks, while allowing people to focus on more creative and innovative work. Overall, Prime Minister Abe's announcement of the new task force marks a significant step towards promoting the growth and development of Japan's robotics industry. It demonstrates the government's commitment to promoting innovation, and its recognition of the potential benefits that could arise from investing in robotics technology. With its strong history of robotics development, Japan is poised to play a key role in this field in the years to come.
