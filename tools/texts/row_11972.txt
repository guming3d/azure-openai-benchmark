article: Washington (CNN) -- Less than 100 feet from where a hijacked airplane slammed into the Pentagon, Muslim military personnel bring prayer rugs on weekday afternoons for group worship. On Fridays, a local imam conducts a service in the Pentagon Memorial Chapel built after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks by al Qaeda that killed 184 people at the U.S. military headquarters. The chapel, with stained-glass windows, burgundy carpeting and a wooden altar, provides a place of prayer and religious observance for anyone regardless of faith or culture. Its welcoming calm and nondenominational culture are in stark contrast to the emotional debate over plans to build an Islamic cultural center and mosque two blocks from ground zero in New York City, where planes flown by al Qaeda hijackers destroyed the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,700 people. To chaplains who work in Army chapels around the world, the tolerance and openness represent the support and camaraderie of military culture. "What happens here is normal," said Chaplain (Lt. Col.) Carleton W. Birch, spokesman for the Army Chief of Chaplains. The Pentagon chapel opened in November 2002 as part of the reconstruction of the complex from damage caused by the 9/11 attack. Behind the altar, a large stained-glass display depicts the Pentagon, an eagle and the American flag, with a double row of 184 ruby-red glass pieces representing the victims killed when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the building. "United in memory, September 11, 2001," it reads. The chapel contains 80 seats and has regularly scheduled religious services on weekdays, including Catholic confession and Mass, a Jewish service and Torah study, a Hindu service, a Mormon service and services for other Christian denominations, along with the Muslim prayer service. On average, 300 to 400 people visit the chapel each week, either to take part in group services or on their own. Army officials interviewed Wednesday said they were unaware of anyone ever protesting against Muslims' use of the chapel. "I've never had a question about it" in four-plus years at the Pentagon, Army spokesman George Wright said. The Army culture of religious freedom dates back to the Revolutionary War, Wright said, describing it as "a big tent." "We're very tolerant here of one another and our faith," he said. "We don't keep track of who comes in." CNN's Chris Lawrence contributed to this story.

chatgpt: The military chapel located near the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack in New York City has become a symbol of unity in the midst of tragedy. The chapel is unique because it is a non-denominational space, open to people of all faiths. In a country where religious tensions often run high, the chapel serves as a reminder that tolerance and understanding are possible. According to officials, the chapel's non-denominational status is part of military culture. The military embraces diversity and inclusivity, recognizing that soldiers of all faiths serve and die for their country. The chapel is a physical representation of this philosophy, providing a space for military personnel from all backgrounds to come together. One of the events that drew attention to the chapel's inclusive nature was the tragedy of September 11th, 2001. On that fateful day, a hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon, killing 184 people. The chapel, located just steps away from the Pentagon, became a refuge for people seeking solace and comfort in the aftermath of the attack. Since then, Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus have all used the chapel's space. It has become a place for people of all faiths to gather and find support in difficult times. The chapel's walls are adorned with symbols of various religions, including a Star of David, a cross, and Islamic calligraphy. The military chaplains who oversee the chapel recognize the importance of its non-denominational status. They believe that it is essential for soldiers to have a space where they can come together, regardless of their religious beliefs. The chapel has become a model for other spaces across the country. It serves as a reminder that, despite our differences, we are all united in our desire for peace and understanding. The military chapel near the 9/11 crash site is not just a building, but a symbol.
