chatgpt: Toby, the Collie who captured the hearts of staff at Hilbrae Pets Hotel, was put to sleep yesterday after spending most of his life at the centre. Toby arrived at the shelter as a ten-month-old stray back in May 2003, and staff had hoped that he would quickly find a loving home. Despite his friendly personality and affectionate nature, Toby's fear of cars made it almost impossible for him to find a permanent family. Centre staff worked tirelessly with him, trying to ease his anxiety and encourage him to overcome his phobia. While they were able to make some progress, it was not enough to convince anyone to adopt him. Over the years, Toby became a beloved part of the Hilbrae family, with staff members and volunteers doting on him and providing him with the love and attention he deserved. Despite not finding a permanent home, he was never without companionship or care. As Toby grew older, his health began to decline. Yesterday, after a visit to the veterinarian, staff members made the difficult but compassionate decision to put him to sleep. The decision was made with Poignant regret, and Toby will be deeply missed by everyone at the centre.  In a statement, the team at Hilbrae said, "We are devastated by the loss of our dear Toby, who we loved and adored. Despite his fear of cars, he never lost his loving and gentle nature, and always greeted us with a wagging tail and a friendly smile. He will always have a special place in our hearts and will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him". Toby's story, while ultimately a tragic one, serves as a reminder of the important work done by animal shelters like Hilbrae. Many animals, like Toby, find themselves in need of a home, and it is the dedicated staff members and volunteers who provide them with the care and affection they need during their often-lengthy stays at the shelter. While Toby may not have found the forever home he deserved, he was surrounded by love and warmth throughout his life. The team at Hilbrae will undoubtedly continue their important work, and Toby's memory will live on through the countless animals they help and care for in the years to come.
