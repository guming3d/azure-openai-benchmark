Serious air pollution plagues most major Chinese cities, where environmental protection has been long sacrificed for the sake of economic development. Coal burning and car emissions are major sources of pollution. In recent years, China has beefed up regulations and pledged financial resources to fight pollution. In the far northeastern city of Harbin, some monitoring sites reported PM 2.5 rates of up to 1,000 micrograms in October, when the winter heating season kicked off. In December, dirty air gripped the coastal city of Shanghai and its neighboring provinces for days, with the density of PM 2.5 exceeding 600.

chatgpt: In an unusual scene that has baffled the residents of Hubei Province in China, streaky pork has been spotted hanging from the windows of a flat. Every window in the apartment was covered in rashers of the meat, creating a striking image that quickly gained attention on social media.  The reason behind this bizarre display of pork is still unclear. It is not known whether the resident of the flat is a butcher or some other kind of meat vendor, or whether they had considered the effects of smog in the city on the exposed meat. The smog in many Chinese cities has been a serious issue in recent years, with air quality often reaching hazardous levels.  The images of the pork hanging from the windows have been shared widely on Weibo, China's popular social media platform. Many users expressed concern about the potential health risks associated with the pork being exposed to the polluted air. Others speculated that the display was a protest of some kind, although it is not clear what the protest might be about. Some users suggested that the person responsible for hanging the pork might have been trying to dry it, a common method of preserving meat in China. However, others pointed out that this method is usually used in rural areas where there is more space and fresh air. It is not a practice commonly seen in urban areas and might attract unwanted attention from authorities. The images of the pork hanging from the windows have sparked a lively conversation online, with many people wondering what could have led to such an unusual display. For now, the reason remains a mystery. However, the images serve as a reminder of the challenges facing many urban residents in China, including the high levels of pollution in the air.
