article: (CNN)As goal celebrations go it was almost certainly unique but Roma captain Francesco Totti had plenty to celebrate. His title challenging side was trailing 2-0 to arch city rival Lazio in the Rome derby before the veteran striker worked his magic in the second half. Totti cut the arrears with a fine angled strike in the 48th minute of the clash in the Olympic Stadium. He then claimed his second and the vital equalizer as connected with Jose Holebas's curling delivery for an acrobatic finish. In frenzied celebrations, Totti promptly grabbed a mobile telephone from one of the Roma coaching staff and took a 'selfie' picture of himself. The shot was later posted on the club's official Facebook page and has gone viral on social media. It was the 38-year-old's 239th goal in Serie A in his 22nd season with Roma. Neither side could add to its tally in a frantic finale to a fine match. Totti needs another 35 to match Silvio Piola's all-time Serie A record of 274, and temporarily drew Rudi Garcia's team level at the top with Juventus. However, the title holders beat Napoli 3-1 away later Sunday to go three points clear -- their victory down to a pair of stunning strikes from Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal and a rare goal from Martin Caceres.

Juan Mata wasted two fine chances to level for Louis van Gaal's side, which was seeing its 11-match unbeaten run ended. Earlier, Alexis Sanchez scored twice for Arsenal who beat Stoke 3-0 at the Emirates to move into fifth spot in the battle for Champions League places. Messi stars for Barca .
