article: (CNN) -- Concern over the spread of the Ebola virus has caused the cancellation of an African Cup of Nations football match. The Seychelles was due to host Sierra Leone in a qualifying game on Saturday, but the tiny island nation's ministries of health and immigration prevented the visiting players from entering the country. At least 525 cases of Ebola have been reported in Sierra Leone since March, 224 of which have been fatal. Seychelles, which was trailing 2-0 after losing the away leg of the second-round qualifier in Sierra Leone on July 19, has forfeited both the tie and its hopes of reaching next year's tournament finals. Sierra Leone players were on Friday reportedly prevented from boarding a plane at Kenya's Nairobi Airport that would have taken them to the Seychelles. Seychelles Football Federation president Elvis Chetty told CNN that there was little choice but to follow government advice and forfeit the match, which was to be held in the capital Victoria. "After being advised by the ministry of health to postpone the match for an indefinite period, the ministry of immigration informed us it would not allow the team from Sierra Leone to enter the Seychelles," Chetty said. "Subsequently, the SFF felt it was prudent to forfeit the scheduled match as opposed to asking for a postponement. "We respect the decisions taken by the authorities to safeguard the health interests of our country. "Our thoughts are with the Sierra Leone people in their hour of need." There have been more than 1,300 confirmed or suspected Ebola cases in West Africa since March, when cases of the virus were first reported in Guinea. Other countries to be affected include Liberia and Nigeria. Sierra Leone president Ernest Bai Koroma has declared a public health emergency in his country in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus. One of the country's athletes at the Commonwealth Games in Scotland was taken to hospital last week to be tested for Ebola after feeling unwell. However, cyclist Moses Sesay was cleared and was able to compete in Thursday's men's individual time trial. Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever, affecting multiple organs and accompanied by bleeding. There is no known cure or specific treatments. The World Health Organization has said that drastic action is needed to contain what has fast become the worst outbreak on record.

chatgpt: In a surprising turn of events, the Seychelles football team has been forced to forfeit their African Cup of Nations qualifier match against Sierra Leone due to Ebola fears. This decision was made after Sierra Leone football players were prevented from entering the country, citing concerns over the recent Ebola outbreak. Since the outbreak began earlier this year, at least 224 lives have been lost in Sierra Leone alone. The country has been grappling with the effects of this deadly virus, which has had a significant impact on their health system and economy. Despite their efforts to contain the spread of the disease, the outbreak has continued to persist, causing widespread panic and fear across the country. The decision to prevent Sierra Leone football players from entering Seychelles comes as a significant blow to their national team who were looking forward to participating in the African Cup of Nations qualifier. The team had been working tirelessly to prepare for this match and had hoped to secure a victory that would take them one step closer to the famous football tournament. However, despite their disappointment, the Sierra Leone team understands the concerns of the Seychelles authorities and has expressed their support for the decision. They have reiterated their commitment to working tirelessly to contain the spread of Ebola and protect the health and wellbeing of their citizens. This latest incident raises once again the significant impact that Ebola is having across the African continent. With many countries struggling to contain the outbreak and prevent its spread, it is clear that this disease is having a profound impact on the health and well-being of millions of people. As we continue to watch the events unfold, it is clear that much needs to be done to address the root causes of the Ebola outbreak and prevent its spread. From improving health systems and strengthening the capacity of local governments to responding quickly and effectively to outbreaks, there is much that can be done to ensure that Ebola is brought under control and that the people of Sierra Leone and other affected countries receive the support and assistance they need. In the meantime, the Sierra Leone football team will continue to work hard to prepare for their next match, hoping that they will have the opportunity to showcase their skills on the football pitch soon. And while they may have been prevented from entering Seychelles, their commitment to their sport and their country remains unwavering, a testament to the resilience and determination of the people of Sierra Leone.
