article: By . Harriet Arkell . A violent Jamaican woman who abducted a vulnerable man before torturing him for 17 hours will not be deported from Britain because a judge said social workers had failed her. The woman, known as Ms K, was sent to jail for five years for blackmail, false imprisonment and ABH after the 2009 attack - related to a drugs dispute - which left the mentally ill man fearing for his life after he was tied up. Upon her release from prison, Home Secretary Theresa May wanted to send the woman back to Jamaica, but lost after it was decided that failures by London social workers had turned the woman into a violent criminal.

The woman was born in Jamaica and stayed there after her mother moved to Britain in 1992, suffering beatings at the hands of her Jamaican grandmother and being raped at the age of eight. In 1994, she was sent to London to join her mother and stepfather but was raped again by her stepfather's brother and a friend of the family. Ms K was then put into care and given a good foster family, but a mistake in paperwork meant that she was removed from there and transferred to a children's home. There she suffered yet more beatings and was sexually abused. After social workers let her mother remove her from care, Enfield social services were told she was being beaten by her mother in 2006.Â  Despite them hearing that the young woman was suicidal as a result, they did nothing, it was reported today. The family moved to the London borough of Haringey, where social workers failed to protect both Baby P and Victoria Climbie, but again social services failed to help, despite an A&E doctor warning Ms K was 'slipping through the net', the Sun reported. The woman was arrested in October 2009 after the torture of the vulnerable man. Social workers at Haringey Council, pictured, were blamed for letting the woman 'slip through the net' After her sentence finished, a tribunal overruled the Home Secretary's wish to send her back to Jamaica, saying: 'The state's failure to look after her has greatly contributed to her involvement in crime and her mental illness.' An appeal by Mrs May failed when Judge Ken Craig backed the tribunal's decision, citing a list of failures by North London councils Enfield and Haringey and saying that sending the woman back to Jamaica would be 'unconscionable'. Spokesmen for Haringey and Enfield Councils declined to comment today.

chatgpt: A violent immigrant has been found guilty of abducting and torturing a vulnerable man in a 17-hour ordeal. The woman, who came to Britain from Jamaica in 1994, was imprisoned in 2009. After her release, former Prime Minister Theresa May tried to have her sent back to Jamaica. However, a tribunal overruled the decision, citing "the state's failure to look after her." The woman had been put in care after suffering a catalogue of rapes and beatings. Social workers from Enfield and Haringey councils had failed to protect her. The woman's traumatic experiences left her with severe mental health problems that helped explain her violent behavior. The victim was a vulnerable man who suffered from learning disabilities. He was abducted by the woman and held hostage for 17 hours. She beat him with a metal bar, a broomstick, and a stiletto shoe. She also poured boiling water over him, causing him to suffer life-threatening burns. After the ordeal, the woman forced the victim to sign a letter saying that he had not been harmed. She then took him to a police station and claimed that he had been stealing from her. The court heard how the woman had a long history of violence and criminal behavior. She had been arrested several times for assault and had served time in prison for stabbing her former partner. The case has again raised concerns about the effectiveness of the UK's care system. The woman's case highlights the need for better support and protection for vulnerable individuals who are at risk of harm or abuse. The woman was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the abduction and torture of the vulnerable man. Her case is a stark reminder of the importance of protecting those who are at risk from violence and abuse. In conclusion, the violent immigrant who abducted and tortured a vulnerable man in a 17-hour ordeal has been sentenced to 23 years in prison. Her case highlights the need for better protection for vulnerable individuals and raises concerns about the effectiveness of the UK's care system. The court ruling also sends a strong message that such violent criminal behavior will not be tolerated, and justice will be served for those who are victims of such acts.
