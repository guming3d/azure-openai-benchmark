chatgpt: A shocking video that went viral on social media this week shows a 17-year-old girl named Shamichael Manuel being brutally beaten up by her so-called friend named Sharkeisha. The video was initially posted on Instagram, but it was later removed after it sparked outrage throughout the online community. According to Manuel, she had no idea why Sharkeisha had attacked her. The two were allegedly friends, and Manuel had no indication that Sharkeisha was angry with her. In the disturbing video, Sharkeisha can be seen delivering blow after blow to Manuel's head while she laid on the ground helpless. The incident has sparked a conversation about the dangers of social media and the negative impact it can have on young people. Many are calling for stricter regulations on content posted online, especially when it involves violence or the exploitation of vulnerable individuals. Initially, it was reported that Sharkeisha was a 22-year-old woman from North Carolina. However, it has since been revealed that the real Sharkeisha is actually a 16-year-old student from Texas. It is unclear why someone would use her name to post such a horrific video, but Sharkeisha (the real one) has since spoken out about the incident. In a statement released by her family, Sharkeisha apologized for the video and said that she had no involvement in it. She also expressed her sympathy for Manuel and condemned those who took part in the attack. "My family and I were shocked and saddened by the video that was posted online," the statement read. "We want to make it clear that I had nothing to do with it, and we do not condone violence in any form. We hope that Shamichael makes a full recovery and that justice is served against those who hurt her." Manuel has since received support from many individuals online who have reached out to offer their condolences and express their outrage over the incident. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help with her medical bills, and it has already raised thousands of dollars. The incident has also prompted a discussion about the importance of recognizing the signs of bullying and abuse and taking action to prevent it. Many have called for more resources to be made available to young people who are struggling with their mental health or who are victims of bullying. The Shamichael Manuel case serves as a tragic reminder of the dangers that exist in our digital age. It is up to all of us to take responsibility for our actions and to use social media in a positive way. We must work together to create a safer and more inclusive world for all of us.
