article: Guatemala City (CNN) -- Software mogul John McAfee could be deported to Belize on Thursday after being detained by immigration officials, a Guatemalan official said. Authorities took McAfee into custody Wednesday, said Francisco Cuevas, a spokesman for Guatemala's president, Otto Perez Molina. He is accused of entering Guatemala illegally. After weeks in hiding, the 67-year-old Internet security pioneer emerged publicly Tuesday in Guatemala's capital, hundreds of miles from the Caribbean island in Belize where his next-door neighbor was found dead.

Guatemala's foreign minister said earlier Wednesday that officials there did not know how McAfee entered the country and that there was no record of McAfee entering legally at any official border crossing. McAfee's lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, filed a formal request for asylum with Guatemalan officials Wednesday. He said McAfee left Belize to escape police persecution. Belize authorities have said they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 shooting of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. "I had nothing to do with his death," McAfee wrote on his website Tuesday in a message to Faull's family. "I have lost five close family members in my 67 years and I know your suffering."

He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994 and moved to Belize in 2008. The case began to unfold on November 9, when McAfee told police someone had poisoned four of his dogs. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, a former girlfriend said. Officials say the dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door. McAfee lived in the remote northern part of Ambergris Caye. Read more: Bizarre visit to McAfee's pleasure palace in Belize . Two days later, someone shot Faull in the head in his own living room. A 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor, and Faull was found dead on the second floor. McAfee told CNN in the interview that he did not kill Faull and did not pay anybody to kill the man. He said he will not surrender to police for questioning, adding that his priority is to clear his name. Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads. A 2009 story in the New York Times indicated that McAfee's fortune had plunged to $4 million from its $100 million peak, largely because of the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report.

chatgpt: John McAfee, known for his involvement in the development of the McAfee antivirus software, could be deported back to Belize, where he is wanted for questioning in connection to the murder of his neighbor, Gregory Faull. On Wednesday, Guatemalan immigration authorities detained McAfee, who was on the run from Belizean authorities for over three weeks. McAfee's lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, has filed a request for asylum on behalf of his client, and the Guatemalan government is expected to make a decision on the matter in the coming days. Guerra argues that McAfee's life is in danger if he is extradited to Belize, where he claims he would be tortured and killed. Belizean authorities have been attempting to question McAfee in connection to the murder of Faull, who was found dead in his home on November 11. McAfee has denied any involvement in the crime and has gone into hiding ever since. He believes that he is being targeted by Belizean authorities due to his refusal to pay bribes to government officials. McAfee's journey to Guatemala began after he illegally entered the country to evade Belizean authorities. The 67-year-old tech entrepreneur has lived a colorful life, with a long history of legal troubles, including arrests for drug and weapons charges. He also ran for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination in 2016. The case has received significant media attention, with many outlets speculating whether McAfee is a victim of government persecution or a suspect in a murder case. Supporters of McAfee argue that the Belizean government is engaging in an unlawful witch hunt against him, while others speculate that his eccentric behavior may have led to his involvement in the murder. The extradition process between Guatemala and Belize is complicated, and it is unclear whether McAfee will eventually be sent back to Belize. The two countries do not have an extradition treaty, which means that the process could be prolonged and complex, requiring cooperation from both governments. If the Guatemalan government decides to grant McAfee asylum, it would prevent his extradition to Belize and allow him to remain in the country legally. However, it is unclear how long this process will take and whether or not the Guatemalan government will ultimately grant McAfee asylum. The case highlights the complexities of extradition and asylum law and illustrates the need for cross-border cooperation when it comes to criminal investigations. It is unclear when a final decision will be made on the fate of John McAfee, but the eyes of the world are watching as the story unfolds.
