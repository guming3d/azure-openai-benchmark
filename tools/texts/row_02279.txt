The ex-Tottenham manager had also been heavily linked with the Queens Park Rangers job and held talks about succeeding Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road last week.

USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann is second favourite to get the job and the American connection with Lerner could prove pivotal in his decision.

According to the latest odds released by leading bookmakers, Tim Sherwood is the favourite to take over at the club. Sherwood is known for his stint as the manager of Tottenham Hotspur, where he took over from Andre Villas-Boas mid-season and led the team to sixth place in the league. He has also been an assistant manager at Aston Villa in the past, making him familiar with the club's workings.

Former Celtic manager Neil Lennon and US national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann have also been linked with the post.

Klinsmann, who has played and managed at the highest level, is widely regarded as one of the best coaches in the world.
