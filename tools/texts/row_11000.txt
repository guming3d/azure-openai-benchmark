article: By . Michael Zennie . A set of mastodon tucks and a stone-age tool dredged together out of the Chesapeake Bay by fishermen suggest that human could have settled in North America thousands of years before previously thought, according to a controversial new study. The mastodon remains are 22,000 years old, according to radio-carbon dating - up to ten thousand years older than the Clovis culture, thought to be the first settlers in the Western Hemisphere. Most researchers believe the first humans inhabited North America between 13,000 and 16,500 years ago after crossing the Bering Strait land bridge from Asia. This flint tool, which was found with a 22,000-year-old mastodon skull in the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay. It could be proof that humans inhabited America up to ten thousands years before previously thought . The mastodon tusk that was hacked off a skull found in the Chesapeake was carbon-dated to 22,000 years old . Despite the incredible claims, much of the archaeological community remains skeptical, Live Science reports. 'The bottom line is, there simply is no context for these discoveries,' University of Arizona-Tuscon archaeologist Vance Holliday told the site. He added: 'There's absolutely no DNA evidence.' Just because the two items were found together, he argues, doesn't meant that they were from the same time frame. There is no way to prove the flint tool is as old as the mastodon skull, Dr Holliday said. The incredible archaeological find was discovered in 230 feet of water 60 miles off shore in 1974. Fishermen who were dragging their scalloping nets across the bottom of the bay snagged a massive mastodon skull and dragged it to the surface. Also in the net was a flint knife. The skull of the giant ice-age beast was too big to carry back to shore, so the crew cut off the tusks and teeth and threw the rest back in the water. The captain of the boat donated his artifacts to the local Gwynn's Island Museum in Virginia, where the sat unnoticed for near 40 decades. These are the teeth hacked from the mastodon skull in 1974. They suggest the beast was less than 30 years old when it died . They were re-discovered by a University of Delaware geologist, who alertedÂ Dennis Stanford, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution. Dr Stanford believes that the tool shows wear - proof, he says, that it was used before it was submerged in water. The Chesapeake has been underwater since the last ice age ended 14,000 years ago - meaning the tool is at least 14,000 years old. Dr Stanford, however, believes it was used to butcher the mastodon, which would make it 22,000 years old, according to Live Science.

chatgpt: Archaeologists have found a mastodon skull with a flint knife attached to it in the Chesapeake Bay in 1974. This discovery has been found to be around 22,000 years old, making it a crucial find in the evolutionary timeline of the Americas. According to experts, this discovery has the potential to rewrite the history of the region and the world. The find indicates that humans were in America much earlier than previously thought. Historians believed that the human race migrated to America around 12,000 years ago, but this discovery challenges that very notion. The flint knife found with the skull is a clear indication of human activity, and researchers are excited about the potential it holds in shedding new light on the continent's history. The mastodon skull was recovered by Nicholas Luccketti and his team from the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay. The area was once an open plain that was probably the hunting ground of ancient humans. The discovery has set off a whirlwind of activity in academic circles, with experts clamoring to study the flint knife and the skull to gain critical insights into the early human population of the Americas. This finding is significant as it may help explain the origin and development of human migration patterns. According to Patricia Spear, Director of the National Museum of Natural History, the discovery of a mastodon skull with a flint knife in it offers valuable clues to the cultural history of the Americas. The discovery could indicate that there were several waves of migration into the region, beginning much earlier than historians previously believed. The discovery of the mastodon skull also indicates the possibility that ancient humans hunted the now-extinct mastodon. The prehistoric animal was about the same size as an elephant and roamed the Americas before its extinction 11,000 years ago. The finding of the animal's skull with a flint knife in it suggests that humans might have hunted and killed it using these weapons. The find has generated a lot of excitement within the archaeological community, who are eager to conduct further investigations into the early history of the Americas. The discovery has prompted archaeologists to look deeper into the coastal regions, where ancient populations might have lived. In summary, the discovery of the mastodon skull with a flint knife in it is a significant milestone in the history of the Americas. It presents valuable clues to the cultural history of the region and could potentially rewrite the history of human migration. The find has spurred further interest and research, and there is no doubt that more revelations will emerge in the coming years.
