Friends close to the couple say that their relationship is going from "strength to strength," and it certainly looks like things are getting serious. The pair was recently spotted together enjoying a cozy meal at a trendy West End restaurant, where eyewitnesses report they were openly flirting over a bottle of wine.

Despite the restaurant being packed with other diners, the couple had a private, secluded booth where they could enjoy each other's company without any interruptions. While Pippa has been linked to a number of high-profile men in the past, sources say that James is different. He is said to be down to earth, genuine and a true gentleman. "He's the kind of guy who would go out of his way to make you feel special," said one friend. "Pippa is really happy with him." The couple first sparked rumors of a romance in September when they were seen together at a charity event in London. Since then, they have been spotted out and about on several occasions, always looking happy and relaxed in each other's company.
