article: (CNN) -- The fallout from Adam Lambert's risqu√© American Music Awards performance keeps coming with "Good Morning America" canceling the singer's live performance scheduled for Wednesday morning. ABC was flooded with more than 1,500 complaints, and the network sent an e-mail to potential concert goers letting them know that Lambert would not be performing on Wednesday. "Given Adam Lambert's controversial live performance on the AMAs, we were concerned about airing a similar concert so early in the morning," a spokesperson for the network said. "The Early Show" on rival network CBS was quick to announce that they have booked Lambert to perform and discuss the controversy on Wednesday morning. Lambert shocked viewers with his sexually suggestive dance sequence that included simulated oral sex as well as Lambert kissing his male keyboardist. The Parents Television Council, a Media watchdog group, also attacked the show as vulgar and urged its members on Monday to contact ABC, Dick Clark Productions and the show's advertisers with complaints about the content. "Last night's 'American Music Awards' broadcast was nothing short of tasteless and vulgar. Adam Lambert, the second-place finisher in last season's 'American Idol' competition, chose to treat American families to simulated oral sex and other demeaning behavior," the PTC posted on its Web site. Melissa Henson, director of communications and public education for the PTC, said the council wasn't concerned about Lambert's gay kiss. Its issue and focus are on the simulated oral sex, she said. "The gender has nothing to do with it," Henson said. "It would be true if it had been a woman's face that was thrust into his crotch." Henson also noted that this is not an anti-Adam Lambert campaign and said the council would have had no problem with Lambert performing live on "Good Morning America." "As long as he keeps it clean," Henson said.

chatgpt: ABC's "Good Morning America" has cancelled Adam Lambert's live performance, following the controversy that surrounded his sexually suggestive dance sequence at the American Music Awards (AMAs). According to reports, the network has received more than 1,500 complaints after Lambert's performance at the AMAs.  Lambert, who rose to fame in 2009 as a finalist on "American Idol," has been known for his flamboyant stage presence and over-the-top performances. However, many viewers were shocked by his risque performance on the AMAs, which featured the singer simulating sex acts and kissing his male bandmates. The controversy surrounding Lambert's performance led to a swift backlash on social media and calls for boycotts from conservative groups. ABC quickly issued an apology for the performance, but the damage was already done.  The cancellation of Lambert's live performance on "Good Morning America" is just the latest sign that the singer's actions at the AMAs have had serious consequences. Many fans of the singer have expressed disappointment, while others have sympathized with his artistic expression.  Lambert himself has addressed the controversy in interviews, explaining that he was simply trying to "push the boundaries" and "start a conversation" with his performance. He has also expressed regret at the negative reaction, stating that he never intended to offend anyone. Despite the backlash, Lambert's career appears to be on solid ground. The singer recently released his fourth studio album, "Velvet," and has continued to tour and perform around the world. While some conservative groups may continue to criticize his performances, it seems likely that Lambert will continue to push boundaries and test the limits of what is acceptable in pop music.  In the end, the controversy surrounding Lambert's performance at the AMAs may have brought attention to important issues related to artistic expression and freedom of speech. Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, it is clear that Lambert's performance has sparked a much-needed conversation about these important issues.
