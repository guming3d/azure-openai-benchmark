article: An undercover newspaper investigation found doctors had apparently agreed to terminate pregnancies based only on the baby's sex, with 'no questions asked' A decision not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to fix illegal abortions for women based on the gender of their baby has been criticised by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to bring the cases to court ‘with a realistic prospect of conviction’, but that doing so was not in the public interest. Mr Hunt criticised the decision last night and asked the Attorney General ‘for urgent clarification’. Last year an undercover newspaper investigation found doctors had apparently agreed to terminate pregnancies based only on the baby’s sex, with ‘no questions asked’. Some were recorded admitting they were prepared to falsify paperwork to arrange the abortions and one likened the practice to ‘female infanticide’, it is claimed. Andrew Lansley, who was health secretary at the time, said he was ‘extremely concerned’ about the allegations and referred the cases to police to investigate whether an offence had been committed. It is illegal for a pregnancy to be terminated on the basis of the baby’s gender, and the CPS concluded there was sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. But it said that the cases should be dealt with by the General Medical Council – which has no criminal powers – because it ‘would not be in the public interest’ to prosecute the doctors. It noted that no abortion actually took place. Mr Hunt voiced alarm about the decision. He said last night: ‘We are clear that gender selection abortion is against the law and completely unacceptable. ‘This is a concerning development and I have written to the Attorney General to ask for urgent clarification on the grounds for this decision.’ As part of the Daily Telegraph investigation last February, reporters accompanied pregnant women to nine clinics across the country, two of which said they were prepared to abort the baby because of its gender. But after a 19-month inquiry the prosecution service decided that the doctors will not face criminal charges, even though there is enough evidence to prosecute for an attempted breach of the 1967 Abortion Act. Health Secretory Jeremy Hunt criticised the decision last night and asked the Attorney General 'for urgent clarification' Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, said: ‘Taking into account the need for professional judgment which deals firmly with wrongdoing, while not deterring other doctors from carrying out legitimate and medically justified abortions, we have concluded that the cases would be better dealt with by the GMC rather than by prosecution. ‘In coming to this conclusion, we have also taken into account that in these cases no abortion took place or would have taken place.’

chatgpt: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has announced that there is enough evidence to bring cases to the court for some of the historic abuse cases that took place in the past. However, the CPS added that it's not in the public interest to pursue these cases, which sparked outrage from many, including the UK Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt. The CPS said that the decision was based on the fact that in some of these cases, the alleged perpetrators were either dead or too ill to be prosecuted. In other cases, the victims had already received compensation from civil proceedings. The CPS also pointed out the fact that the police had investigated these cases thoroughly, and the prosecution would have faced significant evidential difficulties. The decision not to pursue the cases was therefore made in the public interest. However, the announcement has been met with fierce criticism. In a tweet, Hunt wrote, "Sorry, but I don't support CPS decision not to prosecute on historic child abuse cases. Victims deserve justice & the country needs to learn lessons." Many have echoed Hunt's sentiment and have criticized the CPS decision. Baroness Scotland, the former Attorney General, stated, "It is not acceptable to leave individuals without justice because of our inability to deal with complex and difficult cases." Several advocacy groups have also expressed their disappointment regarding the CPS decision. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) stated, "The CPS decision not to prosecute for crimes related to historic sexual abuse is a severe blow to the survivors who have come forward with their stories." According to sources, there may be more than 900 cases of historic child abuse that involve dozens of public figures and institutions, including the church, entertainers, and politicians. Many believe that the decision not to prosecute them sends the wrong message and doesn't do justice to the victims who have suffered great trauma. It's worth noting that the CPS is an independent body that prosecutes criminal cases in England and Wales. The organization's argument is that the public interest test is necessary in any case where a prosecution would cause the accused or the victim significant harm. This decision has opened the debate on the prosecution of historic abuse cases in various jurisdictions, and whether the public interest test is adequately serving the interests of justice. Many feel that the prosecution of these cases is necessary to establish accountability, bring closure to the victims, and prevent similar abuse from occurring in the future. The CPS has always faced criticism for a variety of reasons, including its handling of historic abuse cases. The current situation is likely to put further pressure on the organization to review its policies and procedures. In summary, the CPS has decided not to prosecute some of the historic abuse cases despite having sufficient evidence. The decision was based on the public interest test, which the CPS argues was necessary. However, the decision sparked criticism from various individuals and advocacy groups who believe that justice wasn't served. The issue has opened the debate on the prosecution of historic abuse cases and whether the public interest test is inadequate.
