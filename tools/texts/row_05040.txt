article: By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Ministers should spend up to £1billion of taxpayers’ money to persuade lonely older people to use the internet, an influential think-tank said yesterday. Encouraging the elderly to log on would ease the isolation of those who live alone while saving many millions for the NHS and in state-subsidised care home places, according to the Policy Exchange. The cost of internet education for the more than six million people who do not know how to use it would amount to £875million – or £141 each – said the think-tank, which has close links to David Cameron. But the savings would be almost double that. Going online: More than six million people still do not know how to use the internet (posed by models) At present, four in ten over-65s do not have access to the internet. The report said everyone in Britain should have the skills and confidence to go online by 2020. It added that one in ten patients who visit their GP do so because they are lonely rather than due to illness. Isolated people are more likely to need emergency hospital beds or admission to care homes. The number of people aged 85 or over is set to double in the next 20 years, with many living hundreds of miles from family members. Report author Eddie Copeland said: ‘In an increasingly isolated and fast moving world it is vital that everyone in society is able to use the internet and understand its benefits. ‘From alleviating social isolation, bringing together communities, paying bills and now accessing public services, online can improve lives.’ Many pensioners visit GPs or hospitals partly out of loneliness, said the think tank (picture posed by models) He added: ‘Being able to simply write an email or access a social networking site could provide older people with a way to stay connected to their friends and families, who may live hundreds of miles away. ‘Maintaining these important relationships will help an ageing society vulnerable to loneliness.' Some 29 per cent of people over 65 have still never used the internet, according to figures by the Office for National Statistics issued in the first quarter of this year. Among over-75s nearly two in three, three million people, have never used the internet.

chatgpt: A new report from the Policy Exchange, a think-tank with links to former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, has suggested that providing internet education for six million people could result in significant savings for the UK government. The report found that such a scheme would cost £875m or £141 per person, but could lead to double the savings due to the reduced pressure on GPs and carers. The report notes that a lack of digital skills is a major challenge for many people in the UK, particularly older people and those with disabilities. The internet is increasingly essential for accessing public services, job hunting, shopping, and keeping in touch with family and friends. However, many people are unable to take advantage of these opportunities due to a lack of skills or access to the right technology. The Policy Exchange report argues that a comprehensive scheme to provide internet education would be a worthwhile investment for the UK government. The study estimates that such an initiative could lead to savings of up to £1.7bn due to reduced pressure on GPs and carers. In addition, the report highlights the potential economic benefits of providing internet access to more people, including increased productivity and innovation. The report also suggests that the benefits of the scheme would not be limited to individuals who receive internet education. The wider community would benefit from a reduction in demand for health and social care services, as people become more self-sufficient and less reliant on these services. Additionally, the report notes that providing internet education could help to reduce social isolation and improve mental health, particularly for older people. The Policy Exchange report has been welcomed by many experts in the field of digital inclusion. Sarah Mitchell, the Director of Policy and Strategy at the Good Things Foundation, a UK-based charity which aims to promote digital inclusion, stated that the report was "a welcome contribution to the debate on the importance of digital skills". Mitchell also highlighted the need for government funding to support effective digital inclusion initiatives. However, some have argued that the suggested scheme may not be the most effective way to promote digital inclusion. Victoria Betton, the Founder and Director of mHabitat, a social enterprise which uses technology to improve health and social care services, suggested that the government should focus on improving access to technology and infrastructure rather than solely on education. Regardless of these critiques, the Policy Exchange report highlights the urgent need for more action to support digital inclusion in the UK. As technology becomes increasingly essential to modern life, it is crucial that everyone has the skills and resources they need to participate in the digital world.
