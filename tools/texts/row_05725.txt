article: (CNN)  -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has done a U-turn over the use of goal-line technology and apologized to the English and Mexican football associations for controversial refereeing decisions in their last 16 defeats. FIFA confirmed to CNN Tuesday that the next meeting of its International FA Board from July 21-22 in Wales would discuss technology but the use of video replays is ruled out. Frank Lampard's goal that never was as England trailed 2-1 just before halftime in their last 16 match against Germany, prompted widespread calls for the introduction of goal-line technology after his shot clearly crossed the line. In a later match on Sunday, Argentina's Carlos Tevez scored a hotly-disputed opening goal against Mexico in their 3-1 victory and television replays, which were broadcast on big screens at the ground, showed him to be offside. Blog: Just give us truth, introduce goal-line technology . Blatter told a media briefing in Johannesburg: "It happened in 1966 and then 44 years later -- though it was not quite the same," the UK's Press Association reported. This was a reference to England's disputed third goal against West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final where arguments have raged for years over whether Geoff Hurst's shot crossed the line. "I apologized to England and Mexico. "The English said 'thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some, and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it." But the Swiss is still set against the wider use of video technology where play might be stopped to allow a replay to be examined. "The only principle we are going to bring back for discussion is goal-line technology," he said . Time for football to embrace technology ? "Football is a game that never stops and the moment there was a discussion if the ball was in or out, or there was a goal-scoring opportunity, do we give a possibility to a team to call for replays once or twice like in tennis? "For situations like the Mexico game you don't need technology." Blatter added that the world governing body would launch a new drive to improve refereeing standards at the highest level later this year. "We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high level referees," he said. "We will start with a new concept of how to improve match control. I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed."

chatgpt: In a major development for the future of football, FIFA president Sepp Blatter has announced that they will now be considering the use of goal-line technology. The move comes after much debate and criticism over the years regarding crucial missed calls by referees in determining whether or not a goal has been scored. Blatter acknowledged during a press conference that mistakes by officials could cost a team a win, or even an entire tournament. He noted that the use of technology to get these calls right is important to the integrity of the game. While the use of goal-line technology is a step in the right direction for many football fans and players, it follows a controversial and disappointing conclusion to the Round of 16 for both England and Mexico in the 2010 World Cup. Blatter apologized for the refereeing decisions that ultimately led to both teams being eliminated from the competition. England was denied a crucial goal against Germany when Frank Lampard's shot hit the crossbar and then clearly crossed the goal line, but was not awarded by the officials. On the other hand, Carlos Tevez's goal for Argentina against Mexico may have been allowed to stand despite being offside. Blatter has ruled out the wider use of video technology to help referees, citing concerns about potential delays and disrupting the flow of the game. He emphasized that goal-line technology was the only technology that FIFA was willing to consider at this time. This decision does not come as a surprise to many observers, as FIFA has been hesitant to implement video replay technology in the past. Supporters of video replays have argued that it will help referees make the right calls on critical decisions like goals, fouls, and penalties. However, FIFA has resisted such measures, citing concerns about the disruption of the flow of the game and a potential impact on the job of the officials. Blatter's latest comments seem to suggest that the use of technology in football may still be a contentious issue for some time to come. In conclusion, the consideration of goal-line technology by FIFA is a move applauded by many who have long been advocating for the introduction of technology in football. However, concerns remain about the need for additional technology to support referees in making accurate decisions. Blatter's refusal to consider further measures may leave some unhappy, but the hope is that the use of goal-line technology will at least ensure that crucial goal-scoring decisions are not missed in the future.
