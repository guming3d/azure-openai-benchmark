article: The broadcast regulator Ofcom has been asked by cable giant Virgin Media to open a formal investigation into the way the Premier League sells its TV rights. Virgin Media claims fans are forced to pay over the odds to watch games on television and that a further 60% rise in the cost of the rights is predicted in the next auction . Brigitte Trafford, Virgin Media's chief corporate affairs officer, said in a statement: 'The rapidly rising cost of Premier League live broadcast rights means UK fans pay the highest prices in Europe to watch football on TV. Virgin Media has asked Ofcom to investigate how the rights are sold ahead of the next auction.' Virgin Media has asked Ofcom to open an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 claiming that 'significant consumer harm resulting from escalating rights costs' can be addressed by making changes to the way in which live rights are sold. Sky Sports paid the Premier League over £2billion for 116 live games a season over three years . Newcomers BT Sport acquired 38 live Premier League games per season at a cost of £738million . Michael Owen working as a pundit for BT Sport . The Premier League's current domestic live TV rights increased by 70 per cent to £3billion after Sky and BT Sport shared seven packages in the last auction for the 2013-16 rights. The next Premier League tender is expected to go out in the new year with the next set of three-year deals announced before the end of the season. A Virgin Media statement said: 'A review is required with the next auction imminent and a further 60% inflation in costs predicted.' The company filed its complaint with Ofcom two weeks ago and a decision is expected in late October or early November. Virgin Media's complaint is understood to suggest that fans in the UK have to pay £51 monthly for access to all top-flight matches on TV, while it is £25 in Italy, £21 in Germany, £18 in Spain and £10 in France. Virgin Media is not planning to bid for the Premier League rights but carries Sky Sports and BT Sport on its cable networks, so it passes on the costs of live Premier League football to its own customers. Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, said earlier this year the company had no intention to bid for live Premier League TV rights. The complaint to Ofcom claims consumers do not benefit from competition between channel providers in terms of the cost, and that the restriction on the number of matches being shown live limits consumer choice.

chatgpt: Virgin Media has accused broadcasters of forcing sports fans to pay excessively high prices to watch live Premier League games. The company's CEO, Tom Mockridge, has called for greater transparency in the pricing of sports channels, claiming that current prices are "ridiculous". Mockridge cited the deals struck by companies such as Sky Sports and BT Sport for exclusive rights to show Premier League matches. Sky Sports paid a staggering £2.28 billion for the rights to broadcast 116 live games per season, while BT Sport forked out £738 million for just 38 live games a season from 2013 to 2016. Virgin Media has long been a vocal opponent of the high prices charged by broadcasters for live sports coverage. The company claims that many fans are being priced out of the market, with subscription fees for sports channels often costing more than other household bills. Mockridge argued that broadcasters should be required to publish the cost of their content and the fees they charge to distributors, adding that the current system is not transparent enough. He suggested that the current pricing model is unsustainable and that fans will eventually be forced to switch off. Virgin Media has also accused broadcasters of using their dominant positions to stifle competition and unfairly hike prices. The company has called for Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, to investigate the issue and put a cap on the amount broadcasters can charge for their content. The dispute over the high cost of sports channels has been ongoing for several years, with Virgin Media one of the most vocal opponents. In 2014, the company launched a legal challenge against BT, accusing the telecoms company of using its position as a wholesale supplier to undercut rivals. However, the case was eventually dropped. The Premier League has also faced criticism over the amount of money involved in broadcasting rights. Critics argue that the huge sums paid by broadcasters have inflated transfer fees and wages, creating an unsustainable bubble that could burst at any time. Despite this, interest in the Premier League remains as high as ever. The league is the most-watched professional sports league in the world, with a cumulative audience of 4.7 billion people in 212 territories last season. The current broadcasting deals are set to expire at the end of the 2018/19 season, paving the way for renewed negotiations over the cost of access to Premier League matches. It remains to be seen whether Virgin Media's calls for greater transparency and lower prices will be heeded by broadcasters, and whether the current system will be overhauled.
