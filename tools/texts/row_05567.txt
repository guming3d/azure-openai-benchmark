Argentina are getting ready for their World Cup quarter-final showdown with Belgium where Lionel Messi can win his fifth man-of-the-match award in as many games. Coach Alejandro Sabella will hope the Barcelona maestro produces another pivotal performance when they take to the Estadio Nacional pitch in Brasilia in a bid to reach the final four. Sabella, though, has been on the defensive for his other forwards, insisting striker Gonzalo Higuain is pulling his weight despite not scoring yet.

Napoli player Higuain has been struggling for fitness after an ankle injury in May, and Messi has been heavily relied on for goals so far. The 26-year-old, playing at the centre of a three-man attack, has had little joy against defenders, but Sabella thinks his form is improving as the tournament goes on. The Argentina boss said: 'We all have a lot of confidence in him because he is a great player who is doing a great job for the team. What's missing is the goalscoring. 'He is improving every day. In the last match he ran more than any other player. He sacrifices himself for the team. 'All strikers need to score goals, but also help the team. 'I'm staying calm. Hopefully the goal will arrive soon.' But with Sergio Aguero's injury, Carlos Tevez being excluded and Higuain yet to find his feet in Brazil, Sabella may lean on Messi once more.

chatgpt: Argentina Train at Estadio Nacional in Brasilia Ahead of World Cup Quarter-Final Against Belgium The Argentina national football team trained at Estadio Nacional in Brasilia ahead of their World Cup quarter-final match against Belgium on Saturday. Led by captain Lionel Messi, the Argentine squad trained under the scorching heat of the Brazilian sun as they prepared for their next match in the tournament. Messi, who is in sensational form in the World Cup, will be going for his fifth man-of-the-match award in as many games when Argentina takes on Belgium. The Barcelona forward has been instrumental in guiding Argentina through to the quarter-finals, scoring four goals in the tournament so far. Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella defended striker Gonzalo Higuain, who is yet to score in the tournament, ahead of the match against Belgium. "Football is not only about goals, it's not fair to focus only on the goal-scorers," Sabella said in a press conference. "Gonzalo (Higuain) is a player who works hard for the team, we know how important he is for us and we have confidence in him." Higuain, who plays for Italian club Napoli, scored 25 goals in 46 appearances for the club in the 2013-2014 season. He is expected to start alongside Messi and Sergio Aguero in the quarter-final match. Argentina, who finished top of Group F, defeated Switzerland 1-0 in the round of 16 to advance to the quarter-finals. Belgium, who finished top of Group H, defeated the United States 2-1 in extra time in their round of 16 match. Argentina and Belgium have met twice before in the World Cup, with Argentina winning both matches. The last time they met was in the 1986 World Cup semi-finals, where Argentina won 2-0. The match between Argentina and Belgium is expected to be a tense affair, with both teams looking to advance to the semi-finals. Argentina, who have won the World Cup twice before, are one of the favorites to win the tournament this year. Messi, who is widely regarded as one of the best footballers in the world, will be looking to add a World Cup trophy to his already impressive list of achievements. The Argentine squad will be hoping for a strong performance against Belgium on Saturday, as they look to continue their journey towards the ultimate prize in football â€“ the World Cup trophy.
