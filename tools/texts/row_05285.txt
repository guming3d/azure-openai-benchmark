article: (CNN) -- The European Tour has dropped Bahrain from its 2012 schedule. The second Volvo Golf Champions tournament was due to be played at the Royal Golf Club, a course designed by British golfer Colin Montgomerie, in January next year. But following a crackdown on anti-government protestors that left at least 32 people dead the European Tour has decided to drop Bahrain from the schedule, for now at least. "With work still ongoing to resolve issues in Bahrain and the need to confirm the venue by the end of July 2011, the difficult decision to postpone the event for 2012 was taken," the Tour said in a statement. But Bahrain would, it confirmed, remain on its roster. "We know that Bahrain is working hard to address the issues it has faced in recent months, as well as to reach out to the international community," said George O'Grady from the European Tour. "We, together with the European Tour players, look forward to returning and building on that first, very successful, event in the future." The postponement of next January's tournament will be seen as another blow to a Bahrain government keen to show the world that stability has returned to the island following months of anti-government unrest. In June motor sport's governing body, the FIA, cancelled Bahrain's 2011 F1 Grand Prix amid security fears. Red Bull's Australian driver Mark Webber raised ethical concerns about hosting a major sporting event in the Kingdom. "In my personal opinion, the sport should have taken a much firmer stance earlier this year rather than constantly delaying its decision in the hope of being able to reschedule it in 2011," Webber wrote on his personal web site in June. "It would have sent a very clear message about F1's position on something as fundamental as human rights and how it deals with moral issues." FIFA has also asked the Bahraini authorities to explain the jailing of several national football team players. Alaa Hubail, a striker who played 52 times for his country, was sentenced to two years in prison for his involvement in "illegal protests". A spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the sentences being handed down to protestors. "There are serious concerns that the due process rights of the defendants, many of whom are well-known human rights defenders, were not respected and the trials appear to bear the marks of political persecution," said Ravina Shamdasani. When asked by CNN about the arrest of the footballers the Bahraini FA confirmed several had been arrested, but claimed they had been treated fairly according to the law. "The players have been arrested, investigated and detained for having opposed the general laws and bylaws of the country," the vice-president of the Bahraini Football Association, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa al Khalifa, told CNN back in June before Hubail's sentence was handed down. "The fact that they happen to be footballers and national team players is highly irrelevant."

chatgpt: In a significant move, the European Tour has announced that it has dropped Bahrain from its 2012 schedule, citing the political unrest in the country as the reason for this decision. The Volvo Golf Champions, which was due to be played at Bahrain's Royal Golf Club, has been postponed indefinitely, although the Tour has expressed the hope that it will return to the country in the future. This decision comes in the wake of the cancellation of Bahrain's Formula One Grand Prix, which was due to take place earlier this year. The event was cancelled following widespread protests by activists who demanded greater political freedoms and an end to the country's authoritarian rule. The European Tour's decision to drop Bahrain from its schedule is a clear indication of the impact that the political unrest in the country is having on sports events. While Bahrain has long been a popular destination for sports, including golf, the current climate of political uncertainty has made it difficult for organisers to proceed with events without the risk of disruption or cancellations. The Tour's decision has been met with mixed reactions. While some have praised the move as a principled stance against human rights abuses in the country, others have criticised it as being overly cautious and lacking in resolve. Some commentators have questioned the Tour's commitment to human rights, pointing out that it has continued to hold events in countries such as China and Dubai, which have been accused of human rights abuses. The Tour itself has defended its decision, stating that the safety and security of its players and staff is a top priority. It has also expressed the hope that it will be able to return to Bahrain in the future, once the political situation in the country has stabilised. The postponement of the Volvo Golf Champions has been a significant blow to Bahrain's Royal Golf Club, which had been eagerly anticipating the event. The tournament was set to showcase the club's world-class facilities and attract top players from around the world. In a statement, the Royal Golf Club expressed its disappointment at the Tour's decision, but emphasised its commitment to providing a safe and welcoming environment for players and visitors. The club also expressed the hope that the tournament would be rescheduled in the future, enabling it to showcase its facilities and promote the sport of golf in the region. The decision to drop Bahrain from its schedule is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the European Tour, which has struggled in recent years to maintain its position as one of the world's premier golfing organisations. With the cancellation of several high-profile events, including the BMW Championship and the HSBC Champions, the Tour has faced criticism from both fans and players. Despite these challenges, the Tour remains committed to promoting the sport of golf around the world. In a statement, the Tour's CEO Keith Pelley emphasised the importance of continuing to hold events in politically unstable regions, stating that "golf has the power to bring people together and promote tolerance and understanding, even in the most difficult of circumstances." As the political situation in Bahrain continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether the Tour will be able to make a return to the country in the future. Whatever happens, the decision to drop Bahrain from its schedule is a clear indication of the impact that political unrest is having on sports events, and highlights the need for organisations to carefully consider the safety and security of their players and staff when planning events in politically unstable regions.
