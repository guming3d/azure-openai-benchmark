article: (CNN) -- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has signed into law a ban on same-sex marriage in Africa's most populous nation. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry slammed the decision Monday. "Beyond even prohibiting same-sex marriage, this law dangerously restricts freedom of assembly, association and expression for all Nigerians," he said in a statement. "People everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality. No one should face violence or discrimination for who they are or who they love." Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, characterized the law as a "big setback for human rights for all Nigerians." According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the bill passed by the Senate at the end of last year introduces a 14-year prison sentence for people who are convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage or civil union. It also reportedly makes it an offense to administer, witness or help at a same-sex marriage ceremony. NAN said the law also forbids people from running gay clubs, societies, processions or meetings in Nigeria. The punishment for such acts is 10 years in prison, it said. And the law even states that marriages or civil unions from outside the country will be void inside the country, according to NAN. Last month, Uganda's parliament passed controversial legislation that would make some gay acts punishable by life in prison. For the bill to become law, it would need the signature of that county's president, who has 30 days to make a decision. Homosexuality is illegal in most African nations based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the British colonial era and perpetuated by cultural beliefs. Punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison. Worldwide, a growing number of countries now allow same-sex marriage, the majority of them in Europe. The Netherlands was the first, in 2001, and it was later joined by Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Portugal, Denmark and France. A bill to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales is also now law, though it isn't expected to come into force until later this year. French court rules mayors cannot block same-sex marriage . Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa are the non-European countries in the group, according to the Pew Research Center. Same-sex marriage is also legal in some parts of Mexico and the United States. CNN's Christian Purefoy, Marilia Brocchetto and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has signed a bill into law that criminalizes homosexuality. The bill, which imposes a 14-year prison sentence for same-sex marriage, has sparked outrage from human rights groups and the international community. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry slammed the Nigerian government for the decision, stating that the law is a "dangerous" and "deeply troubling" attack on human rights. Kerry also expressed concern that the law would affect the U.S.'s relationship with Nigeria, a key African ally. Homosexuality is already illegal in most African nations, but Nigeria's new law goes further than most, with punishments not only for same-sex marriage but also for anyone who is involved in or supports a same-sex relationship. The law has drawn criticism from around the world, with many arguing that it is a violation of human rights. Human Rights Watch has called the law "barbaric," while Amnesty International has labeled it a "breach of international human rights law." Many Nigerians, however, support the law, with demonstrations taking place in support of the legislation. Some have argued that the law is necessary to protect traditional African values and Christian morality. The Nigerian government has defended the law, arguing that it is in line with the wishes of the Nigerian people and that it is meant to protect the country's cultural and religious values. President Jonathan has stated that the law was passed in response to what he called "unrelenting pressure" from Western countries to legalize homosexuality. The Nigerian government has also criticized the international community's response to the law, accusing Western countries of imposing their values on Nigeria and interfering in the country's internal affairs. Despite the controversy surrounding the law, it is likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future. Nigeria is one of the most powerful and influential countries in Africa, and its leadership has shown no indication that it plans to back down in the face of international pressure. As the world continues to grapple with issues surrounding homosexuality and human rights, Nigeria's new law serves as a reminder of the challenges that remain in the fight for equality and justice for all.
