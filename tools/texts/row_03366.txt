article: Adnan el Shukrijumah, chief of global operations for Al-Qaeda, was killed in a raid by Pakistani military . The Pakistani military says they've killed a senior an Al-Qaeda leader who grew up in the United States and was on the FBI's most wanted list. Adnan el Shukrijumah, 39, was the chief of global operations for the terrorist group. He was killed along with two other suspected militants in Shinwarsak, South Waziristan,on Saturday. Shukrijumah, who lived in New York and Florida for 15 years, was accused of plotting to blow up the New York City subway. He also planned attacks on the London Underground and trains in Norway. Federal prosecutors say he recruited three men in 2008 to receive training in the lawless tribal region of Pakistan for carrying out attacks. He eventually took over a position once held by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed —  the mastermind of the Sept. 11 World Trade Center attacks — who was captured in 2003. Shukrijumah was found hiding in a compound after fleeing from a  North Waziristan tribal district where the army launched a major operation against militant bases in June. 'The al-Qaida leader, who was killed by the Pakistan army in a successful operation, is the same person who had been indicted in the United Stated,' said a senior Pakistani army officer. Pakistan military spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa said in a tweet that five terrorists were also arrested during the raid. Shukrijumah was born in Saudi Arabia and moved to the US as young child. He settled with his family in Brooklyn, New York, where his father preached in a mosque. The family moved to Florida, where he took classes at a community college and worked odd jobs. But when the FBI showed up to arrest him as a material witness to a terrorism case in 2003, he already had left the country. He lived in the US for 15 years but rose to a prominent position in Al-Qaeda and took over a position once held by the mastermind of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks . Prosecutors believe he visited Trinidad and London on his way to al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan where he started with lowly camp duties. He was moved up the FBI's most wanted list — including a $5 million bounty on his head — when three men accused of plotting suicide bomb attacks on New York's subway system named him as their key liaison in Pakistan.

chatgpt: In a major victory for the global war against terrorism, Adnan el Shukrijumah, the chief of global operations for Al-Qaeda, was killed in a joint operation carried out by Pakistani security forces and American intelligence agents. This news comes as a major blow to the terrorist network as Shukrijumah was one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. Shukrijumah was found hiding in a compound in Pakistan's South Waziristan region, along with two other suspected militants. The compound had been under surveillance for weeks before the operation was carried out. Shukrijumah had been on the run for years, having fled from the North Waziristan region where Al-Qaeda had established a base. Shukrijumah was a US citizen who had lived in Brooklyn and Florida for 15 years before fleeing to Pakistan. He was accused of being involved in several terrorist plots, including plans to bomb subway systems in New York City and London. The US had offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. The news of Shukrijumah's death was welcomed by US President Joe Biden, who said that it was a "significant milestone" in the fight against terrorism. The Pakistani government also welcomed the news, saying that it showed the country's commitment to the fight against terrorism. Shukrijumah has been described as the "most dangerous" Al-Qaeda operative since the death of Osama bin Laden. He was believed to have been involved in the planning of several attacks, including the failed attempt to bomb the New York City subway system in 2009. Shukrijumah's death is a major blow to Al-Qaeda, which has been weakened in recent years by drone strikes and other military operations. The group has also lost many of its key leaders, including bin Laden, who was killed by American forces in Pakistan in 2011. However, experts warn that the threat from terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) remains high, and that they continue to pose a significant threat to global security. These groups have been able to establish bases in countries like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and have carried out attacks in several countries around the world. In conclusion, the death of Adnan el Shukrijumah is a significant development in the global fight against terrorism. The successful operation by Pakistani security forces and American intelligence highlights the importance of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism. While this is a major setback for Al-Qaeda, the threat from other terrorist groups remains high, and countries around the world must remain vigilant in their efforts to combat this ongoing threat to global security.
