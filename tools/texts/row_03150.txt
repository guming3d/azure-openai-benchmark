article: Hekla volcano, one of Iceland's most active volcanoes, is on the verge of  a major eruption that could impact air travel, experts have warned. A University of Iceland geoscientist believes a 'bulge' on the northern sign of the volcano is caused by huge deposits of magma rising. In 2010 the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano hampered air travel due to the ash and gas it has spewed into the atmosphere, and there are fears another eruption could cause the same issues. The Hekla volcano, which experts warn is on the verge of erupting for the first time since 2000. Researchers say there is now more magma than in 2000, the last time the Hekla volcano erupted. University of Iceland geophysicist Pll Einarsson said in a report published in the Icelandic newspaper Morgunblai on Monday that according to GPS monitoring of the expanding surface, there is now more magma underneath Hekla than before the volcano's last eruption in 2000, . Hekla volcano 'could erupt soon,' Einarsson said. The last eruption at Hekla started on Feb. 26, 2000, and lasted for nearly two weeks. Then, it took just 79 minutes from the first warning earthquake until the volcano exploded, Einarsson said. Hekla volcano has blasted more than 20 times in the last 1,200 years, blanketing southern Iceland with thick layers of ash and lava. Some of the eruptions are short and small, while others continue for months, pumping enough ash into the atmosphere to chill temporarily the northern latitudes. Lava explodes from the Hekla volcano in an unpopulated area about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Iceland's capital Reykjavik on Sunday Feb. 27, 2000. The Hekla volcano is in an unpopulated area about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Iceland's capital Reykjavik. Volcano watchers have anticipated a new eruption at Hekla since 2006, when tiny earthquakes and surface swelling first hinted that new magma had appeared. Media reports warned of similar surface swelling at Hekla in 2011 and 2013, without a subsequent eruption. Hekla, in the background, was believed to be the gateway to purgatory. .

This surface swelling indicates magma (molten rock) is rising under the volcano, pushing up the ground as it fills fractures and pipes beneath Hekla.

chatgpt: The Hekla volcano in Iceland has been a concern for geologists, as they have recently discovered an alarming bulge on its northern side. The cause of the bulge has been identified as a massive deposit of molten rock rising to the surface, indicating that there is now more magma beneath the surface than during the last eruption in 2000. Geologists have been closely monitoring the Hekla volcano, which has a history of sudden and explosive eruptions. Its last eruption occurred in February 2000, but experts are still unclear about the exact timing of the next one. The larger quantity of magma underneath Hekla's surface has raised concerns among scientists as it may be an indication of an impending eruption. When magma reaches the surface, it can cause a powerful explosion that spews ash and volcanic gases into the atmosphere, which can significantly impact air travel. This is not the first time that Iceland has dealt with volcanic eruptions that affected air travel. The 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano resulted in the cancellation of almost 100,000 flights across Europe, causing chaos and significant economic losses. Experts predict that if Hekla erupts, there could be even more severe effects than that of Eyjafjallajökull. The bulge on Hekla's northern slope indicates a giant magma chamber deep within the volcano, which could release a catastrophic amount of ash and gas if it explodes. The Icelandic authorities are closely monitoring the situation, and they have already alerted the aviation industry about the potential risks posed by Hekla's activities. Air travel could be seriously affected not only in Iceland but also in the surrounding areas. However, the bulge could also subside without leading to an eruption, which would be a desirable outcome for everyone. Nevertheless, the unpredictability of volcanic activities makes it impossible to determine with certainty what will happen. In conclusion, the bulge on the Hekla volcano is an alarming discovery that has raised concerns among geologists and the aviation industry. With more magma underneath than the last time Hekla erupted, the chances of an explosive eruption are higher. The Icelandic authorities are monitoring the situation, and people are advised to keep an eye on the developments.
