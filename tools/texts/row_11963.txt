article: New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Indian officials welcomed the top leader of Myanmar's military junta Sunday in a visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties between the neighboring countries. Gen. Than Shwe is on a five-day trip to India, where he is scheduled to tour sacred Buddhist sites, greet Indian officials at a ceremonial reception in the presidential palace and visit the shrine to Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi before holding talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In 1951, the two nations signed what they called a "treaty of friendship," and over the past few years, bilateral trade has soared to almost $1 billion, according to Indian officials. Several Indian companies have invested in Myanmar's energy sector. And India's main space agency has helped set up a data-processing center in Yangon for remote-sensing applications, India's external affairs ministry says. The visit comes several days after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged India and other countries in the region to push Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to comply with UN human rights resolutions and nuclear nonproliferation agreements. "It is critical that Burma hear from you, its neighbors," she said in a speech at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional meeting. Clinton described life in Myanmar as "dangerous" for the country's inhabitants and urged other nations to push for democratic reforms there. "We would encourage India and other countries to send a clear message to Burma that it needs to change its course," State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. The military general's itinerary also includes tours of the India's information-technology hub in Hyderabad and the industrial center in Jamshedpur. His visit is the second by a top junta administrator in a year.

chatgpt: Gen. Than Shwe, the leader of Myanmar's junta, has embarked on a five-day visit to India. The two countries have long-standing diplomatic and economic ties, and bilateral trade has reached almost $1 billion. This visit comes just weeks after the United States urged India and other neighbors to push for political reforms in Myanmar. During his visit, Gen. Than Shwe is expected to hold talks with Indian political leaders and business delegates to negotiate trade deals and discuss various issues of mutual concern. India has been keen to strengthen economic ties with its eastern neighbors, including Myanmar, which is rich in natural resources such as oil, gas, and metals. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since a coup in 1962. The country has been plagued by ethnic and political tensions, and the junta has been accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent. However, India has maintained close ties with the regime in Myanmar, citing the need for regional stability and security. The United States has been urging India and other neighboring countries to use their influence to bring about political reforms in Myanmar. However, India has been cautious in its approach, seeing the junta as a key strategic partner. The U.S. has also imposed sanctions on Myanmar over its human rights record, which has only strengthened the country's ties with China, another major trading partner. India has been trying to balance its interests in Myanmar with its strategic concerns in the region, including its rivalry with China. The two countries have been vying for influence and political clout in Southeast Asia, and India sees Myanmar as a key ally in countering China's growing assertiveness in the region. In conclusion, Gen. Than Shwe's visit to India highlights the importance of strong diplomatic and economic ties between the two countries. However, it also raises questions about India's approach to Myanmar's military regime, which stands accused of ongoing human rights abuses and political repression.
