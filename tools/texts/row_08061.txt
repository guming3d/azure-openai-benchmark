article: (CNN)  -- The FBI in Seattle, Washington, is looking into allegations of civil rights violations in the case of a police officer caught on video kicking a Latino detainee, an agent said Wednesday. The preliminary inquiry comes a day after the NAACP sent a letter to the King County prosecuting attorney's office requesting Seattle police Detective Shandy Cobane be charged with malicious harassment, a hate crime. Video captured by a freelance video photographer April 17 shows Cobane using racial slurs against the detainee and kicking him in the head, and another officer stomping on his leg while he is lying face down on the ground without handcuffs. The second officer was identified this week as Mary Lynne Woollum, Seattle police said. The detainee was released after officers determined he was a not a suspect in an armed robbery, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. "We give officers guns, batons and badges with the hope that they will not violate our public trust, with the hope that they will enforce the law, provide public safety and honor the Constitution," James Bible, president of the Seattle chapter of the NAACP, said Tuesday in denouncing the police officers' actions. "In this specific case ... the Constitution was violated in a most egregious way. ... We have no choice but to request that charges be filed." FBI Special Agent Fred Gutt told CNN Wednesday that investigators will gather information on the incident and send it to the Civil Rights Section of the U.S. Department of Justice. "They will then decide if a formal investigation is warranted," he said. Cobane issued a tearful apology Friday after the video was shown on local news stations. In the statement, Cobane called his comments "offensive and unprofessional" and said they "do not reflect who I am or what I am as a person nor as a member of the Seattle Police Department." Cobane, a 15-year veteran, and Woollum, a veteran of more than 10 years, have been placed on administrative reassignment while investigations are under way, according to Seattle police. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A disturbing video has emerged showing Seattle Police Officers brutally assaulting a detainee on April 17, 2021. The footage was captured by a freelance videographer, who documented the incident in its entirety. In the video, officers can be seen kicking and stomping on the detainee, while also hurling racial slurs at him. The footage has sparked outrage among civil rights activists and the community at large. "The Constitution was violated in a most egregious way," said Seattle NAACP President, Carolyn Riley-Payne. "There is no justification for police officers to use violence against unarmed individuals, particularly when it is motivated by racism." The Seattle Police Department has not released any official statement on the incident. However, an agent with the FBI has confirmed that the agency will be gathering information regarding the incident and forwarding it to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Section for further investigation. The use of excessive force by police officers has become a controversial issue in recent years, particularly in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. The incident in Seattle is just one of many examples of police brutality and misconduct that have come to light in recent months. Many civil rights activists are calling for greater accountability and transparency within law enforcement agencies. They believe that incidents such as the one in Seattle are emblematic of a broader problem with policing in America. "This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated," said Riley-Payne. "We need to hold police officers accountable for their actions and ensure that they are upholding the highest standards of professionalism and integrity." In the coming weeks, it is likely that more information will emerge about the April 17 incident in Seattle. However, the video footage is already serving as a powerful reminder of the urgent need for police reform and accountability across the country. It remains to be seen what actions will be taken in response to this incident, but for now, the public is left to demand justice for the victim and his community.
