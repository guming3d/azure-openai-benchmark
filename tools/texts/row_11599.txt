article: Washington (CNN) -- Four key GOP senators who have announced their support for a "don't ask, don't tell" repeal are prepared to join Democrats in voting to let the bill proceed, aides to the four said Friday. The aides said Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe, Lisa Murkowski and Scott Brown will vote Saturday to end debate on the ban on openly gay and lesbian people in the military, regardless of whether the Senate passes a stopgap spending bill, a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. The four have previously said that bill must be approved first. The Senate is currently working to craft a temporary spending bill, made necessary after Democratic leadership pulled a $1 trillion spending bill after Republicans abandoned their support of it. The four senators' support for the "don't ask, don't tell" repeal would ensure the 60 votes needed to clear the way for the bill to advance even if Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, votes against it, as is expected. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who co-sponsored legislation that would repeal the policy, said Friday that the four senators have "shown courage" in supporting the measure. Lieberman said he believes that the Senate will have more than the 60 votes needed, adding that the bill's co-sponsors had worked closely with the Defense Department in crafting its language. But Pentagon officials are warning gay and lesbian soldiers that the current law will temporarily remain in place, if the bill passes, as they review the legal technicalities of the repeal. A guidance memo would be sent to military personnel informing them of the change, which would remain in effect for at least 60 days after it is signed into law, Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said. Conservative Republicans have argued that, among other things, a repeal would place an unreasonable burden on the military at a time when it is facing severe strains in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to overturn the ban in a "standalone" measure not tied to any other legislative items. It passed 250-175 on mostly partisan lines. The House had passed a repeal of the ban as part of a larger defense policy bill, but the measure stalled last week in the Senate. Obama and Democratic leaders are trying to push through a repeal before the end of the current lame-duck congressional session. The more conservative incoming Congress, which will be seated the first week of January, is considered far less likely to overturn the Clinton-era ban. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a sudden twist of events, the United States Senate has withdrawn its requirement that the spending bill must be passed first before any other measure is considered. The move came as a surprise to many, especially since the lawmakers were pushing hard for the spending bill to be prioritized.  Despite the withdrawal, current law will remain in effect for at least 60 days if the bill does pass. This means that the United States government will still be required to adhere to certain provisions in the current law, even if the new bill gets passed. The withdrawal has sparked mixed reactions from both sides of the political divide. Some Senators have praised the move, saying that the Senate must prioritize measures that will benefit the American people, rather than focusing solely on the spending bill. Other Senators, however, have criticized the move, arguing that the Senate must stick to its original plan. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to overturn a ban that had been in place on a certain measure. This comes as good news for many Americans, who have been eagerly waiting for the ban to be lifted. The measure in question has been a subject of controversy for many years, with supporters arguing that it is necessary to protect the rights of certain groups. Opponents, on the other hand, have argued that it infringes on individual freedoms. The House's vote marks a significant victory for supporters of the measure, who have been pushing for its removal for years. The Senate will now have to vote on whether or not to accept the House's decision, and if they do, the ban will be lifted.  Overall, it seems that the U.S. government is making progress on a number of fronts, with lawmakers pushing through bills and measures that will benefit the American people. While there have been some setbacks along the way, such as the withdrawal of the spending bill requirement, the government is still moving forward with its agenda. It remains to be seen how this will all play out in the coming days and weeks, as Senators continue to debate and negotiate over various measures. With so much at stake, it is clear that they must work together to find common ground and advance the country's interests.
