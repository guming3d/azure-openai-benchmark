article: For a manager who arrived at White Hart Lane with a reputation for shunning knockout competitions, it now appears that Mauricio Pochettino has finally discovered the magic of the FA Cup. When Pochettino took over at Tottenham last summer, he was reportedly told by his employers to take the cups seriously, after using the games to rest several first team members at Southampton. But what perhaps Daniel Levy and Co did not envisage was the Argentine coach plotting a trip to the recording studio should Spurs reach the FA Cup final, following in the footsteps of Tottenham's 1981 cup hero Ossie Ardiles. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has not ruled out making an FA Cup final song if Spurs get there . Ossie Ardiles pictured singing his solo line in Tottenham's FA Cup final song .

Ardiles and his team-mates recorded the infamous Ossie's Dream with Chas and Dave that year, with the song reaching No 5 in the charts as Spurs lifted the cup after beating Manchester City 3-2 in a replay. 'I know all about Ossie's Dream,' confessed Pochettino to The Sun. 'I have heard the song and even seen a video of it. 'Would I record a song with Chas and Dave if we get to the final this season? Maybe. Yes, why not?' Pochettino stopped short at saying he would be singing too much on any potential collaboration. 'I would let my staff sing because they have good voices and I don't!' Pochettino and his squad could team up with Chas and Dave to record a new version of the song . The Spurs manager wants to recreate the scenes of excitement shown in the FA Cup single . The song made it up to No 5 in the music charts and inspired the club to FA Cup glory . While Tottenham supporters will now undoubtedly be hoping to hear a team single ahead of a cup final, music lovers across the nation will be hoping Pochettino is not about to usher in a new era of football songs. It has become less of tradition in recent years, but still one responsible for tunes such as The Anfield Rap by Liverpool ahead of the 1988 FA Cup final and Move Move Move (The Red Tribe) by Manchester United ahead of their Cup triumph in 1996. Tottenham take on Leicester City at White Hart Lane in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday.

chatgpt: Tottenham Hotspur legend Ossie Ardiles has teamed up with Chas and Dave to create a Cup final song for the club. The Argentine made a name for himself with the north London club during the 1970s and 1980s, winning the FA Cup and UEFA Cup with Spurs. Mauricio Pochettino, the current Tottenham manager, has joked that he may follow in Ardiles' footsteps if the team makes it to the final of this season's FA Cup. His side are set to face Leicester City in the fourth round of the competition this coming weekend. Speaking at a press conference ahead of the match, Pochettino praised Ardiles' musical efforts, saying: "It is a good idea, and it is good for the fans. It shows the love that the players and the people have for the club." Pochettino went on to highlight the importance of the FA Cup to Tottenham, adding that the club are "very serious" about their chances in the competition. The Argentine has yet to lift a trophy during his time at the club, having guided Spurs to two runners-up finishes in the Premier League and a loss in the final of last season's Champions League. "We always take the FA Cup seriously, because it is a very important competition for the history of Tottenham," Pochettino said. "We believe that we can win this competition and every competition we enter." Tottenham have a good recent record in the FA Cup, having reached the semi-finals of the competition in each of the past two seasons. The club have won the tournament eight times in their history, with their last triumph coming in 1991. Their opponents this weekend, Leicester City, are currently enjoying a strong season under manager Brendan Rodgers. The Foxes sit in third place in the Premier League table, and will provide a stern challenge for Tottenham at the King Power Stadium. Pochettino will call on a number of his key players for the match, including striker Harry Kane and midfielder Christian Eriksen. Both players have been linked with moves away from the club in recent months, but Pochettino insists that they remain committed to Tottenham. "Harry is one of the best strikers in the world, and he is very happy here," Pochettino said. "Christian is also very important for us. They are both very professional players and they always give their best for the team." Tottenham fans will be hoping that their team can put in a strong performance against Leicester, and take another step towards Cup glory. With legendary figures like Ossie Ardiles cheering them on, the team will be keen to create their own history in the competition.
