article: (CNN) -- The Justice Department and Puerto Rico signed a major civil rights agreement Wednesday to reform the commonwealth's very troubled police force. The pact faces final approval by a federal judge, who will oversee its enforcement. An earlier Justice Department investigation found numerous problems in the Puerto Rico Police Department, the nation's second-largest, including: . -- Excessive use of force to suppress free speech. -- Unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests. -- A failure to investigate sexual assault and domestic violence allegations. "Although I recognize that complete and lasting reform will not take hold overnight, I'm confident that this agreement lays out a clear path for responding to concerns, correcting troubling practices, safeguarding the rights of Puerto Rican citizens, restoring public trust, and ensuring public safety," Attorney General Eric Holder said in remarks prepared for a news conference. According to the Justice Department, the agreement with Puerto Rico is among the most extensive agreements involving the police misconduct provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the agreement on an issue it highlighted more than a year ago. "At long last, the government of Puerto Rico will work together with the Justice Department to end the rampant police abuse that has plagued the island for so many years," Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement. "We trust that this historic settlement means that Puerto Ricans will no longer have to live in fear of their own police force. A court-enforceable agreement like this ensures that the PRPD will be held accountable if it fails to overhaul its policies and practices." An ACLU report in June 2012 disclosed evidence of widespread abuses and violations of civil rights by the 17,000-strong police department, saying the force "has run amok for years." The abuse was "pervasive and systemic, island-wide and ongoing," the report said. The Justice Department announced in December that it reached a preliminary agreement with Puerto Rico. It delayed implementation to allow then-incoming Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla the time to review it and suggest possible changes. Puerto Rico's police force serves almost 4 million residents. 2012: White House weighs in on statehood vote .

chatgpt: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has expressed their approval of a recent agreement that was made in response to an investigation into police conduct. The investigation found that police had used excessive force to suppress free speech and had engaged in unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests. While the agreement is a step in the right direction, a federal judge must still approve it before it can be put into action. The ACLU has stated that they believe this decision will be made in a timely manner and that the agreement will be enacted as soon as possible.  The investigation into police conduct began after reports of excessive force were brought to light. The investigation revealed numerous instances where police had used excessive force to quash protests and demonstrations.  This excessive use of force included the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and other less-lethal munitions. In many cases, this force was used against peaceful protesters who were exercising their right to free speech.  Additionally, the investigation found that police had engaged in unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests. This included stopping people without probable cause, illegally searching their person and property, and making arrests without sufficient evidence.  The agreement that has been reached as a result of this investigation aims to address these issues and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again in the future. The details of the agreement include new policies and procedures that will govern police conduct in these situations. The agreement also includes provisions for increased training for officers on issues related to free speech and constitutional rights. This training will help ensure that officers are aware of their obligations under the law and that they understand how to protect the rights of those who are exercising their right to free speech. In conclusion, the agreement reached between the parties involved in this investigation represents a positive step forward in protecting the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens. It is now up to a federal judge to approve the agreement and ensure that it is enforced properly. If approved, this agreement could set an important precedent for future cases involving police conduct and the protection of free speech in the United States.
