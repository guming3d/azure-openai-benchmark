article: (CNN) -- A U.N. resolution justifies the targeting of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, a senior NATO military official with operational knowledge of the Libya mission told CNN Thursday. The resolution applies to Gadhafi because, as head of the military, he is part of the control and command structure and therefore a legitimate target, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to talk to the media. Asked by CNN whether Gadhafi was being targeted, the NATO official declined to give a direct answer. But NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu disputed the claim, saying the alliance was not specifically targeting Gadhafi. "We are targeting critical military capabilities that could be used to attack civilians, including command and control centers that could be used to plan and organize such attacks," Lungescu said. "We are simply not targeting individuals," she said, but noted on CNN's American Morning that those military capabilities are the "nerve center of Gadhafi's kill chain. The war machine that has been consistently attacking, relentlessly attacking and systematically attacking civilians in Libya." "We've seen just the other day in Misrata that sort of indiscriminate shelling is still continuing. So the Gadhafi regime still poses a threat to its own people." NATO has been ramping up pressure on the regime, employing helicopters last weekend for the first time against Gadhafi's forces. Explosions are heard often in Tripoli, evidence of allied air strikes. NATO intervened in March in the months-long civil war under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians as Gadhafi tried to crush the revolt against him. The resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council authorized "all necessary measures," with the exception of a ground invasion, to protect civilians. NATO's goal is to end attacks against civilians, the withdrawal of Gadhafi forces to barracks and bases, and full humanitarian access, Lungescu said. "There is, of course, a political track and that is what has been going on with the Contact Group in Abu Dhabi," she said, referring to the Thursday meeting of world powers focused on the Libyan crisis. The group bolstered financial and moral support for the Libyan opposition there and focused on sustaining pressure on Gadhafi. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Wednesday it is time to start planning for what to do in Libya after Gadhafi's departure "because Gadhafi's reign of terror is coming to an end." But Gadhafi has refused to step down, going so far this week as to do a live audio broadcast as NATO warplanes bombed his Tripoli compound. "We will not surrender," he said during Tuesday's broadcast. NATO recently announced its decision to extend its mission in Libya by 90 days. CNN's Eve Bower contributed to this report.

chatgpt: NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu has stated that the alliance is not specifically targeting Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi, despite its ongoing military campaign in the country. Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Tuesday, Lungescu said that NATO's mission is to protect civilians, and that any actions taken are in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. The resolution, adopted on March 17, authorized all necessary measures to protect civilians in Libya, including the use of force. The resolution also imposed a no-fly zone over Libya and called for an immediate ceasefire. While Lungescu insisted that NATO is not targeting Gadhafi specifically, she did acknowledge that the resolution applies to him in his capacity as the head of the country's military. She emphasized, however, that the primary goal of the military operation is to protect Libyan civilians. NATO launched its campaign in Libya on March 31, with bombing raids against Gadhafi's military assets. Last weekend, the alliance deployed helicopters for the first time in the conflict, targeting military positions in and around the capital, Tripoli. The effort has come under criticism from some who argue that NATO is overstepping its mandate, and that the bombing campaign has caused civilian casualties. Human rights organizations have also accused Gadhafi's forces of using civilians as human shields. Despite these criticisms, Lungescu maintained that NATO is committed to following the mandate set out by the United Nations. She also pointed out that the alliance has been careful to avoid civilian casualties, and that any harm caused has been unintentional. The ongoing conflict in Libya has drawn international attention, with countries divided on the best course of action. The United States, France, and the United Kingdom have been among the most vocal supporters of the NATO campaign, while Russia and China have criticized what they see as an overreaching use of military force. Despite these divisions, the situation on the ground in Libya remains tense, with Gadhafi's forces continuing to fight against opposition groups seeking to overthrow his regime. The situation has also fuelled concerns about the spread of violence across the region, with neighboring countries such as Tunisia and Egypt also dealing with political instability in the wake of popular uprisings. As the conflict in Libya continues, the world will be watching to see whether NATO can achieve its goal of protecting civilians without further escalating the violence. While the alliance insists that its actions are in line with international law, the ongoing debate over the military campaign shows that there are no easy answers in a conflict where the stakes are so high.
