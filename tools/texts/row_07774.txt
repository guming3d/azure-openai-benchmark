article: (CNN) -- His was a rags-to-riches tale. A Greek immigrant who came to the United States and made it big. A waiter who gambled in his spare time. A poker prodigy who turned $50 into $40 million in just three years. Archie Karas has described himself the "king of the gamblers," but authorities in San Diego are now calling him a cheater. On Friday, police arrested the 62-year-old Karas, whose legal name is Anargyros Karabourniotis, at his home in Las Vegas, on allegations he marked cards during a blackjack game in San Diego in July. The alleged cheating was also caught on camera, according to authorities. The alleged incident occurred at San Diego's Barona Casino. Karas won $8,000 playing blackjack, but San Diego District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis says video shows the gambler cheated with a technique known as marking cards. Marking cards allows a player to identify the value of cards. If done correctly, neither the dealer nor other players notice the marks -- only the player who is in on the scheme. "This defendant's luck ran out thanks to extraordinary cooperation between several different law enforcement agencies who worked together to investigate and prosecute this case," Dumanis said. Karas is being held in Las Vegas without bail. He faces charges of burglary, winning by fraudulent means and cheating. He is expected to appear in court Monday for an extradition hearing. It was not immediately clear if Karas has legal representation. He won some, he lost some . Karas' exploits are legendary in the poker world. In 1992, he went to Las Vegas with just $50. He got a $10,000 loan from a poker buddy at Binion's Horseshoe, according to Poker.org. Karas tripled the loan in one game. From there he went on to bet and win at pool, then poker. "I was the best," Karas told ESPN in an interview broadcast in 2008. "Anybody who'd come to town I'd play them, I didn't care who they were and I'd win, too." But he had a problem, he recounted to ESPN. No one would play him anymore; he had simply won too much. He didn't quit. Instead, he changed the game. "I had to play dice," he told ESPN. He said lines of people used to show up to watch him bet $1 million on each roll. "I ran it up to $40 million," he recalled. "It was a lot of money." But as quickly as it came, the money left Karas. He said he lost $20 million in 10 days. Soon, it was all gone. It took him three years to win the $40 million and only three weeks to lose it. If the loss hurt Karas, he didn't show it in his 2008 interview. "I consider myself the king of gamblers," he said, chuckling. "I made it, I lost it and like Frank Sinatra says, I stood tall and I took the punches and I did it my way."

chatgpt: Legendary gambler, Archie Karas, has been charged with cheating in the world of gambling. Karas is a Greek immigrant who shot to fame in the 1990s after winning a whopping $40 million over a period of three years. He quickly became known as one of the best poker players in the world, but his reign at the top was short-lived. Just three weeks after winning his fortune, Karas completely lost all of his winnings. He is now facing charges for allegedly cheating at a San Diego casino. Karas has been under investigation since July 2019. He was arrested on September 24th, 2020, and charged with burglary, winning or losing by fraudulent means, and cheating. His arrest came after authorities found evidence linking him to incidents of card switching at a blackjack table. Karas was known in the gambling world for his exceptional skill and his love for high-stakes games. His three-year winning streak was possibly one of the most impressive runs in the history of gambling. He managed to turn $50 into $40 million through a combination of skill and sheer luck. In a 2008 interview with ESPN, Karas described himself as the "king of gamblers". He spoke about how he had made and lost millions several times throughout his life. In the same interview, he admitted to having a gambling problem. Despite his love for gambling, Karas has had several run-ins with the law throughout his life. He has been arrested multiple times for cheating and has even served time in jail. His most recent arrest, however, could have serious consequences for him. Karas is facing felony charges and, if found guilty, could face up to three years in jail. Additionally, his reputation in the gambling world could be ruined forever. Cheating is considered one of the most serious offenses in gambling and could lead to lifelong bans from casinos. The news of Karas' arrest has sent shockwaves throughout the gambling world. Many of his fans and supporters are struggling to come to terms with the allegations against him. Some have even taken to social media to express their disbelief. It remains to be seen what will happen to Karas. Many legal analysts predict that he will face serious consequences if found guilty of the charges against him. For now, the gambling world is holding its breath, waiting to see what will happen to the man once known as the king of gamblers.
