article: (CNN) -- A group of 20 tourists, including two Americans, who were trapped at sea on a drifting ice floe in the Canadian Arctic are now safe after a stroke of luck. Their sheet of ice bumped into another one early Wednesday, the Canadian coast guard said. The second ice floe was touching land. "They were able to walk from one ice floe to the other to land," marine coordinator Christian Cafiti said. "Everyone is safe and sound." A rescue plane dropped survival kits onto the 3Â½-square-mile frozen sheet Tuesday, after the expedition alerted authorities to their plight. The kits included satellite phones, inflatable rafts and food rations. The plane kept an eye on them while they waited for helicopters to arrive. When the copters arrived early Wednesday, bad weather prevented them from hoisting the group on board. They are standing by to airlift them to an Arctic station. "We are having regular conversations with them through satellite phone," Cafiti said. The tourists do not appear to be in danger of exposure. They are dressed warmly and have been able to remain dry. Camping surprise . The tourists were camping on the ice when the frozen sheet -- three times the size of New York City's Central Park -- broke free early Tuesday, carried off by the tide. "Ice breaking off is a very common thing at this time of year," Canadian air force spokesman Steven Neta said. The floe drifted two miles away from land and appeared to start to crumble, Neta said. Had it fallen apart, the three rubber rafts were more than large enough to hold the whole group. The cold also was not too harsh. Even that far north, daytime highs in June often rise well above freezing. More than 220 rescued from ice floes off Latvian coast . CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

chatgpt: After a nerve-wracking ordeal that lasted for several hours, 20 tourists who were stranded on a drifting ice floe in the Canadian Arctic have walked to safety. The group, which included two Americans, had been trapped on a chunk of ice after it broke away from the shoreline. The tourists were part of a guided tour and were exploring the region when the unexpected happened. According to reports, the group was on the ice floe for several hours before help arrived. The Canadian Coast Guard dispatched helicopters to the area and provided air-dropped survival kits that included rafts. The tourists used the rafts to get to safety after the ice floe drifted back towards land.  The tourists were understandably shaken by the experience, but amazingly, no one was injured. They were met by rescue teams on the shore who provided them with food, water, and medical attention. Helicopters are standing by to take them to a base where they will be further debriefed and checked for any possible injuries. It was not immediately clear how the tourists ended up on the drifting ice floe or how far they drifted from shore. However, officials have warned that the Canadian Arctic can be notoriously unpredictable and dangerous, with shifting ice and rapidly changing weather patterns. The area is a remote and inhospitable region, and travelers are advised to take extreme precautions. The tourists are said to be in good spirits despite their ordeal and are grateful to the rescue teams who helped them. They have been advised to rest and recover before continuing their journey, and it is not known if they will return to the region in the future. For now, the focus is on their wellbeing, and authorities are ensuring that they receive the necessary support to recover from the experience. This incident is a reminder that even the most well-prepared travelers can find themselves in dangerous situations, and that it is vital to take all precautions when exploring remote regions such as the Canadian Arctic.
