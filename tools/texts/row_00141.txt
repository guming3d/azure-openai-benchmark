Online retail giant Amazon is considering offering its much-anticipated smartphone for free, it has been reported. The retailer is understood to be aiming to 'undercut rivals' and 'grab a meaningful market share' by tempting consumers using iPhones and Galaxy phones - which normally cost about $200 (£127) - to switch to their free version. However, it is thought the company, which is already behind the hugely popular Kindle e-reader, may require its smartphone users to sign up to services such as its loyalty programme, Amazon Prime. 'Apple's nightmare': If Amazon, which is already behind the popular Kindle e-reader (right) can conquer the market with free phones, Apple may be forced to lower the prices on its iPhone (left) Technology blogger Jessica Lessin claims that 'people familiar with Amazon's effort' confirmed the company was considering offering the smartphones for free. But it is expected to come with some strings attached. 'One of them is whether Amazon would require its smartphone owners to . pay for services such as Amazon Prime, the company’s loyalty program,' Lessin writes in her blog. 'But the people familiar with the matter said that Amazon wants the . device to be free whether or not people sign up for a new wireless plan . at the same time. (Wireless carriers typically discount the price of . devices if customers sign up for a one or two-year wireless contract.)' Cost: Smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy typically cost about $200 (£127) One of the sources says Amazon - which is yet to throw its hat into the smartphone game but is rumored to be interested in doing so - has been in communication with wireless service providers about offering the phone on other carriers. The phone, however, would be offered directly to consumers through a website. Lessin said the free strategy 'isn't set in stone - it depends on a few things that Amazon still needs to work out. For example, the company will need to figure out the financial arrangements with hardware suppliers who are actually manufacturing the phones - something one of Lessin's sources isn't entirely sure is feasible. Free? Amazon is rumored to be considering undercutting its competitors when it enters the smartphone market by offering free phones . Lessin claims that regardless of whether Amazon phones end up being free, or cost significantly less than other, similar phones, the mere fact that the company is considering the strategy indicates how it plans to get into the phone business: 'undercut rivals and grab meaningful market share.' If it works, other smartphone companies could potentially be forced to follow suit and offer their products for much lower prices, or even for free. Lessin described the scenario as 'Apple's Nightmare.'

chatgpt: Amazon is reportedly gearing up to take on smartphone giants Apple and Samsung in the highly competitive smartphone market. According to industry experts, the e-commerce giant is planning to "undercut rivals and grab meaningful market share" in the smartphone market. As Amazon continues to diversify its product offerings, this move would mark the company's latest push into consumer electronics. While it is too early to say when Amazon's smartphone will hit the market, the company has reportedly been working on the project for some time now. If Amazon can successfully lure people away from Apple and Samsung technology, it could spell trouble for these tech giants. In response to Amazon's entry into the market, they may be forced to lower their prices to compete. The smartphone market has traditionally been dominated by Apple and Samsung, with other competitors struggling to even make a dent in their market share. However, with Amazon's vast resources and reach, experts believe that the company could break the current duopoly. Amazon's reputation for offering products at lower prices than its competitors is well-known. If the company can maintain this strategy with its new smartphone, it could potentially become a major player in the market. In addition, Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa, could differentiate its smartphone from its competitors. While Amazon's previous foray into the smartphone market with its Fire phone in 2014 was unsuccessful, the company has made significant strides in the consumer electronics space since then. The company's Amazon Echo smart speaker, which is powered by Alexa, has become an instant hit and has cemented Amazon's position as the leader in the smart home space. Amazon's entry into the smartphone market could also have implications for wireless carriers. Currently, carriers offer subsidies to make smartphones more affordable for consumers. If Amazon's smartphone is priced lower, carriers may be forced to rethink their strategy, which could have significant implications for the industry. It remains to be seen when Amazon's smartphone will hit the market and how it will be received by consumers. However, the company's track record in disrupting markets cannot be ignored. From bookselling to streaming video, Amazon has shown that it is not afraid to take on the biggest players in any industry. If Amazon can successfully undercut its rivals and grab meaningful market share in the highly competitive smartphone market, it could be a game-changer for the industry.
