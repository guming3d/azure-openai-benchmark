But just seconds later, he collided with one of the pair, Tracy Sutherland, at 13,000 feet, knocking them both unconscious. Tragic: Donnie Bragg, 27, died in a freak collision after he was knocked out by a fellow jumper in mid-air and failed to deploy his parachute. The incident happened above SkyDive the Farm's facility in Polk County, Georgia . Mr Bragg, who was engaged and had a newborn son, was instantly killed when he crashed into the ground without deploying his parachute. Mr Sutherland suffered several broken bones and is currently recovering in hospital in Rome, while the third jumper was not injured. Today, instructor Steve Haseman, of SkyDive the Farm in Polk County, said Mr Bragg had been a dedicated worker at the firm, with whom he carried out the skydive. He added that the company was now trying to piece together what had happened during the jump. Location: Today, instructor Steve Haseman, of SkyDive the Farm (pictured) in Polk County, said Mr Bragg had been a dedicated worker at the firm. He said: 'He was very passionate about life, about skydiving' 'We have an idea of what happened, but we don't know exactly,' he told 11Alive.com.  'The . collision between the two of them rendered both of them unconscious. 'And because of that, they weren't able to land their . parachute properly and safely.' Although two cameras had been filming during the jump, one did not capture the incident, while the other was knocked off in the collision and lost, he said. Mr Haseman described Mr Bragg, who had just graduated from Southern Ploytechnic State University in Marietta with an engineering degree, as a 'really good guy' with a passion for life. He said: 'He had a huge heart, very outgoing, very passionate about life, about skydiving, about family. He's touched everybody's life, for sure.' The Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Parachuting Associated are investigating. The incident comes just months after a British skydiver narrowly escaped death when another skydiver crashed into him at 12,500ft. James Lee, 25, was filmed hurtling towards the ground unconscious after being knocked out by the jumper above Netheravon in Wiltshire. He was only saved when two other skydivers saw what had happened and postponed pulling their own cords. Instead, they dived towards Mr Lee and managed to deploy his parachute for him.
