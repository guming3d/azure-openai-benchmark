It is the most advanced paper plane ever created - and can even be controlled by an iPhone. Created by U.S firm Power Up toys, the PowerUp3 is an add-on gadget for homemade paper planes that gives them a small motor and propeller. When connected to the PowerUp app, the smartphone is used as a remote control to fly the plane wirelessly - and a single charge can last up to 10 minutes. Scroll down for video . Any paper plane can be fitted with the PowerUp motor and a propeller connected to a carbon fibre shaft, pictured left. The plane can then be controlled via Bluetooth using an app on a smartphone, right, which shows the plane's altitude. Power Up's motor can run for 10 minutes on a single charge . The £30 kit, which goes on sale next month, has a Bluetooth receiver built-in so it can communicate wirelessly with the iOS app. 'Pilots' can control the height of the plane, and make it turn left or right, using their handset and the app even gives information such as the plane’s altitude. However, there is one snag - users still need to provide they own paper plane, although the firm helpfully supplies instructions for making what it claims is the ultimate design. The kit, which clips onto the plane, has a motor connected by a carbon fibre shaft to a propeller. ‘Just build a plane out of a piece of standard paper, attach the motor, and open up the app on your phone - it'll fly for up to ten minutes on a single charge,’ the firm said. It also encourages owners to experiment with their own designs for planes. ‘At PowerUp, we strongly encourage experimentation, and part of the fun is tweaking your airplane designs to achieve the best results.’ The firm added the gadget is made of a highly durable carbon fiber composite, so it will not break with normal use - however, it warns ‘that does not mean it is indestructible!’ The £30 kit doesn't come with paper planes included but PowerUp has created an instructional video, pictured, on how to build the most aerodynamic paper aircraft that will fit the motor and propeller .

chatgpt: Innovation never ceases to amaze us, as demonstrated by the latest release of PowerUp, a gadget that lets you step up your paper plane game! PowerUp, a company known for making powered paper planes, has recently released their latest model. The PowerUp 3, the newest version of the product, comes with a motor and propeller attached to a carbon fibre shaft, enabling the customisation of any paper plane to fly for up to 10 minutes. The PowerUp 3 is not only powerful, but also intelligent. This device comes with a built-in Bluetooth receiver that seamlessly connects wirelessly to a smartphone app. Machine learning engineers have designed the app with advanced algorithms to ensure easy and trouble-free usage. This setup means pilots can get real-time telemetry on their phone, including altitude, ascent, descent and other useful data points. According to Shai Goitein, CEO of PowerUp, "we wanted to make sure that every launch was more fun, more engaging, and more intuitive than ever before." The PowerUp 3 is designed to achieve just that. Great attention was paid to the details in order to provide all the necessary adjustments to ensure the plane performs according to expectations. Pilots can make mid-flight adjustments to the plane for optimal results by changing the thrust or angle of the propellers. The smartphone app adds another layer of excitement to the experience of flying the PowerUp 3. The ability to control a paper plane using a smartphone is a fascinating development. The PowerUp 3 smartphone app is user-friendly and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App store. The app has a simple, yet effective user interface that is intuitive and easily navigable, even for inexperienced pilots. The PowerUp 3 is a step up from its predecessor, the PowerUp 2.0. The latest model comes with a redesigned carbon fibre shaft, replacing the plastic strut in the previous model. The manufacturer has also increased the size of the motor and propeller to provide enough thrust for a longer flight time. In conclusion, the PowerUp 3 is an extraordinary gadget that has revolutionised the paper plane experience. With its motor, propeller, carbon fibre shaft, and smartphone app with real-time telemetry, the PowerUp 3 takes paper plane flying to new heights. This gadget is a must-have for anyone who loves to fly paper planes and wants to take it to the next level. With the PowerUp 3, it is time to make old-fashioned paper planes exciting again.
