The European Union has spent £850,000 moving and upgrading a visitor centre even though it only received 50,000 people a year. In contrast, the Pencil Museum in the Lake District town of Keswick, receives more than 80,000 visitors a year, who pay up to £4.25 a head for entry. Attendance at the free European Commission Visitor Centre dropped in 2012 by 5 per cent on the previous year. Upgrade: Relocating and renovating the European Commission Visitor Centre cost taxpayers £853,000 (1million Euros) Hub: The new visitor centre is based inside the European Commission's Charlemagne Building in Brussels . But despite the decline in numbers, the EU lavished taxpayer's money on relocating the centre to a different Brussels street this spring. The new centre, which is now opposite the Commission's headquarters, opened in May. It sits just half a mile from the European Parliament's Visitor Centre, which opened in 2012 at a cost of nearly £18million. But actually visiting the Commission's Visitor Centre is no easy task. People wanting to go must to book at least 10 weeks in advance using an online application form and go in a group of 15 or more. No children are allowed as access is limited to people aged 15 and over. Mrs Yannakoudakis said: 'The EU thinks that it can win over citizens . with extravagant visitors’ centres such as those hosted by the European . Commission and the European Parliament. 'The parliament lavished a shameful £18m on its temple of . EU propaganda and now we learn that a further million Euros has been . spent on another centre half a mile away. 'The EU needs to rein in the outlandish budget for publicising itself. If it buckled down and did a better job, including by cutting back . waste, it might find it needed less money to spend on hype.' Success: The Pencil Museum in Cumbria receives more than 80,000 visitors a year - 30,000 more than the European Commission Visitor Centre . Attraction: Visitors pay up to £4.25 a head entry for the Pencil Museum, while the European Commission centre is free . In response to the MEP's written question, Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding said: 'The Visitors’ Centre is an integral part and key instrument of its communication strategy. 'It provides an opportunity for citizens, including high-profile groups and key multipliers, to visit the Commission at its headquarters. 'The Centre aims to give visitors an insight into how the Commission works and also explain its policies and programmes.' The centre had 50,576 visitors last year, down from 53,245 in 2011. Pencil Museum manager Alex Farthing said all profits from entry fees go into maintaining the museum.

chatgpt: The newly relocated European Commission Visitor Centre has been making headlines since its unveiling last year. The impressive building cost a whopping £853,000 to construct, and has since been open to the public for free. Despite the big bucks spent on its construction and the fact it is a free attraction, it seems visitors are not coming in droves as expected. According to reports, the visitor centre is attracting 30,000 fewer visitors than the nearby £4.25-a-head Pencil Museum. This has left many scratching their heads as to why such a grand and free attraction is failing to bring in tourists. The European Commission Visitor Centre is located in a prime position near the train station, making it easily accessible to visitors. It was intended to be a hub of information about the European Union, providing insights into the workings of the Commission, its role and the benefits of being a member state. However, it seems that the visitor centre isn't living up to its potential. A spokesperson for the centre has said that they are "disappointed" with the visitor numbers but are taking steps to improve. They have launched a new marketing campaign to raise awareness of the visitor centre and attract more tourists. The campaign includes billboard advertising, social media posts and partnerships with local hotels. However, it seems that the problem may be more fundamental than simply a lack of awareness. According to some critics, the visitor centre is too focused on the EU and not enough on the broader picture. They feel that the centre should provide more information on the history and culture of Europe, rather than just the mechanics of the EU. Another issue that has been raised is that the visitor centre is not interactive enough. Visitors want to be able to experience things rather than just read about them. For example, they could have interactive exhibits on the different cultures and cuisines of Europe or simulated debates to showcase the EU's decision-making processes. Despite these criticisms, the European Commission Visitor Centre is a stunning building and has a lot of potential. It provides an opportunity for visitors to learn about the EU and the benefits of membership, and this is something that should be celebrated. It's clear that the centre needs to make changes to its offering to attract more visitors, but when it does so, it could become a major tourist attraction. In conclusion, the European Commission Visitor Centre is struggling to attract visitors despite being a free attraction with a prime location. However, with a new marketing campaign and changes to its offering, it could become a popular tourist attraction in the future.
