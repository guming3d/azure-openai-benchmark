article: (CNN) -- Police are investigating the gang-rape of a tourist in central India, the latest black eye for the country over violence against women. A Swiss couple was camping near a forest in India's Datia district when a group of men beat the husband and raped his wife, the district's deputy superintendent of police, R.S. Prajapati, told CNN. There were between five and seven attackers, he said. The couple arrived in Mumbai on February 3 and were on a cycling tour across the country, said D.K. Arya, deputy inspector general of police. The attackers stole a laptop, 10,000 rupees (US $185) and a mobile phone, he said. The victims went to police and the woman was hospitalized and later released. Twenty people have been detained for questioning, Arya said. The couple is staying at a guesthouse in the Datia district while the investigation unfolds, he said. The Swiss ambassador to India, Linus von Castelmur, has spoken with the couple and offered any support they will need. "Their health and treatment is the priority of the moment," the ambassador said in a statement. "The embassy has also been in touch with the local authorities and has requested for swift investigation and for justice to be done." The attack comes at a time in India when there are calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women. In December a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped on a New Dehli bus, spurring protests in India, where most women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations. That woman later died in a Singapore hospital. A panel appointed by India's home affairs minister as a result of the case criticized Indian attitudes toward sexual assault and called for policy changes, including creating an offense of gang-rape punishable by at least 20 years in prison, making it a crime for police to fail to investigate sexual assault complaints and making it illegal to consider character or previous sexual experience of the victim at a criminal trial.

chatgpt: The Swiss embassy in India has called for a swift and thorough investigation into the gang rape of a Swiss tourist in central India. The woman, who was on a camping trip with her husband, was attacked by a group of men near the town of Datia in Madhya Pradesh state. Local police have said that they have detained 20 men for questioning in connection with the attack, which took place in the early hours of the morning. The couple were sleeping in a tent when a group of men forced their way in, beat the husband and then raped the woman. The incident has sparked outrage in India, which has been rocked by a string of high-profile rape cases in recent months. Women's rights campaigners have accused the authorities of failing to do enough to prevent sexual violence and of being too lenient on offenders. In response to the attack, the Swiss embassy in New Delhi has issued a statement expressing its concern and urging the Indian authorities to "take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of our citizens." The embassy also said that it was providing the victim with consular support and that Swiss officials were in contact with local authorities to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis condemned the attack in a statement on social media, saying: "I am deeply shocked by the terrible incident in India. Our thoughts are with the victim and her loved ones." The incident comes just months after the gang rape of a 23-year-old medical student on a bus in Delhi, which brought worldwide attention to the issue of sexual violence in India. The case led to protests across the country and prompted the government to introduce tougher laws on rape and sexual assault. Despite the new laws, however, activists say that little has changed and that women are still at risk of sexual violence. They are calling for better police training, a more sensitive judicial system and an end to the culture of victim-blaming that they say is too prevalent in Indian society. For the Swiss tourist and her husband, the attack will be a traumatic experience that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. But campaigners hope that their ordeal will help to focus attention on the issue of sexual violence and spur the authorities into taking action.
