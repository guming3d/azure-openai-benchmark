Entry refused: Ben Weidner, who suffers from Type 1 diabetes, was refused entry to Delsea Drive-In because he was carrying a juice-box and some candy for his condition . Weidner was refused entry to the Vineland cinema, where his father had taken him and his friends for a fun . night at the movies, because of the food items in his backpack. 'No food. No drink. Bottom line,' Dr DeLeonardis told WPVI. 'Sorry your kid has an affliction but what can I tell you?' Ben's father Phil Weidner says DeLeonardis went too far in enforcing the rule with his son. 'He needs to have items with him to handle low blood sugar. He's got celiac, he's got numerous food allergies. We are bringing these items in not because they are extra items to eat, but because they are for his own safety,' he told WPVI. Doctor's orders: Dr John DeLeonardis is a pediatrician and the owner of Delsea Drive-In and says that he won't change his rule to allow diabetics to bring in outside snacks because he'll lose money at the concession stand . Necessary supplies: Ben Weidner carries this backpack with him everywhere. It hold his Epipen, insulin, candy and a juice-box . DeLeonardis is unrepentant and says that he'll miss out on sales at the concession stand if he changes his policy. 'They'll abuse it,' he told WPVI . 'My time shouldn't be occupied at the box office trying to explain to people, "We have a website. It tells you about this." If you don't want to go to that, don't come.' He says food, including gluten-free snacks, is available at his concession stand and that there's no need for anyone to bring anything else with them. However, for a person suffering a sudden drop in blood-sugar levels, even a short wait in line at a concession stand could spell disaster. Ben Weidner, who already has to worry about his condition daily and inject himself with insulin, the abortive trip to the movies left a bad taste in his mouth. 'I feel humiliated, really,' he told WPVI. 'Because I've been trying to get past this, all this stuff with my friends. Pretty much being with them, be as normal as possible. It's just really humiliating.'

chatgpt: A 16-year-old boy, Ben Weidner, was denied entry to a drive-in cinema by the owner John DeLeonardis, citing a strict policy against outside food. However, Ben's case is unique as he suffers from Type 1 diabetes and needs snacks on-hand in case he suffers a sudden blood-sugar drop.  According to Ben's mother, they had visited the drive-in cinema multiple times before with his snacks, and the issue only came up when the owner personally denied them entry. She expressed her disappointment and frustration, stating that "it's not like we're smuggling in a three-course meal." On the other hand, DeLeonardis defended his decision, stating that if he made an exception for Ben, it would open the door for others to abuse the rule and bring in their own food. Additionally, he argued that concessions are a significant source of revenue for the drive-in cinema, and allowing outside food could result in substantial losses. Following the incident, there has been a heated debate online, with many people supporting Ben and criticizing the cinema's policy. Some have suggested that there should be exceptions for those with medical conditions, while others have argued that the cinema has a right to protect its revenue. In response to the backlash, DeLeonardis stated that he sympathized with Ben's situation but maintained that he could not make an exception. He suggested that Ben could call ahead and arrange for a special dispensation for his snacks on future visits. The incident has shed light on the challenges faced by people with medical conditions in accessing public spaces. While businesses have a right to protect their revenue, they also have a responsibility to accommodate customers' medical needs. In cases like Ben's, where the need is for a small amount of snacks, it seems reasonable to make an exception. As for Ben, he has since found an alternative cinema that allows him to bring his snacks, and he is content to watch movies there instead. However, his story has inspired a wider conversation about the need for greater sensitivity towards people with medical conditions in public spaces. In conclusion, the incident involving Ben Weidner and John DeLeonardis highlights a crucial issue at the intersection of business and healthcare. While it is understandable for businesses to have policies around outside food to protect their revenue, exceptions should be made for those with medical conditions. The incident is a reminder of the need for greater awareness and sensitivity towards people with medical conditions, and the importance of accommodating their needs in public spaces.
