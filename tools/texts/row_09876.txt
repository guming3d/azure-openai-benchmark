chatgpt: A bomb that was concealed in a cell at Fremantle Prison over 25 years ago has finally been destroyed by the bomb squad. Acting on a tip-off from a former inmate, the bomb squad located the explosive device hidden underneath the floorboards of one of the prison's solitary confinement units. The unit was believed to have been in use during the prison’s operational years. Reports suggest that the bomb may be associated with the 1988 prison riots. The riots that occurred at Fremantle Prison were some of the most violent in Australian history. The facility was constructed in the 1850s and was initially used to house convicts that were sent to Australia. The prison was famously known for being one of the toughest in the country. It is believed that the bomb was planted by one of the inmates who were involved in the riots. The device was discovered within a cell that was located in what was once the prison's solitary confinement unit. The unit had been closed for some time now and had not been used for several years before the discovery of the bomb.  The bomb squad worked to destroy the explosive device, making sure that it was safely detonated to avoid any harm to the public or the prison itself. The historical prison site opened as a tourist attraction in 1991, five years after the events of the riots. Former inmates, prison staff, and members of the public expressed their shock and concern about the existence of such a device in the prison facilities, but were relieved to learn that the bomb had been safely destroyed. The 1988 riots were the result of major overcrowding at Fremantle Prison. The number of inmates had reached record levels and inmates began to feel that they were living in inhumane conditions. This led to a series of protests that quickly turned violent, leading to the destruction of the prison’s B block. The riots lasted for over two weeks and resulted in the deployment of the army to restore order. The discovery of the bomb more than 25 years later has raised questions about the management and oversight of the prison at the time. There have been calls for an investigation into the events of the riots and the factors that contributed to the situation. Overall, the discovery and destruction of the bomb highlight the complex history of Fremantle Prison and serve as a reminder of the need for increased attention to safety and security measures at all prison facilities.
