chatgpt: Plants worth £5,000 were discovered by police in the toilets of a pub in the West Midlands. The haul of cannabis plants was located next to a sign warning patrons that anyone caught with drugs would be barred for life. The discovery was made after a tip-off from a member of the public, and officers quickly arrived at the scene. Upon entering the women's toilets of the pub, police found a sophisticated grow operation that had been created in a disused cubicle. The plants were being grown under UV lights and had been carefully tended to, indicating that the grower was well-versed in the art of cannabis cultivation. Police believe that the grow operation had been running for some time, with the plants being tended to on a regular basis. The discovery came as a shock to the pub's management, who were unaware of the illegal activity taking place on their premises. Following the discovery, police removed the cannabis plants and destroyed them in a controlled operation. No arrests have been made, but officers are continuing to investigate the matter. Speaking about the discovery, a spokesperson for the police said: "This was a significant haul of cannabis plants, with a street value of around £5,000. We are grateful to the member of the public who alerted us to the activity taking place in the pub, and we would encourage anyone who has information about illegal activity to come forward." The incident highlights the ongoing issue of drug use and cultivation in the UK, particularly in pubs and other public places. Police have warned that they will continue to crack down on illegal activity, and are urging the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour. The pub's management has since released a statement condemning the illegal activity that took place on their premises. They have promised to work with police to ensure that such incidents do not happen again, and have reiterated their zero tolerance policy towards drugs. In conclusion, the discovery of a cannabis grow operation in the toilets of a pub in the West Midlands has highlighted the ongoing issue of drug use and cultivation in the UK. Police are urging the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity, and have warned that they will continue to crack down on illegal activity.
