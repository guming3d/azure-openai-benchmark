Biologists worry that the northern African pythons could interact with their Burmese cousins who already thrive in large numbers in the Florida Everglades. Last year, 141 Burmese pythons were removed from the National Park. Both snake populations, which are non-venomous, likely originated from pets that either escaped or were illegally dumped by their owners.

Wildlife officials say the rock pythons captured so far have averaged 10ft in length. Their range is currently limited to the suburbs where marshlands are divided by a highway, canals, strip malls and housing developments crowded with new homes. They've been captured in canals and in open areas next to homes; some end up as road kill. One fatal dog attack by a rock python was confirmed in 2013. Warning signs: Flyers have been posted to alert residents of the neighborhood that the Northern African python has been spotted nearby . Sneaky snakes: Their range is currently limited to the suburbs where marshlands are divided by a highway, canals, strip malls and housing developments crowded with new homes . On Thursday, wildlife officials timed a monthly survey to coincide with cooler temperatures that drive cold-blooded snakes seeking warmth to bask in open, sunny areas like roads and levees. The wildlife commission also left fliers about the snakes on mailboxes in one neighborhood. Anyone who encounters either python species is encouraged to contact Miami-Dade Fire Rescue.

chatgpt: Wildlife officials in Florida have reported the discovery of over 30 Northern African pythons in a suburban area located west of Miami. The non-venomous snakes, also known as rock pythons or python sebae, are not native to the region and their presence in the area has raised safety concerns among residents. This discovery has particularly alarmed residents, as these snakes can grow up to over 20 feet long and be extremely dangerous. A fatal dog attack by a rock python was also confirmed in the region back in 2013. Wildlife officials believe that the snakes could have been introduced to the area as a result of people releasing them into the wild. To prevent a possible invasion of the invasive species, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has hired an animal control expert to patrol the area. The FWC has warned residents to stay cautious and report any sightings of the dangerous snakes. The FWC has emphasized that these snakes are not pets, and that releasing them into the wild is both illegal and irresponsible. The snakes are a threat to the local ecosystem and other native species. They are known to feed on mammals, birds, and reptiles, and can pose a danger to pets and even small children. The non-native snakes' arrival in the area is a reminder of the ongoing issue of invasive species in the state of Florida. Over the years, countless animals, plants, and insects have been introduced to the ecosystem, often with devastating consequences. The python population, in particular, has exploded in the state following the release of captive individuals into the wild. The FWC has urged residents to take precautions to prevent the spread of invasive species, including not releasing pets into the wild and properly disposing of exotic plants. They also ask people to report any sightings of non-native animals, as early detection is key to managing these populations. In summary, the discovery of over 30 Northern African pythons in a suburban area west of Miami has raised safety concerns among residents. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has taken proactive measures to limit the population of the non-native snakes and warned residents to stay cautious of these dangerous predators. The incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing issue of invasive species in the state.
