On June 9, Neale brandished a stun gun and used it on her daughter when the girl apparently didn't make oatmeal to her liking. The witness said that Neale started yelling at the child, then grabbed the stun gun from her bedroom, cornered the girl and tasered her left kneecap. It seemed evident that the stun gun was activated since the child screamed and fell to the floor. Neale's friend didn't want to get involved at first. But when she came across a note in the child's dresser expressing how the girl no longer wanted to live, the friend decided to contact police. Neale on the other hand, denies that the stun gun was on. She told investigators that everyone was playing with the taser, and when she touched her child with it, it was not turned on. She explains the bruising on her daughter's knee came from a paddling with a spoon and not the stun gun. The wrong way: Neale allegedly used the stun gun on her daughter for not making oatmeal the right way . Arrested: Neale was arrested on Thursday, and her stun gun confiscated. She made bail late Friday evening, but her children are now being cared for by other relatives . This wasn't the only incident Neale's friend witnessed of child abuse.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a woman from Tallahassee, Florida, has been arrested and charged with aggravated child abuse after she tased her own daughter for making oatmeal the wrong way. Melissa Neale, 34, was taken into custody by the police and is now being held in the Leon County Detention Centre. According to reports, Neale became irate when she noticed that her 12-year-old daughter had made oatmeal incorrectly. The argument between the mother and daughter escalated quickly, and Neale allegedly resorted to using a stun gun on the child. The incident came to light after Neale's daughter confided in her aunt about what had happened. The aunt immediately contacted the authorities, who took Neale into custody. Neale's other child, a 14-year-old son, was also present during the altercation but did not reportedly witness his mother using the stun gun on his sister. Both Neale's children are now in the care of other relatives. The authorities have expressed their shock and dismay at the incident, saying that such behavior towards a child is entirely unacceptable. "Using a taser on a child is beyond the pale," said Tallahassee police spokesperson, John Drake. "We will not tolerate abusive behavior of any kind, and anyone who engages in this type of behavior will be held accountable." Neighbors and acquaintances of Neale expressed their surprise and disbelief at the news. Many described her as a loving and caring mother who had never shown any signs of aggression or violence in the past. "It's a real shock to hear about this," said one neighbor. "Melissa was always a friendly person who seemed to adore her children. I never would have thought something like this could happen." Neale is now facing serious charges of aggravated child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. She is currently awaiting trial, and the authorities are urging anyone with any information about the incident to come forward. In the meantime, the children who were involved in the incident are being given the care and support they need to recover from the trauma they have experienced. The case has once again highlighted the importance of recognizing and preventing child abuse in all its forms.
