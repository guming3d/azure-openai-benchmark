article: (CNN) -- Burned rubble near a Bali travel guidebook. Twisted metal beside brightly-colored suitcases. Headphones and human remains. In the rural area of eastern Ukraine where a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 fell from the sky on Thursday, the ground was scarred with death and devastation left behind by a flight that never reached its destination. Video footage from the site, located about 30 miles from the Russian border, showed smoke billowing from the smoldering wreckage long after the crash. "It's a gruesome scene," freelance journalist Noah Sneider said. "There's bodies splayed out through the fields. People said the plane kind of exploded in the air, and everything rained down in bits and pieces, the plane itself, the people inside." Stunned rescue workers and rebel fighters combed the area, Sneider said, planting sticks with white cotton ribbons where they found bodies in the fields. There are so many dead that it's unlikely the local morgue will be able to hold them all, Sneider said, even in a volatile region that's seen waves of death recently amid clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. "When there was the battle for the Donetsk airport, something like 50 people died and they didn't have the space," Sneider told CNN's Anderson Cooper. On this flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, officials say there were 298 people aboard. In the wide fields of tall grasses, debris stretched so far, in so many small pieces, that it seemed unfathomable that anyone would ever know for certain what happened to Flight 17, Sneider said. "Finding things like passports," he said, "is a matter of chance." Separatists clearly controlled the site, Sneider said. But even battle-hardened rebel fighters appeared shocked, he said. Fighting has torn apart the region. But this is something else. "Nothing of this scale has happened," said Sneider, who's been covering the conflict for months. Locals in the rural area trying to help were overwhelmed, he said. Firemen who rushed to put out the flames found they had a hose with holes in it, spraying water everywhere, he said. As night fell, search crews seemed uncertain about what to do at first, he said. But eventually, teams put up tents and set up flood lights in the field. Ukrainian officials said rescue and investigation teams had been hampered by armed groups in the area. Pictures suggested the area was hardly a cordoned off crime scene, with people standing on top of parts of the wrecked aircraft. And there are some reports that pieces of the aircraft have been looted and put in people's yards, CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Kiev. Sneider said he hadn't seen any looting by people in the area. "Most of them are so frightened that they're not coming anywhere near here," he said.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck on the outskirts of the war-torn city of Donetsk on Sunday evening, as a passenger plane crash-landed amidst ongoing violence in the region. The crash site is a harrowing scene of devastation, as charred debris fills a wide field with tall grass. Journalist Noah Sneider has described it as a "gruesome scene" and even battle-hardened Ukrainian rebels seem shaken by the severity of the crash. The plane, a Boeing 747, was traveling from Bangkok to Amsterdam with over 300 passengers and crew members on board. It crashed just outside Donetsk, a key city in the ongoing conflict between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists. The cause of the crash is not yet known, but the ongoing violence in the region undoubtedly played a role. This catastrophe is yet another reminder of the deepening crisis in Ukraine, where violence has escalated in recent weeks. The city of Donetsk, which has become a battleground between government and rebel forces, has been hit hard by the fighting, leaving many residents in a state of constant fear. The crash has brought a new level of horror to the already dire situation. Journalists and local residents alike are struggling to come to terms with the scale of the tragedy. Speaking to reporters, one local resident said: "I can't believe this is happening in my city. We've been through so much already and now this." Emergency services are working to recover the bodies of the victims, but the process is slow and dangerous due to ongoing fighting in the area. Rebel forces have reportedly prevented Ukrainian officials from gaining access to the crash site, adding to the tension in the region. As the investigation into the cause of the crash continues, questions are being raised about the safety of air travel in the conflict zone. Many airlines have already canceled flights to and from Ukraine, citing concerns over safety. The crash is a tragic reminder of the toll that the ongoing conflict is taking on the people of Ukraine. The country has been in turmoil since the ousting of former President Viktor Yanukovych in February, and the situation has only deteriorated since then. More than 3,000 people have been killed and nearly one million have been displaced since the conflict began. International leaders have condemned the violence and called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but so far, their efforts have yielded little progress. The crash of Flight 747 is a stark reminder of the need for immediate action to end the conflict and restore stability to the region. As the world mourns the loss of those on board Flight 747, the crisis in Ukraine continues to deepen. The crash is a stark reminder that the people of Ukraine are caught in the middle of a bloody conflict that shows no signs of abating. The world must come together to find a way to bring an end to this tragedy and ensure that such a catastrophe does not happen again.
