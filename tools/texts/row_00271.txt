article: In custody: Ex-PM Dominique de Villepin has been arrested in connection with a corruption case . Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin was in police custody today after being arrested in connection with a corruption scandal. The 58-year-old has been implicated in a fraud enquiry centred on the prestigious Relais & Chateaux (R&C) hotel and restaurant club. Regis Bulot, a former senior manager at R&C, spent seven months in prison this year while waiting trial over the alleged theft of 1 million pounds through over-charging for the club’s guidebooks, which are available all over Britain. De Villepin, who made his name in the UK by making a passionate speech to the United Nations opposing the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq in 2003, is a close personal friend of Bulot, 64. Now transcripts of telephone conversations have emerged from late 2011 which are said to prove De Villepin tried to stop R&C’s new management from proceeding with court action against Bulot. There are also suspicions that some of the money siphoned away from R&C may have been used to fund De Villepin’s political career. The two men are close friends and their families have often holidayed together in R&C hotels all over the world. Bulot had other high-profile supporters in his legal battle. Alain Ducasse, the multi-starred superchef, was overheard telling Mr Bulot: ‘You must quickly cut the head off your successor’ in another call recorded by investigators. Bulot has admitted to benefiting from illegal cash payments but denies involvement in any illicit political financing. Chain in chains: Relais & Chateaux own luxury resorts all over the world, inculcating the Xara Palace on the island of Malta, and is now at the centre of the fraud scandal involving de Villepin . De Villepin admits going to see the new R&C management about his friend, but insists it was at their invitation. ‘I have strictly nothing to feel bad about,’ he said before his arrest. ‘To try and implicate me in a story in which I have nothing do with is unbearable.’ The scandal follows former president Jacques Chirac receiving a suspended prison sentence for fraud last year. Nicolas Sarkozy, Chirac’s successor, is also facing allegations that he received illegal cash payments from Lilliane Bettencourt, France’s richest women. Both Chirac and Sarkozy were once close cabinet allies of De Villepin, a fellow conservative, but they have since all fallen out. Police confirmed that Mr De Villepin was being questioned at a station in central Paris following a request by judges sitting in Strasbourg, eastern France. He can be held for up to 48 hours before being charged or released. Ends .

chatgpt: Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has been arrested in Paris and questioned today. He is being investigated in connection with a case of alleged theft by a close friend. According to reports, Villepin's friend is suspected of stealing £1m from a wealthy businessman. The businessman filed a complaint with French authorities, claiming that his former friend had made unauthorized withdrawals from his bank account. The investigation has been ongoing for several months, and Villepin was questioned today as part of the probe. The former prime minister has denied any involvement in the alleged theft and has maintained his innocence throughout the investigation. Villepin is no stranger to controversy. He was previously embroiled in a political scandal in 2004 when he was accused of playing a role in a smear campaign against then-presidential hopeful Nicolas Sarkozy. Villepin denied any wrongdoing, but the scandal tarnished his reputation and led to his resignation as prime minister in 2007. Since leaving politics, Villepin has been involved in various business ventures and has written several books. He is also known for his diplomatic career, having served as France's ambassador to the United Nations in the early 2000s. His arrest comes as a shock to many in France, who have long seen Villepin as a respected figure in French politics. Some have speculated that the investigation could be politically motivated, given Villepin's history of political controversy. Regardless of the investigation's motivation, Villepin's arrest has raised questions about the role of politicians in France's justice system. Some have criticized the investigation as a way for authorities to target Villepin and other high-profile figures, while others have argued that it shows that no one is above the law. The case continues to unfold, and it is unclear what the outcome will be for Villepin and his friend. In the meantime, the former prime minister will likely face increased scrutiny from the media and the public, as the investigation into the alleged theft continues. Overall, this arrest and investigation is another chapter in France's long history of political scandals and controversies. While the outcome is uncertain, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in government and politics.
