article: (CNN) -- A short video that has gone viral in Mexico asks a tough question of the country's presidential candidates: "Are you striving only for the (presidential) chair, or will you change the future of our country?" A young girl with brown eyes and long brown hair, wearing a simple white shirt, poses the question. Behind her is a small army of child actors who star in the video, which is cute for a moment, but deadly serious. In it, the children act out a day in the life of a Mexican resident, fraught with all the problems and challenges that a leader must face. A child dressed as a businessman gets robbed at gunpoint as soon as he leaves his home. The robbers hand their loot over to a corrupt police officer. Protesters clash with riot police. There's a smog alert. Drug traffickers have it out with police on the streets, and human smugglers unload their cargo. Seeing children act out these grown-up situations has elicited a number of responses. Some viewers have criticized it as political manipulation, others as a wake-up call. But the list of Mexico's woes weighs heavily: security, pollution and poverty, among others. The video has garnered nearly 2 million views in less than four days. "In reality, the video is not reflecting anything that people have not experienced," said Rosenda Martinez, a spokeswoman for Our Mexico of the Future, the group behind the production. The video targets the major presidential candidates -- Enrique Pena Nieto, Josefina Vazquez Mota and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador -- and aims to raise awareness about Our Mexico of the Future. The goal of the organization is to collect as many "visions" of Mexico's future as possible and to compile them in a book that will be presented to the candidates before the election. So far, more than 10 million Mexicans have written or recorded their dreams for a safer or cleaner or more tolerant Mexico. "We've had the response we've hoped for, and even exceeded it," Martinez said. After the children in the video depict a kidnapping, posters of the missing and people wearing face masks because of smog, the young narrator continues: "If this is the future that awaits me, I don't want it. Stop working for your party, and not for us. Stop superficially fixing the country." Some of the candidates have watched the video. Vazquez Mota, of the ruling National Action Party, said the video's message can't go unnoticed, while Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate Pena Nieto expressed that now is the time for change, as the video suggests. Leftist candidate Lopez Obrador, of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, had not seen the video, but said he agreed with the theme of change. Our Mexico of the Future will release data based on the millions of messages it has received. Martinez said to expect that security and the environment are the two most popular themes mentioned by Mexicans. CNN's Krupskaia Alis contributed to this report from Mexico City.

The video, which features children acting out various scenarios that depict the poverty, violence, and corruption that affects Mexican society, has gone viral on social media with millions of views. In the video, young actors portray different real-life situations, such as a boy sleeping on the streets, a young girl working in a factory, and a group of children living in a slum.

Jaime Rodriguez, the independent candidate who is also known as "El Bronco," also shared the video on his social media channels and spoke about the importance of investing in education and creating opportunities for young people. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the candidate for the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), praised the video and expressed his willingness to work with civil society organizations and young people to tackle the challenges facing the country. The video has also sparked a conversation among Mexican citizens, who have taken to social media to share their thoughts and opinions about the issues it raises. Many people have expressed their frustration at the current state of affairs in Mexico, with high levels of violence, corruption, and poverty affecting millions of citizens. Others have shared their hopes for the future and the importance of investing in education, creating jobs, and fighting corruption to bring about real change. Save the Children Mexico hopes that the video will continue to spark debate and encourage presidential candidates to listen to the voices of ordinary citizens, especially young people who are often overlooked in political conversations. The organization's director, Maria Josefina Menendez, said that she was thrilled with the response to the video and hoped that it would inspire more young people to get involved in civic engagement and advocate for change. In conclusion, the video featuring child actors has struck a chord with Mexican society as it highlights the challenges the country faces and urges presidential candidates to take action. As the country heads into a crucial election season, it is clear that citizens are ready for change, and it is up to the candidates to listen to their voices and work for a better future for all.
