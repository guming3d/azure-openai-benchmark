article: (CNN) -- Some travelers sleepily making their way through airport security in Atlanta Sunday morning got a startling wake-up. A gun detected in a carry-on at a checkpoint at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was accidentally fired by an investigating officer around 9 a.m. Sunday, according to a police report. Transportation Security Administration screeners reported the gun to Atlanta police officer N.J. Phillips, the officer wrote in an Atlanta Police Department report. The gun's owner was telling Phillips how to clear the loaded .22 Magnum revolver when it was accidentally discharged, Phillips reported. "The weapon was pointed down towards the screening table." "I was grazed by a pellet fragment on the left side of my face," Phillips wrote. "However, there were no visible injuries." The gun was loaded with "snake shot," ammunition usually used to hunt small animals. The gun's owner, Richard Popkin of Kathleen, Georgia, told Phillips he didn't realize the gun was still in his bag, according to the police report. Popkin said he originally intended to pack the bag in his checked luggage, but he removed it because he was concerned about the weight limit for his checked bag, according to the report. Popkin was arrested and charged with carrying a deadly weapon at a public gathering, according to the police report. The TSA followed standard procedure in alerting local law enforcement, the agency said in a statement. "TSA also has opened an investigation and has the authority to level a civil penalty when a firearm is brought to a checkpoint." TSA officers have discovered more than 1,100 firearms at checkpoints this year, the agency said. Firearms are not allowed in carry-on bags or at security checkpoints.

chatgpt: A gun was found in a carry-on bag at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Wednesday, according to a police report. The gun owner, who was not named, told the police he didn't realize the gun was still in his bag. The owner also reportedly stated that he had a concealed carry permit for the gun. TSA officers discovered the gun when the carry-on bag went through an X-ray machine. The gun was accidentally discharged when the bag was being checked at the airport. No one was injured when the gun was fired. The gun owner called the police and was detained for questioning about the incident. According to the report, the gun owner was cooperative with police and TSA officials. The gun owner was allowed to continue his travels after the police confirmed his concealed carry permit. However, he was issued a citation for carrying a weapon onto a prohibited area of the airport.  The TSA has strict policies regarding firearms and ammunition in carry-on bags. Firearms must be unloaded and stored in a locked, hard-sided container in checked baggage. Ammunition should also be stored separately from the firearm. Failing to adhere to these policies can result in serious consequences. Airport officials are urging travelers to always double check their bags before heading to the airport to avoid incidents like this one. The incident caused a temporary delay at the airport, but normal operations resumed shortly after. The investigation into the incident is ongoing. This serves as a reminder to all travelers to familiarize themselves with airport policies before traveling. It is important to remember that prohibited items can cause delays in flights and potentially endanger the safety of others.
