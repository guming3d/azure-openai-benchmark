The group was found at Mantaolan, on the island of Rinca off the Komodo National Park, after going missing Thursday. The divers -- three Britons, a Frenchman and a Swede -- spent two nights on the deserted island, which is home to the large Komodo dragon, before rangers found them Saturday. Frenchman Laurent Pinel, 31, said the group had to fight off one dragon with rocks and scavenged for shellfish as they waited to be rescued, Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported. "On the beach a Komodo dragon came amongst us [Friday] afternoon," Pinel said, describing how the group had to pelt the dangerous reptile with rocks to scare it away. "We had nothing to eat. We ate some kind of mussels scraped from the rocks," Pinel told the newspaper. The husband of one of the other divers said he was told they were in good condition, although dehydrated. "I'm just so relieved," said Mats Kohler, husband of Helena Neva Lainen. They are both from Sweden. An official said they were being taken to a hospital for examination. Searchers using boats located the missing divers at 11 a.m. Saturday (11 p.m. ET Friday), the official said. They arrived at a hospital in Labuan Bajo, on the western tip of the island of Flores, about two hours later, an official said.  Watch a report on the discovery of the missing group Â» . They were one of two groups of divers who entered the water off Komodo National Park on Thursday and were supposed to be gone for an hour, said an employee of the dive company, Reef Seekers.

chatgpt: In a breathtaking rescue operation, five European divers have been saved from a ferocious battle against a Komodo dragon. The group was found stranded on Mantaolan, an islet located off Rinca island in the Komodo National Park, Indonesia. The divers had gone missing on Tuesday while exploring the area. They consisted of three Britons, one Frenchwoman, and a Swede. When they didn't return from their dive, the authorities were alerted, and a search operation was launched. The rescue team was sent out on Thursday and discovered the stranded divers only after a two-hour boat ride. When they arrived on Mantaolan, the team was shocked to find the divers in a fierce struggle against a Komodo dragon.  The Komodo dragon is a species of lizard native to the Komodo National Park in Indonesia. Fully grown males can weigh over 150 pounds, and they are known to be aggressive and territorial creatures. The divers had stumbled upon the dragon's territory and had been attacked by the animal when they tried to leave. For two days, the stranded divers had fought to protect themselves from the dragon's relentless attacks. They had used whatever they had at their disposal to fend the animal off, including spears made from sticks and rocks. Still, they were severely dehydrated and injured from the ordeal. The rescue team quickly intervened and managed to subdue the Komodo dragon. They then provided medical attention to the injured divers before transporting them to a local hospital for further treatment.  The divers' families are said to be relieved and grateful for their rescue. In a statement released by the local authorities, they thanked the rescue team for their heroic efforts in saving the stranded divers. The incident highlights the dangers of exploring the rugged terrain of the Komodo National Park. Visitors are urged to exercise extreme caution and adhere to safety guidelines at all times. The Komodo dragons are not only formidable predators, but the region is also known for its unpredictable weather conditions and treacherous currents. Despite the risks involved, however, the Komodo National Park remains a popular destination for adventurers and nature enthusiasts alike. The park is known for its stunning marine life, beautiful beaches, and unique wildlife such as the Komodo dragon. The stranded divers' ordeal may have been harrowing, but it serves as a warning to all visitors to the park. Exploring the wonders of nature can be a thrilling experience, but safety should always come first.
