article: Spending on foreign aid should be slashed, voters have warned Chancellor George Osborne. The hand-outs for overseas development would be the top target for cuts among the public, according to a poll by Ipsos MORI. More than half of all voters - 55 per cent - want to see a reduction in the overseas aid budget, in defiance of David Cameron’s refusal to shelve its protected status. More than half of those polled wanted the Chancellor George Osborne to cut the amount of foreign aid Britain gives . David Cameron refuses to shelve the aid budget's protected status, despite wide criticism of the 'arbitrary' amount . Their views emerged as Tory peer Lord Ashcroft urged Mr Cameron to stop ring-fending money for spending on aid. In an article for Conservative Home, he said that the target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income is ‘arbitary and even bizarre’.  He argues that it would be both ‘popular’ and ‘help the Chancellor achieve his fiscal goals’. Lord Ashcroft believes that the Prime Minister should reassess the aid budget as it would be popular and would help the chancellor achieve his fiscal goals . He said: ‘People show compassion by giving of what they have, of their own accord. If people want to support charities that provide real help to those in need, I admire them. But governments cannot be compassionate with money they have confiscated from their citizens on pain of prison.’ Benefit payments is another area that the public want to see reduced. Some 44 per cent want a cut in welfare payments, while 28 per cent want to see a reduction in spending on defence at a time of austerity. A majority of Tory supporters, 65 per cent, want to see a reduction in benefits while even 43 per cent of Liberal Democrats want to see lower payments, just behind the 50 per cent of Ukip voters. However just over one in four Labour supporters - 26 per cent - want lower benefits. Some 84 per cent of Ukip supporters want to see spending on overseas aid slashed, followed by 61 per cent of Conservatives, 49 per cent of Labour voters and 47 per cent of Lib Dem supporters. The poll shows voters are strongly against cuts to frontline services, with just three per cent wanting a cut in state pensions, two per cent agreeing with a cut to schools and one per cent in a reduction on spending in care for the elderly. International Development Secretary Justine Greening has been more eager to overhaul aid spending than her predecessor Andrew Mitchell. Miss Greening, a chartered accountant, has promised to examine every penny that goes on foreign aid. She has cancelled handouts to India and earmarked part of the budget to support Ministry of Defence peacekeeping programmes.

chatgpt: A new poll has unveiled that 55% of people believe that the UK's aid budget should be reduced, going against Prime Minister David Cameron's insistence to maintain its protected status. The poll, conducted by Lord Ashcroft Polls, showed that a significant majority of the public is in favour of a change in government policy concerning the country's foreign aid budget. Despite persistent criticism and the current backlash against the government regarding the refugee crisis, Cameron has repeatedly stated his intention to maintain the current aid budget . However, it appears that a significant portion of the population disagrees with that position. Lord Ashcroft himself has spoken out, stating that the opinion of the majority of the public should not be ignored, and that it would be both popular and practical to reduce the budget in a time of economic hardship. According to the poll results, Cameron's stance is at odds with people’s opinion around the country, with the majority supporting a cut to the budget. The findings are sure to reignite the debate over the UK’s foreign aid budget, which has always been a contentious issue since its inception. The protection afforded to the aid budget has always met with fierce opposition, with many people arguing that foreign aid should be more closely scrutinised and that the money would be better spent on domestic problems. Such sentiment has continued to gather momentum, and this poll suggests that it is now more popular than ever before. The results indicate that the government may be out of touch with popular opinion concerning foreign aid, and if they don't adjust their policies, they could well face the wrath of voters in the upcoming elections. Proponents of reducing the aid budget point to the fact that the UK is currently facing significant economic problems, and that tough choices need to be made when it comes to allocating funds. With countless domestic issues requiring attention and national infrastructure desperately needing repair, it’s understandable why many people don't see the aid budget as a priority. However, critics warn that reducing the aid budget could have significant ramifications, impacting the country's standing on the global stage, harming international relations, and leaving many people in the world’s poorest countries without the vital support they need. As the arguments on both sides continue to unfold, one thing is certain - the UK public is sending a clear message that they want the government to consider the possibility of reducing the aid budget. Whether or not those demands are met remains to be seen, but with an election looming, the issue is sure to remain at the forefront of political debates for the foreseeable future.
