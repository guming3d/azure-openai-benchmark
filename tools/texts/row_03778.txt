article: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of Pakistani residents have taken up arms and are battling local Taliban militants in the wake of a deadly mosque attack last week. A Pakistani police stands guard at a checkpoint in Peshawar, Pakistan on June 8. It is the first major battle between the residents of northwest Pakistan and Taliban militants near the Afghanistan border. The residents are outraged over a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers that killed at least 40 people and wounded some 80 others. Starting on Saturday morning, some 400 villagers in the Upper Dir district formed a "lashkar" -- or militia -- to fight the Taliban, killing 14 of the militants as of Sunday evening, according to local administrator Atiq Ur Rehman. Four of the villagers have been injured in the battle, Rehman said. The militia have burned a number of houses thought to be sheltering the militants, according to Upper Dir police chief Ijaz Kahn. Both the residents and Taliban fighters are using heavy weapons, including rocket launchers and anti-aircraft weapons, Rehman said. There is a long history of Taliban presence in the area, including foreign fighters in leadership roles, local officials said. Authorities said Taliban fighters were driven out of Shot Ghas and Ghazigay -- two villages where the Taliban have support. The villagers took up arms against the Taliban after Friday's suicide attack at a mosque in Hayagay Sharqi -- a village in Upper Dir located about 35 km (22 miles) from the Afghan border and known for being against the Taliban. Upper Dir is a part of the Swat Valley, where the Pakistani military has waged a month-long operation against Taliban militants, but the district has not been part of the ongoing military offensive. The United Nations has said an estimated 2 million Pakistanis have been displaced by fighting between the Pakistani military and Taliban militants. The militants threatened to continue attacking cities in Pakistan until the military ends its operations against Taliban militants. As a result, Pakistani authorities have increased security in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital city. CNN's Ingrid Formanek and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report .

chatgpt: The ongoing conflict in Upper Dir, located in the Swat Valley region of Pakistan, has left the country in a state of unrest. The Pakistani army has been facing off against Taliban militants, amidst reports that an estimated 2 million Pakistanis have been displaced as a result of the conflict.  The escalating violence has led to a backlash against both sides involved in the conflict. On Friday, a suspected Taliban suicide attack at a mosque in the region only served to fuel tensions further. The attack reportedly left several dead and many more injured.  According to an official statement, both sides have been using heavy weapons, including anti-aircraft weapons, in the ongoing conflict. The situation in Upper Dir remains tense, with many residents living in fear of the violence that has become all too common in the region.  The displacement of millions of people as a result of the conflict has put a significant strain on the resources of the Pakistani government. With many people forced to flee their homes, there is an urgent need for humanitarian aid in the region.  The United Nations has expressed concern over the humanitarian crisis in the region, calling for urgent action to be taken to address the needs of the displaced people. The UN has called on the Pakistani government to ensure that those affected by the conflict receive adequate support and assistance in their time of need.  The conflict in Upper Dir is part of a wider problem faced by Pakistan, with Taliban militants causing unrest in many regions of the country. The situation is further complicated by the presence of other extremist groups, such as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State, who are also known to operate in the region.  The ongoing conflict in Upper Dir highlights the need for a long-term solution to the issue of extremism in Pakistan. While the military has had some success in pushing back against the militants, it is clear that a broader strategy is needed to address the root causes of the problem.  As the situation in Upper Dir continues to unfold, it is important that the voices of the displaced people be heard. The Pakistani government must take urgent action to provide support to those affected by the conflict, while the international community must offer assistance to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the region.
