article: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said Sunday during an unannounced visit to Afghanistan that he doesn't know whether soldiers will continue to receive paychecks if an agreement over the U.S. debt ceiling cannot be reached. "I certainly hope it gets solved," Mullen told reporters. America's highest-ranking military officer said soldiers had recently asked him about the crisis, saying "here we are, halfway around the world, fighting our country's wars, and I've got to worry about a paycheck." Mullen said August 15 would be the first payday jeopardized if the United States defaults. Soldiers normally get paid in two-week increments, making the last assured payday on August 1, he said. Senate leaders said Sunday that progress had occurred in the talks on a deficit reduction deal that would raise the debt ceiling and cut spending. However, the deadline for the United States to face possible default on its obligations is midnight Tuesday, and political wrangling in Congress has held up an agreement so far. On Friday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta issued a statement to remind military personnel that they should plan to come to work as scheduled in the coming week, regardless of whether a deal gets worked out. Panetta pledged to do "everything possible to ensure that our national defense is protected." A Department of Defense official told CNN on condition of not being identified on the possibility of military pay being withheld, "it's not a question of whether, but when, if an agreement isn't reached." The Treasury Department has not specified what might happen for troops if an agreement is not reached. But the impact could be substantial if a prolonged battle prevents the government from sending out millions of checks owed to active-duty soldiers, Social Security beneficiaries, federal employees and others. Congress has until August 2 to raise the current $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. Otherwise, Americans could face rising interest rates and a declining dollar, among other problems. Mullen said Sunday that he has seen progress in Afghanistan since a so-called "surge" of 33,000 additional troops. Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central's "The Daily Show," is also in Afghanistan to visit with troops, along with basketball player Karl Malone and magician David Blaine.

chatgpt: In the midst of the ongoing government shutdown, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has called on American troops to be patient as leaders in Washington continue to struggle to reach a deal. With no signs of resolution in sight, many soldiers are beginning to worry about whether they will continue to receive their paychecks. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, who is currently on an unannounced visit to Afghanistan, admitted that he did not know what the future would hold regarding government funding. "I certainly hope it gets solved," he told reporters. The uncertainty and volatility surrounding the government shutdown has caused great anxiety for thousands of American soldiers who depend on their paychecks to support themselves and their families. As the days drag on without any sign of progress in Washington, many are beginning to wonder how they will survive financially. Defense Secretary Panetta has reiterated his commitment to supporting troops during these difficult times, assuring them that the Department of Defense is doing everything possible to ensure that they are taken care of. However, the fact remains that if Congress fails to pass a new spending bill in the coming days, there is a real risk that thousands of soldiers could find themselves struggling to make ends meet. Despite these concerns, many soldiers are choosing to remain positive and are voicing their support for their fellow troops around the world. "We all took an oath to serve and protect our country, and we will continue to do so, no matter what," said Sergeant First Class Derrick Johnson, who is currently serving in Iraq. In the meantime, politicians in Washington continue to bicker and argue over the best course of action, with no real progress being made towards resolving the issue. As the clock ticks down, the pressure continues to mount on lawmakers to find a solution before it's too late. For the men and women serving our country overseas, the stakes are incredibly high. Without a resolution to the current crisis, many will find themselves facing financial hardship and uncertainty. As the government shutdown drags on, the question remains: when will our leaders in Washington finally put aside their differences and do what's right for the thousands of soldiers depending on them?
