But last weekend, a conversation with his son Tommi about cars led to the pair travelling back to Mr Nummelin's old house where they found the car with all its paint, lights and glass still in tact. The car, in seafoam green, was bought by the then 20-year-old Mr Nummelin to help him get to and from his first job. His son Tommi told the Huffington Post that the upper radiator hose became lose and he filled the compartment with water.

But with the father and son beginning to wonder what might have happened to the vehicle, they drove the 20 miles from their home to the old house where they found the car in the exact same spot. Tommi explained: After walking for some minutes through the forest that has slowly been growing for the last 40 years, we found a small mossy patch in it where he had left his car. The pair now plan to return to the woods behind the old family home so they can gain access to the interior of the car . 'The Ford was in better nick then anoyone really expected. Because of the remote location, all glasses and lights (except one that was smashed during towing) were intact.' However, althought the car appears to be in good shape, it has has sunk around six inches into the ground. The pair now plan to return to the woods so they can gain access to the interior of the car, but will have to take lock picking tools as Mr Nummelin no longer has the keys.

chatgpt: A Finnish man and his son made an incredible discovery when they stumbled upon an ancient vehicle that had been abandoned in a forest since 1974. Pekka Nummelin had bought a 1976 Ford Anglia back in the day, which he later towed to a spot in the woods behind his parents' house when it broke down. Despite moving across town, Mr Nummelin left the car behind where it remained, untouched and undisturbed, for four decades.  Fast forward to 2014 when Mr Nummelin and his son, Tommi, decided to revisit the spot where the car had been left. They were nothing short of surprised to find the vehicle still in the exact same spot where it had been abandoned about forty years ago. The car had become rusted and weathered, but there was no mistaking that it was the same 1976 Ford Anglia they had left behind all those years ago. Mr. Nummelin recounted the story of how the vehicle came to be left in the forest, telling local media "the car broke down and we towed it there to fix it. But when we moved house, we left it behind because we didn't want to tow it again". And that was how the car ended up being left for the best part of four decades. The car's state of preservation was a testament to the harsh weather conditions it had endured over the years. The damp and cold conditions of the Finnish forest, as well as the heavily snowed-in winters, had done little to diminish this remarkable find. The vehicle appeared frozen in time, as if no time had passed since the day it was left behind. Mr Nummelin, who now works as a carpenter, admitted that he would give anything to own such a car today, noting that it was sitting on original tires. "It is a shame we abandoned it. It is a collector's item, and even the tires are the original ones", Mr Nummelin said. The remarkable find generated a lot of curiosity from car enthusiasts who flocked to the spot to take a look at the historical artifact. While some commented on the car's impressive state of preservation, others were amazed at how a car could remain untouched in the forest for so long without being vandalized or stolen. As for Mr Nummelin, he was just happy to have seen the car again after so many years. He reflected on the memories the car evoked, reminiscing on how he had driven it from Helsinki to Lapland when he first bought it. He said, "The trip took nine hours, and the car was the same as when we left." The Nummelins have since moved the car from the forest, although they have no plans to restore it any time soon. The car remains a reminder of how time stands still in the forest, preserving for decades what might have otherwise been lost to history.
