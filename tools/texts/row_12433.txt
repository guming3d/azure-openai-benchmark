article: A fast-moving green-tailed fireball appeared in the sky last night over much of the eastern U.S. in the midst of an annual meteor shower. The American Meteor Society says they received more than 200 reports of the fireball last night around 6:20pm, from as far north as the Great Lakes to the southern state of Georgia. Those who witnessed the marvel said the fireball was greenish-to-white in color as it crossed the sky, and there was no sign that it hit anywhere. Scroll down for video . Amazing sight: The above dashcam footage taken by the the Benwood, West Virginia Police Department show the fast movig object seen Monday night . All over the map: The above map shows where there were reports of a fireball in the sky Monday night, over 12 eastern states . The reports came from the states of Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. These sightings come during the annual Taurid meteor shower, which is going on right now and could lead to more reports of meteors in the next few nights. Taurid meteors are fragments of the Comet Encke, Bill Cooke of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center toldÂ WQAD. Encke is a three-mile wide comet of ice and rock that circles the sun every 3.3 years and its fragments are very large - producing bright meteors when their hit the Earth's atmosphere. One man in Chicago recorded a fireball traveling through the sky in that city, but it was later determined that the sightings were actually just a promotional stunt carried out by Red Bull. To promote an upcoming Red Bull event, three skydivers jumped out of a plane with flares shooting from their shoes as they drifted to the ground - creating a similar sight. Monday night's sightings also corresponded with a similar event over western Japan when night fell there hours before. Experts believe the object seen in Japan was a bolide, which is a very bright shooting star. On the other side of the world: A similar green object was seen over western Japan Monday night as well .

chatgpt: On Monday night around 6:20pm, residents of 12 eastern states were treated to a spectacular display of a meteor shower. The fiery object, most likely a part of the annual Taurid meteor shower, was visible across states including Florida, West Virginia, and New York. According to astrophysicists, the Taurid meteor shower originates from the debris left behind by the Comet Encke, which orbits the sun once every 3.3 years. The annual meteor shower typically peaks in the first week of November, and this year's display did not disappoint. The stunning display of light and color was captured on camera by numerous onlookers who posted their videos on social media. The meteor was reported to be unusually bright and lasted for several seconds, leaving a trail of smoke behind it. This sighting comes just days after reports of an extra-bright shooting star over western Japan, which was also believed to be a Taurid meteor. Although this coincidence may be purely random, it has raised the question of whether these two sightings are related. Despite the excitement, the Taurid meteor shower does not pose any significant threat to Earth. The meteors are relatively small and burn up as they enter Earth's atmosphere. In fact, meteor showers provide a unique opportunity for scientists to study the origins and composition of our solar system. As more people turn their gaze to the skies, events like these are becoming increasingly common. From the breathtaking northern lights to the annual Perseid meteor shower, there are countless wonders to behold in our universe. For those who missed Monday's meteor shower, there is still a chance to catch a glimpse of the Taurid meteor shower before it reaches its peak on November 11th. The show will continue until the end of the month, offering plenty of opportunities to witness the beauty of our night sky.
