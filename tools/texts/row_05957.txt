article: (CNN) -- Jason Collins became the first openly gay man to play in the NBA on Sunday night, wearing a Brooklyn Nets uniform in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers. Collins, who lives in Los Angeles, signed a 10-day contract with the Nets on Sunday. He entered the game with 10:28 left in the second quarter, receiving a round of applause from the L.A. crowd at the Staples Center. Brooklyn won the game 108-102, and Collins played 11 minutes, not scoring any points but pulling down two rebounds and making one steal. When Collins took the court, he became the first openly gay athlete in any of the major American team sports -- baseball, football, basketball and hockey. But in a post-game interview, Collins talked like a jock, not a history maker. "It felt fun," Collins said. "It felt good to get back out there on the court." "Jason told us that his goal was to earn another contract with an NBA team. Today, I want to commend him on achieving his goal," said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. "I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment." Last year, the center, who was a free agent at the time, made the disclosure about his sexuality in an April column that appeared in Sports Illustrated magazine. "I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, 'I'm different.' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand," he wrote. Collins, 35, is a big, end-of-bench bruiser who can harangue opposing centers. Over 12 seasons, he has a career average of 3.6 points per game, and he hasn't averaged more than 2 points a games since his 2006-07 season as a Net when the team called New Jersey home. Collins received a congratulatory tweet from Michael Sam, the all-American football player from the University of Missouri who recently came out. Sam tweeted, "Congratulations to my friend @jasoncollins34 - excited to see you do work out there #Brooklyn." Collins said he didn't expect to create such media stir in the coming games. "There's only so many questions you guys can ask," he said.

chatgpt: In a historic moment for the NBA, Jason Collins made his first appearance of the season during the game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers. The veteran center made headlines last year when he came out as gay in a column for Sports Illustrated. At the time, he was the first active player in one of the four major professional North American sports leagues to openly identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. Prior to the game, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver expressed his support for Collins' return to the league. "I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud," Silver said in a statement. "He has been a leader on and off the court and an important voice in the movement for equality and inclusion in sports." Collins, who signed a 10-day contract with the Nets earlier this week, played 11 minutes during the game against the Lakers. Although he didn't score, his appearance on the court was itself a powerful moment. The 35-year-old was welcomed by his teammates and the crowd, who cheered him on throughout the game. "I'm just happy to be playing basketball again and get my first one under my belt," Collins said in a post-game interview. "It was definitely an emotional week for me, but the support from my teammates and the coaches and the Nets organization has been amazing." Collins' return to the NBA marks a significant milestone for LGBTQ+ representation in professional sports. While progress has been made in recent years, with athletes from various sports coming out as gay or transgender, there is still a long way to go. Discrimination and homophobia remain prevalent in sports, and many LGBTQ+ athletes still feel like they have to hide their identities. Collins has been a trailblazer in this regard, using his platform as a professional athlete to speak out for LGBTQ+ rights. His decision to come out in 2013 was a bold move that paved the way for other athletes to follow in his footsteps. It also highlighted the need for greater diversity and inclusion in sports. Overall, Collins' appearance in the Nets-Lakers game was a moment of progress and inspiration. While there may be further challenges ahead for LGBTQ+ athletes, Collins' courage and leadership continue to inspire others to be proud of who they are and to fight for a more inclusive sports community.
