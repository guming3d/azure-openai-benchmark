article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- The California fertility doctor who implanted a dozen embryos in Nadya Suleman, resulting in the birth of eight babies, will lose his medical license on July 1, state officials said. The California Medical Board ruled that Dr. Michael Kamrava committed "gross negligence" with "repeated negligent acts, for an excessive number of embryo transfers" into Suleman in 2008. Suleman -- known in the media as "Octomom" -- was 33 when she gave birth to eight babies in January 2009. She was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in-vitro fertilization administered by Kamrava. Kamrava, who began treating Suleman in 1997, said Suleman demanded all 12 embryos that were available for the procedure. The doctor "did not think he could refuse to transfer less embryos than those to which N.S. would agree because he believe at the time that the ultimate decision should be largely driven by the patient's wishes," the board wrote in the decision released Wednesday. "While the evidence did not establish (Kamrava) as a maverick or deviant physician, oblivious to standards of care in IVF practices, it certainly demonstrated that he did not exercise sound judgment in the transfer of 12 embryos to patient N.S. (Suleman)," the board wrote. His lawyer argued during a hearing last October that Kamrava has been "a respected, excellent physician and surgeon for 25 years," but that he "ran into sort of a perfect storm with one of his patients." Kamrava was also found guilty of gross negligence in two other cases, including his treatment of a woman on her late 40s who became pregnant with quadruplets after he implanted seven embryos. Her pregnancy was "rocked with complications," according to the medical board. Another case was a missed cancer diagnosis for a patient with an abnormal lab report. It was revealed during Kamrava's revocation hearing last October that Suleman still has 29 frozen embryos in storage available for her use should she want more children. The complaint said the doctor should have referred Suleman to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies. Kamrava, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Beverly Hills, California, was expelled from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2009 for what the fertility medical society called "a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards." The society recommends implanting no more than two embryos for women under 35 and no more than five for women over 40 -- who have more trouble getting pregnant -- according to guidelines published on its website. Giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies, including "complications with pregnancy, prematurity and long-term consequences of that," Dr. Victor Fujimoto, an expert witness called by the medical board, testified. Suleman's children -- six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature -- all went home after an extended stay in the hospital. While there has been no indication any problems have emerged, "we still don't know," Fujimoto said.

chatgpt: The California State Medical Board has ruled that Dr. Michael Kamrava committed "gross negligence" when he implanted 12 embryos in a woman who gave birth to octuplets in 2009. The woman, Nadya Suleman, had reportedly demanded that all 12 embryos be implanted. The State Medical Board had initially sought to revoke Dr. Kamrava's medical license in 2010, citing his "flagrant disregard" for professional standards. However, an administrative judge had recommended that he be placed on probation instead. Now, after a lengthy legal battle, the board has finally succeeded in revoking Dr. Kamrava's license, effective July 1. In its final decision, the board noted that Dr. Kamrava had "repeatedly and grossly" violated professional standards in his treatment of Suleman. The case had attracted national attention at the time, with many questioning the ethics of Kamrava's actions. Some experts criticized him for not considering the potential health risks to both the mother and the babies, while others accused him of exploiting Suleman's desire for a large family in order to profit financially. In its decision, the board noted that Kamrava had a history of "substandard care" and "misconduct" in his treatment of other patients as well. For example, he had reportedly implanted six embryos in a woman who was not married or in a stable relationship, which resulted in a high-risk pregnancy. Kamrava had argued that he was acting in the best interests of his patients, and that Suleman had specifically requested that all 12 embryos be implanted. However, the board argued that his actions were reckless and showed a lack of judgment. The board's decision has been welcomed by many in the medical community, who see it as an important step in upholding professional standards and preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future. Some have expressed concern, however, that the ruling may discourage doctors from taking on difficult cases or pursuing innovative treatments. Suleman has not commented publicly on the board's decision. She has previously defended Kamrava, saying that he had provided her with the care and support that she needed during her pregnancy. Despite the controversy surrounding the case, the octuplets – six boys and two girls – have reportedly grown up healthy and are now 12 years old. Suleman, who has become known as "Octomom," has faced her own set of challenges over the years, including financial difficulties and legal troubles. The case has also raised broader questions about the ethics of fertility treatments and the responsibilities of doctors. While many experts believe that patients should have the right to make their own choices about their reproductive health, others argue that doctors have a duty to act in the best interests of their patients and to prioritize their health and safety above all else.
