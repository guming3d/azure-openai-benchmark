One of the women, aged 19, was brutally cut across the throat, while the other, aged 26, was sliced across the face. The incidents happened within a short distance of each other, raising suspicions that they may have been linked. Police have launched an investigation and are appealing to anyone with information to come forward. The first attack took place around 7 pm on Friday, when the 19-year-old victim was walking home from work. She was approached from behind by an unknown attacker who slit her throat with a sharp object. The woman managed to call for help, and emergency services rushed to the scene. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and is said to be in a stable condition. Just two hours later, the second attack occurred in the same area. This time it was a 26-year-old woman who was targeted. She was walking home from a friend’s house when an attacker jumped out and sliced her face with what is believed to be a knife. The victim screamed for help and was able to run away, while the attacker fled the scene.
