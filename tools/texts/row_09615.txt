According to reports, he was hit by a lorry and suffered severe injuries, leaving him in a critical state. However, latest reports suggest that he is 'alive and stable' but still in serious condition, receiving treatment at a hospital in Leeds. The incident took place while Carlisle was walking towards the city centre in York. Witnesses claim that before the accident happened, he stopped to help a distressed stranger, and the next moment he was hit by a lorry. The driver of the lorry stopped at the scene and was cooperating with the police during their investigation. Carlisle, who made more than 500 appearances for 11 different clubs, was a prominent figure in British football commercials and broadcasting after retiring from the game in 2013.
