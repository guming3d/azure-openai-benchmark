article: (CNN) -- Federal health officials are investigating another possible norovirus outbreak aboard a cruise ship that just ended a Caribbean voyage. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 114 passengers and 10 crew members on the Holland America cruise ship ms Veendam suffered vomiting and diarrhea during a week-long voyage that ended Saturday. A CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officer and an epidemiologist boarded the ship when it arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Saturday, the agency said. The investigators will "conduct an environmental health assessment and evaluate the outbreak and response activities." The CDC is also testing stool samples from the sickened passengers and crew, the agency said. Holland America officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Veendam carried 1,273 passengers and a crew of 575, the CDC said. Hundreds of people aboard two cruise ships in the Caribbean fell ill with norovirus last month. The CDC reported that norovirus hit more than 600 passengers and crew on Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas in January, making it one of the biggest such outbreaks on any cruise ship in the past two decades. The Caribbean Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, cut short its seven-day Caribbean itinerary last month after 178 passengers and 11 crew members were stricken with norovirus. CDC staffers helped sanitize that ship. The Veendam got a failing grade from CDC inspectors who found multiple sanitation violations, including brown liquid dripping on clean dishes and a fly on the buffet, in September, the CDC said. "While unacceptable for Holland America Line, the unsatisfactory score is highly unusual and an aberration," Holland America's Sally Andrews said last year. Inspectors don't tell cruise lines when they're going to show up, but they visit twice a year as part of the CDC's vessel sanitation inspection program. The CDC grades ships on a 100-point scale. An 85 or lower is considered a failing grade. The Veendam received a grade of 77. "Since 1996, Veendam has received passing scores on 32 inspections," Andrews said. The Veendam is a 16-year-old ship, christened by actress Debbie Reynolds, that can carry 1,930 passengers and crew, according to Holland America. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that at least 114 passengers and 10 crew members aboard a Holland America ship have fallen ill with vomiting and diarrhea. The ship was en route to Florida when federal health officials boarded it on Saturday to investigate the outbreak. This incident comes just weeks after hundreds of passengers aboard two other cruise ships in the Caribbean also fell ill with the norovirus, a highly contagious stomach bug. The outbreaks have once again raised concerns about the cleanliness and safety of cruise ships, which have faced criticism in the past for their lack of adequate health and safety measures. The Holland America ship, the Veendam, has also been under scrutiny recently after receiving a failing grade from CDC inspectors in September. The Veendam, which can carry up to 1,350 passengers, received a score of just 77 out of 100 during its inspection. The failing grade was due to a number of violations, including improper food handling, inadequate sanitation practices, and poor overall cleanliness. The recent outbreak on the Veendam serves as a reminder of the importance of proper sanitation practices in preventing the spread of illness on cruise ships. The norovirus, which is spread through contaminated food or water, can cause symptoms such as stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea, and can be particularly dangerous for young children, elderly individuals, and those with weakened immune systems. Holland America has released a statement regarding the outbreak, saying that they are working closely with health officials to identify the source of the illness and prevent further spread. The company has also implemented a number of measures to contain the outbreak, including isolating those who are sick and increasing sanitation procedures around the ship. Despite these efforts, many passengers on the Veendam have expressed concern about the ongoing outbreak and the overall cleanliness of the ship. Some have even chosen to cut their vacations short and disembark early, citing fears for their own health and safety. The recent outbreaks on cruise ships highlight the need for greater transparency and accountability in the industry, as well as stronger measures to ensure the health and safety of passengers and crew. While the CDC and other health organizations continue to investigate these outbreaks, it is clear that much work remains to be done in order to prevent future incidents and protect the well-being of those onboard.
