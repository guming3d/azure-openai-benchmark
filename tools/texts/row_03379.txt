article: (CNN) -- David Nalbandian was disqualified in the ATP Queen's Club final Sunday for angrily kicking down an advertising board and injuring a court side official. The Argentinian was leading Croatia's Marin Cilic by a set and trailed 3-4 in the second, having just dropped his service, when the incident occurred. A Cilic serve to his forehand saw Nalbandian unable to return and he took out his frustration on the board, which was just in front of line judge Andrew McDougall. The force of Nalbandian's kick left McDougall with a nasty gash to his leg and he stood up to protest to the player. Umpire Fergus Murphy halted play before ATP supervisor Tom Barnes came onto the court to speak to him and the 30-year-old Nalbandian, who was officially defaulted for "unsportsmanlike behavior." He later returned to apologize for his actions to the 6,000 capacity crowd at the club in London. "I am sorry to do that. Sometimes we get very frustrated here on court. It is tough to control," he said. "It is a mistake. It is a tough moment to end a final like that. Sometimes we feel the pressure from the ATP. It is a mistake and I have to pay for that. Everybody makes mistakes." A subdued Cilic was handed the tournament trophy, the first ATP title for the 23-year-old since winning in St Petersburg in October last year.

"I can't change it, but I'm really sorry for the fans that it finished like this." Tournament director Chris Kermode told BBC Sport that officials had been left with no other option than to default Nalbandian. "David is struggling to come to terms with it. He clearly regrets what happened -- but these things happen. "Queen's is sold out and the spectators are watching some great tennis, so to have the match end this way is quite disappointing. "But there's not a lot we can do about it. We are under the governance of ATP rules." Kermode added that McDougall had been taken to the tournament's medical center to have attention for his injured leg. An ATP official later told CNN that in their records dating back to 1980 they could not find another instance of a player being disqualified in an ATP final for a similar offense than committed by Nalbandian.

chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, David Nalbandian, the Argentine tennis star, was disqualified from the Queen's Club final on Sunday after he injured a line judge when he kicked over an advertising hoarding. This unfortunate incident left Andrew McDougall, the line judge, with a deep gash on his leg.  As the repercussions of his actions became clear, Nalbandian could only watch on in disbelief as the referee disqualified him from the match. Despite winning the first set, he had thrown away any chance of winning the tournament with his ill-tempered outburst. McDougall received medical treatment for his injury, but it was clear that he was in significant pain. The incident occurred in the second set of the match, with Nalbandian losing his serve to opponent Marin Cilic. Frustrated at his performance, he headed back to the bench, where an advertising hoarding caught his eye. In a moment of recklessness, he lashed out at the hoarding with his right foot, causing it to break and sending shards of wood across the court. The line judge, who was sitting in a nearby chair, was struck by the wood and immediately fell to the ground clutching his leg. The referee quickly intervened and after a brief discussion with officials, disqualified Nalbandian from the match. An announcement was made to the crowd to confirm that the Argentine star had lost his chance to win the title. The incident was met with disappointment from both spectators and players alike. Cilic, who was awarded the match and title due to Nalbandian's disqualification, expressed his regret at the situation. "Nobody wants to win a tournament this way," he said in a statement after the match. "It's unfortunate that it had to end this way." In a televised interview after the match, Nalbandian apologized for his actions, admitting that he had let himself down and that his behavior was unacceptable. "It was a mistake," he said. "I'm sorry for the guy. I feel really sorry for him." The incident has raised questions over Nalbandian's future as a professional tennis player, with some suggesting that he could face further disciplinary action as a result of his outburst. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that Sunday's events will be remembered as a black mark on his career, and a cautionary tale for anyone tempted to lash out in the heat of the moment.
