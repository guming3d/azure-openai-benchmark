The mother-son duo completed their winter wonderland with a mannequin of Princess Esla. They also dotted other characters from Frozen around the front yard including Anna, Kristoff, and the Olaf the snowman. Despite being proud of her display, Ragel is worried here might be an accident because passing traffic sometimes stops in the 'middle of the road' to catch a glimpse of it. 'People honk and wave,' she told The Effingham Daily News. Ragel's idea for the giant icicle originally came from her late husband, Alan, who liked to build smaller ones along the driveway.

chatgpt: Residents in St. Elmo were recently treated to a magnificent sight as a giant icicle measuring eight feet long finally reached the ground after a lengthy eight-day journey from the top of a tree. The impressive icicle was the result of a creative idea by 56-year-old Katherine Ragel, who enlisted the help of her son Garrick Moreland to create the wintry wonderland display. The idea was born of the icy conditions prevalent in the area, with temperatures plummeting below zero as winter took hold. Since the household had a large tree in the yard, Katherine and Garrick decided to create something special. Heading to the tree, Garrick took to the branches as the temperatures dropped even further, climbing up with a hose and braving the cold to create the giant icicle. For eight days, the icicle grew in size, dangling precariously above the ground and captivating onlookers. Many residents made a point of visiting the tree each day to check on its progress and snap photos of the impressive creation. The arbor man had indeed created a masterpiece - a beauty to behold. Despite the cold weather, Katherine and Garrick were delighted by the attention their creation had garnered. They had achieved their aim of bringing a touch of the winter magic to the area and filling it with the wonder that the season often evokes. However, they knew that warmer weather would see the end of their handiwork, as the warmer temperatures would soon cause the icicle to melt away. As expected, the warmth soon returned to the area, and the icicle’s descent was imminent. It was a bittersweet moment for the family and the neighborhood, as it signaled the end of the wonderful creation's journey. Nonetheless, the memory of the giant icicle stuck around, bringing a smile to many faces in the area who were fortunate enough to witness its beauty. In conclusion, the giant icicle that took eight long days to travel from the top of a tree to the ground has left an indelible impression on those who saw it, filling the town of St. Elmo with the magic of winter. While the days of the icicle may be numbered, its memory will stay with the community forever.
