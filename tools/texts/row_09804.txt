chatgpt: Lauren Finkelstein, a 32-year-old DJ from Houston, has had enough of people asking her when she's going to settle down. In a viral photo shared on the Huffington Post, Finkelstein is seen pouring herself a glass of champagne while her sisters show off their wedding and engagement rings. Finkelstein explained that she has been asked so many times about her plans to get married that she has lost count. She said that while she's always happy for her sisters and their significant others, she's equally happy being single and focusing on her career. "It's not that I'm against marriage or anything like that," Finkelstein stated. "It's just that I'm not going to settle for anything less than what I truly want in a partner." Finkelstein's refreshing outlook on single life has resonated with many on social media, with thousands of people sharing the photo and praising her for living life on her own terms. "I've never understood why society can't accept that some people are perfectly happy being single," wrote one Twitter user in response to the photo. Another user commented, "Lauren is living her best life and I love to see it. She doesn't need a partner to have a fulfilling life." Finkelstein's successful career as a DJ has taken her all over the world, allowing her to experience new cultures and meet new people. She said that being single has given her the freedom to pursue her dreams and follow her passions without any limitations. While she hasn't ruled out the possibility of getting married someday, Finkelstein maintained that it's important for people to focus on their own happiness rather than conforming to societal expectations. "I don't want to settle down just because that's what's expected of me," Finkelstein explained. "I want to settle down when I find the right person who fits into my life and makes me happy." In the meantime, Finkelstein will continue to live life on her own terms, pouring herself a glass of champagne as her sisters flaunt their rings, and inspiring others to do the same.
