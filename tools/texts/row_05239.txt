article: By . Rob Cooper . A Somalian grandmother was allowed to come to Britain to live in a council house with her daughter who is an unemployed single mother-of-three living on benefits. Halima Jimale, 68, was reunited with her daughter Fadumo Mohamed, 43, who claims £310 a week in handouts despite fears that she would also be a drain on taxpayers' money. A relative promised to give the pensioner £100 a week so she didn't have to rely on benefits as well - but the tribunal heard he had just £1.15 in his bank account. Hearing: The Tribunal judge ruled that Halima Jimale, 68 could come to Britain to live with her daughter . But despite this, judges in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber Upper Tribunal gave Ms Jimale permission to come to Britain. They ruled that fellow Somalian Abdulkadir Elmi, 46, who is a security guard earning £22,400 a year would do his best to support the family. The tribunal, sitting in London, heard that Ms Jimale will live rent free in her daughter's council house with her three grandchildren. As Mrs Mohamed was already living in a council house, the court ruled it would not cost the state any more to have her mother brought to Britain as well. Mr Justice Bernard McCloskey heard that the single mother receives £188 a month in child benefit for her three children, £101 income support and £165 per week in tax credits. Despite Mr Elmi's lack of money they found 'there is a clear bond of mutual loyalty and support' in Somalian family culture and he could be depended on to provide money to the pensioner. If the security guard stops handing over £100 per week to the family, Ms Jimale will be forced to rely on state handouts. The tribunal was told that Mr Elmi had just £1.15 in his account because he had been sending money to his parents in Somalia. However, he had recently stopped as they had got jobs. The Home Office argued that Ms Jimale shouldn't be allowed into the country because there was no evidence that the distant relative would actually hand over any money. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'We are disappointed with the judgment in this case, however we can only challenge decisions if an error of law is detected. In this case there were no grounds for further appeal. 'We are clear that those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution are welcome - but family life must not be established here at the UK taxpayer's expense.'

chatgpt: Halima Jimale, a 68-year-old woman, came to the UK in hopes of being reunited with her daughter, Fadumo Mohamed. However, her arrival was met with controversy as Fadumo claimed £310 a week in state handouts. The issue sparked concerns among taxpayers who were worried that Halima may become a burden on the country's finances. Thankfully, a judge ruled that Halima would not be a drain on taxpayers' money, and she was allowed to stay in the UK. This decision was based on the fact that Halima's family had promised to support her financially, with a relative offering to give them £100 a week. However, the promise of financial support from the relative soon fell flat when it was revealed that they only had £1.15 in their bank account. This revelation has cast doubt on whether Halima's family will be able to support her in the long term. The situation has ignited a debate about the UK's immigration policies, with some questioning whether it is fair for people to come to the country without any means of supporting themselves. While others argue that the UK should prioritize helping families reunite, regardless of their financial situation. On one hand, immigration is an important issue that affects the whole country. Taxpayers have every right to expect that the people who come to the UK will not become a drain on the country's finances. However, on the other hand, it's important to remember that families who have been separated for years deserve the chance to be reunited. The issue is not a simple one, and it seems that there are no easy solutions. However, it's clear that the country needs to find a way to balance the needs of taxpayers with the needs of people like Halima, who simply want to be reunited with their loved ones. In the meantime, Halima's family has vowed to find a way to support her. Fadumo claims that she is actively seeking employment and hopes to become financially independent soon. However, the question remains: what happens to people like Halima who don't have family members to support them? The issue of immigration and financial support is a complex one that the UK will continue to grapple with. As the country looks for solutions, it's important to remember that at the heart of this issue are real people like Halima, who just want to be with their families.
