A growing trend in shops using fatter child mannequins has been described by a leading children’s charity as ‘desperately sad’. Fifty per cent of the British population is predicted to be obese by 2050 and the UK has the highest child obesity rate in Western Europe. In a sign of the deepening crisis, one mannequin manufacturer has seen a 300% surge in requests from shops for plus-size child models. Fat's shocking: Stores are increasingly demanding bigger mannequins . The dummies used to display clothing for seven to eight-year-olds have a standard size of 4ft in height, with a 26in chest and 22in waist. However, many shops are requesting plus-size mannequins 20 per cent bigger, according to The Daily Mirror. Vicky Chatten, communications executive at mannequin manufacturer Displaysense, said: ‘We’ve had a 300% increase in calls from retailers looking for much larger child mannequins, ranging from as young as four years old up to 10-year-olds. It is quite shocking and a trend that is one the increase.’ Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation, told the paper that the situation was ‘desperately sad’ but added that the country needs to face up to the fact that there is now an epidemic of fat children. Chubby: Fifty per cent of the British population is predicted to be obese by 2050 . The news follows controversy stirred up by clothing store American Apparel, which last week decked out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair. The storefront at the retailer's East Houston location in New York features three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear, exposing their unkempt bikini lines and stopping window shoppers dead in their tracks. But while some Twitter users have labeled the exhibition 'kinda pervy', the retailer has defended it by saying it is intended to start a conversation about society's concept of feminine beauty.

chatgpt: According to a recent study, the United Kingdom is facing a major health crisis as half of its population is expected to be suffering from obesity by 2050. This projection is based on current trends and if nothing is done to address the issue, it could cause a significant burden on the healthcare system and the economy as a whole. The study also revealed that the UK has the highest child obesity rate in Western Europe. This is a cause for concern as childhood obesity can lead to various health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. This could also have a long-term impact on the country's future workforce and productivity. Experts blame a number of factors for the rise in obesity rates including easy access to high-calorie junk food, sedentary lifestyles, and lack of exercise. The UK government has implemented several policies to combat this issue, such as introducing a sugar tax and promoting healthy eating in schools. However, some argue that more needs to be done to tackle the root cause of the problem. Public health professionals are calling for a multi-faceted approach which includes greater access to healthy, affordable food, more physical activity opportunities, and education on nutrition and healthy lifestyles. They argue that a more comprehensive approach is essential to address the complex factors that contribute to obesity. The study's authors emphasized the importance of taking proactive measures now to prevent the predicted rise in obesity rates. They suggest that a successful approach would involve cooperation between the government, healthcare professionals, the food industry and the wider public. While the UK is not alone in facing this issue, the projected rise in obesity rates is a cause for concern. Taking action now to address this problem is critical as it could have serious implications for the country's health and well-being, as well as its economy. The government and society as a whole need to act now to reverse the trend and ensure a healthier future for all.
