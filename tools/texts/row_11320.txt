FCO minister Hugo Swire told Thai charge d'affaires Nadhavathna Krishnamra there was 'a real concern' in the UK over the way in which the deaths of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have been dealt with. Mr Swire said it was crucial for the Thai authorities to investigate the killings in a 'fair and transparent way' and keep the victims' families up to date with progress. Scroll down for video .

The two murder suspects - named in reports as bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun - are paraded before the press before they are taken to the beach to reconstruct the crime . The two suspects, both 21, were charged with three offences - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery. But later reports - denied by the Thai police - suggested that a Burmese embassy official had formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured. Following Mr Krishnamra's meeting with Mr Swire today, the Foreign Office said in a statement: 'Mr Swire stressed that there was a real concern in the UK about how the investigation has been handled by the Thai authorities. He said that it was crucial for the investigation to be conducted in a fair and transparent way. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, show how 'they killed' backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller . 'Mr Swire emphasised how important it was that the UK and Hannah and David's families received regular updates on the investigation's progress. He also noted his concern about the way that the police had engaged with the media on the case and reiterated that the UK police stood ready to assist with the investigation and subsequent legal process.' Earlier this month, Mr Swire spoke to Thailand's deputy prime minister Tanasak Patimapragorn about the case.

chatgpt: FCO’s Hugo Swire has called for a fair and transparent investigation surrounding allegations of torture made against two men suspected of the murder of two British backpackers in Thailand last year. Speaking to Thai officials, Swire demanded that any investigation be carried out in a way that is fair and transparent, while also calling for the victims’ families to be kept informed of developments.
 
The two men, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun, from Myanmar, were convicted in December for the brutal murder of British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on the southern island of Koh Tao in 2014. However, the case has been fraught with controversy surrounding allegations of torture and inadequate legal representation.
 
Just last week, a Burmese embassy official claimed that the two men had been tortured into confessing to the killings. According to the official, the suspects were subjected to beatings and cigarette burns, and were forced to watch as their families were threatened. The official also claims that the two men were not given access to legal representation until weeks after their arrest, despite repeatedly requesting it.
 
Swire’s comments come just days after the official’s allegations were made public. It is the second time Swire has spoken out on this issue, having met with Thai officials in October to raise concerns about the conduct of the investigation and trial. At the time, he called for a probe into the allegations of police brutality.
 
The accusations made by the Burmese embassy official have only served to reinforce concerns about the Thai justice system. The country has come under fire recently for its use of military courts in cases involving civilians, and for its poor record on human rights. Thailand’s reputation as a safe destination for tourists has also been called into question in recent years due to a spate of unsolved violent crimes, including the murder of the two British travellers.
 
The allegations of torture against the two suspects are particularly worrying, as they highlight the corrosive effect that such practices can have on a legal system. If proven, they would not only invalidate the convictions of the two men, but also call into question the entire basis of the trial. It is therefore essential that a thorough and impartial investigation is conducted into these claims, and that any wrongdoing is exposed, regardless of who is involved.
 
The importance of keeping the victims’ families informed of any developments in the case cannot be overstated. The families have already suffered immeasurable loss and pain, and it is essential that they are kept up-to-date on any changes that may affect the case. This includes updates on the investigation into the allegations of torture, as well as any further legal proceedings that may arise.
 
In conclusion, the allegations of torture made against the two suspects in the Koh Tao murder case must be taken seriously. The claims raise serious concerns about the conduct of the Thai justice system, and underscore the need for a thorough and impartial investigation into police conduct. The families of the victims must also be kept informed of any developments in the case, so that they can continue the long and difficult process of coming to terms with their loss.
