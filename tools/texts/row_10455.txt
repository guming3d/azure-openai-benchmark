article: Japan has delayed the launch of its space probe for the second time due to bad weather. The Hayabusa2 will now blast off on a six-year mission to mine a distant asteroid aboard Japan's main H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center in south of the country on Wednesday at 1.22 pm local time. The probe was originally scheduled to launch today but Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) postponed it to Monday after a forecast of thick clouds.

Hayabusa2 had been set to blast off aboard the H-IIA rocket, pictured, from Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan today but the launch was postponed for the second time due to bad weather . The agency said it decided on the second postponement due to fears of strong winds, and warned that the launch could be delayed further depending on the weather. The 31 billion yen ($260 million) project will send the explorer towards the 1999JU3 asteroid in deep space. It will blast a crater in the asteroid to collect materials unexposed to millennia of wind and radiation, in the hope of answering some fundamental questions about life and the universe. Hayabusa2 will take off only weeks after a European spacecraft's historic landing on a comet captivated the world's attention.

The probe, which is about the size of a domestic refrigerator, is expected to reach the asteroid in mid-2018 and spend around 18 months near it. It will also study the surface by dropping tiny robots and if all goes well, asteroid samples will be returned to Earth in late 2020. The Hayabusa2 mission will blast off just weeks after the European Space Agency succeeded in making mankind's first ever landing on a comet this month. Scientists said initial data sent from the robot lab Philae showed traces of organic molecules and a surface much harder than imagined. Philae, released from its mothership Rosetta, has gone into hibernation on the comet, having used its onboard battery power after 60 hours of prodding and probing.

chatgpt: Japan's Hayabusa2 probe is set to blast off on Wednesday, November 30th, at 1.22pm local time. The asteroid explorer, which was originally scheduled to launch earlier this week, will now set off aboard the country's main H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan. The launch date was postponed from Monday due to a forecast of thick clouds that could have endangered the launch. The Hayabusa2 mission is an ambitious project that aims to land on an asteroid, collect samples of the asteroid's rock, and return them to Earth for analysis. The mission is scheduled to last until the end of 2019, and will involve several complex maneuvers in space. The Hayabusa2 probe is equipped with a suite of instruments that will allow it to study the asteroid's surface, composition, and structure in great detail. The spacecraft will also deploy a lander and three small rovers to explore the asteroid's surface up close. The Hayabusa2 mission has been in development for several years, and has faced several technical challenges along the way. However, the successful landing of a probe on a comet by the European Space Agency in November 2014 has given the Hayabusa2 team renewed hope that they can complete their mission as well. The Hayabusa2 spacecraft represents a significant step forward in the field of space exploration, and is expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the solar system and its origins. The mission has already generated significant interest from scientists around the world, who are eager to see what discoveries the probe will make. The launch of the Hayabusa2 probe is an exciting event that marks a new chapter in the history of space exploration. With its advanced instruments and cutting-edge technology, the probe is poised to make important contributions to our understanding of the universe and our place within it. As the probe sets off on its journey, scientists and space enthusiasts around the world will be following its progress closely, eagerly anticipating the important discoveries that it will make. The success of the Hayabusa2 mission will be a testament to the dedication and expertise of the many scientists and engineers who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality.
