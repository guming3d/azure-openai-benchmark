article: Rancho Mirage, California (CNN) -- Following the furor over revelations the U.S. government is collecting telephone records and data mining popular online services, National Intelligence Director James Clapper took the unusual step Saturday of declassifying some details about the programs. In doing so, Clapper reiterated President Barack Obama's position that the programs are necessary to fight terrorism, while one of his deputies said the administration was looking into possible repercussions caused by leaks to the media about programs. "We are doing an assessment of the damage that has been done to U.S. national security by the revelation of this information," Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters during a news briefing in Rancho Mirage, California, where President Barack Obama was meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. "...Currently, there's a review underway to understand what potential damage may be done." How does it affect me? Clapper's declassification of some details is the most comprehensive explanation by the government to date of how the programs work and what information they collect. Among the details made public: The National Security Agency's PRISM program -- the program that reportedly allows the government to access online services -- is an internal government computer system that is used to manage foreign intelligence collected from online providers and services. "Over the last week we have seen reckless disclosures of intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe," Clapper said in a statement distributed along with a two-and-a-half pages of details about the programs. Privacy's already dead . "In a rush to publish, media outlets have not given the full context -- including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government." The release of the declassified material comes as the government is under fire following revelations about the surveillance and intelligence programs that have seen privacy advocates call for reforms and elected officials question the expansive nature of the intelligence-gathering activities. Internet laughs about being spied on . The revelations began Wednesday, when a British newspaper, the Guardian, published a top secret order from an intelligence court that required Verizon Business Network Services to give telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19. Revelation opens political Pandora's box . That was followed a day later by a report from The Washington Post that the government was using a program called PRISM that reportedly allows NSA analysts access to computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other companies to extract details of customer activities, including "audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents" and other materials. Clapper said the surveillance activities published in the Guardian and The Washington Post are "lawful and conducted under authorities widely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress" since its inception in 2008.

chatgpt: The United States is currently undergoing a review in order to analyze the potential damage that could arise from the PRISM program, according to a top government official. National Intelligence Director James Clapper recently released details of the highly classified computer system that is primarily utilized for managing foreign intelligence. The disclosure was a rare glimpse into one of the most secretive programs in the U.S. intelligence community. Many experts believe that the review of the PRISM program is well overdue, considering the complexity and scope of the system. The program is said to be responsible for collecting and analyzing massive amounts of information from a wide range of sources across the globe. The information gathered includes everything from phone records to email messages. Despite the program's controversial nature, supporters of PRISM argue that it is essential for national security, especially in a post-9/11 era where terrorism poses a major threat. They claim that PRISM has prevented numerous acts of terrorism and saved countless lives. The declassification of the details of the PRISM program provides a unique opportunity for the public to examine the inner workings of the system. There are already concerns over the legality of the program and its impact on privacy. However, the review of the PRISM program could provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the program and its potential consequences. In addition, the review could also contribute to a broader discussion on the use of surveillance in the modern world. Technology has made it easier than ever before to collect vast amounts of data, but balancing national security concerns with individual privacy remains a significant challenge. The review of the PRISM program could have implications for the future of surveillance both in the U.S. and around the world. The release of information on PRISM has already sparked widespread debate and discussion across the nation. Some have pointed out that the program could be in violation of civil liberties, while others argue that it is a necessary tool in the fight against terror. The review could offer a chance to address these issues and create a more transparent and accountable system for gathering intelligence. However, there are concerns that the review may not be comprehensive enough. Some experts argue that the probe needs to be more in-depth in order to fully understand the potential risks and impacts of the PRISM program. There is also the issue of balancing the need for national security with individual privacy rights, which is a complex and challenging task. In conclusion, the review of the PRISM program is a crucial step in understanding the potential consequences of the highly classified computer system used for managing foreign intelligence. The program has been highly controversial since its inception, and the declassification of its details could provide valuable insights into its effectiveness and legality. However, there are still concerns about the comprehensiveness of the review and whether it adequately addresses privacy concerns. The final results of the review could have far-reaching implications not only for national security, but also for the broader debate on surveillance in the modern world.
