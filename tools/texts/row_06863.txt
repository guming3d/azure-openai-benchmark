article: By . Reuters . A 41-year-old man who was arrested after border officials found two dying Mexican men in the trunk of his car at the U.S.-Mexican border wept in court on Wednesday as he was arraigned on a federal smuggling charge. Nicholas George Zakov appeared distraught as his court-appointed attorney entered a plea of innocent on his behalf during a brief hearing in U.S. District Court in San Diego. Following the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Wheat said federal investigators were still probing the incident and plan to take the evidence, including the as-yet unfinished autopsy results, to a grand jury for an indictment in the next week. Custom border officers stopped Nicholas George Zakov in this orange Dodger Challenger at the U.S.-Mexican border on Tuesday, August 12 - two dying men were found in the trunk . Wheat said that the two men found last week in the trunk of the orange 2012 Dodge Challenger, identified as Tarcisio Casas-Blanco and Jose Quiroz-Casas, were from the Mexican state of Guanajuato. They had been caught in the United States illegally before and were voluntarily returned - a process where they waived hearings that might have led to formal deportation and instead were immediately returned to Mexico. According to the complaint, when Zakov arrived at the border inspection station after waiting in a line of cars for over an hour, he said he had nothing to declare.

However, he was selected at random for a secondary inspection, Wheat said and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents using a scanner on the car found irregularities in the trunk. Upon opening the trunk, the customs agents found the two men unconscious - one was breathing and the other was not, Wheat said. Both men were later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Zakov, who is from North Dakota but now lives in the Los Angeles area, told federal investigators that he was supposed to be paid $3,500 for smuggling the men into the United States, according to the criminal complaint against him.

chatgpt: A man has been arrested at the U.S.-Mexican border after border officials discovered two dying Mexican men in the trunk of his car. The man, identified as Nicholas George Zakov, age 41, claimed that he had nothing to declare when he approached the border. However, during a routine search, customs agents found two unidentified men unconscious in the trunk of his car. One of the men was found to be breathing while the other was not. Unfortunately, both were later pronounced dead. Zakov stated that he was supposed to receive $3,500 for smuggling the men into the U.S. Zakov has since been arrested and charged with several crimes, including human smuggling and transporting and harboring illegal aliens. As authorities investigate the incident, more details are expected to emerge. The incident highlights the dangers of human smuggling, which can result in serious health risks and even death for those being smuggled. According to the Department of Homeland Security, human smuggling is a growing problem, with criminal networks smuggling immigrants across the border for profit. Smugglers often use hidden compartments in vehicles, such as trunks, to transport people across the border. They typically charge high fees for their services, and the people being smuggled are forced to endure dangerous conditions during the journey. Border officials have been cracking down on human smuggling in recent years. In 2020, a total of 197 human smuggling-related deaths were reported along the U.S.-Mexican border. In light of this recent incident, authorities are urging people not to attempt to enter the U.S. illegally. They advise people to follow proper legal procedures and to avoid falling victim to criminal networks that profit from human smuggling.  Overall, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of human smuggling and the importance of border security in preventing such illegal activities. As the investigation continues into this tragic case, authorities will continue their efforts to combat human smuggling and keep people safe.
