Enjoying 1,100 sq metres of absolute harbourfront, the three-storey home also boasts grand dining rooms, a Butler's pantry, stained glass windows, marble fireplaces, its own tidal pool and verandahs with the best views in town. 'Ravenscourt' has only had three owners in its history and,  like many homes in the area, has been kept within the one family. Property Agent Mathew Hayson says it's rare for this kind of estate to come on the market. 'You can probably count on one hand the number of properties that have come up in the last two decades', he told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are only about 200 waterfront homes and most of them have been owned for a very long time.' He says the Stannard family for example, who ran the first boat-building companyÂ  in the area in 1900s, owned all the dockyards for 'a good 100 years.' Hayson expects 'Ravenscourt' to sell in the same price range as two similar waterfront Wharf Rd properties: Number 43 Wharf Rd went for $11.5m in 2008 and number 19 for $11.1m in 2009.
