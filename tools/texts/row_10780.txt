article: A beloved Roman Catholic priest was found dead Wednesday in his church's rectory, spurring police to launch a murder investigation and those he touched to try to make sense of his sudden passing. Eureka, California, Police Chief Andy Mills said officers -- responding to a call from staff at St. Bernard Church -- first came across the victim around 9 a.m. Wednesday. He did not elaborate on how the death occurred, adding Wednesday night that there were no suspects. Mayor Frank Jager identified the victim as the Rev. Eric Freed, whom he called a personal friend and a "tremendous person in this community" since his arrival three years ago. The St. Bernard Parish website featured a cross and the words, "Rest in Peace," above Freed's name. "He was a really, genuinely warm individual," said professor Stephen Cunha, the chairman of Humboldt University's religious studies department where Freed taught for more than 10 years. "... Kind is the word that comes to mind, sensitive." Noting that students at the state university loved Freed -- who was also deeply involved in that school's Catholic student group, the Newman Center -- Cunha added: "This was not some stuffy clergyman. He was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with... "He connected with everybody." Local and state authorities remained at St. Bernard Church -- one of two in the coastal Northern California city situated 275 miles north of San Francisco where he was the sole pastor -- late Wednesday processing the crime scene and following up on tips, Mills said. Those efforts include looking for Freed's vehicle, a 2010 Nissan Altima. The police chief said that authorities had no solid leads. Just a few days ago, the priest sent a note to his parishioners thanking them for their support and prayers and wishing them a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. "I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to be your pastor," Freed wrote in a letter posted on the parish website. "Our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as Catholic Christians." While he was relatively new to St. Bernard, Freed had already made an impact there and elsewhere around Eureka -- including with the city's Japanese-American community, as Freed lived in Japan for many years -- Jager told reporters. "This is an absolutely tremendous loss not only for the St. Bernard's Parish, but for our community generally," the mayor said. "For those of us who believe in prayer, this is the time for that." His ties to Humbodt State went back even longer. A guest lecturer, Freed wrote a book about the first atomic bomb and also taught about the New Testament, connecting with Christians and non-Christians alike. "He was very well respected, very well liked and had a tremendous working knowledge as well as academic knowledge," Cunha said. "... To think that he passed in this way: It's just layers of grief and shock."

chatgpt: The mysterious death of Reverend Eric Freed, a beloved spiritual leader at a church in Eureka, California, has prompted a criminal investigation. Police are treating the case as a homicide after Freed was found dead in the rectory of his church. Authorities have launched a full-scale murder probe, but they have yet to identify any suspects in the case. Investigators are currently seeking leads on Freed's car, which was reportedly missing from the scene of the crime. Police Chief Andrew Mills stated that the department is working tirelessly to uncover any clues that could lead them to the perpetrator. Mills also stressed that the police have not identified any evidence that would suggest that the killing was a hate crime or that there was any religious or political motivation behind it. Meanwhile, the community is grappling with the loss of a beloved figure. Reverend Freed, a professor of religion at a nearby university, was known for his warmth and kindness. The church where he served as the pastor is holding a memorial service for him, and friends, family, and colleagues are expressing their shock and sadness at his untimely passing. Janet Pulsifer, a friend of Freed's, spoke to local media about the impact he had on her life. "He was such a special person," she said. "I can't even describe it. He had a way of connecting with everybody, making them feel welcomed, loved, and important." Freed's former students are also mourning his loss. One of his former pupils, who wished to remain anonymous, described him as a "patient and compassionate" teacher who helped her overcome personal struggles. "I wouldn't be where I am today without his guidance," she said. As the investigation continues, authorities are urging anyone with information about the crime to come forward. They have released a description of Freed's car, a silver 2010 Nissan Altima with California license plate number 6RGB061, and are asking for the public's help in locating it. In the meantime, the community is left reeling from the loss of a cherished member. The investigation into Reverend Eric Freed's death is ongoing, and authorities are leaving no stone unturned in their search for justice.
