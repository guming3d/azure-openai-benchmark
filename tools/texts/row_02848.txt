Dangerously close: A live mortar shell that struck a car in Benghazi, Libya, became wedged in the bodywork instead of exploding . But instead of exploding, the live mortar shell punched a hole in the bodywork and stopped when it hit the rubber tire. He said: 'I ran off when I saw it and shouted to everyone to keep away, but after half a day when it was still there and hadn't exploded, I went back and took a snap.' But the un-exploded mortar is reportedly still wedged in car because for the moment it's too dangerous to remove, according to Mr Kassis who posted these images online. This weekend, deadly fighting between Islamist militias and forces backed by Libya's internationally recognised government forced the closure of an airport in eastern Tripoli, military sources said. Close call: Fawwaz Qasim Kassis risked his life to take the snap of the grenade, which struck the car on hatch to the petrol tank . At least four people were killed and ten wounded in clashes between the Islamist Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) and fighters loyal to the government around the Mitiga air base, the sources said. An airport official said that Mitiga was closed to air traffic due to the violence. Libyan carriers moved civilian flights to Mitiga after Tripoli's main international airport was damaged by fierce fighting between state-backed fighters and Islamist militias in July.

chatgpt: A Libyan man had a lucky escape when he found a live mortar shell in his car after shelling hit his hometown of Benghazi. The incident happened on Wednesday morning when the man, who has not been identified, was checking his car after hearing the shelling. Despite the risks involved, the man decided to take a picture of the deadly device. He reportedly opened the car door, fiddled with the shell, and managed to take a snap before closing the door again. The mortar didn't explode, but rather than calling the police or army officials, the man decided to take his own action. He used social media to report the incident and knowledge of the location of the live shell. He warned fellow citizens to be careful and vigilant, as there may be others scattered around the city. The post quickly went viral and many locals praised the man for his bravery and quick thinking. City officials have urged residents of Benghazi to be extra cautious and to report any unusual activity immediately. It is not clear if there were any casualties in the recent shelling that led to the discovery of the live mortar shell. Benghazi has witnessed numerous acts of violence and armed conflict since the 2011 overthrow of former leader Muammar Gaddafi. The city has been a battleground for various Islamist militias, and several groups have clashed for control over its streets and neighborhoods. The discovery of the live mortar shell in the man's car highlights the precarious situation of many ordinary Libyans who live in fear of being caught in the crossfire of the ongoing conflicts. The Libyan government has repeatedly promised to restore stability and security to the country, but the situation remains fragile. The incident in Benghazi serves as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by civilians, and the urgent need for a peaceful solution to the ongoing crisis.
