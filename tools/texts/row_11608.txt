article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- From today, travelers visiting the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) risk being detained at airports and sent home if they don't comply with new U.S. immigration rules. Thousands of travelers risk being detained and sent home from U.S. airports and ports. The introduction of the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) means visitors from 27 VWP countries -- including most of Western Europe, New Zealand, Japan and Australia -- must now register their details online at least three days before departure. ESTA -- which came into effect today -- replaces the written green I-94 form and allows travelers under the VWP to enter the U.S. without a visa and stay for up to 90 days. The measure is designed to tighten security and make it harder for terrorists who are citizens of the participating countries to easily obtain entry to the U.S. Critics fear the new rule will be an inconvenience for business travelers and the British Foreign Office is concerned that travelers who have not heard about the new rules may be caught out. A British Foreign Office report on travel trends for 2009 predicted that 13 percent of British travelers are more likely to visit the States now Barack Obama has been elected. "The consequences of not registering through ESTA could therefore be far reaching," says the Foreign Office. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has assured travelers that the system can handle last-minute and emergency requests. Watch CNN's Richard Quest explain the new rules. Â» . ESTA has been operating on a voluntary basis since 1 August 2008 and is compulsory from 12 January 2009. Applications can be made at any time, even if travelers have no specific travel plans. If itineraries change, information can be easily updated on the ESTA Web site. Once travelers are authorized, they can travel for up to two years or until their passport expires, whichever comes first. Passengers must submit the same information that is currently required in the I-94 immigration form. This includes biographical data, travel information as well as questions regarding communicable diseases, arrests and convictions. Registration is possible through the U.S. government ESTA Web site. In most cases, eligibility for travel will be approved immediately. Applicants who receive an "Authorization Pending" response will need to check the Web site for updates. Applicants whose ESTA applications are denied will be referred to Travel.State.Gov for information on how to apply for a visa. ESTA does not change the rules for citizens from countries that require visas. That no longer includes travelers from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Republic of Korea, and the Slovak Republic; they joined the VWP in November, 2008. Malta became a member the following month. Travelers are advised that ESTA does not guarantee entry into the United States. The final decision rests with the immigration official at the port of entry.

chatgpt: Travelers to the United States are warned that they risk being turned away at U.S. airports as entry rules come into effect. This is because of the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), which allows short-term visitors under the visa waiver program entry to the United States. Visitors must register details online at least three days before they depart. The visa waiver program allows citizens of certain countries to travel to the United States without obtaining a visa. Instead, they must apply for an ESTA online at least 72 hours prior to their departure. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in entry being denied at the airport. The new rules are aimed at improving security and ensuring that travelers have the appropriate documentation before arriving in the United States. By registering online in advance of their trip, visitors will have provided personal details such as their name, passport number, and travel itinerary. This information can be checked against various security databases before they arrive in the country. The ESTA requirement also allows for greater control over who is allowed into the United States. In the past, visa-free travel meant that many travelers could enter the country without undergoing extensive background checks. However, the ESTA requirement has enabled the U.S. government to screen travelers before they arrive, reducing the risk of individuals with a criminal or terrorist background entering the country. The new rules have already caused confusion for some travelers. Many are unaware of the new requirement and may not realize the need to register online until it is too late. This has led to some passengers being turned away at the airport, causing disruption and delays. To avoid any potential issues, travelers planning to visit the United States should ensure they are aware of the new entry requirements. They should check the ESTA website well in advance of their trip and provide all necessary details. This will ensure that their registration is processed in a timely manner and that they are able to enter the country without any issues. The ESTA requirement also serves as a reminder that travel to the United States can be subject to unexpected changes. Travelers should remain vigilant and stay informed of any new travel requirements or restrictions. This will help to avoid any last-minute surprises and ensure a smooth and hassle-free trip. Overall, the new ESTA requirement is a positive step towards improving travel security and ensuring that only legitimate travelers are allowed into the United States. While it may cause some initial confusion and disruption, travelers are advised to comply with the new rules and register online well in advance of their trip. By doing so, they can enjoy a safe and stress-free journey to the United States.
