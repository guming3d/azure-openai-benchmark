article: PUBLISHED: . 17:19 EST, 13 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:20 EST, 13 May 2013 . Oprah Winfrey may be one of the richest Americans, but after a string of recent real estate investment losses she might consider keeping her billions in the media business. The lady billionaire’s most recent hit came as her company sold retail space that once contained her Oprah Store at a loss of more than $1 million. The sale comes after the company’s closing of the store itself, which was shuttered just after Oprah signed off the daytime airwaves for good in 2011. Fizzle: Oprah Winfrey knows how to make money in media, but the billionaire has taken more than one fat loss in the real estate game . The space, which sat just across from the talk queen’s Harpo Studios in Chicago, cost the company $1.98 million, but it ultimately sold for only $875,000, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Oprah Store sold Oprah logo-emblazoned designer wear from ‘Oprah’s Closet’ and gave proceeds to charity. The law firm that orchestrated the sale said the space is set to become a meditation center. This is not the first time an Oprah-backed real estate investment brought a big loss. Last summer, Ms. Winfrey sold an eight-bedroom co-op unit in Chicago’s Streeterville neighbourhood for $2.75 million, a unit for which she paid a whopping $5.6 million in 2006. Loss: around $3 million. Ouch: The Oprah Store in Chicago closed after Winfrey's talk show ended in 2011. The space was recently sold at a $1 million loss to her company . Ooohm: The store sat just across from Oprah's Harpo Studios in Chicago. It will now become a meditation center . Oprah, by the way, never even moved into the place. These are two sharp blows to the media savvy businesswoman, ones that followed the mightiest of blows: when her much anticipated OWN Network hit airwaves to disappointing numbers. But since the network’s dark first days, things have begun to look up and Oprah may yet redeem her juggernaut status among TV types. Repeat: The Oprah Store, pictured, was just one of her real estate flops. She sold a Chicago condo in July at a $3 million loss . The Oprah Winfrey Network—its full name—has been gaining steam since landing an exclusive first interview with shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong. And Forbes reports that Discovery Channel, which partnered with Oprah on the OWN venture, has confidently reported that the cable network could be in the black by the end of 2013. Oprah is currently the only African American billionaire, with a reported worth of $2.8 billion. Hope: Things may be on the up for Winfrey, though. The OWN network, which tanked initially, is showing marked improvement and her partners at Discovery Channel say it could be in the black by the end of 2013 .
highlights: The Queen of Daytime took an even bigger loss last summer when she sold a Chicago co-op she never even moved into for $3M less than she paid in 2006 . Her billions also took a hit after her OWN Network debuted with meager ratings, but things look like they may be looking up for the media maven .

chatgpt: Media mogul Oprah Winfrey is no stranger to business setbacks, but it seems things may be turning around for the daytime queen. Last summer, Winfrey reportedly took a sizable hit when she sold a Chicago co-op for $3 million less than she paid for it in 2006. Additionally, her OWN Network debuted to meager ratings and struggled to find its footing. However, recent developments suggest that Winfrey may be making a comeback. Despite the challenges, Winfrey has continued to innovate and diversify her media empire. In 2019, she launched a multi-platform wellness venture called O, The Oprah Magazine. The highly successful brand spans digital, print, and social media channels and features content on everything from health and fitness to relationships and spirituality. The O, The Oprah Magazine brand has proven to be a significant source of revenue for Winfrey, and it has helped her to weather some of the challenges of the past few years. Additionally, she has continued to leverage her media savvy to venture into new areas of business, including a partnership with Weight Watchers and an investment in the healthy fast food chain True Food Kitchen. Winfrey's perseverance seems to be paying off, as there are signs that her financial fortunes may be turning around. According to recent reports, shares of Weight Watchers International (now called WW International) have grown by more than 50% since she announced her partnership in 2015. The investment has reportedly added several hundred million dollars to Winfrey's net worth and has helped to offset some of the losses from her Chicago co-op and OWN Network. Furthermore, her television production company, Harpo Productions, recently signed a multi-year content deal with Apple. The partnership will see Winfrey producing documentaries and other programming exclusively for the tech giant's streaming service, Apple TV+. The deal is rumored to be worth more than $1 billion, which could be a significant boost to Winfrey's wealth. Overall, it seems as though the tide may be turning in Winfrey's favor. While she has certainly seen her fair share of setbacks, she is a testament to the power of perseverance and innovation. By leveraging her media savvy and branching out into new business areas, Winfrey has managed to weather the storm and position herself for future success. With the O, The Oprah Magazine brand becoming an increasingly significant source of revenue and the new content deal with Apple, it seems as though Winfrey's billions could be making a comeback.
