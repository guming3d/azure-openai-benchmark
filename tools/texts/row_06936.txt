article: San Francisco, California (CNET)  -- On Wednesday, Sony unveiled Move, its motion-sensitive controller. A small device that looks like a microphone -- but with something on top of it that looks like a ping pong ball with an LED inside -- Move is Sony's bid to gain control over the motion controller wars that are currently led by Nintendo, with its Wii controller, and which many think will be dominated by Microsoft and its Project Natal controller system. To Sony, releasing the Move is an obvious move for the PlayStation, given it believes it started the motion controller era with its Eye Toy. Sony held its press conference during the Game Developers Conference here. Now, the Move, which will be available this fall in a starter kit that begins at under $100 for a Move, a PlayStation eye camera and a game, is its attempt to jump ahead of Microsoft's Natal and to begin winning over Wii users. "We like to think that the migration path between Wii households and PlayStation households is a natural path," said Peter Dille, Sony's senior vice president for marketing and PlayStation. Shuehei Yoshida, Sony's president for worldwide studios, said Move will "demonstrate that the motion controller for PS3 will be the solution for both casual and hard-core gamers alike" and that the types of games Sony can create with it are "amazingly diverse." Among the types of games Move will work with include those that involve swords, bows and arrows, guns, punching and much more. The idea is that Move will provide players with a realistic and precise feeling of holding whatever kind of thing the game calls for, be it a sword or a gun. Sony first talked about its new motion controller at E3 last year but didn't have a name or any kind of timing. Now, by unveiling the device's name it can begin what Dille said will be the company's biggest video game marketing effort of the year. While Sony is expecting consumers to use Move with a range of brand-new games, the company also clearly thinks that it will enhance game play in existing titles. As such, it showed off how Move can be used to move characters around in its hit title, Little Big Planet. Further, the controller comes with its own accessory, known as a sub-controller, which will accentuate what's possible with Move. And later this year, the forthcoming game SOCOM 4 will incorporate both Move and the sub-controller. Â© 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

chatgpt: Sony has launched its latest gaming device, the Move, a small gadget that resembles a microphone. The Move is designed to work with the PlayStation Eye Camera and a game, which are included in a starter kit which costs less than $100. According to Kenichiro Yoshida, the President of Sony, the Move is a major step forward for the company. He praised the device, calling the games that can be played with it "amazingly diverse". The Move is a motion-controller that can be used to play games on the PlayStation 4 console. The device uses sensors that track the movements of the player's hand in real time, allowing them to control the game in a way that makes it feel as if they are really part of it. The starter kit for the Move comes with the motion-controller, the PlayStation Eye Camera, and a game. The camera is used to detect the position of the motion-controller so that it can accurately track the player's movements. Once the camera detects the motion-controller, the player can use it to control the game. For example, in a sports game, the player can use the Move to simulate throwing a ball, while in a racing game, the player can use it to simulate steering a car. The Move is also capable of using voice recognition, so players can control the game with their voice as well as their hand movements. This feature allows players to say commands like "start game" or "pause" without having to use the controller. The Move is designed to appeal to a wide range of audiences, from children to adults. It has been praised for its ease of use, and the fact that it allows players to get more involved in the game than ever before. Overall, the Move is an exciting new addition to the world of gaming, offering players a unique and immersive experience. With its accurate tracking and diverse range of games, it is sure to be a hit with gamers of all ages.
