article: First it targeted our vacuum cleaners in the name of global warming – now the EU is gunning for petrol-driven lawnmowers. They are among a range of outdoor equipment facing stringent emissions tests, including chainsaws, combine harvesters and river barges. The European Commission has already forced vacuum cleaner manufacturers to stop producing the most powerful machines. Scroll down for video . Just weeks after the high-power hoover ban, lawnmowers are among a range of outdoor equipment facing stringent emissions tests, including chainsaws, combine harvesters and river barges . The latest regulation is designed to reduce air pollution by cutting emissions from combustion engines in ‘non-road mobile machinery’, Brussels commissioner for industry Nelli Feroci said yesterday. As well as small gardening and handheld equipment, bigger off-road equipment including excavators, bulldozers and crop harvesters, as well as railcars, locomotives and inland waterway vessels such as river barges are also in the Brussels executive’s sights. ‘These people are fanatics,’ said Paul Nuttall, Ukip Euro MP for the north-west of England. ‘They are so blind to their own failings that they do not even realise the contempt which their hyperactivity breeds in the voting public. They just need to stop, take a deep breath and take a look at themselves.’ Industry was quick to point out that the law will backfire because manufacturers will simply withdraw from unprofitable market sectors rather than produce a new range of EU-compliant engines. ‘This is a major problem for us,’ said Theresia Hacksteiner, secretary general of the European Barge Union. ‘The engine manufacturers themselves have already warned the Commission that they will not follow the new standards.’ She added that the law will lead to unintended consequences, in particular the inability of barge owners to find replacement engines. Consumers snapped up high-powered hoovers in the lead-up to the diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts. Above, the European Commission's headquarter . While big manufacturers – of cars, for example – are obliged to follow new European standards set in Brussels, smaller manufacturers of niche products are just as likely to abandon Europe for more profitable markets as produce a new product range. The new legislation comes despite a pledge by Jean-Claude Juncker, president-designate of the European Commission, to cut back on red tape by focusing the Brussels bureaucracy’s work on matters that are essential for the smooth running of European business. Last month there was a stampede of panic-buying when a Brussels diktat outlawed powerful vacuum cleaners over 1600 watts. A list of 30 high-wattage household devices could also be banned next spring following a draft EU report which examined ways to reduce power consumption. These are thought to include powerful hairdryers and kettles.

chatgpt: The European Union has set its sights on reducing emissions from "non-road mobile machinery," including mowers, combine harvesters, and river barges. This move comes on the heels of the recent ban on high-powered vacuum cleaners, which saw a rush of shoppers stocking up on the soon-to-be-outlawed models. The European Commission has outlined plans to regulate the emissions of these machines, aiming to decrease their environmental impact. According to the Commission, non-road mobile machinery currently accounts for approximately 15% of all transportation-related emissions in the EU. Mowers, for instance, often run on diesel engines, which emit high levels of pollutants. River barges, similarly, produce considerable emissions as they transport cargo up and down European waterways. By regulating the emissions of these and other non-road mobile machinery, the EU hopes to make a significant dent in overall transportation-related emissions. The measure is expected to be met with some resistance, particularly from industries that rely heavily on these machines. Farmers, for instance, depend on combine harvesters to efficiently harvest their crops. They may fear that implementing emissions regulations will result in higher costs and decreased performance. Similarly, river transport companies may be hesitant to comply with new emissions regulations, as their operations already face significant competition from other modes of transportation. Any added costs could make it harder for these companies to stay competitive. Despite concerns from some stakeholders, however, the EU is intent on decreasing emissions from non-road mobile machinery. This move follows larger efforts by the EU to take bold action on climate change, including setting a goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. Environmental groups are praising the new efforts to regulate emissions from non-road mobile machinery. They see this as a crucial step in reducing overall pollution and improving air quality in Europe. However, some activists argue that the EU must move even faster and be more aggressive in tackling climate change. Overall, the EU's efforts to regulate emissions from non-road mobile machinery are part of a larger push to combat climate change and reduce pollution. It remains to be seen what impact these regulations will have on industry and commerce. However, it's clear that the EU is serious about taking dramatic action to protect the environment and combat the effects of climate change.
