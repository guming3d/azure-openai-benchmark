article: (CNN) -- West African nations are turning to drastic measures in a desperate effort to stem the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. Guinea has closed its border with Sierra Leone, a border police official told CNN. Meanwhile, the Zambian government banned arrivals of people from countries where there has been an Ebola outbreak, as a preventive measure to stop the virus from entering the country. "All delegates from any of the countries affected by Ebola Virus disease are restricted from entering Zambia until further notice," Dr. Joseph Kasonde, Zambia's minister of health, said in a statement Saturday. The virulent virus continues to advance from its epicenter in Sierra Leone to nearby Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria. Other West African governments are attempting to contain the outbreak, which has been declared a "public health emergency of international concern" by the World Health Organization. Nearly 1,800 cases, including 961 deaths, are attributed to the virus, the World Health Organization says. Nigeria and Liberia have declared states of national emergency, in an effort to control the unprecedented epidemic. The United States and the United Kingdom vowed Saturday to increase assistance to help combat the disease in West Africa. Two missionaries who had traveled to Africa are being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Canada, meanwhile, announced Sunday that a patient who recently traveled to Nigeria has tested negative for Ebola. The patient was treated in isolation after complaining of fever, headache and malaise. He is now doing well, said Eric Hoskins, minister of health and long-term care. "Ontarians should know that we are fully prepared should any cases appear in the province," Hoskins said in a statement. "This situation was the result of all our protocols working effectively."

chatgpt: Canada has announced that a patient who recently traveled to Nigeria has tested negative for the Ebola virus. The patient had exhibited symptoms associated with the virus, prompting medical professionals to take necessary precautions to prevent any possible outbreak. The individual was quickly isolated and subjected to testing, which subsequently returned negative. The news comes as Zambia has imposed a travel ban on individuals from countries currently battling with the Ebola virus. Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria are among the countries affected by the outbreak. The move by Zambia is part of efforts to prevent the spread of the deadly disease from one country to another. The Ebola virus has become an increasingly worrying global health concern. With no known cure, the virus has claimed many lives across several countries. Over 22,000 people have been infected since the outbreak began, with over 9,000 deaths reported. The situation has led to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a global health emergency. The battle against the Ebola virus has been intense in West Africa, with Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone being the hardest hit. These countries have recorded thousands of deaths so far. Despite efforts by the global community to contain the virus, new cases continue to surface. Nigeria has also experienced outbreaks, with the most recent being in 2018. The country has, however, successfully managed to contain the spread of the virus through the implementation of precautionary measures and effective treatments. The Canadian government has reiterated the need for individuals to take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the virus. They have urged individuals to report any symptoms associated with the virus and to seek medical attention immediately to prevent the risk of outbreak. Meanwhile, Zambia's travel ban on individuals from countries battling Ebola is a step towards preventing the disease from spreading further. The move has been praised globally as a necessary precautionary measure to protect public health. The Ebola virus continues to be a global health concern, and efforts are being made by the global community to find a cure. Until then, preventive measures remain the best way to prevent an outbreak. Canadians are advised to stay informed on the situation, take precautions, and seek medical attention if necessary.
