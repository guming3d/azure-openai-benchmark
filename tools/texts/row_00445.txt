article: By . Emma Glanfield . Eric Craggs, 68, of Stockton, County Durham, pictured arriving at court, is accused of asking for the 'Laserstar' device to be fitted to his car in 2009 . A driver attempted to evade the law by having a piece of equipment knowingly fitted to his Aston Martin which stops police speed guns from taking an accurate reading, a court heard. Eric Craggs, 68, is accused of asking for the device, known as a ‘laser jammer', to be fitted to the front of his car during a service in 2009. It is alleged that Craggs, of Stockton, County Durham, has been driving the car with the device activated for the last four years and has managed to evade police detection on two occasions. The device interferes with the lasers used in police speed camera devices and stops officers from being able to take a reading - instead issuing an error message. Prosecutor Andrew Walker told the jury at Teesside Crown Court today how Craggs was caught by PC Lorraine Williams after she failed to get a reading from his Aston Martin during a routine speed check in August last year. He said: ‘She aimed the camera at the front of the Aston Martin car with a view to record the speed. ‘However the device could not record a speed and displayed an error code. She tried again but again an error code showed.’ He told the court how PC Williams then noticed an object under the front number plate of the car which was part of the ‘Laserstar’ device. Mr Walker said PC Williams also remembered a similar instance with the same car in April 2011. The prosecutor told the court how Craggs asked for the 'Laserstar' device to be fitted to his car while getting it serviced at Stratstone garage in Houghton-le-Spring in 2009. He said Stratstone contracted the work to be done at Turners Alarm and Audio in Sunderland and an invoice for around £450 was sent to Craggs. Mr Walker . said: ‘Its purpose is to alert the driver of the vehicle that is being . targeted by a police laser speed meter allowing the driver to slow down . the vehicle. ‘At the same time police are prevented from acquiring the true speed of the vehicle. The pensioner, who appeared in court wearing a pinstripe suit and white shirt, denies a charge of perverting the course of justice between July 15, 2009 and August 12, 2013 . ‘The laser effectively interferes with the laser sent by the police device for typically between four and eight seconds.’ Mr Walker said Craggs denies asking anyone to fit the device and says he had no knowledge of it being there. The pensioner, who appeared in court wearing a pinstripe suit and white shirt, denies a charge of perverting the course of justice between July 15, 2009 and August 12, 2013. The trial continues.

chatgpt: Eric Craggs, a 68-year-old man, has been accused of requesting a device called the "Laserstar" to be installed into his car. This device is said to interfere with lasers in speed guns, making it impossible for the guns to provide a reading of the speed of the vehicle. According to the prosecution, Craggs has been driving around with this device since 2009. Last year, a police officer noticed the device installed at the front of Craggs' Aston Martin, and the authorities launched an investigation. The prosecution alleges that Craggs has been using this device for over a decade, and he now faces charges of perverting the course of justice and using a device to interfere with police equipment. Craggs denies the charges against him, claiming that he never asked for the device to be installed and that he had no idea what it was. His defense is that he purchased the car second-hand and that the Laserstar device may have been installed before he bought the vehicle. The trial, which started on Monday, has brought up questions regarding the use of such devices and their legality. Prosecutor Charlotte Baines argued that Craggs knowingly used the device to avoid speeding fines and that this amounted to perverting the course of justice. She told the court that Craggs' actions were a "deliberate attempt" to avoid the law and that he was "well aware" of the consequences of his actions. Baines further argued that the Laserstar device was illegal as its sole purpose was to interfere with police equipment. She explained that the device was not a legal means to avoid being caught speeding, and anyone caught using it could face criminal charges. The defense, however, maintains that Craggs had no intention of breaking the law and that the device's installation was beyond his control. The defense lawyer, Edward Henry, argued that Craggs was a "law-abiding citizen" and that he had no previous criminal record. Henry told the court that Craggs had been driving the car for over a decade and had no idea that the device had been installed. The trial is ongoing, and it remains to be seen whether Craggs will be found guilty of the charges against him. The case has highlighted the use of such devices and their legality, with the prosecution arguing that they are illegal and the defense maintaining that their clients had no intention of breaking the law. The use of speed cameras and speed guns has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that they are used as a means of generating revenue rather than promoting road safety. Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, however, it is clear that using a device such as the Laserstar to interfere with police equipment is illegal and can result in severe consequences for those caught using it.
