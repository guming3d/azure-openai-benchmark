article: By . Paul Revoir . Fed-up viewers have told the BBC to stop moving events from channel to channel, saying it is wearing them out trying to keep up. Some sports such as the cycling road races and gymnastics have been switched from BBC1 to other channels, such as BBC3, or viewers have been redirected to one of the corporation’s 24 dedicated Olympics channels. Critics claim that once the broadcaster starts showing a sport on a channel, it should stick with it. Switch-over: Gymnastics has been one of several events where viewers have been asked to change channel to continue watching mid-way through the excitement . Others admitted they had not realised the sport they had been watching had been switched and they ended up missing large chunks of it. The BBC is operating 24 dedicated channels showing all the action from every event on satellite and cable. But many viewers access the coverage through the two main channels – BBC1 and BBC3 – which have been changing events in the middle of the coverage. One viewer wrote on the BBC’s message-board: ‘I’m trying to watch the bike race here! It started on BBC 1, moved to BBC 3 and now is moved to the Red Button! ‘Stop doing that! I feel like I’m participating in the Olympics, chasing after the TV channel.’ Another said: ‘This is becoming a nasty habit with the BBC and I absolutely hate it! It’s like watching a TV with your kid in charge of the remote.’ Others took to Twitter to complain. One sports fan tweeted: ‘Ughhh, was streaming the gymnastics on BBC1 and it switched to BBC3 and the stream I have for that doesn’t work.’ Another added: ‘Didn’t realise gymnastics switched to BBC3, been watching horse riding for about 20 minutes.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Every event is live and uninterrupted on the BBC’s 24 Olympic channels, which have proved enormously popular and are being watched by millions. ‘On BBC1 and BBC3, we go to the best of the action, which occasionally means we will switch events between channels. ‘But this is the first time people can use the red button to find full live coverage of anything they choose and that can also be recorded.’

chatgpt: The ongoing Olympics fever has taken over the world, with spectators glued to their screens, eagerly waiting to watch their favorite athletes win medals. However, the broadcasting of the games on various channels has left some viewers disgruntled. Criticism is mounting against the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for changing channels during the Olympics and other sporting events. According to some critics, once the broadcaster starts showing an event, it should remain on the same channel until it ends. Complaints arose after the BBC changed channels during one of the Olympic events, disrupting the viewing experience of spectators. This was despite the outlet operating 24 dedicated channels that show all the action from every sporting event. The changing channels have led to frustration among viewers, with some claiming that they miss parts of the event as they scramble to find the new channel. However, the BBC has defended its decision, stating that it offers various channels that cater to different sports and events, thereby enabling viewers to choose what to watch. It is essential to cater to different preferences as some sports are more popular than others, and it would be a disadvantage to show only one sport on a single channel. Thus, the changing of channels also allows for flexibility in broadcasting, which can better cater to viewers' interests. Furthermore, the BBC has highlighted that it offers a unique feature whereby viewers can watch an event in full on its streaming service, BBC iPlayer. This means they can watch a particular event regardless of which channel it is being broadcasted on. Hence the shifting of channels should not affect the whole viewing experience. Despite the justification from the BBC, the criticism has remained, with some viewers expressing their disappointment on social media platforms. Some have even threatened to boycott the broadcaster, indicating that they prefer rival networks that do not switch channels during an event. The present situation raises the question of how far a broadcaster should go to cater to viewers' interests, especially when there is no clear consensus on what would appeal to everyone. While switching channels may be frustrating for some viewers, it may be beneficial for others, who can find and watch their preferred sport without having to sit through segments that do not interest them. In summary, the BBC has come under criticism for changing channels during the Olympics, despite offering viewers a range of channels dedicated to different sporting events. While critics insist on sticking to the same channel till the end, the broadcaster maintains that the provision of different channels cater to diversity, while its streaming service enables viewers to stream events in their entirety regardless of which channel it is being broadcasted on. It remains to be seen how the broadcaster will respond to the criticism, and whether it will change its approach going forward.
