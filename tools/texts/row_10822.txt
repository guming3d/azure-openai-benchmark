article: (CNN) -- Nothing gets people in the Halloween spirit like group costumes. Teamwork was the finishing touch of many iReporters' outfits -- whether it was a team of green Army men or crayons. Many iReporters devoted a lot of time and effort into perfecting their costumes, such as Jason Chuon and his partner Jeremy Kidd, who went to creative lengths to create their nun-chuck couples costume: "We did some searching online and came across a website that sold chain links in every size and color one could imagine." They chose a hollow chain, cut it, tied each end of the chain to thin, plastic hair bands and finished it off with metallic-looking headbands. They chose to do a couples costume after Kidd proposed to Chuon on a business trip in Hong Kong a few weeks before Halloween last year. CNN iReport received an array of costume submissions -- iReporters slipped on masks and assumed the roles of superheroes, dressed in their best (or worst) as celebrities, and put the pop in pop culture icons with their creative and eye-catching outfits. The costume themes varied as widely as the amount of time invested in creating them -- one iReporter says she spent up to a month creating most of the 17 costumes for a "Wizard of Oz" group, while others chose simpler themes and created their costumes in one night, such as a Care Bears college student group displayed in the gallery above. However different the costumes were, two themes emerged among all of the iReports: the fun of the creation process as a group and the reactions at the end result. Kera Dacy and her movie accountant co-workers dressed up as the Village People and purportedly elicited quite a reaction from a celebrity on the set: "At the end of the week we pay our employees and actors their per diem. Jessica Alba was on this list, among others. You can imagine her response to a biker with fake chest hair and an Indian handling her money." We featured some of the best submissions in the above gallery, but be sure to check out all of the great group Halloween costume submissions here.

chatgpt: With Halloween just around the corner, iReporters have been getting creative with their costumes. Many have devoted a lot of time and effort into perfecting their looks, with some opting for group costumes to make a bigger impact. One trend that has emerged this year is the use of teamwork to create standout costumes. Whether it's a group of friends, co-workers, or family members, these teams have pooled their talents and resources to make their costumes come to life. One iReporter group, in particular, stood out with their impressive costumes. The group chose to dress up as characters from the hit movie, The Avengers. Each member of the group took on the persona of their chosen character, with Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow all making an appearance. Their costumes were spot on, with Iron Man's signature red and gold suit perfectly recreated and Captain America's shield crafted to perfection. The group's dedication to their costumes was evident in every detail, from the intricately designed masks to the hand-crafted props. But this wasn't the only group to impress with their costumes. Other iReporters have also shared their group costume submissions, with a variety of themes and characters. From the classic Addams Family to the popular game Among Us, each submission showcased the creativity and dedication of these teams. It's clear that teamwork can take Halloween costumes to the next level. By working together, groups are able to create more intricate designs, share resources, and bounce ideas off each other to really make their costumes stand out. As Halloween approaches, it's exciting to see what other group costumes will be shared on iReport. Will we see more superhero teams or perhaps some spooky monster mash-ups? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure, these iReporters are sure to impress with their teamwork and commitment to crafting the perfect costume.
