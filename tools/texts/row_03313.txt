article: (CNN) -- Thanks to the age-old art of bartering, a California teenager became the envy of all his friends when he pulled into school in a Porsche convertible. Steven Ortiz, 17, dreamed of one day owning a luxury sports car -- a dream that became reality after he posted a used cell phone on Craigslist. "My friend gave me a free phone and said, 'Do what you want with it,'" Ortiz told CNN's "American Morning" Thursday. "So I put it on Craigslist on the barter section." After some serious patience, research and a lot of talking, his cell phone trade landed him an iPod touch, which he managed to barter up for a dirt bike and then to a Macbook Pro laptop computer. Before long, he was the proud owner of an 1987 Toyota 4Runner. Eventually, he landed a classic Ford Bronco SUV -- the golden ticket that would soon get him into the driver seat of a luxury sports car. "I just went for it," he said. "I knew the Bronco was worth more at the end." So what's his secret? "It's trying to catch people who want what you have," Ortiz said. "The man that needed the laptop had an extra car," so both parties got what they wanted, he added. He advises anyone looking to get into the barter game to be cautious before committing to a trade. "Always inspect everything," Ortiz said. Although he accomplished his goal of owning a Porsche, Ortiz says it's time to move on and he plans on going back to what he does best -- bartering for something else. "I don't have a job right now and I really don't like asking my parents if I can get an oil change, so I want to trade [the Porsche] for a mid-sized truck," Ortiz said. "We'll see what comes along."

chatgpt: A man named Steve Ortiz has recently made headlines after he managed to barter up a used cell phone that he had posted on Craigslist in the barter section. Ortiz is now the proud owner of a Porsche, after managing to trade up from the initial cell phone. According to Ortiz, anyone can do what he did, but he warns that it takes a great deal of patience and research to find exactly what other people are looking for. "It's trying to catch people who want what you have," Ortiz explained during a recent interview with CNN's "American Morning". The bartering process that Ortiz went through is certainly impressive. After posting the cell phone on Craigslist, he managed to trade up to an iPod touch, then to a computer, then to a dirt bike, and finally to an SUV. It was only once he had the SUV that he managed to make the trade for a Porsche. Ortiz's story is a reminder of just how much you can accomplish through bartering online. For people who are looking for a new car or other expensive item, bartering can often be a more feasible option than trying to save up enough money to buy the item outright. It also allows you to get creative with what you're willing to trade, turning what might be seen as "junk" into something valuable. However, it's worth noting that bartering online does come with its own set of risks. It's important to thoroughly research the people you are trading with to ensure that you are not getting scammed. It's also important to clearly define the terms of the trade and to make sure that both parties are satisfied. Overall, Steve Ortiz's story is an inspiring example of what can be accomplished through online bartering. While not everyone will be able to turn a used cell phone into a Porsche, his story is a testament to the power of persistence and creativity.
