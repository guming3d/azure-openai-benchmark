article: (CNN) -- Police in Allendale, South Carolina, are investigating whether a funeral home fit a 6-foot, 5-inch man into his coffin by severing his legs. The wife of James Hines reportedly said the funeral home told her that her husband's coffin was long enough. A former Cave Funeral Services employee has alleged since James Hines' death from skin cancer in 2004 that Hines was too tall for his coffin and that the funeral home took extreme measures to make him fit, Allendale County Coroner Hayzen Black told CNN. Officials exhumed Hines' body Tuesday, Black said, and a fair amount of "undesirable evidence" was found, although he could not comment further. The coroner's office handed the case over to law enforcement officials for a criminal investigation, he said. Allendale Police Detective Donnie Hutto told CNN affiliate WJBF-TV that he could not comment on the condition of the body. A Cave Funeral Services employee had no comment when asked about the matter. But Ruth Hines, widow of the dead man, told WJBF that the allegations and exhumation of Hines' body are difficult for her. "I'm just going through quite a bit," she said. "It's like starting all over again, and it's left me with hurt and numbness." "According to the measurements on the casket, and the funeral director, we asked him, 'Was this suitable for his length?' and he said, 'Yes that will be perfect,'" Ruth Hines said. Hines told WJBF that her family has used Cave Funeral Services for a number of years, and she isn't sure what the family will do in the future if the allegations are true.

chatgpt: The recent exhumation of James Hines' body by county coroners has revealed some shocking evidence. Hines, who passed away in 2004, was reportedly too tall for his coffin. The family of the deceased had commissioned Cave Funeral Services to handle the arrangements. However, a former employee of the funeral home has come forward, stating that they had to take extreme measures to make Hines fit into the coffin. According to the employee, Hines was a towering individual, standing at 6'5''. Despite the obvious size difference, the funeral home assured the family that they could handle the situation. The employee who spoke to authorities said that they had never encountered such a situation before and had to use a variety of tools to fit the body into the coffin. The former employee's statement ultimately led to the exhumation of Hines' body on Tuesday. The county coroner reported "undesirable evidence" was found upon examination of the body. It is not clear at this time what exactly was found during the examination, but authorities are investigating.  Cave Funeral Services, who were responsible for the handling of the funeral arrangements, have declined to comment on the situation. It is yet to be seen whether or not the funeral home will face any legal repercussions due to their actions.  This incident shines a light on the importance of proper handling of deceased individuals. Families trust funeral homes to handle their loved ones with the utmost care and reverence. It is important that funeral homes uphold these standards and not take shortcuts that could potentially cause distress to grieving loved ones.  The investigation into the matter is ongoing, and more information will be made available as it becomes known.
