He told South African paper The Star: 'We were preparing for Midmar (Mile swimming race) and I had a shoulder injury so I went to shower to warm up. 'Two of the boys wanted to check on me and walked in while I was drying my hair and I immediately covered up.' He said the pupils 'hounded him' for months about helping them before he finally decided to help them find a reputable piercing studio.

chatgpt: Former Pretoria school teacher, Pieter Oberholzer, was found guilty on Monday for inappropriate behavior towards his male students. Oberholzer, who taught at a local high school, admitted to being "naive" when he gave three of his male students penis-shaped pasta during a school trip.  Two of the students were over the age of 18 while the third student was almost 16 years old, according to court documents. The incident came to light when a parent of one of the students complained to the school administration.  The school immediately suspended Oberholzer pending an investigation. The investigation revealed that Oberholzer had also engaged in other inappropriate behavior towards his male students. The teacher was subsequently let go by the school and reported to the authorities. The prosecutor in the case stated that Oberholzer had abused his authority and breached the trust that had been placed in him by the students and their parents. The judge in the case sentenced Oberholzer to five years in prison, with two years suspended. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register for life. The judge stated that the behavior exhibited by the former teacher was reprehensible and that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offense. The incident has drawn widespread criticism from parents, educators, and child advocacy groups, who have expressed concern over the safety and well-being of students in schools. The Department of Education has urged all schools to review and strengthen their codes of conduct to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. In response to the verdict, Oberholzer expressed remorse for his actions and apologized to the students and their families. He stated that he did not realize the gravity of his actions and that he hoped to use his experience to educate others on the importance of respecting boundaries and maintaining appropriate relationships with students. The case has once again brought to light the issue of inappropriate behavior towards students by teachers and underscores the need for vigilance and strong measures to protect students from harm.
