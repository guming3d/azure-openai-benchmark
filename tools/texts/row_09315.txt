chatgpt: The 86th Academy Awards ceremony was held on March 2, 2014, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California. The ceremony, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, celebrated the best films and performances of the year. The night was full of surprises and triumphs, as well as some well-deserved recognition for some of Hollywood's biggest names. One of the most talked-about films of the night was "12 Years a Slave," directed by Steve McQueen. The film, based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man who was abducted and sold into slavery, took home the top prize of the night â€“ the Best Picture Oscar. The film also garnered a number of other awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Lupita Nyong'o. Another standout film was "Gravity," directed by Alfonso Cuaron. While it was not able to secure the Best Picture Oscar, the film dominated in the technical categories, winning seven awards, including Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects. The film, which starred Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, told the story of two astronauts stranded in space after their spacecraft is destroyed. In addition to these two films, there were a number of other noteworthy winners. Jared Leto won Best Supporting Actor for his performance in "Dallas Buyers Club," in which he played a transgender woman. The film, which also starred Matthew McConaughey, won Best Makeup and Hairstyling as well. McConaughey was recognized with the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Ron Woodroof, a man diagnosed with HIV in the 1980s. Cate Blanchett won her second Oscar for her leading role in "Blue Jasmine," a film directed by Woody Allen. The film, which also starred Alec Baldwin and Sally Hawkins, explored the life of a wealthy New York socialite who falls from grace. The awards show was not without its controversies, however. Many were disappointed that the critically praised "Inside Llewyn Davis," directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, was not nominated for Best Picture. Additionally, some criticized the lack of diversity among the nominees, with no people of color nominated in any of the four acting categories. Despite these criticisms, the 2014 Oscars proved to be a memorable night for Hollywood, with well-deserved recognition given to some of the year's most noteworthy films and performances. As the lights dimmed on the Dolby Theatre, audiences around the world were left with the words of Lupita Nyong'o, who, in her acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress, said, "When I look down at this golden statue, may it remind me and every little child that no matter where you're from, your dreams are valid."
