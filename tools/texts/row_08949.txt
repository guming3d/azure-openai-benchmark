Christopher McKee told FoxCT on Wednesday. 'I know a lot of folks were very upset about it when they heard what the offense was that had occurred.' Senior citizen Terri Rousseau told the television affiliate station 'I would think [the community center] would be safe.' Following the robbery, police looked for the suspect in the community center and also used a K9 team, The Hartford Courant reported. The teen's name has not been released because of his age.
