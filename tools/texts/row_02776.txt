article: How do you solve a problem like email? Google's Gmail team thinks it knows how: with a new app called Inbox. Inbox, which launched Wednesday, offers a different way of handling the daily avalanche of email. Specifically created with mobile users in mind, it sorts and turns emails into reminders, highlights the important bits and adds outside information it thinks is helpful. Even as people are turning to other tools to quickly communicate from their phones -- messaging apps, social networks, text -- email remains an invaluable if sometimes infuriating way of communicating from mobile devices.  You can filter out spam, something Gmail excels at, but there's still a huge volume of legitimate email to deal with. A lot of companies have taken a stab at improving the email experience. Gmail recently started categorizing emails automatically and putting them in different tabs in your inbox, like social, promotions and updates. The popular third-party app Mailbox used folders and gestures to make sorting through emails easy. That company was snapped up by Dropbox. Inbox seems to be heavily influenced by Mailbox's time-saving, reminder-centric approach (not to mention its name). It also borrows some neat features from Google Now. Inbox works by grouping similar messages together, like bills, in what Google calls "Bundles." You can schedule a bundle to only show up at specific intervals, say once a week. There's no need to read all the words in an email just to get to the juicy bits. Inbox will highlight what it thinks are the key parts of an email, like contact information, confirmation numbers or photos. It's also tapping Google for related information to save you a trip to the search engine. For example, if you've set a reminder to call the dog groomer, the business's contact information will show up automatically. Messages can be turned into reminders, reminders can be snoozed, and important emails "pinned" while the rest are whisked away. Inbox is currently only invite only. It is available as and iOS and Android app, as well as a desktop view (for Chrome browser users only).

chatgpt: Google has just launched its new Inbox app for Gmail users, which aims to make managing emails much more organized and streamlined. The app groups conversations and lets users snooze emails for later viewing. While Google has not yet made Inbox available to everyone, the company has allowed users to request an invite to beta test the app themselves. Once users receive an invite, they can start using the app right away. The Inbox app is a significant improvement over the traditional Gmail platform as it introduces a much more organized way of viewing emails. Conversations will now be grouped together based on similar topics, making it easier to find what users are looking for. Furthermore, the app lets users snooze emails, allowing them to temporarily remove emails from their inbox and set up a time for them to reappear. In addition to these features, the Inbox app also introduces several new tools that will greatly enhance productivity. One such feature is the ability to create reminders from emails. So if someone emails you with a reminder to pay a bill, you can easily set a task for that bill within the app. Another noteworthy feature is the app's ability to display important information right within the email itself. For example, if someone sends you an email with flight information, the app will provide you with real-time updates on the flight's status right within that email. While the Inbox app is currently invite-only, Google has said that it will be rolling out to all users soon. However, the company has not provided an exact date for the app's full public release. Users who want to use the app immediately can invite themselves by sending a request to Google's Inbox website. Overall, the Inbox app is an excellent upgrade to Gmail that will greatly improve the way users manage their emails. With its powerful grouping and snoozing features, along with its convenient productivity tools, the Inbox app is sure to be a hit among Gmail users once it is fully released to the public.
