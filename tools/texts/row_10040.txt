With injuries decimating the Arsenal squad, Arsene Wenger has a few selection headaches, particularly in defence, ahead of this match with Anderlecht as the Gunners look to build on their 4-1 win over Galatasary. Starting in goal is expected to be the very inexperienced Emiliano Martinez. The 22-year-old comes into the team after the suspension to No 1 Wojciech Szczesny - sent off against the Turks - while David Ospina is out with a thigh injury. Calum Chambers returns from his own suspension and could replace either Hector Bellerin at right back or Nacho Monreal at centre back. Laurent Koskielny is still suffering with an achillles problem. Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey should both take their place in the Gunners midfield, but Theo Walcott is unlikely to feature as he continues his return from long-term injury. Lukas Podolski has recovered from illness. Anderlecht, meanwhile, are missing defender Fabrice N'Sakala. Jack Wilshere (centre) looks to have shaken off an injury, while Calum Chambers (r) returns from suspension .

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Anderlecht and Arsenal have faced each off only twice in European competition – that was in the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1969-70. These two matches ended with one win for each team, but Arsenal lifted the trophy, by winning 4-3 on aggregate. There have been 12 previous meetings between Arsenal and Belgian sides: the Gunners have lost only three times (W7 D2). The Gunners have won each of their last five against teams from Belgium.

Silvio Proto (left), Sacha Kljestan (centre) and Olivier Deschacht (right) warm up during a training session .

Arsenal have found the net only once in their last four away games in European competition, including qualifying. Anderlecht’s last win in Europe came November 2012 (1-0 against Zenit St. Petersburg), with seven losses and three draws since. The Belgians have conceded in each of these 10 matches, 2.6 per game on average. Only one of the last six Anderlecht's Champions League goals has been netted by a striker.

chatgpt: Arsenal is set to face Anderlecht on matchday four of the UEFA Champions League. The Gunners are in a good position in Group D, sitting at second place with three points. Anderlecht, however, has just one point from their first three matches. As Arsenal prepares to face the Belgian side, they will be without their first-choice keeper, Wojciech Szczesny, who is suspended for the match. This means Argentine goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, will start the game. Martinez has deputized for Szczesny before in the Premier League, putting in solid performances. David Ospina, Arsenal's backup goalkeeper, is also out of the squad due to injury. This means that the Gunners will have to rely on 22-year-old academy product, Matt Macey, as their backup keeper. The Gunners will welcome back defender Calum Chambers from his one-match suspension. Chambers was sent off in the reverse fixture against Anderlecht and missed Arsenal's last Champions League game against Borussia Dortmund. Midfielder Jack Wilshere is also expected to shake off an injury he suffered in Arsenal's win over Hull City. Wilshere has been in good form for the Gunners this season and Arsenal fans will be hoping that his injury doesn't keep him out of crucial upcoming fixtures. Arsene Wenger's side won comfortably against Anderlecht in the reverse fixture, scoring three goals in the final 29 minutes to clinch the victory. However, the Belgian side has shown in this season's Champions League that they are not to be taken lightly. Anderlecht held Borussia Dortmund to a 1-1 draw in their last fixture and will be looking to capitalize on Arsenal's goalkeeper problems. Arsenal will be wanting to put in a strong performance in this game to maintain their position in the group. The Gunners sit just two points behind Dortmund, who will face Turkish side Galatasaray on the same night. Arsenal has a good record against Belgian sides in European competitions. The Gunners have won their last nine matches against Belgian sides, scoring 29 goals in the process. However, Arsenal has struggled in the Champions League this season, losing their opening fixture to Dortmund and only just beating Anderlecht in the reverse fixture. The Gunners will need to put in a strong performance to secure all three points against the Belgian side. This game will be an important one for both sides, as they both look to progress from Group D. Arsenal will be hoping that their backup goalkeeper can step up and perform well in place of Szczesny, while Anderlecht will be looking to take advantage of Arsenal's weaknesses. The match between Arsenal and Anderlecht will take place on November 4th, 2021. The Gunners will be playing at home at the Emirates Stadium and will be looking to put in a strong performance in front of their fans.
