article: The lazy, laid back stereotype of Australian workers has been officially debunked. A new study looking into work life balance of the average Australian employee has found that Aussies regularly work overtime without being paid, with the 'donated' hours adding up to $110 billion every year. 'On average full-time workers reported working six hours unpaid overtime each week and part-timers, three hours,' The Australian Institute's study, Walking The Tightrope, states. The Australian Institute's study, Walking The Tightrope, found that the average Australain worker donates $9,471 in unpaid overtime to their employers each year . 'This donated contribution adds up to 1.13 million hours or $2.1 billion – a week. 'The average worker donates $9,471 in unpaid overtime to their employers each year, which adds up to $109.8 billion across the workforce.' The research, which was conducted to help promote Go Home On Time Day on November 19, resolved that the nation has a 'culture of overtime' that far exceeds that of other countries, with 14.7 per cent of all hours worked being unpaid. 'If these donated hours were allocated to and paid to Australians looking for work the unemployment rate could be zero rather than 6.2 per cent,' the study states. The average working week of Australia's full-time employees is 42.8 hours, ranking it at ninth place amongst OECD countries . A portion of the results are based on a survey of almost 2000 Australians, 42 per cent of which admitted their work/life balance had worsened over the last five years. When asked why they thought that was, the most common response was 'longer working hours', which was given by 46 per cent of people while 'job insecurity' was chosen by 27 per cent of respondents. Participants named 'more flexible hours', 'fixed finishing times' and 'renegotiating hours' as the changes they were willing to make to improve the balance between work and life, while three quarters of respondents admitted they would not give up their pay.

Aside from a lighter wallet, health researchers warn that the extra working hours have a damaging influence on employees. 'We know from research that we've done at the University of Adelaide that unsocial working hours does lead to [people being] overweight and obesity in children - that's an indirect effect, but it's all related to the issue,' Dr Dino Pisaniello, the head of public health at Adelaide University, told the ABC. 'Those [long] hours may constitute a health problem with regard to stress and [participation] in physical activity. If we're sitting in a chair for long periods of time that's a problem in itself.'

chatgpt: As Go Home On Time Day approaches, a new study has been released by the Australian Institute that reveals the extent to which Australian workers are putting in unpaid hours for their employers. The study, titled "Walking The Tightrope," surveyed a sample of Australian workers to determine the frequency and amount of unpaid overtime that is being contributed to Australian companies each year. The results were startling. On average, it was found that each worker was donating a whopping $9,471 in unpaid overtime to their employer each year. This number is a significant amount and highlights the pressing need for Australian companies to prioritize work/life balance. Of those surveyed, 42 percent reported that their work/life balance has worsened over the past five years. The primary reason for this worsening balance is longer working hours. As more companies embrace flexible work arrangements and remote working options, it is crucial that they remain mindful of the importance of setting clear boundaries and work hours to ensure that their employees don't fall into the trap of overworking. Go Home On Time Day, which is taking place on November 19, is an excellent reminder for both employees and employers to take a step back and reconsider the importance of achieving a healthy work/life balance. This annual event was launched by the Australian Psychological Society (APS) and is now in its 12th year. The day is an invitation for workers to leave the office at their regular finishing time, with the aim to remind people to prioritize their wellbeing and get some much-needed downtime. On this day, businesses all around Australia will be encouraged to support their employees by encouraging them to go home on time and unplug for the day. The APS believes that encouraging employees to go home on time will benefit both the worker and the employer, as the former will have much-needed rest, release from stress and the latter will have a renewed, energised and more productive workforce. Carolyn Mouncey, Executive Director of the APS, has emphasized the need to promote Go Home On Time Day more vigorously, in order to ensure that Australian workers are reminded of the importance of taking care of their own wellbeing. Overall, the study highlights the overarching concern regarding work/life balance in the Australian workforce. The results show that unpaid overtime is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed by Australian companies. As we approach Go Home On Time Day, it is an ideal opportunity for companies to take a step back, ensure they are creating work environments which promote work/life balance, while at the same time encouraging employees to prioritize their health and wellbeing.
