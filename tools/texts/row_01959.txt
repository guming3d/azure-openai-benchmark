chatgpt: On the final day of the summer transfer window, striker Alvaro Negredo completed a loan move to Valencia. The Spanish striker expressed his gratitude towards Manchester City fans for their support during his one-year stint at the club. Negredo was signed by Manchester City in 2013 from Sevilla for a reported fee of £16.4 million. The striker had a great start to his career with the Sky Blues, scoring a goal in his debut game against Newcastle United. Negredo went on to make 30 appearances in his first season and helped the club win the Premier League title. However, Negredo's form dipped in the second half of the season as he struggled with injuries. The arrival of Wilfried Bony also meant that Negredo's chances of starting games decreased. Eventually, Negredo found himself surplus to requirements under Manuel Pellegrini and was shipped out on loan to Valencia for the 2014/15 season. Negredo's loan move to Valencia was a successful one as he netted 18 goals in 33 league appearances. His performances earned him a permanent transfer to the club, where he spent the next three seasons. On his return to Valencia, Negredo is looking to make an impact once again. The 35-year-old striker will be looking to provide some much-needed firepower to their squad. Valencia finished 9th in the La Liga last season, and Negredo's signing could be a step towards improving that record. Negredo's loan move to Valencia is for a year, after which the move will become permanent. This could be the final chapter of Negredo's career, and he will be hoping to end it on a high note. Manchester City fans will always remember Negredo for his contributions to the club's title-winning campaign. Negredo's goals were crucial in that season, and he played an important role in the team's success. City fans will surely be hoping that Negredo has a successful spell in Valencia and ends his career on a high note.
