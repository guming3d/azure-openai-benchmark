article: Oops!  A learner driver smashed through a front wall and into a house in Netley, Hampshire, after losing control on a tight corner . A learner driver who lost control on a tight corner was lucky to escape injury when she ploughed her car through a wall and into a house. The motorist, a woman in her thirties, was driving with a passenger when she smashed her black Hyundai Getz, which had an L-plate on the back, into a house in the village of Netley, near Southampton. The car destroyed a garden wall and smashed a large hole in the front of the terraced property, which was empty at the time, and both the driver and her male companion walked away unhurt. Paramedics were called and assessed the pair, while emergency services cordoned off part of the road and the car was taken away on a truck. One neighbour told how he heard a loud thump at around 1.30pm on Saturday. James Myles, 63, said: 'I came round and saw the car buried in there and the couple in it were just getting out. 'I was relieved nobody was hurt. They were very lucky and it was lucky there was nobody inside.' Mr Myles, who said the junction was a difficult one to navigate because of on-road parking, said he gave the couple a cup of tea to calm them down as they sat on the wall after the smash. Neighbour Duncan Matthews, 36, was doing building work on his house when he was alerted to the crash. He said: 'I just heard a humongous thud and my wife and I both looked at each other and my wife said "What was that?". 'There were 50 people out there within two minutes. It just looked awful.' Sgt Alex Banks of Hedge End police said they would be making further inquiries to try to establish what happened. The female householder returned to her house later but did not want to comment.

chatgpt: A woman in her thirties has miraculously escaped unhurt after her car smashed through a garden wall and into a terraced house in Netley, Hampshire. The incident occurred when the woman lost control of her Hyundai Getz on a tight bend in the area. The incident took place in the early hours of this morning when the woman was driving along the residential street. According to eyewitnesses, the car was traveling at an alarming speed when it approached a tight bend, making it difficult for the driver to navigate. The car veered off course and smashed into a garden wall before crashing into the empty terraced house. The driver and her male passenger were both unhurt in the terrifying smash. The homeowner, who was away at the time of the incident, was relieved to hear that nobody was hurt in the accident. The car has since been removed from the property by a recovery team. Residents in the area say that the junction where the incident took place is notoriously difficult to navigate due to the high volume of parked cars. Many have called for the local council to introduce traffic-calming measures in the area to prevent future accidents. A spokesperson for the local council has said that the area will be reviewed, and that any necessary changes will be made to ensure the safety of road users. They urged drivers to take caution when driving on residential streets, especially in areas where visibility is limited or where there are parked cars. The incident has caused considerable damage to the garden wall and the property, but thankfully, nobody was injured in the incident. Hampshire police have launched an investigation into the incident to determine the cause of the crash. This incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of driving at high speeds in residential areas, and highlights the importance of taking caution when approaching tight bends.
