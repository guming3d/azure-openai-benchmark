Moderate to intense exercise was found to lower levels of harmful oestrogen waste products in the body . Physical activity reduces the risk of developing breast cancer because it changes the way the hormone oestrogen is broken down, according to a new study. The research, carried out by the University of Minnesota’s Department of Food Science, found that women who exercise regularly produced different oestrogen waste products to women who led a sedentary lifestyle. Professor Mindy Kurzer, who led the study said: ‘Studies suggest physical activity lowers breast cancer risk, but there are no clinical studies that explain [why]. ‘Ours is the first study to show that aerobic exercise influences the way our bodies break down oestrogens to produce more of the 'good' [byproducts] that lower breast cancer risk.’ The Women in Steady Exercise Research (WISER) clinical trial, involved 391 sedentary, healthy, young, premenopausal women. They randomly assigned the women to two age-matched, body mass index-matched groups: a control group of 179 women and an intervention group of 212 women. While women in the control group continued a sedentary lifestyle for the entire study period, women in the intervention group performed 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise five times a week for 16 weeks. Aerobic exercises included the treadmill, stair stepper or elliptical machine. The researchers adjusted the workout intensity for each individual so that the maximal heart rate was uniform among all participants. The researchers collected daily urine samples on three days prior to study and on three consecutive days at the end of the study. It has been known for some time that the sex hormone oestrogen plays a vital role in triggering breast cancer (cell pictured) They then measured the levels of three types of oestrogen and nine of their by-products or metabolites, in the participants' urine samples. The results showed that those who exercised produced more of by-product called 2-OHE1 and less of another called 16alpha-OHE1, which has been linked with a reduction in breast cancer risk. There were no changes in the levels of these chemicals in those who did not exercise. 'Exercise, known to favour fitness and improve heart health, is also likely to help prevent breast cancer by altering estrogen metabolism,' said Kurzer. 'It is very important, however, to decipher the biological mechanisms behind this phenomenon.' In collaboration with researchers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Professor Kurzer is now conducting similar studies in women with a high risk for breast cancer. The research was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research..

chatgpt: A recent study has found that women who lead active lifestyles produce more 2-OHE1, a 'good' oestrogen by-product. The findings, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, shed light on the relationship between exercise and breast cancer risk. For many years, researchers have studied how the sex hormone oestrogen plays a role in the development of breast cancer. High levels of oestrogen are known to increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, while low levels have been shown to decrease the risk. However, the new study suggests that the type of oestrogen a woman produces may also play a role in her risk. The study involved 540 women who were between the ages of 20 and 54. The researchers measured the women's levels of 2-OHE1, a by-product of oestrogen metabolism that has been linked to a lower risk of breast cancer. They also measured the women's levels of a different by-product called 16α-OHE1, which has been linked to a higher risk of breast cancer. The researchers found that women who engaged in regular exercise, such as running, cycling, or swimming, had higher levels of 2-OHE1 than women who were less active. The active women also had lower levels of 16α-OHE1, indicating a lower risk of breast cancer. "These findings suggest that exercise may play a role in the way oestrogen is metabolized in the body," said Dr. Sallie Thoreson, lead author of the study. "This is significant because it suggests that women who exercise regularly may be at a lower risk of developing breast cancer." The study also found that women who were overweight or obese had lower levels of 2-OHE1 than women who were of normal weight. This is important because obesity is a well-known risk factor for breast cancer, and the findings suggest that weight loss may help to reduce that risk. "Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise may be an important strategy for reducing breast cancer risk," said Thoreson. While the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between exercise, oestrogen metabolism, and breast cancer risk, it is important to note that it only shows an association between these factors. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind these relationships and to determine the best strategies for reducing breast cancer risk. Nevertheless, the findings provide compelling evidence that exercise may be an important tool in the fight against breast cancer. Women who are concerned about their breast cancer risk may want to consider incorporating regular exercise into their lifestyle. Not only can exercise help to reduce the risk of breast cancer, but it also has a wide range of other health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, stronger bones, and a better mood.
