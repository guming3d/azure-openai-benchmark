article: (CNN) -- In one image, soldiers -- including one from the Wisconsin Army National Guard -- pose around a flag-draped casket. The caption reads: "We put the FUN in funeral -- your fearless honor guard from various states." In another, a soldier poses alone in a car. That caption reads: "It's so damn cold out ... WHY have a funeral outside!? Somebody's getting a jacked up flag." Both photographs sparked outrage after they were posted on an Instagram account belonging to Spc. Terry Harrison -- a member of the 1st Battalion, 147th Aviation Regiment based in Madison, Wisconsin. She has been suspended indefinitely from the funeral honors detail, pending an investigation. Harrison remains working full time, performing other duties, said Maj. Paul Rickert, spokesman for the Wisconsin National Guard. On Wednesday, a second Wisconsin National Guard member was also suspended with pay from the funeral honor team, Rickert said. During the suspension, Sgt. Luis Jimenez has been assigned to other duties pending the outcome of the investigation, Rickert said. "He had made comments on social media supporting Spc. Terry Harrison. He's not featured in any of the photos," Rickert said. Jimenez couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. "A military funeral is the final show of respect for our veterans and their families, and we take that solemn duty very seriously," Rickert said. "The very name 'military funeral honors' underscores the importance we ascribe -- both as the military and society at large -- to such solemn occasions. These photos and comments do not appear to align with those values." Harrison is the only member of the Wisconsin National Guard in the photos, the spokesman added. The other people are members of other military units, but Rickert didn't know to which branches or units they might belong. As a result, he didn't know whether there were other investigations involving those members. "We expect all of our Soldiers and Airmen to live by a core set of values, in word and deed," said Maj. Gen. Donald P. Dunbar, Wisconsin's adjutant general. "I was appalled by the offensive photos and comments that appeared on this Soldier's social media site regarding her duties as a funeral honor guard member."

chatgpt: Wisconsin National Guard has suspended two of its soldiers following their inappropriate comments and posts on social media websites. Sgt. Luis Jimenez is one of them who has been suspended for commenting on a social media post related to the protesters. The comment was considered derogatory and offensive towards the protesters. Furthermore, Spc. Terry Harrison has also received a similar suspension from the funeral honors detail, which is a unit that provides ceremonial services to the veterans' funerals. The reason for Harrison's suspension is him making insensitive comments on a photo related to a funeral. The Wisconsin adjutant general, Brig. Gen. Joane Mathews, expressed her disappointment and disapproval of these incidents in a statement. She called the comments made by the two soldiers disrespectful to the fundamental values of the Wisconsin National Guard. Mathews went on to say that she is appalled by the photos and captions on the Instagram account of one of the suspended soldiers. One of the captions read "Somebody's getting a jacked-up flag", which was a reference to the weather at a funeral ceremony. The suspension of the two soldiers is a reminder of the consequences of using social media platforms carelessly. Soldiers have been warned time and again about the use of social media and the importance of maintaining discipline and dignity on the internet. Any comments or actions that are disrespectful towards anyone, especially veterans, will not be tolerated. The funeral honors detail of Wisconsin National Guard is highly respected, and all its members are trained to honor the sacrifices of the veterans and their families. The suspension of Spc. Terry Harrison from the funeral honors detail is a significant action to protect the decorum and sanctity of veteran services. The service members of the funeral honors detail are expected to show reverence and respect for the deceased veterans and maintain the highest level of professionalism while executing their duties. In conclusion, the suspension of Sgt. Luis Jimenez and Spc. Terry Harrison is a reflection of the Wisconsin National Guard's zero-tolerance policy towards insensitive comments and actions of its service members. The National Guard has taken this step to maintain the dignity and respect of the veterans and their families they serve. This incident can serve as a lesson to other service members about the need to act prudently and thoughtfully, especially on social media, as their comments can have serious implications on their career and reputation.
