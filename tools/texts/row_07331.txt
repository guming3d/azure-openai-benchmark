chatgpt: Bradford West MP, George Galloway, has tied the knot with Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, a Dutch-born consultant who is 31 years his junior. The couple exchanged their vows at the Houses of Parliament on Saturday in the presence of their family and friends. However, the wedding was not without controversy. Reports surfaced that the father of Galloway's third wife, Rima, claimed that his daughter was still legally married to the MP, which would make his marriage to Pertiwi invalid and constitute bigamy. A spokesperson for Galloway vehemently denied the accusation, stating that Rima had divorced the MP in 2017 and that the MP was free to marry Pertiwi. The spokesperson also clarified that the MP had followed all legal procedures and that the wedding had taken place with the full knowledge and consent of all parties involved. Many have expressed surprise at the MP's decision to get married again, especially given the significant age difference between him and his new wife. However, Galloway has been vocal about his love for Pertiwi, whom he has referred to as his "soulmate." The couple met while working together on a political campaign and have been dating for over a year before deciding to take their relationship to the next level. They have shared several public displays of affection on social media, with Galloway often posting pictures of himself and Pertiwi on Twitter and Instagram. Despite the controversy surrounding their marriage, the couple remains optimistic about their future together. In a statement to the press, the MP expressed his gratitude to those who had supported him and his new wife and emphasized his commitment to his constituents in Bradford West. "I am grateful for the love and support of my family and friends, and I am excited to begin this new chapter in my life with Putri," he said. "I remain dedicated to serving the people of Bradford West and upholding the values that have defined my political career." In the coming weeks, Galloway is expected to return to his duties in Parliament, where he will continue to work on issues of concern to his constituents. His marriage to Pertiwi is likely to remain a topic of interest and speculation, with many curious to see how the couple's relationship will develop in the years to come.
