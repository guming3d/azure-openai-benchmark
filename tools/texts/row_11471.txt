article: Finland’s largest airline is asking customers to fry with them as it becomes the latest carrier to use a mix of recycled cooking oil and jet fuel to power a long-distance flight. Finnair is using the biofuel to drive the engines of an Airbus A330 aircraft on a nine-hour demonstration flight from Helsinki to New York on Tuesday. It will be the airline’s inaugural transatlantic flight using a fuel mix containing the type of oil used to fry fish, chips or chicken. Come fry with me: Finnair is using recycled cooking oil to power a flight from Helsinki to New York . Finnair said it will be able to reduce its net carbon dioxide emission by 50 to 80 per cent by switching to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly fuel source. But biofuel is more than twice the price of conventionally produced jet fuel and it is too costly for any airline to operate with it exclusively. Tuesday’s flight coincides with the opening day of the UN Climate Summit in New York. Kati Ihamaki, Finnair’s vice-president of sustainable development, said: ‘The UN Climate Summit is an important gathering to fight climate change, and we wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the climate benefits of more widespread adoption of environmentally sustainable biofuels in aviation. Let's fry away: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has been using cooking-oil-based fuel on flights in Europe since 2011 . Finnair's biofuel mixture is being provided by SkyNRG Nordic, a joint venture between SkyNRG and Statoil Aviation, and is partly manufactured with cooking oil from restaurants. Finnair isn’t breaking new ground with its Helsinki-to-New York flight, however. It first flew with biofuel in 2011 and several airlines have been using the mixture for years. But Finnair said it is hoping to establish a biofuel hub with its partners to develop the supply chain and lower the cost of sustainable biofuel while reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

chatgpt: Finnair, Finland's largest airline, has taken a significant step towards reducing its carbon footprint by using biofuel to power one of its Airbus A330 planes. This marks the first time the airline has used a biofuel mix for a transatlantic flight. The flight will coincide with the opening day of the UN Climate Summit, which is also a significant event for the airline given its commitment to promoting sustainable travel. Finnair has been working diligently to reduce its emissions, and this move is a testament to its commitment to the environment. The biofuel mix consists of a blend of renewable jet fuel and traditional kerosene, and is believed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent. It is a notable step towards reducing the airline industry's carbon footprint and moving towards sustainable aviation. Finnair's A330 will depart from San Francisco and land in Helsinki, with an approximate duration of 11 hours. While the biofuel mix will only account for a fraction of the plane's total fuel consumption, it is an essential step towards achieving the airline's sustainability goals. The airline has been seeking to implement sustainable aviation measures for several years now, with a particular emphasis on reducing its carbon emissions. It has previously implemented measures such as installing winglets on planes and optimising flight paths to improve fuel efficiency. Finnair's commitment to sustainability has been recognised in the industry, with the airline being awarded the prize for Europe's Leading Charter Airline at the World Travel Awards in 2019. The use of biofuels in the aviation industry is a significant development towards achieving environmental sustainability. It offers a viable alternative to conventional fossil fuels and could lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions by the sector. As the effects of climate change become more evident, it is essential for industries to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. Finnair's use of biofuel is a positive step towards achieving this goal, and it is hoped that other airlines will follow suit in implementing sustainable aviation measures.
