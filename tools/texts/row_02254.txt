article: Europe captain Paul McGinley may regret leaving Ian Poulter out of Saturday afternoon's Ryder Cup foursome pairings after the Englishman engineered a stunning fightback  in the morning session. Poulter lost his Ryder Cup opener with Stephen Gallacher to Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed on day one, but the heroics he's become renowned for in this tournament were back on show in the morning as he and Rory McIlroy came from behind to halve their match with Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker. McIlroy will be back in action however for Europe with his partner from Friday, Sergio Garcia, as they take on Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan in the foursomes.

chatgpt: European golfer Ian Poulter has been benched for the afternoon foursomes after his impressive morning performance at the Ryder Cup. Poulter, who played alongside Rory McIlroy, helped Europe halve their match against American pair Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker. Poulter's absence in the afternoon matches could be a setback for Europe, as they try to hold off the charging American team. The afternoon foursome matches will see Jamie Donaldson and Lee Westwood face off against Zach Johnson and Matt Kuchar, while Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy will take on Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan. In another pairing, Martin Kaymer and Justin Rose will face Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed, while Victor Dubuisson and Graeme McDowell will face Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker. The Ryder Cup has been a closely contested tournament so far, with both teams trading blows and neither team able to break away. Poulter's heroics in the morning session will be remembered as one of the key moments of the tournament, but his absence in the afternoon will be felt by the European team. Poulter and McIlroy were unstoppable in the morning fourballs session, with Poulter making some decisive putts that ultimately led to Europe salvaging a point. However, European captain Jose Maria Olazabal has to think about the long-term strategy and felt that Poulter needed some rest before the singles matches in the coming days. The afternoon foursomes represent a different challenge for the European team, as they will have to work together and make strategic decisions on every hole. The American team has been playing superbly in this format, winning all four of their matches in the last Ryder Cup. Regardless of the outcome, the Ryder Cup has once again proven why it is one of the most exciting events in golf. The pressure, drama, and passion on display remind fans why this tournament is so special. With the world's best players battling it out for glory, every shot counts and every decision can prove critical. As the sun sets on day one, the stage is set for an epic weekend of golf.
