Four men were found sleeping inside a yellow Mini Cooper, alongside four dead deer. According to reports, the men had shot three of the deer before running over the fourth with their car. After this callous act, they simply went to sleep in the cramped vehicle. The incident immediately raised red flags with the responding officers. Upon closer inspection, they discovered that the men had been hunting without a license, and had possession of illegal drugs. Two of the men were subsequently arrested on poaching and drug charges. They were identified as 18-year-old William Hutto and 17-year-old Carson Price. The gruesome discovery has prompted widespread outrage, as the local community mourns the loss of the four innocent deer. "It's sickening to think that someone could do something like this," said one resident, who preferred to remain anonymous. "These men clearly had no respect for wildlife or the law."
