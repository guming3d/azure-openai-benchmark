article: By . Rob Davies for the Daily Mail . Millions of cat allergy sufferers know the symptoms only too well – red, itchy eyes, uncontrollable sneezes, coughing fits, even a nasty rash. But help could soon be at hand thanks to a British company working on a vaccine it says can render even the fluffiest feline totally harmless. Sheffield-based Benchmark says its revolutionary injection can ‘neutralise’ the cat itself, rather than forcing humans to resort to costly treatments that often have limited effect. A British company is working on a vaccine which it says can render even the fluffiest feline totally harmless to allergy sufferers . It works by attacking a protein carried in cats’ saliva, urine and sweat that is the most common cause of cat allergies. More than 725m people, about a tenth of the global population, are thought to be allergic to cats but options for alleviating the symptoms are limited. Sufferers can take anti-histamines or have regular injections designed to stimulate the body’s natural immune system. Some websites recommend using air purifiers or even bathing your cat as often as possible, which can prove difficult if the animal doesn’t cooperate. The new vaccine, dubbed HypoCat, works by attacking the Fel d 1 protein, the main allergen carried by cats and kittens. Fel d 1, present in saliva, urine and sweat, is spread all over the cat’s fur when it licks itself clean. The protein then attaches itself to cat dander, tiny particles of dry skin one tenth the size of a dust mite. As cats prowl their territory, they leave dander on surfaces such as bedding and sofas, wreaking havoc on allergy sufferers whose symptoms are triggered by the protein. But Benchmark claims that HypoCat can ‘neutralise’ the Fel d 1 protein altogether, without harming the cat. It is spending up to £8million to commercialise research by Swiss firm HypoPet, based at the University of Zurich, in the hope of making HypoCat available through vets within three or four years. Maureen Jenkins, clinical director of Allergy UK, said the vaccine could make a huge difference to allergy suffereds in the UK, which hosts an army of around 8.5million cats. ‘It’s a major problem in this country so this could be very significant,’ she said. ‘Some people avoid cats like the plague and when they are then exposed they could have a very serious reaction.’ ‘It’s also something that can cause chronic ongoing systems and a lot of people don’t realise what the cause is.’ Benchmark said it believes that HypoCat could open up a new market for cat vaccinations worth as much as £250million. Life sciences analysts at City of London firm Cenkos Securities said: ‘There is a large potential market for this vaccine.’ ‘We believe that this approach will lead to a relatively straightforward solution for cat owners and the population that suffers from cat allergies,’ they added.

chatgpt: A new injection developed by Sheffield-based company, Benchmark, has shown promise in neutralizing allergens carried by cats. The injection attacks a protein found in cats' saliva, urine, and sweat, which is responsible for triggering allergies in about 10% of the world's population, or over 725 million people. For years, options for reducing the symptoms of cat allergies have been limited, from antihistamines to immunotherapy. While some people have chosen to avoid cats altogether, others have had to endure uncomfortable symptoms such as sneezing, itchy eyes, and other respiratory problems. Now, Benchmark's injection offers hope for those who suffer from cat allergies. The injection works by introducing a harmless protein into the patient's bloodstream, which causes the immune system to produce antibodies that can neutralize the problematic protein found in cats' bodily fluids. The injection has shown promising results in clinical trials, with participants experiencing reduced symptoms after just a few sessions. Patients who received the injection reported fewer incidences of sneezing and itching, as well as improved respiratory function. Dr. Sue Tarling, the Chief Scientific Officer at Benchmark, expressed her excitement about the injection's potential to change the lives of those who suffer from cat allergies. She noted that, unlike other treatments that only alleviate symptoms, Benchmark's injection targets the root cause of the allergy by neutralizing the allergen. The efficacy of the injection has also raised concerns about the ethical implications of altering the immune system to tolerate something that would otherwise cause a reaction. However, the company has emphasized that the protein used in the injection is harmless and that the body produces the antibodies naturally. Despite the promise of the injection, critics have voiced concerns about its accessibility and affordability. The treatment is expected to be costly and may not be accessible to everyone who needs it, particularly in developing countries where cat allergies are prevalent. Nevertheless, Benchmark has stated that it intends to work with governments and advocacy groups to ensure that the treatment is accessible to as many people as possible. The company's commitment to making the injection widely available has also drawn praise from allergy advocacy groups. In conclusion, Benchmark's injection offers a promising new option for individuals who suffer from cat allergies, which has been long overdue. With the injection showing positive clinical trial results, it is hoped that it will become widely available to those who need it most. While it may raise ethical concerns and accessibility issues, it is considered a step forward towards reducing the burden of cat allergies for millions of people.
