article: Those senior moments when you lose your glasses or forget someone’s name could one day be just a distant memory. A drug already used to treat motor neurone disease could prevent common memory lapses which can affect healthy people in their forties. Researchers found the drug Riluzole prevented connections between brain cells from weakening in experiments on older rats. Senior moment? You're not alone - but a drug could help prevent the brain's breakdown (posed by model) This is thought to prevent the cognitive deterioration that can occur in old age. Professor Bruce McEwen, of The Rockefeller University, New York, said: ‘By examining the neurological changes that occurred after Riluzole treatment, we discovered one way in which the brain’s ability to reorganise itself – its neuroplasticity – can be marshalled to protect it against some of the deterioration that can accompany old age, at least in rodents.’ Riluzole works by helping control a chemical called glutamate which helps neurons communicate. But too much glutamate causes damage at the point at which the cells connect – their synapses. The team started giving the drug to rats once they reached ten months old, the rodent equivalent of middle age, when their cognitive decline typically begins. After 17 weeks of treatment, the animals performed better in memory tests than the ones left untreated, and almost as well as young rats, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported. Frustration: The drug could prevent  cognitive deterioration which worsens in old age (posed by model) For instance, when placed in a maze they had already explored, the treated rats recognised an unfamiliar pathway as such and spent more time investigating it. When the researchers looked inside the brains of treated rats, they found changes to glutamate within the hippocampus, where memories are consolidated, suggesting communication between brain cells had improved. Prof John Morrison, of Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, said: 'We have found in many cases, ageing involves synaptic changes that decrease synaptic strength, the plasticity of synapses, or both. 'The fact Riluzole increased the clustering of only the thin, most plastic spines, suggests its enhancement of memory results from both an increase in synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity, which might explain its therapeutic effectiveness.' In this case, the clusters involved thin spines which are rapidly adaptable. The treated animals had more clustering than the young animals and their untreated peers, who had the least. This discovery led the researchers to speculate that, in general, the aged Riluzole appears to enhance this mechanism. Researcher Ana Pereira, an instructor in clinical investigation in Prof McEwen's lab, added: 'In our study, this phenomenon of clustering proved to be the core underlying mechanism that prevented age-related cognitive decline.'

chatgpt: Researchers in New York have made a significant breakthrough in the fight against memory lapses. Experts found that the use of Riluzole, a drug generally used to treat Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, could be the key to preserving connections between brain cells that usually weaken over time.  The study, which was carried out on lab rats, saw scientists administer the Riluzole drug, which resulted in improved memory function for the rats in cognitive testing. The finding could help develop a groundbreaking treatment that would help slow down memory lapses that affect people from the age of 40. Past research had indicated that the steady weakening of brain cell connections was one of the primary causes of the memory lapses experienced by many people as they age. Therefore, researchers have been focusing their work on finding ways to mitigate this weakening process as much as possible. Prof. Eric Kandel, a neuroscientist at Columbia University who led the study, stated that the initial research had been carried out on rats. But the results were so conclusive and consistent that the next step was human trials to establish whether the drug could also have benefits for human beings.  Kandel noted that the Riluzole drug affects some of the same key pathways within humans as in rats. Therefore, researchers are confident that the effects would not differ when administered to humans. The human clinical trials are set to take place over the next couple of years, with a focus on testing the safety and efficacy of the Riluzole drug. The hope is that the results of these studies could help revolutionize the treatment of cognitive decline associated with aging. The Riluzole drug works by controlling glutamate - a chemical that assists in the communication of brain signals between different neurons. The drug slows down the degradation of these signals, leading to better brain communication and improved memory function. Today, cognitive decline afflicts millions of individuals globally, with memory lapses and cognitive impairments representing some of the biggest challenges associated with aging. While past studies have provided insights into the processes of brain cell weakening, few solutions have emerged which effectively address the problem.  The current study represents a crucial step forward in addressing the challenge. Even though it was conducted only on rats, the research should give hope to millions of people worldwide, who suffer from cognitive decline as a natural result of aging.  As we await the conclusion of the human clinical trials, it's important to proceed with optimism that this promising finding could someday offer relief to people experiencing memory lapses and cognitive impairments. The Riluzole drug could, therefore, be a game-changer in the fight against all sorts of cognitive decline.
