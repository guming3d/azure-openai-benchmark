article: An international jewellery scam dubbed the 'Italian Job' has been broken up by police who stormed a luxury hotel and arrested a gang of alleged fraudsters. Detectives believe that the men, who claim to be from Italy but are actually Eastern European, were hoping to defraud jewellery shops in the North-West of England by using fake money to buy goods. They seized £2million worth of counterfeit euro notes, as well as £50,000 in genuine currency and a haul of watches worth around £100,000. Haul: This fake money was seized by police investigating an alleged jewellery fraud gang on Saturday . Four alleged fraudsters had hired a whole conference room, according to the police who apprehended them at Manchester's Portland Thistle Hotel. They were dressed in expensive Italian suits and claimed to be from Italy themselves, while they drove an Audi 8 and Alfa Romeo with German number plates. Police arrested two of the suspects in the foyer of the hotel in front of guests and shoppers on Saturday afternoon, and the other two were arrested in the conference room. Det Insp Rob Cousen of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We were responding to dynamic intelligence. We had only established an hour earlier they were in the Portland. 'We had previously received intelligence that a Manchester jeweller had been targeted by a gang. Those arrested have given details of who they claim to be but they had a number of ID cards. 'We believe they are probably from Eastern Europe and linked to an international organised crime gang. Arrest: The four men were apprehended at the Portland Thistle Hotel in central Manchester . 'They were very sharply dressed, flash, and wore a lot jewellery. We are trying to establish if the jewellery they had was real or fake. They claimed to be Italian - a proper Italian job. 'They had hired the Denis Law conference suite, which gives an indication of their suspected plans. You don't go to that much trouble for a small fraud. 'We believe we have stopped a number of jewellery businesses from going out of business. They could have been ruined by this kind of fraud, and lost everything, their livelihoods, even their homes.' The police had received a tip-off from Safer Gems, an organisation which monitors allegations of crime in the jewellery, fine arts and antiques trades. It is believed that the men were hoping to bring jewellers to their hotel suite and buy gems using a mixture of real and fake cash. Police claim that the gang entered Britain via the Channel Tunnel before travelling north of Manchester. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: Four men have been arrested by police at the Portman Thistle Hotel in Manchester on Saturday. Authorities have confiscated £2million in counterfeit euros as well as £100,000 worth of high-end watches.  Investigators believe that the four suspects were planning to use the counterfeit currency to purchase jewels and watches, potentially fueling the illicit trade of counterfeit goods in Europe.  Police have disclosed that the suspects were detained after they were observed conducting suspicious activity at the hotel. Upon investigation, they discovered the counterfeit cash and other items in their possession.  The suspects claimed to be Italian nationals but investigators concluded that they were from Eastern Europe. The police reported that the four had been travelling to different areas with the fake currency to exchange it for genuine currency. Counterfeit money is a severe problem for a variety of industries and businesses. Counterfeiting involves the production of illegal currencies, which can create financial losses for central banks and other financial institutions. At the same time, the sale of counterfeit items helps fund other crimes, including terrorism. Law enforcement agencies are continually working to shut down counterfeit businesses and crack down on individuals involved in such illegal activities. Measures undertaken by the government include the implementation of enhanced security features on banknotes and other financial instruments, training for police officers, and the use of specialized technology to track and arrest counterfeiters. The Manchester Police have commended the efforts of their officers in intercepting such sizable counterfeit funds before they could be used further. Police are also keen to remind businesses to be alert and to report any suspicious activities as well as educating the general public on how to identify fake banknotes. The recent bust of the four individuals in Manchester highlights the fact that counterfeiters are becoming more widespread and sophisticated in their methods. Additionally, organized crime groups are becoming increasingly involved in the manufacturing and distribution of counterfeit currency, with significant implications for businesses and society at large. As a result, law enforcement agencies across Europe and the world are continuing to collaborate to put an end to this problem. The Manchester police force's successful operation is just one example of the significant progress being made in the fight against counterfeit currencies and goods. The operation serves as a reminder that counterfeit currency can cause irreparable damage to businesses and the economy, and hence the public should be vigilant in identifying and reporting any suspicious activities.
