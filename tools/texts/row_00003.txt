A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning. Blanc Brasserie in London's Covent Garden has been forbidden from offering pink lamb's liver after ignoring a warning from Westminster Council environmental health officers. The food presented an 'imminent risk of injury to health' because of the way it was cooked, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told today. French-born Mr Blanc, 62, is a director of the company that owns the restaurant. James Armitage, Westminster City Council's food, health and safety manager, said: 'After receiving two separate complaints of food poisoning which may have originated from eating at a Covent Garden restaurant, our officers investigated and issued a notice which prevented the restaurant from serving undercooked lambs' liver. 'Today's court decision to uphold the notice is welcome as the serving of undercooked meat, without suitable controls in place, is a public health risk. 'Health inspectors have agreed with the restaurant the safety measures that need to be in place for the restaurant to be allowed to safely put the dish back on its menu.' The two diners contracted campylobacter food poisoning after they had the dish on separate occasions this summer. Guidance from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends that lamb's liver must be cooked at 70 degrees centigrade for at least two minutes. But the Brasserie Bar Co. said it had taken liver off the menu at all 18 of its Blanc Brasserie restaurants throughout Britain after it was ordered to pay Â£3,103 in costs. A spokeswoman said: 'Brasserie Bar Co. has not contested the environmental health officers' enforcement and will no longer serve liver in any of its restaurants. 'In order to serve liver and comply with Westminster Council, it would need to be overcooked to such an extent that our customers just won't eat it.' Mr Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, was awarded two Michelin stars in 1985. There were more than 371,000 estimated cases of campylobacter food poisoning in England and Wales in 2009, resulting in more than 17,500 hospitalisations and 88 deaths, according to the FSA.

chatgpt: Blanc Brasserie, a high-end French restaurant in the heart of Covent Garden, is at the center of controversy after ignoring warning signs from environmental health officers. The restaurant, which is owned and directed by French-born chef Raymond Blanc, 62, was recently visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained of severe food poisoning. The diners had fallen ill with campylobacter, a type of bacteria commonly found in undercooked chicken or other poultry. Despite the warning from the health officers, Blanc Brasserie failed to take any immediate action to rectify their food safety procedures. Instead, the restaurant's management chose to carry on business as usual, putting the health and safety of their customers at risk. The situation at Blanc Brasserie has raised concerns among food safety experts, who warn that ignoring warnings from environmental health officers can have serious consequences. According to experts, failing to take prompt action can lead to the spread of foodborne illness among customers, potentially causing long-lasting health problems and possible legal action. The situation at Blanc Brasserie is particularly concerning given the restaurant's high-end reputation and status as a popular destination for foodies in London. Many of the restaurant's customers are passionate about their food and expect a top-quality dining experience, which includes food safety and hygiene standards that are beyond reproach. Raymond Blanc is a well-known figure in the culinary world, having appeared on numerous TV shows and written several cookbooks. He is also a staunch advocate for sustainable and ethical food practices. The fact that his restaurant seemingly ignored warnings from environmental health officers has raised eyebrows among his fans and supporters. Although the restaurant has not yet issued a statement about the situation, it is likely that the management will face significant backlash from customers and food safety advocates alike. It remains to be seen what steps they will take to rectify the issues raised by the environmental health officers. This incident serves as a reminder to all restaurants and food establishments about the importance of prioritizing food safety and hygiene. Ignoring warnings from experts can have serious health and legal repercussions, which can ultimately harm not only customers but businesses themselves. It is crucial that all food establishments take proactive measures to ensure that their products are safe and healthy for consumption.
