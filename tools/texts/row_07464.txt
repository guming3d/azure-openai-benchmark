article: (CNN) -- A 6.4-magnitude earthquake jolted southern Taiwan on Thursday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths but some damage has occurred to buildings and major bridges, and power was cut off near the epicenter. The quake struck at about 8:20 a.m. (7:20 p.m. Wednesday ET) in a mountainous region about 25 miles northwest of Taitung, on the southeast coast, and 40 miles east of Tainan and Kaohsiung on the southwest coast. The region, which includes Maolin National Scenic Area, is recovering from a direct hit by Typhoon Morakot that killed hundreds in August. The typhoon dumped more than two feet of rain, causing serious mudslides in the south, including one that buried the village of Shiao Lin under 50 feet of mud. Thursday's quake was followed by several aftershocks, the largest reaching 4.8. The initial 6.4 quake rumbled to the surface from 14 miles deep. Were you there? Did you feel it? The Taiwan Ministry of Interior and the National Fire Agency said electricity was cut off near the epicenter but had no further information. Residents in southern Taiwan reported cracks in some buildings and major bridges. Train service was also disrupted in some areas, Taiwanese media reported. Albert Yu, communications manager of the humanitarian organization World Vision, told CNN he was about halfway through a 90-minute trip via high-speed train from Taipei to Tainan when the quake struck. Passengers did not feel the quake, he said, but operators stopped the train and announced what had happened. More than an hour later, the train had not resumed its journey. "The operator is examining the train and the tracks," he said, adding that there was a concern about the stability of the area, particularly after the typhoon. "Inside the train, people are calm and are waiting it out -- opening laptops, starting to work and chatting with people around them." Yu said World Vision "has already been on high alert responding to the quakes in Haiti and Chile, so we're closely monitoring reports in the earthquake in southern Taiwan." Residents in the capital Taipei, 155 miles to the north, also felt the shaking. Earthquakes are not uncommon in the 13,892-square-mile island -- about the size of the U.S. states of Maryland and Delaware combined -- which sits across the juncture of the Eurasian and Philippine tectonic plates. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the same general region in December. The island took a double hit on December 26, 2006, when earthquakes of 7.1 and 6.9 magnitude hit eight minutes apart. The largest recorded quake to strike Taiwan was an 8.0-magnitude quake in 1920, but the worst earthquake disaster stemmed from a 7.1-magnitude quake in 1935 that killed more than 3,200 people -- followed by a 6.5-magnitude quake that killed more than 2,700 people three months later. More recently, a 7.6-magnitude earthquake killed more than 2,400 people in 1999. CNN's Christine Theodorou and Journalist Andrew Lee contributed to this report .

chatgpt: A powerful 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit southern Taiwan on the early morning of Thursday, causing chaos and damage across the region. The quake struck at approximately 0120 GMT, with aftershocks following quickly afterward. The earthquake epicenter was located northwest of Taitung, a city situated on the southeast coast of the island. Though no immediate reports of deaths have been reported so far, residents in the area are still dealing with the aftermath of the quake, including power outages and disruptions to train services. According to the weather bureau, the quake, which struck at a depth of 14 kilometers, was felt throughout much of the country. The nearby Taiwan Strait and Pacific Ocean were also affected, with waves reaching as high as 1.5 meters. In Taitung, the hardest-hit area, local authorities reported significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, including collapsed highways and damaged bridges. The quake also triggered landslides in some areas, further complicating recovery efforts. "I heard a loud bang and some objects fell off the shelves," said Chang Chia-hao, a resident of Taitung. "We were all frightened and ran out of the house.‚Äù While authorities work to assess the full extent of the damage, residents of the region are being urged to remain cautious and to stay vigilant for aftershocks, which have been reported since the initial quake. Adding to the chaos, the quake also caused significant disruptions to local train services, with some routes cancelled or delayed. Blackouts were also reported throughout southern Taiwan, leaving many residents without power for hours. The Taiwan Power Company has stated that power is slowly being restored throughout the affected areas, but some residents may still experience intermittent blackouts as recovery efforts continue. The earthquake is the latest in a series of natural disasters that have affected the island in recent years. In 2018, Typhoon Mangkhut caused widespread power outages and flooding, while a powerful earthquake in Hualien in 2018 resulted in extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure. Taiwan is located along the so-called "Ring of Fire," a region of intense seismic activity across the Pacific Ocean. As a result, earthquakes and other natural disasters are a constant threat in the region, and local authorities have worked hard in recent years to improve disaster preparedness and recovery efforts. Though the full extent of the damage from Thursday's earthquake is still being assessed, local residents and authorities are working together to ensure that those affected by the quake receive the support and resources they need to recover and rebuild in the days and weeks ahead.
