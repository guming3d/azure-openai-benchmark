article: (CNN) -- Amazon is rumored to be making a phone. Citing checks of the company's supply chain, an analyst at Citigroup has issued a memo saying the phone may cost less than $200 and likely will be available in the middle of next year, according to multiple news reports in financial publications. "With the clear success of the Kindle e-Reader over the past 3 years, and Kindle Fire possibly succeeding in the low-priced tablet market, we view this as the next logical step for Amazon," the investor's note said, according to a report in Reuters. The blog AllThingsD says it's likely the phone would run Google's Android operating system: . "(Mark) Mahaney's note doesn't spell out that the phone will use Google's Android operating system, but it suggests that will be the case by positing that Amazon will need to pay Microsoft an 'OS royalty' -- Microsoft has recently been able to extract royalty payments from other Android hardware partners." Of course, all of this is completely speculative, and based on one report from one analyst. Amazon did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Friday morning, and no on knows for sure if the company is working on a phone. But it's interesting to tech journalists and investors in part because Amazon is creeping further from its roots as an e-commerce website and into new areas of technology, including hardware development. The company's Kindle e-reader has been a hit for years, and Amazon this week put its new tablet, the Kindle Fire, on the market for $200. Reviewers say the Kindle Fire isn't amazing -- not as functional as the iPad -- but they're generally impressed with it given its much-lower price. The Apple iPad sells for $500 to $830. The Amazon phone would cost the company $150 to $170 to make, and Amazon -- always one to offer low prices, even when it loses money on a sale -- likely would offer the phone for close to that price, Peter Kafka writes at AllThingsD. Still, all of this buzz about an Amazon phone raises a larger question: . Would you want to buy it? This is completely anecdotal, but when Mike Elgan, a Silicon Valley tech columnist, asked this question of his followers on Google+ he got back plenty of "no's." Some of the responses from his followers: . "I don't even know how well their tablet works, much less an OS for the phone." "-1." "No." "Something that belongs on +The Onion news network :)" "Amazon is going in the wrong direction." Others were more enthusiastic, if the price is right. "$150 with no contract required would be an awesome deal, especially for the 40% or so of people that don't have a smart phone. my father in law wants an iPhone but not the data plan fee."

chatgpt: There has been speculation for years that Amazon, the world's leading online retailer, has been working on a smartphone device to challenge the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. Now, according to a CitiGroup analyst, those rumors are closer than ever to becoming reality. Speaking to investors recently, CitiGroup analyst Mark Mahaney claimed that Amazon is indeed working on a smartphone device, which he expects to launch sometime in 2012. Though CNN has not confirmed Mahaney's claims, the news has sent ripples throughout the tech industry and among Amazon's competitors. According to Mahaney, the Amazon smartphone will be a mid-range, mass-market device that will feature a single 3D display, designed to showcase Amazon's vast array of digital content, including books, movies, TV shows, music, games, and apps. Mahaney also expects the phone to be priced around $200, similar to other mid-range smartphone models currently available. Despite the excitement around Amazon's potential entrance into the smartphone market, the company itself has remained tight-lipped on the subject. When asked for comment, Amazon representatives declined to offer any details on their plans or confirm the existence of a smartphone device in the works. If Amazon does indeed launch a smartphone device next year, it would be a significant move for the company, which has, until now, largely focused on e-commerce and tablet devices. A smartphone would position Amazon as a serious contender in the highly competitive smartphone market, where companies such as Apple, Samsung, and Google currently reign supreme. However, with such stiff competition, Amazon will have to differentiate itself in order to succeed. The 3D display, which Mahaney suggests will be a key feature of the Amazon smartphone, could indeed set the device apart from other smartphones on the market. The display could also help to differentiate Amazon's content offerings, which would be a key selling point for the device. Of course, it remains to be seen whether or not the Amazon smartphone will actually launch in 2012, as Mahaney predicts. The smartphone market is notoriously difficult to navigate, and even established companies such as BlackBerry have struggled to keep up with the competition. If Amazon does decide to enter the smartphone market, it will also face challenges related to manufacturing and distribution. The company will need to find a manufacturing partner, which could be difficult given that many smartphone manufacturers are already tied up with other companies. Likewise, Amazon will need to invest in marketing and distribution efforts to ensure that the smartphone reaches consumers effectively. Despite these challenges, however, the idea of an Amazon smartphone has already generated significant excitement among tech enthusiasts and analysts alike. Only time will tell whether or not the device becomes a reality, but one thing is for sure: if Amazon does release a smartphone, it will shake up the industry in a big way.
