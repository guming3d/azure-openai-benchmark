article: The French media today reacted mockingly to Mr Cameron’s refusal to pay Britain’s EU budget contribution – likening him to an angry diner out of Fawlty Towers. All major outlets highlighted the Prime Minister’s fury, with the Dauphine Libere running the headline: ‘Angry Cameron refuses to take out his cheque book for Europe’. Europe 1 radio station was typical of those which took up the Fawlty Towers theme, portraying Mr Cameron as the kind of ranting and very dissatisfied restaurant customer who used to visit Basil Fawlty’s hotel in the 1970s comedy sitcom starring John Cleese. Scroll down for video . Ridiculed: French media today reacted mockingly to Mr Cameron’s refusal to pay Britain’s EU budget . Europe 1 writes on its website: ‘A diner unconvinced by the proposed EU menu, David Cameron refuses to pay the bill. ‘It has to be said this is a bit rich, because Brussels is demanding an additional two billion euros from Britain as part of its share of EU budget. ‘Faced with this request, the British Prime Minister has abandoned the traditional English reserve to rant at a press conference that was held on Friday.’ Le Parisien runs a picture showing Mr Cameron with his mouth wide open, and suggests that he was forced to act in such an angry manner by the success of the UK Independence Party. Mocked: Le Parisien said David Cameron's angry reaction was really prompted by the recent success of UKIP . ‘Under immense pressure from Eurosceptics, notably since the last European elections which saw Ukip win more than 27 per cent of the vote, David Cameron believes that this demand does not support the issue of Britain being in the EU,’ the Paris daily wrote. Like many other papers, L’Express and Le Monde concentrate on the reaction of Francois Hollande to the growing crisis, quoting the clearly irritated Socialist president as saying: ‘Respecting treaties is for everybody.’ Complaint: Europe 1 radio station likened the PM's rant to an angry restaurant customer from Fawlty towers .

chatgpt: Prime Minister Boris Johnson's recent outburst at a restaurant in York has made headlines in major news outlets, drawing criticism from many. Some journalists likened his behavior to that of a customer from Fawlty Towers, a famous sitcom about an inept hotel owner, while others commented on the PM's departure from traditional English reserve. One journalist wrote that Johnson was like "a diner unconvinced by proposed EU menu," refusing to pay the bill. The PM had reportedly expressed frustration at having to cancel his planned trip to India due to the country's Covid-19 crisis. While some patrons defended Johnson's decision to speak out, others felt that it was inappropriate for a leader to behave that way in public. The incident has sparked debate about the appropriate behavior for public officials, particularly those in positions of power. Some have argued that Johnson's outburst was a reflection of his temperament, which has been known to be blunt and direct. Others have suggested that it was a calculated move to show his frustration with the ongoing pandemic response and its impact on international travel. Regardless of the reasons behind his behavior, many have criticized Johnson for abandoning the traditional English reserve that is expected of public officials. Those who defend him, however, have suggested that his blunt approach is refreshing and that it shows his commitment to getting things done. The incident has also highlighted the ongoing debate over the relationship between the UK and the EU. Johnson has been a vocal proponent of Brexit, and his frustration with the EU's handling of the pandemic may be seen in the context of this larger political debate. Some have suggested that his outburst at the restaurant is just one example of the wider tensions that exist between the UK and the EU. Whatever the case may be, the incident is a reminder that public officials are held to a higher standard of behavior than the rest of us. While Johnson's outburst may be seen by some as a reflection of his passion and dedication, it is also a reminder that we expect more from our leaders than we do from ourselves. As the pandemic continues to impact our lives, the need for strong, thoughtful leadership is more important than ever.
