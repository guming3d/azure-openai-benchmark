article: (CNN) -- Utah officials for the time being do not have to formally recognize hundreds of same-sex marriages performed last December and earlier this year, after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday granted the state's request for a delay. Gov. Gary Herbert and Attorney General Sean Reyes had told the justices the issue of whether the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional remains pending in the lower courts. Having to recognize those same sex marriages before the larger legal questions are fully decided, said the state, would be too disruptive. Once the constitutional issues are fully resolved --- likely by the Supreme Court in the next year or so -- both sides in the debate "will know the status of the interim marriages. Until then, requiring [the state] to recognize plaintiffs' marriages and provide marital benefits is premature and unwarranted," said the appeal. In a one-paragraph order, the high court agreed. But that temporary action does not signal what the justices will ultimately think about the larger constitutional issues raised by gay and lesbian couples seeking a right to wed. A federal appeals court late last month affirmed Utah's voter-approved Amendment 3 violated the equal protection rights of same-sex couples. The law currently defines marriage only between one man and one woman. A group of plaintiffs then asked that court to order the state to recognize those marriage licenses already issued in late December and January. The judges did so, prompting the state's current stay request to the Supreme Court . About 1,300 same-sex couples obtained marriage licenses in the 17 days after a federal judge ruled on December 20 that Utah's ban was unconstitutional. Those marriages were stopped after a separate, temporary stay was put in place in January by the Supreme Court. That was the issue in the current litigation. The case is Herbert v. Evans (14A65). Same-sex marriages also were the subject of a ruling in Colorado on Friday. County clerks in the Denver area have been ordered by the state's highest court to cease issuing same-sex marriage licenses, until the issue is fully decided. The state attorney general had asked for the injunction, saying he plans to defend Colorado's voter-approved measure defining marriages as only between one man and one woman. John Suthers had argued allowing those marriages to go through while the issue is still being debated in the courts would be "legal chaos." After local judges in Colorado in recent weeks week also ruled the state's ban to be unconstitutional, several local clerks -- in Denver, Adams, Pueblo, and Boulder -- said they had to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples who requested them. But the state high court's action puts all that on hold for the time being. The same federal appeals court that acted in the Utah case on Friday also tossed out Oklahoma's ban. Both states plan to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to have the final say. Same-sex marriage: Fast Facts .

chatgpt: The issue of same-sex marriage continues to captivate and divide the country, and it has made its way to the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court once again. The court recently declined to hear a case about the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans, effectively allowing lower court rulings to stand, but this has not stopped the state of Utah from continuing its appeal. In late December of 2013, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby handed down a historic ruling that Utah's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. This ruling marked the first time that a federal court had struck down a state's ban on same-sex marriage, and it quickly became the talk of the nation. However, the celebrations were short-lived. Just days after Judge Shelby's ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a temporary stay, effectively halting same-sex marriages in the state while the appeals process played out. And now, as expected, the state of Utah is appealing Judge Shelby's decision. The Utah Attorney General's office filed its appeal with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on January 21, 2014. "We realize this is a significant issue", said Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes in a statement. "We recognize the importance of this issue and recognize that the decision made by the 10th Circuit will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court, regardless of the outcome." The 10th Circuit is expected to hear oral arguments in the case in April, with a decision expected sometime in the coming months. Depending on the outcome, the case could very well make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court once again. In the meantime, same-sex couples in Utah - as well as in many other states - are still waiting to find out what the future holds for their right to marry. The issue of same-sex marriage has seen its fair share of ups and downs in recent years, with a majority of states now allowing same-sex marriages and the U.S. Supreme Court striking down the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. However, there are still many states that do not recognize same-sex marriages as legal unions. In Colorado, for example, same-sex wedding licenses were put on hold in late February in two counties after the state's attorney general called into question the legality of such marriages. The issue of same-sex marriage is far from over, and it is clear that it will continue to be a lightning rod of controversy and debate for some time to come. As the appeals process plays out in Utah and other states, many will be watching closely to see how the courts ultimately rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans.
