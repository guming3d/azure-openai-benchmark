Ex-pats living in the principality are free to get honours, fund political parties and run businesses while escaping the taxes that apply to other citizens. To live in Monaco there are rules set by HM Revenue and Customs that Britons have to meet, including an ability to prove they have made a ‘definite break’ with Britain. Ex-pats living in the tiny haven of Monaco are free to get . honours, fund political parties and run businesses while escaping the . taxes that apply to other citizens . But many wealthy Britons in the tax enclave still hold on to many links to the UK. More than 500 directors of UK companies have registered addresses in Monaco and control over 1,300 firms, an investigation found. Restaurant and property tycoon, John De Stefano, 67, who runs 81 companies from the principality, is among them. And at least 11 people who live in Monaco as tax exiles, or benefit through family members, have been awarded honours. They include the billionaires Sir Philip Green and Jim McColl OBE. Six Monaco-based Tory donors have made political donations – despite government pledges to close a loophole enabling them to do so. They include Lord Laidlaw, 69, who gave £5million, and David Instance, 73, a Kent businessman, who provided a helicopter used by David Cameron. HMRC spokesman David Richardson said . last night: ‘The Government wants to make sure the rules in our tax . system are clear, but those on tax residence are currently complicated . and uncertain. Sir Philip Green and Tory donor Lord Laidlaw are among more than 2,000 Britons living in Monaco who are believed to be costing the UK economy £1billion a year . ‘They have built up over time, often based on decisions in the courts, so we are bringing in a residence test that will bring certainty to the minority of people whose tax residence status is not immediately clear.’ Monaco residents – who are not breaking any laws – often reject the term tax exile and say they are only there to enjoy the lifestyle and weather in the principality. They say they contribute to the British economy by creating jobs and paying corporate tax at source, and they pay 19.6 per cent VAT in Monaco. HMRC added that it routinely vets would-be honours recipients when the Cabinet Office sends the list to Government departments. Comedian Jimmy Carr was forced to apologise earlier this year after it was revealed he put his earnings into a Jersey-based tax avoidance scheme called K2, which reduced the income tax liability of participants to as little as one per cent. Both David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have branded aggressive tax avoidance, like the one used by Mr Carr, as ‘morally repugnant’. Mr Osborne pledged to clampdown on such schemes during the last budget.

chatgpt: The issue of tax avoidance has been a hot topic in the United Kingdom for some time now, with politicians taking a hard stance against those who seek to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. However, it appears that some individuals, including some of the wealthiest and most influential people in the country, are still able to evade paying taxes without any consequence. According to recent reports, a number of residents in the UK are able to receive honours, fund political parties, and run businesses while avoiding the payment of taxes. This is despite the fact that aggressive tax avoidance has been labeled as "morally repugnant" by high-ranking officials such as former Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne. Among the individuals who are said to be avoiding taxes in the UK are billionaire Sir Philip Green and Tory donor Lord Laidlaw. These individuals are able to enjoy the benefits of living in a country with a stable political and economic system while avoiding paying their dues to the government. The issue of tax avoidance has become increasingly important in recent years, as governments around the world struggle to raise revenue and meet their spending obligations. The UK is no exception, with the government facing increasing pressure to crack down on tax avoidance in order to raise funds for essential services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Despite this pressure, it appears that some of the most wealthy and powerful people in the UK are still able to avoid paying taxes. This is a worrying trend, as it suggests that the system is not fair or equitable for everyone. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the wealthy and powerful have access to more resources and can hire the best and brightest financial experts to help them avoid paying taxes. In contrast, the average person may not have the same resources or access to financial expertise, making it much more difficult to avoid paying taxes. This disparity in resources and expertise is a major problem, as it reinforces the idea that the rich can get away with anything while the poor are left to suffer. It also undermines public confidence in the tax system, making it harder for the government to raise revenue and maintain social programs. In order to address this issue, it is important for the government to take a hard stance against tax avoidance and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. This can be done through a combination of stronger enforcement measures, such as increased penalties and fines for those who evade taxes, and greater transparency and disclosure requirements for businesses and wealthy individuals. Overall, the issue of tax avoidance in the UK is a complex and multi-faceted problem that requires a coordinated and sustained effort from government, civil society, and the private sector. While progress has been made in recent years to crack down on tax avoidance, much more needs to be done to ensure that everyone pays their fair share and that the tax system is seen as fair, equitable, and transparent by all.
