article: Some fisherman will do anything to catch a big one but when it means wading into waist-deep, crocodile-infested waters you have to wonder if it's actually worth it. Onlookers were left dumbfounded by the behaviour of a man, who spent 'at least 15 minutes' in the water at Shady Camp on the Mary River in the Northern Territory. Jason Rogers was there fishing nearby and photographed the man in the water. He said that at the time there was a four-and-half-foot crocodile floating within 50 metres of where the man was fishing. Scroll down for video . To the shock of onlookers the man is seen fishing waist-deep in crocodile infested waters . Mr Rogers has been a fishing guide in the area for 24 years and said that the spot was known for its barramundi fishing. 'It was one of the most dangerous things I've seen happen for years. The man just pulled up in a car with his mates and trotted off to the other side,' Rogers, 45, said. 'Then he waded in up to his waist and started fishing even though there were four or five crocs in and around him. 'But it's not the first time I've seen it happen. It didn't worry him at all. People are willing to take a chance so that they can catch some good barramundi.' The man was fishing for barramundi and took no notice of the crocodiles around him . Mr Rogers had been fishing from the bank before the man arrived and caught 15 barramundi before the man started out into the water. 'He was in there for at least 15 minutes. When he was out in the water you couldn't even have shouted to him to warn him that a crocodile was coming because the river was rushing so strongly. I'll never know how he didn't get eaten,' he said. It's believed that the man was from Darwin Mr Rogers said, and that he had fished in the area before for barramundi. Initially the fisherman just stood off the shore in shallow water as he fished . 'I've seen a lot of silly stuff with people going out and doing exactly the same thing as this man. But the thing is 20 years ago there wasn't as many crocodiles around. There's a bigger population of crocodiles now,' Mr Rogers said. 'A lot of people get taken and it's all because of stupidity. It can happen as quick as a wink, so if you get into the water up to your chest like this you wouldn't even see one coming. 'There'd be absolutely nothing you could do about it. He may have done this before, but the way he's going he won't be doing it for much longer.' Jason Rogers shows off a 98cm barramundi he caught just before the mystery man stepped into the river .

chatgpt: A fisherman has caused concern among other local anglers after spending at least 15 minutes in the water with crocodiles at Shady Camp on the Mary River. Jason Rogers was fishing nearby and captured images of the man in the water with the deadly reptiles.  Shady Camp is renowned for its barramundi fishing, but it is also a well-known habitat for saltwater crocodiles, which are known to be among the world's most dangerous creatures. The man in question has fished the area before, but his decision to enter the water with the crocodiles has been met with widespread criticism.  Many local fishermen are aware of the dangers of crocodile infested waters, and the sight of a man putting himself in harm's way has been a cause for concern. Rogers, who was fishing nearby, said: "He may have done this before, but the way he's going he won't be doing it for much longer."  Rogers' stunning images of the fisherman in the water have circulated widely on social media, with many users expressing their shock and dismay at the man's behavior. Many have called for stricter measures to be implemented to prevent people from entering waters that are known to be inhabited by crocodiles.  Saltwater crocodiles can grow to be over 23 feet long and can weigh over 4,000 pounds. They are known to be highly territorial and will aggressively defend their territory from any perceived threats, including humans. According to the Australian government, there have been over 20 crocodile attacks on humans in the Northern Territory since 2005, with four of these attacks leading to fatalities.  Authorities have stressed the importance of staying out of waters inhabited by crocodiles, warning that the reptiles are highly unpredictable and may attack without warning. The Northern Territory government has also implemented various measures to keep people safe from crocodile attacks, such as erecting signs and barriers, conducting crocodile patrols, and educating visitors to the dangers of the local wildlife.  Shady Camp is a popular destination for tourists and fishermen alike, with many people flocking to the area to experience some of the best barramundi fishing in the world. However, authorities have reiterated that visitors should always exercise caution when near the water, and never enter waters that are known to be inhabited by crocodiles.  In light of this recent incident, it is hoped that visitors to the area will take heed of the warnings and take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from harm. While it may be tempting to take a dip in the water on a hot day, the risks of encountering a crocodile are simply too great. At the end of the day, it is simply not worth putting one's life in danger for the sake of a quick swim.
