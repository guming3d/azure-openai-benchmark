article: A jury will be allowed to consider a confession by a suspect with a low IQ who is accused of killing a 6-year-old boy more than three decades ago, a judge ruled Monday. In May 2012, Pedro Hernandez told police that he choked Etan Patz to death in New York City in 1979, police say. Hernandez's attorney, Harvey Fishbein, argued that his client falsely confessed and the statements were not reliable because Hernandez had been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an "IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range." The statements in question were made during three events across two days in May 2012: a 7Â½-hour interrogation, a 20-minute videotape of the statement following the interrogation, and a statement made at the district attorney's office the next morning, Fishbein said. "I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did and that's the whole point of this case," Fishbein told CNN affiliate NY1. But Judge Maxwell Wiley ruled Monday that the confession was admissible, writing that Hernandez's waiver of Miranda rights was "knowing and intelligent," according to court documents. Wiley cited reports of two forensic psychology experts who met with Hernandez and determined he was "in fact capable of knowingly waiving his rights," the decision said. The two experts agreed that "although the defendant has a very low IQ, that alone does not necessarily prevent a person from understanding Miranda warnings and making a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights," court documents said. Fast Facts: Missing children in the U.S. Hernandez admitted to luring Etan, who was en route to a school bus stop, into the basement of a bodega where he worked as a stock clerk and killing him, according to police. The boy's body was put in a garbage bag and thrown away, Hernandez allegedly told authorities. The remains were never found. The Patz case garnered national attention after the boy went missing, and his picture was plastered on thousands of milk cartons around the country. Fishbein told CNN that although the jury will be able to consider the confession, it is now up to them to decide if it is truly reliable or not. In November 2012, a grand jury indicted Hernandez on second-degree murder and kidnapping charges. He pleaded not guilty in court the following month. The trial is set to begin January 5, Fishbein said. Who is Pedro Hernandez?

chatgpt: Jury to Hear Pedro Hernandez's Confession to Killing Etan Patz in 1979 The highly anticipated trial of Pedro Hernandez is set to begin on January 5, 2022. Hernandez has been accused of the 1979 kidnapping and murder of six-year-old Etan Patz, an incident that garnered national attention and became a turning point in the way missing children cases were handled. In a pre-trial hearing on Tuesday, Judge Maxwell Wiley ruled that the jury will be allowed to hear Hernandez's confession to killing Patz. The confession, given in 2012, came after years of investigation and was considered a breakthrough in the long-cold case. Hernandez's attorney had argued that the confession should be thrown out as false, citing Hernandez's low IQ as evidence that he did not fully understand his rights. However, Judge Wiley ruled that a low IQ does not automatically mean that Hernandez did not understand what was happening during his confession. "The court finds that (Hernandez's) IQ does not demonstrate that (he) lacked the mental capacity to understand his rights," Judge Wiley said in his ruling. Hernandez's confession has been a point of contention throughout the case. In it, he described luring Patz into a bodega where he worked as a teenager and strangling him before disposing of his body in the trash. However, Hernandez's defense team has argued that the confession was coerced and that Hernandez has a history of mental health issues. They have also pointed to the lack of physical evidence tying Hernandez to Patz's murder. The case is largely circumstantial, with no DNA or forensic evidence linking Hernandez to the crime. The trial is expected to bring renewed attention to the case, which continues to haunt Patz's family and the community where the crime occurred. Patz was one of the first missing children to appear on a milk carton, a symbol of the desperation and urgency felt by those searching for him. The case has also led to changes in how missing children cases are handled, including the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. As the trial approaches, there is sure to be wide public interest in the case and the outcome of Hernandez's trial. The Patz family has suffered for over four decades without resolution, and many hope that a verdict will finally bring them some closure. The case also serves as a reminder of the importance of never giving up on unsolved cases and the power of perseverance in seeking justice. As the trial begins, those involved in the Patz case will be looking not just for a verdict, but for a sense of peace and understanding in the years since Etan Patz's tragic disappearance.
