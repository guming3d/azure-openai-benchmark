These extraordinary pictures capture one of Britain's rarest animals - an albino squirrel. The red-eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast Patrick Sullivan, 66, in a park near his home almost three months ago. But despite regularly stalking the woodland he was never able to capture the rare animal on camera. Spotted: The red-eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast Patrick Sullivan, 66, in a park near his home almost three months ago but he didn't spot it again until the other day . The pensioner spent days re-stocking his bird feeder only to be greeted by half a dozen of the animals' grey cousins. Disappointed Mr Sullivan was about to give up on ever tracking down the rare animal, but last week his luck changed. He glanced outside to check on his bird feeder and was stunned to see the red-eyed albino squirrel staring back at him. The former publisher said he was delighted to have finally caught the animal on film. Mr Sullivan, from East Grinstead, Sussex, said: 'When we saw the white squirrel a few months ago darting through the trees, we couldn't believe our eyes. Rare: Mr Sullivan said the squirrel is more nervous that other squirrels so the picture was quite difficult to take . 'We thought, 'That can't be right'. They jump around, but they are gone in a flash. 'We've seen him a few times since then, so when we put in a bird feeder we were pleasantly surprised to see him visit. 'He is a lot more nervous than the other squirrels, so it was not easy to get the picture. The feeder is mainly for the birds, but I'm a nature lover and I'm happy to see him.' Though relatively uncommon, the rare creatures can be seen in a few parts of the South East, and the British Wildlife Centre, in Newchapel, has its own resident albino squirrel. Liza Lipscombe, from the British Wildlife Centre in Newchapel, Surrey, said: 'It's not just squirrels that can be albinos. 'Bank voles, badgers and even white blackbirds are not unknown in this area. 'Albinos have quite a tough time in the wild, losing any natural benefits of camouflage, or they may be rejected by others of their kind. 'But as they are tree-dwelling and very quick on their feet, squirrels have very few natural predators and albino squirrels often survive as long as the grey ones. 'Our squirrel was cared for by Folly Wildlife Rescue, near Tonbridge, and is now too tame to release, and has been given a permanent home here.'

chatgpt: In a rare sighting, wildlife enthusiast Patrick Sullivan glimpsed a red-eyed rodent in the southern region of the United States. Though relatively uncommon, these small creatures can be spotted in a few select areas, adding to the region's diverse collection of wildlife. The rodent, known as the red-eyed vireo, is a species of bird which is commonly found in the eastern region of North America. While it may be a bird, its distinct red eyes and small stature give it the appearance of a rodent, which could be why Sullivan initially mistook it for one. The red-eyed vireo's habitat spans across the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast regions of North America, but sightings of the species are still relatively rare. These birds are typically found in wooded areas, and their distinctive call can be heard echoing through the forests during the summer months. Sullivan reported his sighting of the bird to local wildlife authorities, who were excited to receive news of the rare occurrence. "The red-eyed vireo is a beautiful bird, and we're thrilled to hear that it's still making an appearance in the southern states," said Tom Johnson, a spokesperson for the local wildlife department. Despite being relatively uncommon, the presence of the red-eyed vireo in the south is a reminder of the region's diverse wildlife. Known for its humid summers and mild winters, the southern states are home to a variety of animal species, from alligators and bears to armadillos and coyotes. Many wildlife enthusiasts travel to the southern states to experience its unique blend of flora and fauna first-hand. While sightings of certain species may be rare, the opportunity to glimpse a red-eyed vireo or other uncommon wildlife adds an extra level of excitement to any nature adventure. The red-eyed vireo is just one example of the many incredible creatures that call the southern United States home. From sea turtles to bald eagles, the region's wildlife is as varied as it is awe-inspiring. As for Sullivan, he's happy to have had the chance to see the red-eyed vireo for himself. "I've been interested in wildlife since I was a kid, and it's always amazing to see a new species in the wild," he said. "I feel lucky to have caught a glimpse of this beautiful bird, and I hope others will have the chance to see it too."
