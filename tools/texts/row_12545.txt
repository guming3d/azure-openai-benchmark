article: (CNN) -- For Mike Chinoy, CNN's Beijing bureau chief at the time, one of the most significant moments in that heady spring of 1989 in China happened at 2:30 a.m. Beijing time on the morning of June 4, as the crackdown was taking place. Mike Chinoy: "I described the gunfire and the bodies." Chinoy was on the balcony at "Tokyo base" -- the network's nickname for its makeshift bureau at the Beijing Hotel down the avenue from Tiananmen Square -- watching soldiers march into the square with guns firing. He was also constantly on the phone with CNN Atlanta, giving the network live "beeper" updates on what was happening there. CNN's live video capability had long been pulled by the Chinese authorities. And CNN's first pictures from the square had already been confiscated. But Chinoy, a long-time China watcher in the midst of the biggest story he had ever covered, was keeping the network and its viewers updated by phone.

I was just describing what I was seeing, and passing on what colleagues were sending. I had a telephone line that could be kept open." And then at 2:30 a.m., Ralph Begleiter, CNN's State Department correspondent at the time, started his talk show, which was featuring U.S. Secretary of State James Baker as its previously scheduled guest. Before Begleiter began interviewing Baker, though, he went to Chinoy in China for the latest on what was happening in Beijing.  See photos of the CNN team in Tiananmen Square in 1989 » .

"And then Begleiter asked Baker what America's policy on the crackdown was." "Baker was flustered," Chinoy recalls. "He didn't know what was happening yet. The U.S. embassy hadn't submitted any reports. He hadn't had time to think it through." It was in that moment that Chinoy realized that television news -- and the 24-hour news cycle CNN had pioneered -- was going to alter everything. "It showed the way this live, real-time news on television was going to change the dynamics of how major players responded to dramatic events and crises," said Chinoy. "It was a watershed in the information revolution." No time for even a thought that June 4, 1989, was also his 37th birthday. Mike Chinoy is now an author and Senior Fellow at the Pacific Council on International Policy, based in Los Angeles. Daniela Deane was a chief sub-editor at the Reuters news agency in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen crisis .

chatgpt: On the night of June 3, 1989, Mike Chinoy, an American correspondent, was at the Beijing Hotel near Tiananmen Square. As he stood on the balcony, Chinoy was witness to a historic and turbulent moment in Chinese history. In front of him, he saw thousands of students and citizens gathering in the square to protest against China's Communist Party. The peaceful protests, which began weeks earlier, had turned increasingly violent as the Chinese government responded with force. Despite the chaos, Chinoy remained calm and professional, giving a live commentary of what he saw and heard from the balcony. He knew that this was a significant moment in history and that the world was watching. As he spoke, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker was asked to respond to the breaking news. Baker's response, which was broadcast to the world, expressed the United States' support for the people of China and their right to peaceful protest. Chinoy's live commentary was an early example of the power of 24-hour television news. The coverage of the Tiananmen Square protests and the government's response captured the attention of audiences around the world. The events of that night would have a lasting impact on the Chinese government, as well as on the role of the media in shaping public opinion. The Chinese government's crackdown on the protests resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, and is still remembered as a dark moment in the country's history. For Chinoy and other journalists, the events in Tiananmen Square also highlighted the importance of journalism in providing accurate and timely information to the public. Despite the risks, reporters like Chinoy continued to provide critical coverage of the protests, shining a light on the government's actions and the people's struggle for freedom. Chinoy went on to become a highly respected journalist, covering stories around the world for CNN and other news outlets. His experiences in Beijing were just one of many examples of the power of the media to shape public opinion and influence events on the global stage. As we look back on the events of 1989, we are reminded of the importance of a free press in holding governments accountable and giving a voice to the people. The legacy of Tiananmen Square endures, serving as a reminder of the power of the people to demand change and the role of the media in making those demands heard.
