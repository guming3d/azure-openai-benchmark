article: A European flight was delayed for five hours over safety concerns - after a mouse was spotted on-board. The Swiss aircraft was supposed to depart Zurich for Malaga on Monday at 12.05pm. But a member of cabin crew saw the rodent at the rear of the Airbus A320 and immediately grounded the plane for safety reasons. Passengers on board a Swiss air flight were delayed for five hours - because of a mouse . Passengers then had to wait until 5pm for a new plane to arrive to fly them to Spain. There are always fears that the rogue rodent could have gnawed through any important wires on the aircraft. The mouse was eventually caught and, after a safety check, the plane was given the all-clear and returned to flight today. A spokesperson for Swiss said: 'The aircraft was still on the ground in Zurich as a member of the cabin crew saw a mouse in the Eco-Galley in the back of the A320 aircraft. 'For evident safety reasons, Swiss grounded immediately the aircraft and proceeded to an aircraft change. Cabin crew pointed out that they had seen a mouse, and the plan was grounded . 'The passengers could fly later in the afternoon yesterday (Mon) just after 17:00 to Malaga. 'The Swiss maintenance proceeded yesterday to an in-depth check in order to find the mouse, this with success. 'Since this morning (Tuesday), the aircraft is released and back to the operations again. Such a situation happens very rarely at Swiss.' It is not the first time a plane has been grounded in Switzerland due to a mouse on board. In 2001, a rodent was spotted as an aircraft came into land after flying from the Dominican Republic. Then, two-years later, a pair of mice escaped from a container in the hold of a plane on a flight from the American city of Boston. Last year a plane supposed to travel from Heathrow to New York was grounded shortly before take-off when a mouse was spotted.

chatgpt: Swiss plane passengers were left stranded for five hours after a mouse was spotted scurrying around the cabin by the plane's crew. The furry guest was deemed a potential 'safety concern', with worries that it could gnaw through the plane's wires. As a result, the decision was made to ground the plane until a replacement aircraft could arrive. This is not the first time that mice have caused problems for planes in Switzerland. In 2018, a similar incident occurred with a mouse spotted onboard an EasyJet plane, which caused a delay of over two hours. While these rodents may seem harmless, they can cause significant damage to planes, making them a serious threat to passenger safety. Passengers on the affected plane vented their frustration on social media, with many expressing disbelief and irritation at the unexpected delay. One passenger tweeted: "We have been stuck on this plane for hours because of a mouse! Unbelievable! What is happening?" Despite the inconvenience and frustration felt by the passengers, grounding the plane was the responsible decision. The safety of passengers and crew must always come first, and any potential threats, no matter how small, must be taken seriously. This incident again highlights the need for airlines to stay vigilant and take necessary precautions to prevent pests from gaining access to planes. Mice and other rodents can find their way onto planes through various means, including cargo shipments or even the personal belongings of passengers. Therefore, it's essential that airlines continue to implement strict hygiene protocols and pest control measures. In conclusion, the incident involving a rogue mouse on a Swiss plane may have caused considerable delays for passengers, but ultimately it was the correct decision to ground the plane. The incident serves as a reminder that airlines need to remain vigilant and continue to take every necessary precaution to ensure the safety of their passengers and crew.
