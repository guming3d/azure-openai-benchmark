Officials at the mosque said the online . post was put up by a youth worker who had copied the text of a fatwa - a . religious ruling - from another Islamic website. It read: 'Many times Allaah has mentioned the . details of the birth of 'Eesaa (Jesus) in the Qur'an but He did not . mention any celebration to be done on their occasion. 'Therefore a Muslim is neither allowed to celebrate the Christmas Day nor is he allowed to congratulate them.'. It described Christmas Day as a 'falsehood that Muslims should avoid' and warned that 'disbelievers' were trying to draw Muslims away from the 'straight path'. The Lebanese Muslim Association, which manages the mosque, said the message did not represent the views of the organisation.

'Fatwa': Part of the post removed from the Lakemba Mosque Facebook page . He told The Sydney Morning Herald: 'Anyone who says otherwise is speaking irresponsibly.

'We are required to have good relations with all people, and to congratulate them on their joyous events is very important.' Community leader Dr Jamal Rifi, who joined priests at a Christmas celebration in the capital last night, said: 'We can share the festivities with friends and families and neighbours – I don't think there is any civil, religious or ethical reason not to.'Muslim convert Rebecca Kay added: 'It's sad to see the Lebanese Muslim Association, which considers itself the peak body representing Australian Muslims, with comments like these. It goes to show how far they are from representing the community.'

chatgpt: A message posted by an unknown individual on a mosque’s social media page claimed that Muslims should not celebrate Christmas. The post has since been taken down by the mosque and criticized by Muslim leaders. The message, which labeled Christmas as a "falsehood" and urged Muslims to avoid it, appeared on the social media page of a mosque in the heart of the city. The post circulated for a short time among its followers and was later taken down by the mosque authorities. The mosque’s imam, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the post was misguided and did not reflect the views of the mosque.  The incident followed a lecture given by the imam, in which he reportedly urged his worshipers to avoid participating in Christmas celebrations. The lecture was intended to remind the mosque's followers of the importance of preserving their cultural and religious identity. However, the mosque leaders stressed that the imam’s words had been taken out of context and that he had not advocated the spread of any hateful messages. Muslim leaders across the region have condemned the message as spread of hate and divisiveness. A senior Muslim figure condemned the message and asked all members of the Muslim community to offer their respects to Christians and other communities during the festive season. He added that Islam emphasizes respectful coexistence with people of other religions. Celebrating Christmas is a personal choice and does not impact a person's faith in Islam or any other religion. Muslim leaders have long promoted the importance of tolerance and mutual respect in promoting peace and harmony among diverse communities. Following the incident, the mosque has issued a statement welcoming interfaith dialogue and cooperation. It is hoped that such incidents will not recur in the future. In conclusion, the incident of the message labeling Christmas as a "falsehood" and urging Muslims to avoid it that was posted on a mosque's social media page has been roundly condemned by the mosque and Muslim leaders. It is important for all communities to promote peaceful coexistence and mutual respect despite any differences in beliefs and cultures.
