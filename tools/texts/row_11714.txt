chatgpt: A bus carrying both foreign and Slovakian tourists crashed into a lawnmower on a central reservation of a dual carriageway on Friday afternoon. The collision occurred in the Kechnec area of eastern Slovakia and left a total of ten people injured. Of the passengers on the bus, four were British and one was Russian. The remaining passengers were Slovakian. Authorities have not revealed the identities of those involved in the crash. The bus was headed towards the town of Kosice, the second-largest city in Slovakia. The lawnmower, according to reports, was being used to trim the grass on the central reservation at the time of the accident. The accident caused the bus to overturn, resulting in ten passengers being injured. Emergency services quickly arrived at the scene, where they worked to extract those trapped in the overturned bus. All ten were then rushed to hospital, with the injured passengers being transported to the capital, Bratislava, for treatment. According to local news sources, authorities have opened an investigation into the incident. The driver of the bus, who was among the injured, is being questioned by police. The authorities are yet to determine the cause of the accident. Eduard Heger, the Slovak Prime Minister, took to social media to express sympathy for those injured in the crash, stating that the government was closely monitoring the situation. This is not the first time a bus carrying foreign tourists has been involved in an accident in Slovakia. In 2019, a bus carrying Ukrainian tourists crashed in central Slovakia, leaving two people dead and dozens injured. The latest incident serves as a reminder of the importance of proper road safety measures and the need for motorists to be cautious when operating vehicles. As authorities continue their investigation, the injured passengers remain in the hospital, receiving treatment for their injuries.
