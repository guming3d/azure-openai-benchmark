article: Tokyo (CNN) -- The return of electricity spread slowly Saturday across northern Japan, where hundreds were injured and tens of thousands remained without power after one of the strongest aftershocks following last month's devastating earthquake struck the region. Nearly 250,000 were still waiting for their lights to come on as crews rushed to repair damaged water and gas lines. At least 283 people were injured by Thursday's 7.1-magnitude aftershock alone. It was blamed for two deaths; intial reports indicated a few more deaths, though the causes of those could not be directly tied to the aftershock. Japan is still reeling for the the massive magnitude 9.0 earthquake that slammed the nation on March 11, sparking a nuclear crisis. The death told from that quake and the resulting tsunami stood at 12,921 on Saturday, with nearly 15,000 people still missing, according to Japan's National Police Agency. Communities across northern Japan planned to hold solemn commemorations Monday, including moments of silence to mark one month since the disaster struck. A Japanese researcher said Friday that residents in eastern Japan, including Tokyo, can expect more such aftershocks in the coming months. "We should not be surprised to have magnitude-7 level aftershocks even a year afterward anywhere as wide as east Japan in the wake of such mega-quake of magnitude 9," said Satoko Oki of the Earthquake Research Institute of Tokyo University. Meanwhile, a key transportation hub in Sendai -- one of the areas worst hit by last month's quake -- is preparing to start up operations again. Limited commercial service at the airfield south of the city and near the coast will be restored April 13, authorities and airlines said. "As a result of efforts aiding recovery by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the self-defense force, the U.S. military and other organizations, the airport is being opened sooner than originally expected," Japanese airline ANA said in a statement. ANA said it will make three "relief" flights daily to and from Tokyo's Haneda airport, while rival Japan Airlines said it will operate three flights a day into the airport from Tokyo and Osaka. The re-opening of the airfield will bring relief to the region, which is still without express train service. Many roads and dozens of railroad lines and stations also were knocked out by the disaster. Currently, the airlines believe that, at the earliest, they will be able to restore regular service by the end of May.

chatgpt: A strong aftershock jolted Japan on Thursday, causing widespread mayhem and resulting in two people losing their lives while hundreds were left injured. It was one of the most powerful aftershocks to hit the country since the devastating earthquake on March 11.  The quake, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale, struck off the eastern coast of Honshu at around 11:57 AM local time. The epicentre was located about 50 miles east of Miyagi Prefecture, one of the areas hardest hit by the March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami.  Reports from local authorities indicate that the tremor caused significant damage to buildings and roads in the affected region. The two fatalities were reported in Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures, where a woman in her 80s and a man in his 60s were killed after being crushed by falling debris.  Meanwhile, hundreds of other residents were left with injuries of varying degrees. At least 200 people were rushed to nearby hospitals with injuries, and the death toll is likely to rise as rescuers continue to search the affected areas.  One of the more immediate concerns raised by the aftershock is the potential for further disruption to key infrastructure in the region. In particular, officials are assessing the damage and impact to the Sendai airport, a major hub for travel and commerce in the region.  The airport was temporarily closed down after the tremor, but officials are hopeful that it will be able to reopen in the coming days. They have stated that there is minimal damage to the airport facilities and that the structural integrity of the runways and buildings appears to be intact.  The Sendai airport has been a crucial location for aid efforts and economic recovery in the wake of the March 11 disaster. Its reopening will be seen as a positive indication of progress in these areas.  The aftershock serves as a sobering reminder of the ongoing risks and challenges faced by Japan in the aftermath of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Despite significant progress in rebuilding efforts and disaster preparedness, the country remains highly vulnerable to ongoing tremors and earthquakes.  As the search and rescue efforts continue in the wake of this latest aftershock, it is apparent that Japan's resilience will continue to be tested in the years ahead.
