article: (CNN) -- Inter Milan have won the Italian Serie A title for a fifth successive season -- and the 18th time in their illustrious history -- after Diego Milito's goal gave them a 1-0 win at Siena on Sunday. Jose Mourinho's side needed nothing less than a victory to secure the Scudetto and they achieved that feat in the 57th-minute when striker Milito collected a pass from fellow-Argentine Javier Zanetti, before firing home a shot with the outside of his right foot. A draw would have allowed second-placed Roma to snatch the title with a win at Chievo and Claudio Ranieri's side kept up their side of the deal with a 2-0 success. Mirko Vucinic volleyed home Daniele De Rossi's through-ball in the 39th minute and Italian international De Rossi added a second on the stroke of half-time with a superb long-range strike. With only 45 minutes remaining of the season, Roma were in pole position to win their first title since 2001 -- but Milito's strike ensured Inter became the first team since Juventus in the 1930's to win five titles on the bounce. The result, which condemned Siena to relegation to Serie B alongside Atalanta and Livorno, also means Inter Milan will now face Bayern Munich in next weekend's Champions League final in Madrid with both sides bidding for a unique treble. "This is an incredible joy, a reward for all the hard work we've put in over the year," Milito told reporters. "From tomorrow we will think about that great Champions Lague final." Like the Bavarian giants, Inter have now added the league title to their domestic cup triumph -- and Saturday's Bernabeu showdown now ensures one of the two teams will secure a rare treble of trophies this season. For Mourinho, who has overseen Inter's last two Scudetto wins, there is the added incentive of joining a select band of coaches to have won the Champions League with two different clubs, following his success with Porto in 2004.

chatgpt: Inter Milan has won the Italian Serie A title for the fifth year in a row after a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Siena on Sunday. Diego Milito was the hero for Inter, scoring the only goal of the match in the 57th minute to secure the Scudetto for his team. The win was particularly sweet for Inter Milan, who had already won the Italian Cup earlier in the week. The players and fans celebrated the double trophy-winning season in style, as they paraded around the San Siro stadium with the league title and the Italian Cup. The team's coach, Jose Mourinho, was proud of his players and praised their efforts in a post-match interview. "This is a great achievement for our club," he said. "I am very proud of my players and their dedication to the club." However, it was not plain sailing for Inter as Siena put up a tough fight. The home side had a few good chances in the first half, but Inter's defense held strong. The second half saw Inter put on the pressure, and it eventually paid off with Milito's goal. Elsewhere in the league, Roma finished two points behind Inter Milan in second place after a 2-0 victory over Chievo on Sunday. Goals from Mirko Vucinic and Jeremy Menez secured the win and ensured that Roma would take home the silver medal. The win was bittersweet for Roma, as they had been in the running for the title for much of the season. However, Inter's consistency proved too much for them to overcome, and they were forced to settle for second place. Despite falling short of the title, Roma can take pride in their performance this season. Their second-place finish is the highest they have achieved in the league since finishing runners-up in the 2007-08 season. Overall, it was a memorable season in Serie A, with Inter Milan proving once again that they are a force to be reckoned with. Mourinho's men will now set their sights on further glory in Europe, as they look to defend their Champions League crown.
