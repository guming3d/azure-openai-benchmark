This design concept has been well-received and has been quickly adopted by people who wish to be remembered for their distinctive personalities. “Our goal is to cater to a new generation of consumers who value uniqueness and creativity, " says Funeral Concept founder, David Lee. “Death is no longer just a mourning period, but a celebration of life.

The company's designers take into account the individual's passions, interests, and even their profession, creating a design that truly embodies the person and celebrates their life.
