chatgpt: A mail sorting facility and a Customs office in the United States had to be quarantined after a suspicious package was discovered. Two workers suffered respiratory arrest after being exposed to the dangerous nerve gas inside the package. The package had originated from China and initial tests have been positive for VX chemical nerve gas, which is known to be deadly nerve agent. The incident was reported when the package arrived at the mail sorting facility in the early hours of the morning. A worker had noticed a strange smell coming from the package and immediately alerted the authorities. Emergency services arrived at the scene and the facility was evacuated. The Customs office next door was also evacuated shortly after. After investigating the package, authorities discovered that it was likely to contain a broken container of everyday nail polish remover. However, despite this discovery, initial tests conducted on the package were positive for a deadly nerve agent known as VX chemical nerve gas. This discovery was alarming and prompted authorities to quarantine the mail sorting facility and the Customs office as a precautionary measure. The two workers who had been exposed to the nerve gas were immediately rushed to the hospital. They had suffered respiratory arrest indicating that they had inhaled a significant amount of the gas. Their condition is serious but stable, and they are currently under observation.
