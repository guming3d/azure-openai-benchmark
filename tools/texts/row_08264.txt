chatgpt: A new swimming club, created by the same team behind Secret Cinema, will offer members the opportunity to swim in some of the world's most scenic locations. But, there's a catch: the locations will not be revealed until just moments before the event begins. The concept of the Secret Swimming club is the perfect blend of adventure and relaxation. Members will be able to explore some of the most impressive swimming locations around, with locations ranging from hidden coves to secluded lakes. The club will offer services such as fully-trained lifeguards, equipment rental, snacks and drinks, and on site changing rooms.  The club is geared towards both seasoned swimmers and those new to the sport. It will be an opportunity for members to break free from the confines of a traditional swimming pool and experience nature in a unique and refreshing way.  Membership in the Secret Swimming Club will be exclusive, with access only granted to those accepted by the Secret Swimming community. Members will have to apply for membership and meet certain criteria before being accepted. Once accepted, members will receive monthly emails with dates and locations of upcoming swimming events.  The Secret Swimming club was created by Fabien Riggall, founder of the award-wininng immersive film and theatre experience, Secret Cinema. “Swimming is one of life’s most simple pleasures and is an amazing way to improve mental and physical wellbeing. We wanted to create a club that celebrates nature and encourages people to explore their environment while promoting the benefits of open-air swimming. At the same time, the exclusivity of being invited and kept secret adds a level of excitement to the experience.” The Secret Swimming Club plans to launch its first event in the late summer of 2021, with locations to be announced just days before the event. The club is expected to have a positive impact on the swimming community, providing a unique and adventurous experience for those seeking a break from the monotony of traditional swimming pools.
