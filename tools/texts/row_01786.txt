Joseph Rich, and brothers Michael Reverdes and Steven Reverdes were all apprehended by police after the successful resolution of a dangerous situation that left one family traumatized. According to reports, the incident began when a homeowner made a frantic call to authorities, claiming that several armed individuals had entered their home and violently assaulted him, his spouse, and their stepmother.

Despite the initial confusion caused by a misdirected emergency call, police claim that their response time remained unchanged. Law enforcement officials arrived on the scene promptly and began their investigation, taking statements from the victims and scouring the area for any clues or potential suspects. After a brief pursuit, police were able to apprehend three out of the four intruders, identified as Rich and the Reverdes brothers. The fourth individual managed to escape, and authorities are currently seeking any information regarding their whereabouts.

"Somebody just came into my house, four people just came into my house, they beat the s**** out of me and my wife and my stepmother, then they robbed us," the homeowner recounted to reporters. "We were just sitting in our living room when they barged in, and it was all over so fast."

Authorities are urging anyone who may have information about the fourth suspect to come forward and assist with the ongoing investigation.
