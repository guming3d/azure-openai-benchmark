Not everyone is a naturally gifted musician - but a new invention means you no longer need to be to play a note-perfect solo on the violin. Technology lecturer Dylan Menzies has created the O-Bow, which translates data from an optical sensor and keyboard into violin music. The optical flow sensor monitors the speed and angle of a bow when it is moved across indented grooves on the top of it - much like drawing a bow across an actual violin. Scroll down to watch the video . Hitting the right notes: The O-Bow has an optical flow sensor which is 'played' with a real violin bow while a keyboard is used to choose the notes . Pitch perfect: O-Bow inventor Dylan Menzies believes that experienced keyboard players could learn how to use his system within a few minutes . A keyboard connected to the sensor is used to play the notes and choose the pitch of the music. Combined, this means the user can create music that sounds just like a violin is being played - without the need for years of practice. Multi-talented: Dylan Menzies is a technology lecturer at De Montford University but also a passionate keyboard and sax player . Mr Menzies, who is a lecturer at De Montfort University, told Wired.co.uk: 'I at one time had an obsession with Sibelius' Violin Concerto, and realised I was never going to be able to play something like that on a real violin - I'm a keyboard/sax player. 'That got me thinking about why a violin is hard, and could it be easier but still expressive? I was aware of various commercial and research devices, but nothing seemed to address the problem of electronic bowing as an instrument in its own right, rather than an effect or add-on.' The software can be used to create a . variety of sounds including ringing - the term given to describe the . sound made when a bow is removed part way through playing. It can also produce vibrato, which is a pulsating technique created by shaking the wrist. The lecturer believes a good keyboard player can learn how to use his system in just a few minutes. He . added: 'A week of practicing, you can sound pretty good. I don't think I . have mastered it yet; there is a lot of potential, even for expression . that is impossible on a real stringed instrument.' Mr Menzies has produced five prototypes and may eventually bring the instrument to market. Mr Menzies has built other laterntive instruments - including the CyberWhistle, a penny whistle modified with a windcontroller to emulate wind instruments.

chatgpt: Technology lecturer Dylan Menzies has come up with a revolutionary electronic device called the O-Bow. This device enables musicians to play musical notes with the help of a bow which is moved across an optical flow sensor, and the resulting data is then transmitted to the keyboard. The O-Bow has the potential to revolutionize the way musical instruments are played as it eliminates the use of complex finger movements to create music. This innovative device has garnered attention from musicians and music enthusiasts all over the world. It has been hailed as an excellent device for performers who are looking to create something new and interesting with their musical abilities. The O-Bow is perfect for musicians who want to experiment with new sounds and create unique compositions. One of the great things about the O-Bow is that it is easy to use. The user simply needs to move the bow across the optical flow sensor, and the resulting data is transmitted to the keyboard, which can then be used to create musical notes. The weight and pressure of the bow determine the pitch of the note, and the speed at which it is moved across the sensor determines the duration of the note. Menzies, who is a technology lecturer at a prominent university, was inspired to create the O-Bow after noticing that musicians often struggled with complex finger movements when playing certain instruments. The O-Bow eliminates this issue, and it allows musicians to focus more on musicality and expression rather than simply trying to remember where each note is located. The O-Bow is still in the prototype stage, but Menzies hopes to bring it to the market soon. He is currently seeking funding from investors and is working with musicians to refine the design, iron out any kinks and ensure that it is user-friendly. The final product is expected to be lightweight, portable and easy to use. Menzies is excited about the potential of the O-Bow and believes that it could change the way musicians approach their craft. He anticipates that the device will be particularly popular among musicians who want to challenge themselves and push the boundaries of what is possible with traditional instruments. In conclusion, the O-Bow is an exciting innovation that has the potential to change the way musical instruments are played. It simplifies the process of creating music, helping musicians to focus more on expression and creativity. While the device is still in the prototype stage, it is already generating buzz among music enthusiasts, and its inventor, Dylan Menzies, hopes to bring it to the market soon. If successful, the O-Bow could be a game-changer in the world of music.
