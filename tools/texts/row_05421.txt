article: HealthCare.gov, the problem-plagued federal online site for signing up for insurance under Obamacare, will go down for extended maintenance on Friday night and overnight ahead of Saturday's deadline to have it working for most people, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. The Obamacare question: Can the website handle the volume? The work is set to last from 9 p.m. ET Friday until 8 a.m. ET Saturday. It's not the first time the website has gone down; the administration has frequently done regular weekend maintenance, usually on Sunday mornings. During the maintenance checks, the website's application and enrollment system are unavailable, officials said. But one section of the website that verifies income and citizenship information, known as the Data Services Hub, will function as normal, according to officials. "We will be making upgrades to the system that will require more than our usual four hours to complete. We've done this on occasion in the past," a CMS official told CNN. The administration is racing toward Saturday's self-imposed deadline to get the site up and running as intended. For weeks, President Barack Obama and other officials have been saying a "vast majority" of people will start having a better experience on the federal site by November 30. It faced intense scrutiny after its botched launch on October 1, as users frequently faced crashes, error messages and delays when trying to shop or sign up for insurance. Multiple officials, however, have repeatedly said the website won't be perfect by Saturday, and some problems may remain. WH: Enroll in Obamacare, but not too fast . On the eve of the deadline, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius advised users to shop on the website during "off-peak hours," which she described as "mornings/nights/weekends" in a blog post for Huffington Post. Officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site can't handle, which is what occurred around its launch in October. HealthCare.gov was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users, and will reach that capacity by Saturday, a White House official said. However, big spikes in traffic -- such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on October 1 -- would cause users to go into a queue to receive e-mails advising them when to return, the official noted.

chatgpt: The Obama administration announced on Friday that it would be taking down the troubled HealthCare.gov website for extended maintenance from Friday night through overnight. This comes just one day before the deadline for the site to be functioning for most Americans following a series of fixes. The initial launch of HealthCare.gov in October was marred by technical glitches and errors that embarrassed President Barack Obama and his administration. The website, which was designed to allow people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, crashed repeatedly and was unable to handle the volume of traffic it was receiving. Since then, the administration has been working to fix the site and improve its functionality. Despite these efforts, the website has continued to experience problems, including long wait times and error messages. The extended maintenance that will take place on Friday night is intended to address some of these ongoing issues. According to the administration, the work will involve upgrading the site's software and hardware, as well as making changes to the site's architecture to improve its overall performance. While the administration has said that Friday's maintenance is necessary to ensure the site is working properly, it remains to be seen whether the fixes will be enough to prevent further problems. Many Americans remain frustrated with the site's performance and the difficulties they have encountered in trying to sign up for health insurance. The deadline for most Americans to enroll in health insurance through HealthCare.gov is Saturday, and it is crucial for the site to be functioning properly in order to meet this deadline. If the site is unable to handle the volume of traffic it is likely to receive, it could result in further embarrassment for the Obama administration and more frustration for Americans trying to access the site. Despite these challenges, the administration has vowed to continue working to improve HealthCare.gov and ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health insurance. Whether they will be successful in achieving this goal remains to be seen. In the meantime, many Americans will be closely watching the site over the coming days to see if the extended maintenance has been successful in addressing the site's ongoing issues. For the Obama administration, the stakes are high, and the success or failure of HealthCare.gov will be closely watched and scrutinized by both the media and the American public.
