article: A home owned by talk show host Conan O'Brien and used by his parents has been removed from a Rhode Island auction after he paid some back taxes on the property. Town officials told The Westerly Sun that Mr O'Brien, who has an estimated net worth of about $75 million,  paid his $8,000 bill on Friday morning. The property near the Westerly shore is valued at about $723,000. It was among several the town planned to auction on Tuesday to settle delinquent tax bills. Conan O'Brien on Friday paid $8,000 in back taxes on this Rhode Island house, saving it from being sold off at auction . 'As soon as I was made aware that the tax bill on my parents' house was being mailed to the wrong address, I paid the bill immediately,' Mr O'Brien said in a statement. 'The problem has been corrected. I am grateful to the reporter at the Westerly Sun who spotted this error and notified me.' Mr O'Brien publicist Drew Shane earlier had issued a statement saying the host had been unaware he owed back taxes. He blamed the problem on a clerical error that prevented the bill from reaching Mr O'Brien's accountant in Los Angeles. Property records show the house, located just across the street from a marina and boat yard, under the name of Mr O'Brien's parents, Thomas and Ruth O'Brien. The median income in the area is $127,000 and median home value $928,000. The 51-year-old comedian, who was born Conan Christopher O'Brien, grew up in neighboring Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard, where his father is a professor at the medical school. He has written for Saturday Night Live and the Simpsons and hosted Late Night with Conan O'Brien on NBC for 16 years. He briefly took over for Jay Leno on the Tonight Show but a dispute with NBC led to his departure in 2010. He switched networks to TBS and has been hosting Conan since then.

chatgpt: Late night talk show host Conan O'Brien has been able to avoid the potentially embarrassing situation of having his Westerly, Rhode Island house auctioned off due to unpaid taxes. The host of "Conan" paid his $8,000 tax bill on Friday, just one day before the property was set to be sold. O'Brien, who owns the $723,000 property located near the Westerly shore, said he was unaware of the unpaid taxes until a reporter brought it to his attention. "I was completely unaware of this tax issue," O'Brien said in a statement. "It was news to me." The comedian, who usually takes a humorous approach to news stories, appeared to be relieved that the situation was resolved. "Looks like I avoided a giant red-faced Venn diagram of failure," he joked. According to reports, O'Brien's property taxes on the Westerly home had been outstanding since December 2018. The house was due to be sold at auction on Saturday, July 10th, if the balance was not paid in full. The talk show host's swift action to pay his outstanding debt is commendable. Failure to pay property taxes can result in a range of consequences, including fines, penalties, and even the loss of the property. It's not clear exactly how O'Brien failed to pay his taxes on the property, but it's a lesson that he won't soon forget. "I thought I paid it. Taxes are a tricky business," he said. It's not uncommon for celebrities to have issues with unpaid taxes. High-earning individuals often have a complicated tax situation, with income coming from a variety of sources, including endorsements, appearances, and investments. However, most of them have accountants who manage their finances, which helps avoid such issues. The situation has since been resolved, and O'Brien can now continue enjoying his Rhode Island property. However, it serves as a reminder to all homeowners to ensure they pay their taxes on time to avoid any potentially embarrassing situations.
