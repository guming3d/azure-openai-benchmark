article: (EW.com ) -- Congratulations are in order, sorta, for Peter Jackson and his Hobbit team. According to TorrentFreak's annual list, the first film in their trilogy was downloaded well over eight million times in 2013, making it the year's most pirated movie. It wasn't, however, a runaway victory. "An Unexpected Journey" was followed closely by "Django Unchained," which has an estimated download count of 8.1 million — just 300,000 fewer than "The Hobbit," even though "The Hobbit's" worldwide box office take was more than twice what Django made. Two blockbuster sequels — "Fast and Furious 6" and "Iron Man 3" — plus a surprisingly high-performing Oscar nominee ("Silver Linings Playbook") round out the top 5. But as TorrentFreak notes, the list also holds a few surprises: Though one Jennifer Lawrence film made the list, another, much bigger one — "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" — didn't. (Maybe we can blame this on Catching Fire's November release date.) High grossers like "Man of Steel" and "Gravity" are absent as well, though "Gangster Squad," with its modest worldwide gross of $105,200,903, somehow eked out the number 7 spot. Still not as weird as last year, when "Project X" somehow reigned as the list's top movie. See below for the full top 10. Note, though, that there's no way to draw data from online streaming and cyberlocker download sources — which means that total piracy numbers are probably significantly higher than these. 1. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (estimated downloads: 8,400,000) 2. Django Unchained (estimated downloads: 8,100,000) 3. Fast And Furious 6 (estimated downloads: 7,900,000) 4. Iron Man 3 (estimated downloads: 7,600,000) 5. Silver Linings Playbook (estimated downloads: 7,500,000) 6. Star Trek Into Darkness (estimated downloads: 7,400,000) 7. Gangster Squad (estimated downloads: 7,200,000) 8. Now You See Me (estimated downloads: 7,000,000) 9. The Hangover Part 3 (estimated downloads: 6,900,000) 10.

chatgpt: According to a recent report, "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" was downloaded about 8.4 million times, making it one of the most pirated films of 2013. The report indicates that the movie was followed closely by "Django Unchained," which also had high piracy numbers. However, it is believed that the total piracy numbers for both films are likely higher than what has been reported. This news comes as a blow to the film industry, which has been working hard to combat piracy and protect their copyrights. Both "The Hobbit" and "Django Unchained" were highly anticipated films, with large budgets and significant marketing campaigns. However, the high number of pirated downloads could have a negative impact on their box office earnings. Movie piracy is a common problem around the world, with many individuals illegally downloading films and sharing them online. While some argue that piracy is a victimless crime, others believe that it harms the film industry by depriving filmmakers of revenue and undermining the creative process. Film studios have taken various measures to combat piracy, including releasing their movies in different formats and partnering with internet service providers to block illegal downloads. However, it seems that piracy remains a pervasive problem, and the film industry will continue to struggle to combat it. Despite the high piracy numbers for "The Hobbit" and "Django Unchained," both films still managed to perform well at the box office. "The Hobbit" grossed over $1 billion worldwide, while "Django Unchained" earned over $425 million. However, it is unclear how much money the studios lost due to piracy. Overall, the high piracy numbers for "The Hobbit" and "Django Unchained" is a reminder of the ongoing struggle to combat piracy in the film industry. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that this problem will persist, and the industry will need to continue to adapt to survive.
