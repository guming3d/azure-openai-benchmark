Theme park managers are taking the drastic measure of breath testing students, after too many have vomited on rollercoasters while drunk or hungover during the first week of university. But far from turning them away, Thorpe Park staff are instead happily directing those who are over the limit to the most extreme rollercoaster - which hurtles them through the air head-first at up to 60mph. It might sound like a harsh lesson, but research supported by the park has found the blast of fresh air on The Swarm is exactly what queasy guests need to settle their stomachs and avoid being sick. Staff members will now be breathalysing students and directing those over the limit to adrenaline-boosting rides to cure their hangovers . Staff have seen a massive 250 per cent increase in the number of people being sick on rides this week, as new students arrive at university for the first time and get stuck in to the infamous alcohol-fueled freshers week. The Surrey park, which is close to a number of universities,will breathalyse students to avoid an increase in ‘sick shutdowns’, on some of its most vomit-inducing rides and attractions. Those who have more than 35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath will then  be fast-tracked onto the park’s proven hangover-busting rides, and turned away from others until they are feeling perkier. The move will hopefully appease families, who will no longer be forced to wait while  rides are closed during clean-up operations. The Swarm sends riders shooting through the air head-first down a drop of 39m - but has been found to be the perfect solution to settling queasy stomachs . The research, carried out by neuropsychologist Dr David Lewis, foundthe  blast of oxygen on the high-speed Swarm improves drunk riders' metabolic rate, which boosts speeds at which toxins are broken down. Mike Vallis, divisional director of Thorpe Park, said: ‘Thorpe Park does not condone drinking and riding, however, during this Fresher’s Week period, we realise that a number of our guests do not recognise that they are suffering from the effects of the night before. ‘We felt it was our duty to ensure that all of our guests enjoy the extreme nature of our rides and by putting them on The Swarm, which is proven to be the ultimate hangover cure. ‘We are confident our guests will have a great, and hopefully vomit-free, day.’ Thorpe Park hopes the move will end years of 'sick shutdowns', which force guests to wait while rides are cleaned of vomit .

chatgpt: A local park in the heart of the city has seen a record-breaking increase of 250% in people falling sick during the infamous student 'freshers week'. The increase in sickness has alarmed both health officials and park authorities. As students from various universities settle in the city for their first year, they are bombarded with endless social events, free alcohol, and parties that often last well into the night. Freshers week is notorious for getting new students sick, with many experiencing a mix of hangovers, exhaustion, and even alcohol poisoning. The park, known for its lush greenery and tranquil atmosphere, is a popular spot for students to gather and unwind. However, in the week starting September 20, the park faced a significant increase in the number of people being rushed to the local hospital. Park authorities have expressed concerns about the state of the park after the annual onslaught of freshers week, highlighting that it takes a significant amount of time and resources to restore it back to its pristine state. In addition, park officials have had to employ extra staff to keep on top of the litter and damage left behind, which adds to the already strained budget of the park. Earlier this year, the park management invested heavily in restoring the park's infrastructure and enhancing security to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all visitors. However, the surge in sickness cases during freshers week has put a dent in these efforts. Health officials have warned students about the dangers of excessive drinking, highlighting the long-term effects it can have on their lives. Furthermore, health practitioners have urged students to take reasonable steps to ensure their safety, stay hydrated, and have a control mechanism in place to prevent over-consumption. The surge in sickness among students during freshers week is not a new phenomenon, and authorities have been working hard to address it. However, this latest surge has rung alarm bells, and health officials and park authorities are calling for greater student cooperation in taking care of themselves and the park. In response, student bodies across the city have been working to promote safer freshers week events, including educational programs on responsible drinking, harm prevention strategies, and spreading positive messages about maintaining a healthy balance during university life. Overall, the surge in sickness cases at the local park during freshers week has raised awareness of the dangers of excessive drinking, calling for greater student responsibility and cooperation in taking care of themselves and the local environment. While both health officials and park authorities have expressed concerns, the initiatives launched by various student organizations are a promising sign for a safer and healthier freshers week in the future.
