article: Two humpback whales have washed up on beaches in New South Wales in the last week. The first animal appeared between Saltwater beach and Diamond Beach, Northern Sydney, on Sunday morning. The juvenile animal was found washed up on the shore. The second animal appeared the following morning, when a larger male humpback was spotted on the rocks at Wallabi Point, on the mid north coast of Sydney. Scroll down for video . The large humpback whale appeared on the rocks at Wallabi Point, on the mid northern coast of Sydney, on Monday morning . The giant mammal was said too large to be buried locally, and was thus and transported another location . Investigations are currently under way to determine what killed the giant mammals: It is believed that a ship collision could be responsible, as well as heavy sea conditions . Rob Harcourt, a professor at Macquarie University, told Sydney Morning Herald 'I wouldn't swim next to a dead whale. It's a shark magnet.' Investigations are currently under way to determine what killed the giant mammals. It is believed that a ship collision could be responsible, as well as recent heavy seas. The burial of washed up whales can prove  challenging for local authorities. The whale at Saltwater beach was buried in the sand, while the animal on Wallabi point was determined to be  too large to for a local burial, needing to be dissected and transported to another location. Rob Harcourt, an environmental professor at Macquarie University, warns that waters around whale bodies can be 'a shark magnet' Larger whales can weigh up to 60 tonnes, posing a serious challenge to authorities hoping to dispose of their bodies . Geoffrey Ross, a wildlife management officer with the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that 8-10 stranded whales will appear on beaches in New South Wales in an average year . Geoffrey Ross, a wildlife management officer with the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that 8-10 stranded whales will appear on beaches in New South Wales in an average year. Mr Ross said the procedure to deal with whale bodies has changed in recent years, with wildlife authorities no longer taking them out to sea any more. Burying the animals on the beach is only viable with smaller whales. Larger humpback whales can weigh up to 60 tonnes, posing a serious challenge to authorities looking to bury the animals.

chatgpt: Two dead whales have washed up on two different beaches in New South Wales, Australia, within a day. The first one appeared on Saltwater beach in north Sydney on Sunday, while the second was spotted the following morning on Wallabi Point. According to local authorities, the smaller animal, identified as a Risso's dolphin, was buried on Saltwater beach shortly after its discovery. However, the larger whale, which was about 12 metres long, was cut up into pieces and transported to another location for further examination. Rob Harcourt, a professor from Macquarie University, warned that the waters around the dead whales could attract sharks, making it dangerous for people to swim. He further stated that it is not uncommon for sharks to be drawn to whales that are dead or dying. "Smaller sharks can feed off the soft tissue, while larger sharks might be curious about the dead carcass," he explained. The cause of the whales' deaths is still unknown, and investigations are currently underway to determine what happened. Initial reports suggest that both animals had been injured and had signs of possible boat strikes. However, marine biologists are yet to confirm these speculations. Whale strandings are not uncommon in Australian waters, with dozens of incidents occurring each year in different regions. These incidents can be attributed to several causes, including natural factors such as illness or injuries, as well as human activities such as fishing and shipping. The mammals play a critical role in the marine ecosystem, and their decline has significant impacts on the ocean's health. Therefore, the Australian government has been investing in various conservation efforts to protect marine life in the region, including whales. Despite these efforts, the number of whale strandings has continued to rise, highlighting the urgent need for more comprehensive measures to safeguard their wellbeing. This latest incident serves as a reminder of the crucial role we must all play in protecting our oceans and the creatures that call them home. In conclusion, the discovery of two dead whales on different beaches in New South Wales has raised concerns about marine conservation efforts in the region. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of death, while scientists have warned of the potential risks of swimming near the dead carcasses. It is hoped that the authorities can take necessary measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future and safeguard the wellbeing of marine creatures in the region.
