article: (Cover Media) -- Kanye West claims his appearances on girlfriend Kim Kardashian's reality show are "all for love." It was rumored he decided against appearing on the show because he's vehemently against sharing his private life with the public. The rapper has been featured on "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" only a few times since being in a relationship with Kim. West confirms he takes his romance seriously, and is not looking for more publicity. "Oh, that's just all for love. It's simply that," he told W magazine. "At a certain point, or always, love is more important than any branding, or any set of cool people, or attempting to impress anyone. Because true love is just the way you feel. Thoughts and feelings can disagree sometimes." The rapper has advised the mother of his newborn daughter, North West, on many of her outfits since they became a couple, and some of those style choices have been publicly criticized. "For her to take that risk in front of the world, it just shows you how much she loves me," he explained. "And how much she actually loves the opportunity to learn. ... You got, like, a million companies saying, 'This is impacting your brand! This is impacting your fans! And blah blah blah.' But she still sees this light of beauty." As for West reportedly controlling her look since they started dating, he explained that's not possible. "Nobody can tell my girl what to do," he commented. "She just needed to be given some platforms of information to work from. .. One beautiful thing is that as she discovers it, the world discovers it." The couple welcomed their first child together, daughter North, on June 15. Courtesy of Cover Media .
