article: (CNN) -- Some major websites went dark briefly Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET as part of a national moment of silence for the victims of last week's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Dozens of sites participated, including Aol, The Huffington Post and Digg, and more than 100,000 people and sites have pledged to participate on the Causes.com page for the Web Goes Silent campaign. People and companies are also spreading the word by tweeting their intention to go quiet with the hashtag #momentforSandyHook. High-profile Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ron Conway promoted the online moment of silence, which is part of a larger campaign for federal gun control legislation. Conway is leading the Causes.com campaign along with other big names including Ryan Seacrest, Jack Dorsey, Britney Spears, MC Hammer, Suze Orman and Tyler Florence. Causes.com is a startup that uses social media to raise awareness and funds for charities and causes. Conway is also an investor in the for-profit company. Sites that participated in Friday's moment of silence were invited to do so on their own, or it can embed an official badge with a green ribbon on their sites. Sites using the code appeared grayed out in the background with a white box in the foreground that reads "We are observing a National Moment of Silence for the victims of the Sandy Hook tragedy." Conway joined other tech notables and some celebrities to demand action for stronger gun control in a full-page ad in the Wednesday print edition of the New York Times. The ad was run by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a lobbying group of more than 700 U.S. mayors. It started the Demand A Plan campaign to reform gun laws after the Aurora, Colorado, shootings in July, and it has seen a surge in new support after the Sandy Hook shootings. This is not the first time major sites have banded together to go dark for a cause. This year, major tech names staged an immense and successful online protest against the Stop Online Privacy Act.

chatgpt: Yesterday marked the seventh anniversary of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. In honor of the victims, several major websites went dark for the day. At 9:30 a.m. ET, a moment of silence was observed to honor the 26 innocent lives lost on that day. The blackout was organized by the group "Sandy Hook Promise," a non-profit organization founded by family members of the victims. In addition to the website blackout, the group also launched a campaign to encourage people to make a personal promise to take action against gun violence. Many of the websites that participated in the blackout were popular news and media outlets. The Huffington Post, MTV, and Giphy were just a few of the sites that joined the cause. This marks the seventh year in a row that these websites have gone dark in memory of the shooting. Some backers of the blackout are also part of a larger campaign for stronger gun control. This includes stricter background checks and a ban on assault weapons. While progress has been made in some states, there is still a long way to go in terms of creating meaningful change on a national level. The issue of gun control remains a highly divisive topic in the United States, with some arguing that it is their constitutional right to own firearms. However, many who advocate for stronger gun control laws argue that the right to bear arms should not come at the expense of innocent lives. While the Sandy Hook shooting was a tragedy that shook the nation, it also served as a catalyst for change. The families of the victims have become vocal advocates for gun control, and their efforts have not gone unnoticed. As the nation continues to grapple with the issue of gun violence, events like the website blackout serve as a reminder of the work that still needs to be done. As the day came to a close, the moment of silence was observed once again to remember the victims of Sandy Hook. While their lives were cut tragically short, their memories will live on as a call to action for a safer future.
