article: (CNN) -- Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has rejected reports that the elite motorsport's owner CVC Capital Partners may sell up. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is lining up a bid along with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, according to Sky News -- which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp. But the 80-year-old Ecclestone, who runs F1 on behalf of CVC since selling his rights to the private equity firm in 2006, said such a deal would not be in the commercial interests of the sport. "Formula One is not for sale. And, anyway, we would not sell to a media company because it would restrict the ability to negotiate with other broadcasters," he told British newspaper The Times on Wednesday. Ecclestone, who first secured the rights to negotiate television contracts for races in the late 1970s, said News Corp had not made any approach to CVC. "If they were interested for sure they would have called me and they haven't," he told Bloomsberg. "If someone was to come along with an enormous offer, a lot more than it were worth, then they have to look at it. They have never talked about selling, though." The current Concorde Agreement between the F1 teams expires next year, and Ferrari -- one of eight marques on the grid who made a failed breakaway bid in 2009 before signing the deal -- is reportedly among the parties seeking to wrest control of the sport from Ecclestone. The British entrepreneur has been helping German prosecutors investigating Gerhard Gribkowsky, who handled F1's sale to CVC five years ago. Gribkowsky, who has been arrested under suspicion of fraud, is a former employee of state-run BayernLB -- which had a stake in Formula One up to 2006. "I have been co-operating with the State Prosecution Office's investigation of the affairs of Dr. Gribkowsky since the outset," Ecclestone said in a statement last week. "When I was informed that there was a first suspicion in relation to my perceived involvement in the matter, I went to see the Senior State Prosecutor and her team in Munich earlier this month to clear up any allegations against me. "I am confident that when the full facts have been established, I will be exonerated of blame for any wrongdoing."

chatgpt: Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is reportedly interested in buying the rights to Formula One racing, but the elite motorsport's boss Bernie Ecclestone insists the owner, CVC, will not sell. Despite this, News Corp remains interested in acquiring the rights to the prestigious racing series. However, Ecclestone has expressed concern that a media company such as News Corp would not be a suitable buyer for the sport. News Corp, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, is a global media giant that owns a range of newspapers, TV channels, and other media outlets. The company has reportedly been eyeing the rights to Formula One for some time now, as it looks to expand its interests in the sports world. However, Ecclestone has been vocal about his opposition to the idea of a media company taking over the rights to the sport. Ecclestone, who has been the boss of Formula One for over 30 years, has been aiding German authorities in a probe of the man who helped him sell the sport in 2006. The investigation is focused on whether Ecclestone paid a bribe to secure the sale of the racing series to CVC. Ecclestone has denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation has raised concerns among Formula One fans and observers about the integrity of the sport. Despite the investigation and Ecclestone's opposition, News Corp is reportedly still interested in acquiring the rights to Formula One. The company sees the sport as an important part of its global media portfolio and is said to be willing to spend a significant amount to secure the rights. However, Ecclestone is not convinced that a media company would make a suitable buyer. He has expressed concerns that a company like News Corp would be more interested in using the sport as a platform for its own brands and interests rather than nurturing the sport itself. The rumoured interest from News Corp comes at a time when the future of Formula One is uncertain. The sport has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to the cancellation or postponement of several races this year. At the same time, there is growing concern among fans and teams that the sport is becoming too commercialised and losing its traditional charm. Despite these challenges, Formula One remains one of the world's most popular and prestigious motorsport series. With News Corp reportedly interested in buying the rights, the future of the sport could be about to change significantly. Whether Ecclestone's concerns about a media company taking over the sport will be enough to put off potential buyers, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the world of Formula One is never short on drama and excitement.
