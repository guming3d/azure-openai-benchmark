article: (CNN) -- Jenni-Lynn Watson's shorthand while sending text messages came back to haunt the young man who pleaded guilty Tuesday in Syracuse, New York, to killing the college student, a prosecutor said. Although the 20-year-old victim's cell phone was never found, investigators were able to review call and text messages made by Watson and Steven Pieper, the man she was breaking up with, Onondaga County District William Fitzpatrick told CNN. After dumping Watson's body, Pieper, 21, tried to cover up by texting a mutual friend of theirs, pretending to be Watson, Fitzpatrick said. Using the letters "GTG" apparently did him in. Police looked at Pieper's phone, which was left November 19, 2010, at Watson's home in the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool, and pored over records, Fitzpatrick said. That shorthand for "got to go" was a term used by Pieper, not Watson, the prosecutor said. Pieper pleaded guilty in Onondaga County Court to second-degree murder in the strangling of Watson. Rather than 25 years to life, a plea agreement calls for him to receive a sentence of 23 years to life at the March 8 sentencing, Fitzpatrick said, adding Pieper must serve 23 years before he gets a parole hearing. "Steven made it clear that he did not want to put the Watson family or his family through a trial in this matter, from the very beginning," defense attorney Scott Brenneck told CNN affiliate YNN. "So after a review of the case, it was an appropriate way to resolve it." CNN left messages for Brenneck on Tuesday. In late November, a massive search for Watson, a dance major, ended with the discovery of her remains at Clay Central Park in North Syracuse, the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office said. Watson and Pieper had dated on and off for 18 months and Pieper went over to Watson's home the morning of Nov. 19, authorities said. "I don't think he went over there with the intent to kill her," said Fitzpatrick, adding Pieper was there about two hours. At some point the young woman told Pieper she wanted to have other relationships and he became angry and killed her, the district attorney said. The suspect allegedly placed Watson's body in her car and drove off, only to be stopped several minutes later because there was no front license plate on his vehicle, Fitzpatrick said. Pieper, who received a warning, decided then to dump the body, he said. "He didn't have a long-term plan," the prosecutor said. "On that particular day he was consumed with evil and he killed that poor little girl than no other reason than she wanted to move on with her life," Fitzpatrick told reporters after the hearing. Pieper initially denied involvement, Fitzpatrick said. The case against Pieper was "strong" and Watson's family supported the plea, he said. Watson was last seen at her family's home. She was on Thanksgiving break from Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a tragic turn of events, a man named Steven Pieper has pleaded guilty to the murder of his girlfriend, Jenni-Lynn Watson. According to prosecutors, Pieper strangled Watson in her family's home in Liverpool, New York during Thanksgiving break while she was trying to end their relationship. Watson, a college student, had gone missing after the incident, prompting a massive search effort that lasted for weeks. It was a disheartening time for her family and loved ones, who held on to the hope that she would be found safe and sound. However, their hopes were shattered when Watson's body was discovered in a park near her home just a few days before Christmas. The discovery sent shock waves through the community, and pieced together the unfortunate events leading up to her death. Pieper, who was 21 at the time of the crime, was charged with second-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison. He initially pleaded not guilty to the charges but later changed his plea to guilty on the advice of his attorney. According to reports, Pieper and Watson had been in a relationship for a few years but had recently hit a rough patch. Watson had decided to break things off with Pieper during the Thanksgiving break, an event that triggered him to act violently. During the sentencing hearing, Watson's family expressed their sorrow and grief over the loss of their loved one. Her mother, Julie Watson, read a powerful statement in court, saying, "Steven Pieper, you took my reason for living away from me…There is nothing you can say or do that can bring her back.” Pieper, meanwhile, expressed his remorse for his actions and apologized to Watson's family. "I can’t express enough how sorry I am for what I’ve done," he said. The judge presiding over the case sentenced Pieper to 23 years to life in prison, taking into account his guilty plea and cooperation with authorities. While the sentencing brings some sense of closure to the case, it's a stark reality of the consequences of domestic violence and the importance of seeking help and support when in abusive relationships. As the community mourns the loss of Jenni-Lynn Watson, her family hopes that her story will serve as a reminder of the importance of standing up against domestic violence and seeking help when faced with abuse. The tragic story serves as a stark reminder of how quickly situations can spiral out of control and the importance of seeking help and support when in need.
