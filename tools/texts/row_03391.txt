article: (CNN) -- An internationally renowned paleontologist will plead guilty to stealing dinosaur bones from federal land, his attorneys said in a court filing. Paleontologist Nate Murphy is expected to plead guilty to stealing fossils from federal land. Nate Murphy, whose famous finds include Leonardo, one of the best-preserved dinosaurs in the world, will make that plea in federal court in Billings, Montana. Earlier this month, Murphy pleaded guilty to state charges of stealing a fossil from private land in order to sell it. An expert cited in that case said Murphy's find was worth between $150,000 and $400,000. The self-taught dinosaur expert, who is director of vertebrate paleontology at the Judith River Dinosaur Institute, could face jail time. Murphy and his attorney did not immediately respond to phone messages Friday from CNN. Jessica Fehr, lead prosecutor in the case, said the U.S. Attorney's Office would not comment until after the plea is entered. In court papers, federal prosecutors say Murphy knowingly took fossils from federal property between about August 2006 and August 2007. The "paleontological resources" were said to be worth at least $1,000. In the state case, Murphy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of theft. As part of the plea, the state recommended Murphy's sentence be deferred for five years. Douglas Erwin, president of The Paleontological Society and curator of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said "theft of fossils from pubic lands has long been a problem." In a written statement sent to CNN on Friday, he said such thefts "can often result in the loss of important scientific information and the disappearance of specimens that belong to the public. "At the same time, however, fossil collecting, particularly of common invertebrate fossils, has been a pastime enjoyed by many for decades, and is an important way of connecting people with their natural heritage." An omnibus public lands bill, which the U.S. Senate passed Thursday, includes penalties for fossil theft from public land.

chatgpt: Well-known paleontologist Nate Murphy, who has made significant fossil discoveries, will plead guilty to stealing dinosaur bones from federal lands in Montana, according to his attorney. Murphy, who is affiliated with the Judith River Dinosaur Institute, allegedly took the fossils from public lands in the state. The exact location and the number of fossils stolen have not been disclosed. The theft of fossils from public lands is a long-standing problem, according to the Smithsonian. The department has previously warned that uncontrolled excavation on federal lands can lead to the destruction of significant scientific and cultural resources, and can undermine future discoveries. However, Murphy's case is particularly notable because of his stature in the scientific community. He has conducted extensive research on the evolution of dinosaurs and has contributed significantly to the field of paleontology. His discoveries have been cited in numerous academic publications and have been featured in prominent scientific journals. The theft of fossils by researchers is a controversial issue in the scientific community. Some argue that it is necessary to study fossils in order to advance scientific knowledge, while others believe that it is important to preserve public lands for future generations. Murphy's attorney has not disclosed what punishment his client will receive as a result of his guilty plea. However, he did express regret for Murphy's actions, stating that he "acted out of a misguided sense of excitement." The Judith River Dinosaur Institute has also issued a statement expressing disappointment in Murphy's behavior. The institute emphasized that it is dedicated to responsible scientific and educational activities related to paleontology and that it does not condone theft or other illegal activities. The case has raised important questions about the protection of public lands and the responsible conduct of scientific research. It remains to be seen what the long-term impact of Murphy's actions will be on the field of paleontology and on the protection of the country's natural resources.
