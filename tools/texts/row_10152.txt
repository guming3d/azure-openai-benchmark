chatgpt: Adele Shrimpton, a resident of northern New South Wales, is calling for the authorities to investigate a mystery creature that attacked her while she was swimming in the Tweed River. Shrimpton was bitten by the unknown creature and is now looking for answers as to what the creature could be. Locals of the Tweed River area are baffled by the incident, claiming that the river is home to normal estuary fish only. Shrimpton, however, is convinced that the creature that attacked her was something she had never seen before. In an interview with local news, Shrimpton described the attack: "I felt a sharp pain in my leg and then looked down to see the creature biting onto my skin. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before." Shrimpton was able to swim back to shore and seek medical attention, but is now left with questions about the mystery creature. She is urging local authorities to investigate the attack and determine what kind of creature could be lurking in the river. Experts have weighed in on the situation, stating that it is possible that the creature could be a bull shark, which is known to swim in estuaries and rivers. However, locals are skeptical, as bull sharks are usually easily recognizable by their markings and behavior. Local fishing guides have also commented on the situation, stating that they have never seen anything out of the ordinary in the Tweed River before. Many are calling for more research to be done in the area to determine if there are any unusual creatures present. The incident has left many residents of the area concerned about the safety of swimming in the Tweed River.

"If there's something out there that could hurt people, we need to know what it is and how to stay safe." As the investigation into the mystery creature continues, locals are urged to remain cautious when swimming in the Tweed River.
