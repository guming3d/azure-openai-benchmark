article: Strippers have been awarded $10.9 million by a federal judge who found they had been denied tips and forced to pay for the privilege of working. Rick's Cabaret in New York City's Midtown collected $2 of every $20 the girls earned in tips, a federal court heard. And bosses demanded $60 from each girl every shift in exchange for letting them take to the pole. Payout: A federal judge has awarded dancers from Rick's Cabaret in New York's Midtown $10.9 million . On Friday, Manhattan Federal Court Judge Paul Engelmayer published a 51-page ruling, slamming the club for misleading customers and depriving employees of their due salaries. The action was brought on behalf of some 2,000 dancers employed at the club - owned by Peregrine Enterprises Inc, a unit of RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc - going back to 2005. The award is short of the $18.8 million in damages the dancers sought, and the judge left the balance to be decided at a trial. The date will be set shortly, the court order said. In a September 2013 ruling, Engelmayer sided with the plaintiffs, saying Rick's Cabaret exercised so much control over the dancers that they were actually employees subject to the club's rules and could not make independent decisions about their work. The only payment the dancers received was in the form of tips for dances, which normally amounted to around $20. 'Unfair': 2,000 strippers filed the case which said they were forced to hand over tips and pay to dance . Defending, the club said the strippers were obliged to pay 'performance fees'. This included $20 per dance or semi-private performance, where they charge a minimum of $100 for 15 minutes and up to $400 for an hour. However, Engelmayer slammed the defense, saying a 'reasonable customer would have understood the performance fees which customers paid dancers as gratuities belonging to particular dancers, not as service charges belonging to the club.' RCI Hospitality, Rick's Cabaret's parent company, dismissed the ruling as 'flawed'.

chatgpt: A federal judge has just awarded $10.9 million to around 2,000 dancers of Rick’s Cabaret, a New York's Midtown strip club that failed to pay its employees' wages while also demanding a portion of their tips. The club required dancers to give $2 of every $20 tip and forced them to shell out $60 a shift.  In a scathing ruling, the judge criticized Rick’s Cabaret for its “deceptive practices” that led dancers to believe they were independent contractors and, thus, not entitled to hourly pay. The club allegedly also misled dancers, promising wages and then reneging when they showed up for work.  “Rick’s Cabaret made millions of dollars by misleading these women and then taking advantage of them,” said the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Mark Fistos. “The court’s ruling sends a clear message that this type of exploitation will not be tolerated.” The lawsuit, which began in 2009, claimed that Rick’s Cabaret deprived dancers of minimum wage, which the club denied. The court, however, saw through the club’s defense and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The judge deemed the club’s $2 tip-out policy and $60-per-shift fee as illegal because the club also retained the power to terminate dancers on the spot if they refused to comply with these rules.
 
According to Fistos, the dancers were performing the same functions as any other employee of a business, and should be treated as such. The judge agreed, and now the plaintiffs will be compensated for their unpaid wages. “The women who brought this case forward were brave to stand up for their rights and the rights of their fellow workers,” Fistos said. “Their determination has finally paid off.” The case has highlighted the plight of dancers working at strip clubs across the country, many of whom are not paid hourly wages and rely solely on tips. The ruling in this case may set a precedent for other similar legal disputes, and could bring about greater fairness for those who work in the adult entertainment industry.
