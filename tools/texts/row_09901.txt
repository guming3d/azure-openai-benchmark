article: Facebook is treating their on-site bus drivers like 'servants,' according to a local workers union. The social media giant employs drivers to take their staff on shuttle-buses to their Silicon Valley HQ, but are accused of paying them so little they cannot afford to live in the area. The drivers are now hoping to unionize and join the local Teamsters enclave in order to force Facebook to cut a better deal with the contractor they work for. Unliked: A sign with the 'like' symbol stands in front of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, where bus drivers are now trying to unionize for better working conditions . The bus drivers take Facebook's employees to the officers in Menlo Park, California, but are employed by a contractor, Loop Transportation. The local Teamsters union has written an open letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on behalf of the drivers, accusing Facebook of behaving like the days of Downton Abbey. 'While your employees earn extraordinary wages and are able to live and enjoy life in some of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the Bay Area, these drivers can’t afford to support a family, send their children to school or, least of all, afford to even dream of buying a house anywhere near where they work,' Teamsters official, Rome Aloise said in the letter published by the New York Times. 'It is reminiscent of a time when noblemen were driven around in their coaches by their servants. 'Frankly, little has changed; except the noblemen are your employees, and the servants are the bus drivers who carry them back and forth each day.' The local Teamsters union has written an open letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on behalf of the drivers, accusing Facebook of behaving like the days of Downton Abbey . Most of the drivers employed by Loop for Facebook earn $18-$20 per hour and work split shifts. This means starting at 6am to shuttle workers in to the Menlo Park offices until 11am, and then a six hour break until it is time to take the Facevook employees home again. The drivers complain that as they cannot afford to live in the area, their homes are too far away for them to go home on their break, and are hoping to negotiate new shift hours. Mr Aloise told the NY Times that he hopes to help the Facebook drivers first and then move on to broker similar deals with drivers working for Google, Apple and other Silicon Valley giants.

chatgpt: Facebook's notorious reputation for exploiting its workers extends beyond its headquarters' office buildings and extends to its bus drivers. The company recently came under fire from the Teamsters Local 853 union for how it treats its drivers, who are responsible for transporting employees to and from Facebook's Menlo Park campus. The union has accused the company of treating bus drivers like "servants." According to the union, the bus drivers are so poorly paid that they can barely support their families. While Facebook employees receive generous compensation packages, the drivers' wages are well below what those working in the tech industry earn. Moreover, the significant expenses associated with the drivers' jobs, such as fuel, insurance, and maintenance, primarily fall on the drivers themselves. Thus, despite their critical role in ensuring that Facebook's employees get to work, they don't have the level of financial security required to cover basic necessities. The disparity in compensation has resulted in an increasingly antipathetic divide between Facebook's drivers and the tech industry's well-paid employees. According to Teamsters Local 853, "Facebook completely and utterly devalues the workers that help make [its] business model possible." Facebook maintains that it values the drivers and identifies them as an essential part of the company's workforce. However, the reality seems to be quite different. Many drivers report having to work 16-hour shifts to make ends meet, which has a severe impact on their physical and emotional health. They also lack basic benefits such as health care, paid time off, or sick leave, which adds to their financial instability. The Teamsters Local 853 has launched a campaign to improve the working conditions of Facebook's bus drivers. The campaign includes protests outside Facebook headquarters, where drivers and their supporters gather to voice their concerns. While the union has had some success in improving working conditions for the drivers, they are still calling for greater benefits, higher wages, and more respect from Facebook and the tech industry as a whole. Tech companies like Facebook, Uber, and Lyft have come under increasing pressure in recent years for their exploitative business models that benefit investors and shareholders but leave workers struggling to make a living. The plight of Facebook's bus drivers serves as a stark reminder of the significant inequalities that underpin the tech industry's success. Until companies begin to treat all workers fairly, the divide between tech employees and their counterparts will only widen.
