chatgpt: Arsenal fans will be excited to hear that the Gunners are set to re-sign former striker Carlos Vela. The Mexican forward joined Arsenal in 2006 with high hopes, but he failed to break through into the first team. During his time with Arsenal, Vela only managed to score 11 goals before being loaned out four times. After a loan spell with Sociedad in 2011, Vela made the move permanent in 2012. Last season, the 25-year-old enjoyed an impressive campaign, scoring a total of 16 goals, attracting the attention of Arsenal. According to reports, Arsenal will use their buy-back clause to sign Vela on the cheap. The clause allows Arsenal to re-sign the striker for a pre-agreed fee, which is believed to be in the region of £3.5 million. Arsenal’s decision to exercise their buy-back option is not surprising, given Vela’s recent form. The striker has been in excellent form for Sociedad and has been one of La Liga’s top performers in recent seasons. Arsenal’s attacking options have been limited in recent years, and Vela could help to improve the team’s goal-scoring prowess. Vela has never hidden his affection for Arsenal, and he recently spoke about his desire to play for the club once again. Speaking to BBC Sport, he said, “I always said that I would like to play for Arsenal again. It might be a possibility in the future.” Arsenal’s decision to re-sign Vela is likely to be welcomed by the club’s fans, who have been frustrated by the team’s lack of goals in recent seasons. The Gunners finished last season in sixth place, and the addition of Vela could provide a much-needed boost to the team’s attacking options. Overall, the news of Carlos Vela’s imminent return to Arsenal is sure to be met with excitement from the club’s supporters. With the striker in impressive form and Arsenal lacking attacking options, it seems like a wise move for the Gunners to exercise their buy-back option.
