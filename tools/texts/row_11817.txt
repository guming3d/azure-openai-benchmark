chatgpt: Cesc Fabregas has cemented his position as one of the most prolific assist providers in the history of the Premier League. On Saturday, he registered his 15th assist of the season in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Swansea City, becoming the first player in the league's history to achieve at least 15 assists in two separate seasons.  Fabregas has been in sensational form this season, providing a constant supply of defence-splitting passes to set up his team-mates. His 15th assist came in the 38th minute of the game against Swansea, when he played a delightful through ball to Pedro, who made no mistake with his finish.  The Spanish midfielder's achievement is all the more remarkable given that he achieved a similar feat with his former club Arsenal back in the 2007-08 season. In that campaign, he registered a whopping 17 assists, earning plaudits from fans and pundits alike for his creative genius.  Fabregas has been an integral part of Chelsea's title-winning campaign this year, providing the ammunition for his team-mates to score the goals that have propelled the Blues to the top of the table. His vision, range of passing and ability to unlock defences have been crucial to Chelsea's success, and he has proved to be a key asset for manager Antonio Conte.  Going forward, Fabregas will be looking to add to his impressive tally of assists and help Chelsea finish the season on a high. He has shown that he is still one of the best playmakers in the game, and his contribution to Chelsea's title-winning campaign cannot be overstated.  Meanwhile, Chelsea fans will be eagerly anticipating news on potential transfer targets as the summer transfer window approaches. Reports suggest that the club is looking to bring in a number of high-profile players to bolster their squad ahead of a return to Champions League football next season.  Despite their success this year, Chelsea will need to strengthen their squad if they are to challenge on multiple fronts next season. With the likes of Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham and Liverpool all expected to spend big this summer, the battle for supremacy in the Premier League promises to be more intense than ever before.  In conclusion, Cesc Fabregas has achieved something truly remarkable in becoming the first player to register at least 15 assists in two separate Premier League seasons. His creative genius has been a key component of Chelsea's title-winning campaign, and he will be looking to add to his tally of assists as the season draws to a close.
