article: (CNN) -- Sports reporter Erin Andrews has filed a lawsuit alleging the hotels where a peephole stalker secretly videotaped her were negligent, according to a statement from the law firm representing her. The lawsuit also accuses Michael David Barrett, who has pleaded guilty to stalking the ESPN reporter, of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The suit, filed Thursday, alleges that Barrett received information from hotels when he called them to see if Andrews had made reservations to stay there. "Not only did the hotels confirm that Ms. Andrews was intending to register as a guest, but they also released, without Ms. Andrews' consent, her room number. The hotels then provided Michael David Barrett a hotel room immediately adjacent to hers," the statement from law firm Greene, Broilett & Wheeler said. Hotels named as defendants in the civil suit include Marriott International Inc. and Radisson Hotels International Inc. Representatives from those companies did not immediately return requests for comment. "Although I'll never be able to fully erase the impact that this invasion of privacy has had upon me and my family, I do hope that my experience will cause the hospitality industry to be more vigilant in protecting its guests from the time they reserve a hotel room until they check out," Andrews said in a statement Thursday. She said she filed the lawsuit "to hold accountable those who put my personal safety at risk and who allowed my privacy to be invaded while I was a guest at their hotel, as well as for actually stalking me and making my most personal moments public." Barrett pleaded guilty to a federal stalking charge in December 2009 after prosecutors accused him of altering hotel peepholes so he could shoot video of Andrews while she was nude. In court papers, prosecutors stated that Barrett -- an insurance company employee from Westmont, Illinois -- posted as many as 10 videos of Andrews to the internet. In March, a federal judge in Los Angeles, California, sentenced Barrett to two and a half years in prison. Andrews' civil suit, filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, accuses the hotels of negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy.

chatgpt: Erin Andrews, a popular ESPN reporter, is suing the hotels where a man recorded nude videos of her, claiming that they were negligent in allowing her privacy to be invaded. Andrews also alleges that stalker Michael D. Barrett, who recorded the videos, inflicted emotional distress upon her.  The lawsuit, which was filed in 2011, accused several hotels of allowing Barrett to book rooms next to Andrews and failing to properly ensure her safety and privacy. The incident occurred in 2008, when Barrett filmed Andrews through the peephole of her hotel room door. The videos were later posted online, resulting in widespread public attention and distress for Andrews. Barrett, who pleaded guilty to stalking Andrews earlier this year, was sentenced to 30 months in prison. Andrews' lawsuit seeks damages for emotional distress, injury to reputation, and economic losses. The trial is set to begin in 2017, potentially reshaping hotel industry privacy policies in regards to guests. Andrews has been vocal about the traumatic impact of the incident on her life, both personally and professionally. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2010, Andrews stated, "This happens to other people, and they don't have to talk about it... [but] I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to make it a point to make this girl good again." Since then, Andrews has become an advocate for victims of stalking and invasion of privacy, speaking out about the issue and pushing for stronger legal protections. The case has garnered significant attention, with many legal experts and privacy advocates debating the responsibility of hotels in ensuring guest safety and privacy. Some argue that the hotels should have had more strict security protocols in place to prevent Barrett from filming Andrews, while others suggest that Barrett's actions were solely his own responsibility. Regardless of the outcome, the case highlights the importance of privacy protections and the potential consequences of hotel negligence. Andrews has bravely taken a stand for her own rights and those of others, pushing for justice and accountability in the face of a difficult and traumatic situation.
