article: (CNN) -- The nation's best military fliers have had their wings clipped, thanks to the forced spending cuts imposed on the federal government this year. The U.S. Navy on Tuesday announced it was canceling all the air shows its Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Squadron had scheduled for the rest of the year. The Navy action follows the Air Force's April 1 announcement that its Thunderbirds team would not perform again this year. "Recognizing budget realities, current Defense policy states that outreach events can only be supported with local assets at no cost to the government," said a statement Tuesday from the office of the Commander Naval Air Forces in San Diego. "This is one of many steps the Navy is taking to ensure resources are in place to support forces operating forward now and those training to relieve them." The Navy, Air Force and the rest of the federal government must deal with $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends September 30, that were mandated by a 2011 agreement by Congress that raised the federal debt ceiling.

The cuts targeted agencies and programs dear to Democrats, such as education, and also went after Republican priorities, including the military.

The next performance still on the schedule would have been at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on May 22, part of the graduation festivities at the academy. The Navy said the Blue Angels will continue to train at their base in Pensacola, Florida, for when the budget crunch ends. "The Navy believes there is value in demonstrating the professionalism and capabilities of our Navy and Marine Corps Naval Aviation team, thus inspiring future generations of Sailors and Marines. The Navy intends to continue aerial demonstrations in the future as the budget situation permits," the service's statement said. FAA delays closures of 149 control towers .

chatgpt: In 2013, the US Navy's famous Blue Angels were scheduled to perform in 32 shows throughout the United States. However, this number was significantly reduced due to federal spending cuts, which caused many air shows to be cancelled. Meanwhile, the Air Force's Thunderbirds squad lost more than two dozen of their own shows. The decision to cancel many air shows was made due to the severe budget cuts made by the federal government in response to the economic downturn of the time. These cuts meant that the US military was forced to cut back on non-essential activities, which included air shows and public demonstrations by their elite flying squads.  According to reports, the cost of hosting an air show on a military base can be as much as $100,000, with much of that money going towards fuel and maintenance for the aircraft. With federal funding becoming more scarce, the cost of hosting these shows was simply too much of a financial burden for some bases to bear. Despite the cancellations, both the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds continued to perform in some locations in 2013. They also adapted to the budget cuts by reducing their operating costs and finding ways to be more efficient with their resources.  The Blue Angels, in particular, found creative ways to maintain their presence at air shows. They reduced the number of aircraft used in their performances and cut back on training flights to conserve fuel. They also continued to participate in community outreach programs, such as visiting schools and hospitals, to maintain their connection with the public even when they couldn't perform in large-scale shows. As for the Thunderbirds, they faced an even tougher situation. With the loss of more than two dozen shows, they were forced to cancel their entire European tour for the year. This was a significant blow for the team, as they had been looking forward to showcasing their skills in front of international audiences. Despite these setbacks, both the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds remain popular and important parts of the US military's outreach efforts. Through their performances and community involvement, they help to boost morale and forge connections with the public. Though they may face occasional budget cuts and cancellations, their importance as ambassadors for the military remains unchanged.
