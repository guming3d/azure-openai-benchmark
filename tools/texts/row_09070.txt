Hopkins was not seriously hurt. But after the incident during the Nov. 17 Bills-New York Jets game, he lost his job in advertising and public relations and was banned from the stadium. Defense attorney Patrick Brown said,'It was an accident and it was something that he should have not done obviously, but the time he was doing it he didn't perceive the risks.'

Michael Drmacich said, 'It's great to have video evidence of a crime taking place, making it a lot easier as a prosecutor,' reported WGRZ.

chatgpt: Robert Hopkins of Buffalo has been found guilty of third-degree assault and second-degree reckless endangerment following a three-day trial. The jury came to the decision on Thursday after hearing the testimony of witnesses, including the victim Mark Bratcher. The incident in question occurred on a construction site in downtown Buffalo in May of last year. Hopkins had been working on a scaffold when he lost his footing and fell 20 to 25 feet. Unfortunately, he landed on Bratcher, causing injuries to the man's head, neck and back. During the trial, the prosecution argued that Hopkins had been reckless in his actions, putting both himself and those around him in danger. They maintained that he had been under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident and that this had contributed to his careless behavior. The defense, on the other hand, argued that the fall had been an accident and that Hopkins had not acted with criminal intent. They attempted to paint him as a skilled and dedicated worker who had simply made a mistake. In the end, it was the prosecution's arguments that won out. The jury convicted Hopkins on both counts, meaning he could face up to a year in jail when he is sentenced on Sept. 11. Bratcher, who has been unable to work since the incident, expressed relief at the verdict. "I'm just glad that justice has been done," he said outside the courthouse. "I hope this sends a message to others that they need to take safety seriously on the job." Hopkins, meanwhile, remained silent as he left the courthouse. His lawyer said that they were considering their options and may appeal the verdict. Regardless of the outcome, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of workplace safety. Accidents can happen, but it is up to individuals and companies to take proactive steps to minimize risks and protect those who work on their sites. Hopefully, this case will help to raise awareness and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
