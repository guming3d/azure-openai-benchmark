A cringeworthy video of a martial artist attempting - and repeatedly failing - to punch and kick through a plank has emerged online. And to add to the embarrassment, the only time the taekwondo practitioner is able to smash a piece of wood, a fragment flies off and hits a young girl in the face. Before he attempts to destroy the board, the man in a taekwondo uniform with a Scottish flag on it gives the crowd one of the boards and said: 'Send that round so to make sure they know it's real.' Scroll down for video . Oh dear: This video shows possibly the worst martial arts demonstration ever. The man's repeated blows fail to break the wood . If at first you don't succeed... the instructor bravely continues his war with the piece of wood . He then adopts a combat-ready stance before attempting to punch through it as another man holds it, only producing a painful-sounding thwack and an unscathed piece of wood in the video, posted on Liveleak. Undeterred, he punches the board another three times, with similar and equally disappointing results. Ever the optimist, the man then repeatedly kicks the stout board, before deciding that two burly men are required to hold it for his strikes to succeed. Success! After getting two men to hold the board, the martial artist finally smashes the board, sending a piece of wood flying . Cringe: A splinter of the piece of wood hits a girl watching the demonstration . Ouch: The little girl grabs her head after she is hit by the flying piece of plank . The martial artist goes over to make sure she's OK . He saves face when the board satisfyingly splits after a side kick, even getting a round of applause, but the triumph is short-lived as a fragment of the wood flies off and smacks a young girl in the face, causing her to burst into tears. He rushes over to check she's OK, and the girl appears to have just been shocked and is comforted by a woman, presumably her mother. Most people would have called time on the demonstration at this point, but the man gamely battles on. The big guns: But even a spinning heel kick fails to destroy his wooden adversary . The martial artist checks the unscathed piece of wood . As the two men grip the plank he subjects it to a barrage of ineffectual blows, drawing nervous giggles from the crowd. Unfortunately, viewers never find out the fate of the second piece of wood as the video ends shortly after. One internet wag commented: 'It is not taekwondo, it is taekwondont!'

chatgpt: In an incident that has shocked witnesses, a Scottish martial artist has caused serious injury to a child during one of his demonstrations. The incident occurred when the martial artist was attempting to break a board during a public performance. Upon his repeated failures to break the board, he finally managed to do so, but a piece of the wood flew off and hit a child in the face. According to eyewitnesses, the child was rushed to the hospital with visible injuries to both eyes. The child's parents are said to be understandably angry and are calling for the martial artist to be held accountable for his actions. Despite the incident, the martial artist seemed undeterred, and continued with another demonstration, this time trying to break another board. However, his attempts proved futile, and he was unable to break the board despite multiple attempts. This incident has raised concerns about the safety of martial arts demonstrations and the need for proper safety measures. As martial arts become increasingly popular among young children, parents are becoming more aware of the potential dangers that come with these practices. The martial artist in question has sparked outrage among members of the community, with many calling for him to take responsibility for his actions. However, some are defending his behavior, arguing that accidents can happen even in the most well-planned performances. It is not yet clear whether the martial artist will face any legal action following the incident. This will likely depend on the extent of the child's injuries and whether the martial artist was found to be negligent in his actions. This unfortunate incident has highlighted the need for increased safety measures during martial arts demonstrations, particularly those involving young children. It is important for organizers to ensure that all necessary precautions are taken to prevent accidents from occurring. In the aftermath of this incident, parents are being urged to exercise caution when allowing their children to participate in martial arts classes and demonstrations. While these practices can be a great way to build confidence and physical fitness, it is important to remember that they can also be dangerous if proper precautions are not taken. Ultimately, it is incumbent upon all members of the community to work together to prevent accidents like this from happening in the future. By taking the necessary steps to ensure safety and responsibility in martial arts demonstrations, we can continue to enjoy the many benefits that this practice has to offer while keeping our children safe from harm.
