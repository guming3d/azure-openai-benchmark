chatgpt: Detectives investigating the disappearance of a TV extra, Janet Brown, have begun to dig up land behind her family's rural home. The 51-year-old has not been seen since 2005 and police are hoping to uncover new evidence as part of their investigation. Neighbours have reported seeing police activity in the area, with detectives questioning locals and scouring the surrounding woods. It is said that investigators have even visited Thailand as part of their investigation, leading some to speculate that Brown may have travelled to the country prior to her disappearance. Brown's family have expressed their shock at the latest developments in the ongoing investigation. Her sister, who still lives at the family home, said, "We had no idea that the police were planning to dig up the land behind our house. It's been a long 16 years since Janet disappeared, and we're hoping that this search might finally bring some answers." Janet Brown was last seen in June 2005, when she left her home in the village of Treuddyn, North Wales. Her car was later found abandoned in a layby approximately 10 miles away, but there has been no trace of Brown since. Despite numerous appeals for information and a high-profile media campaign, police have been unable to solve the mystery of Brown's disappearance. However, the latest search for evidence may provide new leads for investigators, who are determined to bring closure to the case. One neighbour said, "It's been a long time since Janet went missing, but we've never forgotten about her. We're hoping that this latest search will finally provide the answers that we've been looking for." As the investigation continues, detectives are urging anyone with information about Janet Brown's disappearance to come forward. Even the smallest detail could be crucial in helping them solve this enduring mystery.
