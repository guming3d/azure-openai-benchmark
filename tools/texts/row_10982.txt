Last orders have been called on Ladies' Nights in Australia as bars are banned from giving free drinks to women. The new law comes into force on January 18 in South Australia in an attempt by the the state government to tackle binge drinking. It is one of a raft of 2013 laws being introduced in the country that critics say are unnecessary 'nannyism'. Banned: Bars in South Australia will not be able to offer free drinks to women from January 18 . In New South Wales new guidelines are being brought in to tell parents what to wear when they drop and collect their children from some schools. Parents have been told not to wear revealing clothes such as bikinis or racist T-shirts. One Sydney school said visitors should wear 'neat, casual clothing and footwear', according to The Telegraph. In Victoria, smokers will be fined Â£89 ($140) if they light up within 164 feet of the beach and in New South Wales a smoke-free radius will be installed around parks. Smokers who light up with 164ft of Melbourne beaches, such as Brighton Beach (pictured) will be fined . A ban on tanning salons will also come into force in the state from today. Critics of the new measures say they are unnecessary and excessive. Terry O'Gormon, president of The Australian Council for Civil Liberties, told The Australian that laws are already in place to prevent drunk people being served more alcohol in bars. He said: 'If there is a problem, it lies with the enforcement.' Under the new alcohol laws, bars must offer free water to customers. However many bars are expected to include men in their promotions to sidestep the ban. The manager of PJ O'Briens bar in Adelaide told The Telegraph: 'As long as you offer the special deals to everyone, it is OK. 'We will still look after everyone. Everything we're doing is by the book.'

chatgpt: A recent report has accused Australian states of enforcing nannyism through new laws aimed at regulating various activities such as smoking on beaches. The report has gained widespread attention, with many questioning if personal freedoms are being curtailed in the guise of public safety. The report highlights the raft of new laws that have been implemented across different states. One particular law that has been criticized is the smoking ban on beaches. While smoking is undoubtedly harmful, concerns are being raised about the legality of such laws because they seem to contradict what people consider as personal freedom. For smokers, this law is seen as an infringement upon their right to smoke in the open. Despite mild opposition from anti-smoking campaigners, the government is standing firm, citing public safety as its primary concern. They argue that smoking on beaches poses a danger to other beachgoers who may inhale secondhand smoke or find cigarette butts littered on the beach. However, the debate has sparked a broader conversation about the extent of personal freedom and whether lawmakers are crossing lines that infringe upon private decision-making. There are those who are in agreement with the recent laws, arguing that they serve a vital purpose in protecting public health and safety. For non-smokers, smoking restrictions on beaches offer an escape from secondhand smoke. Additionally, anti-smoking campaigners argue that such laws serve a broader purpose in protecting citizens from the harmful effects of smoking. However, some have accused the government of going too far while trying to regulate lifestyles. Naysayers argue that the government is overreaching and being too heavy-handed in its approach. Personal freedom should not come at the expense of public safety, but lawmakers must be careful not to infringe upon fundamental rights unnecessarily. In conclusion, it is clear that this issue has struck a chord with citizens and policymakers alike. The debate about nannyism versus public safety will likely continue, and it is up to lawmakers to strike a balance that preserves citizens' freedoms while ensuring their health and wellbeing.
