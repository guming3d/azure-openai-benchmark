Four Shia pilgrims were killed and six were injured when a car bomb exploded in Baghdad's Karrada district, Iraq's Interior Ministry said.

And four Shia pilgrims were injured when three car bombs exploded simultaneously in the town of Balad Rouz, said Muthana Altimimi, head of the security and defense committee in Diyala province. Thursday will mark 40 days after Ashura, which commemorates the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson. Shiite pilgrims often mark the occasion by traveling to shrines. Violence also erupted outside Baghdad. Seven people were killed and four were injured after their houses were bombed in the city of Mussyab, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the Iraqi capital, the Interior Ministry said. It was unclear who was responsible for the blast or why the houses were targeted. Monday's attacks come amid rising sectarian tensions, as tens of thousands of Sunni demonstrators nationwide protest what they say is second-class treatment by Iraq's Shiite-led government. Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq's 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected, which contributed to years of bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare. Read more: Clashes erupt at Iraqi protest as sectarian tensions flare . The arrest of a group of bodyguards for Iraq's Sunni finance minister fueled a surge in protests last week in Ramadi, about 110 kilometers (70 miles) west of Baghdad, and in several other Iraqi cities. At least five people were injured Sunday when bodyguards for a top Iraqi official opened fire on stone-throwing Sunni demonstrators, the country's Interior Ministry said. The clashes broke out after Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq, who is Sunni, arrived to address crowds protesting in a plaza in Ramadi. In the wake of the protests, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has defended his government. "Nobody in Iraq has privilege over others," he said Friday, calling for increased dialogue. "When we want to express an opinion, we have to do it in a civilized, humane and patriotic manner," he said. "It is not expected to express your opinion by cutting off roads, steering strife and sectarianism, fighting, bragging about wars and dividing Iraq." CNN's Yousuf Basil and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report from Atlanta.

chatgpt: In a series of barbaric attacks across Iraq, attackers have targeted Shia Muslims who were planning to celebrate one of the holiest days on their religious calendar. The most recent attacks have occurred just days before Ashura, a day of mourning observed by Shia Muslims for the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. In the Baghdad suburbs, seven people were killed when their houses were bombed. The victims were all Shia Muslims, and it is believed that the attackers specifically targeted these houses. According to local officials, the attackers used homemade bombs to target the houses, causing significant damage. The attacks come as Shia pilgrims are making their way to shrines across the country to mark Ashura. The holy day is observed with services and rituals, including processions through the streets. Pilgrims often travel long distances to reach the shrines, and many of them are now facing difficulties and fears about their safety. In the southern city of Basra, one person was killed and eight others were injured when a bomb exploded near a mosque. The bomb was planted on a motorbike and detonated as worshippers were leaving the mosque after evening prayers. The attack has sparked widespread anger among local residents. Shia Muslims are often targeted by Sunni extremist groups in Iraq, who see them as heretics. The attacks are carried out in an attempt to undermine the stability of the government and weaken the Shia majority in Iraq. The Iraqi government has condemned the attacks and has promised to take action to ensure the safety of pilgrims and other citizens during the Ashura celebrations. The police and military have been placed on high alert, and security measures have been increased in many areas. Many Shia Muslims are understandably concerned about their safety during the upcoming celebrations. In recent years, Ashura has been a target for attacks by extremist groups, and this year is no exception. Despite the risks, the faithful continue to make their way to the shrines, determined to honor the memory of Imam Hussein. The attacks have been widely condemned by religious leaders and politicians, who are calling for a united effort to combat extremism and violence in Iraq. The country has suffered for many years due to sectarian violence, and these attacks once again demonstrate the need for a strong and unified response. As Iraq prepares for Ashura, the eyes of the world are watching. The safety and security of the pilgrims will be of utmost importance, and the government must do everything in its power to ensure that they are protected. The attacks are a reminder that the threat of extremism and violence is still very real in Iraq, and the country must work together to overcome it.
