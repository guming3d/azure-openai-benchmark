article: While many people spent Christmas Eve doing last-minute shopping, two American astronauts had a more challenging matter to attend to Tuesday. In orbit more than 200 miles above Earth, flight engineers Rick Mastracchio and Mike Hopkins embarked on a spacewalk Tuesday morning to repair part of the International Space Station's cooling system. The spacewalk ended at 2:23 p.m. ET Tuesday and lasted 7 hours and 30 minutes, NASA said. More than four hours into the job, the two astronauts had successfully bolted a replacement ammonia pump module into its location and were working to connect lines to allow the ammonia to flow, NASA said in a tweet. There was a slight kink in the work when one of the fluid lines tangled. The astronauts untangled it, but when they did, the line released some ammonia flakes that landed on their space suits. It was not a leak, but some residue, NASA spokesman John Ira Petty said. The ammonia that landed on the spacesuits will require the spacewalkers to air out their suits before going back into the station, but is otherwise not a big deal, he said. The two engineers were carrying out the second in a series of expeditions needed to replace a malfunctioning pump, which circulates ammonia through loops outside the station to keep equipment cool. The pump developed problems December 11 when an internal valve stuck in an incorrect position. The space station's life support system remains up and running, but operations were cut back as a result of the problem, NASA said. It is the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in history, according to NASA. The two astronauts spent about 5Â½ hours outside the space station Saturday working to remove the problematic pump. Spacesuit problem . Mastracchio used a different spacesuit after a small amount of water leaked into the cooling system of the one he wore Saturday. NASA said the issue with the suit, which happened at the end of the spacewalk, was unrelated to a problem experienced in July when water pooled in an Italian astronaut's helmet, causing a spacewalk to be cut short. "Both Mastracchio and Hopkins reported dry conditions repeatedly throughout Saturday's activities and the two were never in danger," the agency said. NASA had installed new safeguards, including snorkels inside the spacesuits that would allow astronauts to take breaths if water formed and they had to return to the space station. Tuesday's spacewalk was the 176th to support the space station's assembly and maintenance, according to NASA. The previous Christmas Eve spacewalk took place in 1999, the agency said, when Discovery astronauts Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld spent more than eight hours refitting parts of the Hubble Space Telescope. The others on board the International Space Station at the moment include Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Tyurin, Sergey Ryazanskiy and Oleg Kotov and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata.

chatgpt: In a historic moment, NASA astronauts have completed a spacewalk on Christmas Eve to repair a malfunctioning pump in the International Space Station's cooling system. The spacewalk lasted for an impressive 7 hours and 30 minutes, according to a statement released by NASA. The two astronauts, Mike Hopkins and Rick Mastracchio, have been stationed at the International Space Station for several weeks now. Their mission has been to conduct routine maintenance and repairs to ensure the station is in top working condition. The trouble began when a pump in the station's cooling system failed, causing temperatures in some areas of the space station to rise. NASA officials quickly decided that a spacewalk was necessary to replace the malfunctioning pump. The astronauts carefully made their way outside the station, where they spent several hours working to complete the delicate task of replacing the pump. The spacewalk was a critical moment for the crew, as temperatures on the station have to be carefully regulated to ensure the safety of everyone on board. Despite the difficulty of the task, both astronauts remained focused and determined, with the entire NASA team watching closely from the ground. The spacewalk was made all the more special given that it took place on Christmas Eve, a fact that NASA was keen to highlight in their statement. "This is only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in history," the statement read. "We're proud of our team for their incredible work in keeping the International Space Station running smoothly." The spacewalk was not without its challenges, however. At one point, Hopkins reported that his suit had a minor water leak, but he was able to quickly fix the problem with the help of Mastracchio. Despite this setback, both astronauts successfully completed the spacewalk and returned safely to the station. The success of this spacewalk is a testament to the incredible skill and bravery of the astronauts who work tirelessly to maintain the International Space Station. It also underscores the importance of NASA's mission to explore and study space. As the world continues to grapple with ongoing challenges here on Earth, it's easy to overlook the incredible achievements that are taking place in space. But the success of this Christmas Eve spacewalk is a reminder that even in the midst of difficulty, humanity is capable of remarkable things.
