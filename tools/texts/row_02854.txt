'I laughed a lot.' In the video, the dog lifts one of its front legs in a fascist salute and then when he hears 'the pony-tailed one is coming' - a reference to Iglesias's long hair - Benito rolls over and plays dead.

chatgpt: A video of a French bulldog named Benito has gone viral after he was caught on camera giving a fascist salute whenever someone says "Hail Spain!" The video, which was uploaded only yesterday, has already received over 50,000 hits, and viewers are torn between finding the dog's behavior amusing and worrying that it might be promoting far-right ideologies. In the video, Benito is seen sitting on his owner's lap as the owner says, "Hail Spain!" Benito responds by raising his paw in what appears to be a fascist salute. The owner then asks Benito to "play dead" at the mention of left-wing politician Pablo Iglesias, and the dog immediately falls onto his back and stays still. Some viewers have criticized the video, saying it is inappropriate to associate such behavior with an animal, while others have praised the dog's cleverness and sense of humor. However, the most surprising reaction has come from Iglesias, himself an unpopular politician in some circles. Iglesias tweeted his approval of Benito, calling the dog "great" and saying that he understands that the video is meant to be a joke. The video has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some people seeing it as a clever satire of far-right nationalism, while others are concerned that it might be encouraging extremist views. Benito's owner insists that the video was only meant to be a joke and was not intended to offend anyone. This is not the first time that animals have become embroiled in political controversies. In the United States, a raccoon became a social media sensation in 2018 after it climbed up a skyscraper, attracting millions of viewers who were anxiously watching to see whether the animal would make it to the top. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, a cat called Larry resides at 10 Downing Street, and his antics have made him almost as famous as the prime ministers he has served under. It seems that animals are becoming more and more important in our political discourse, for better or for worse. People clearly have different opinions about what is appropriate and what isn't when it comes to animals and politics. Some people see it as harmless fun, while others view it as borderline propaganda. For now, though, it seems that Benito the French bulldog will continue to entertain us with his hilarious antics, and we can all agree that he is an adorable and loveable dog.
