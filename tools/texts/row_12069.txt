Clutching a plastic bag and sporting a winter hat and beard, he looks just any other New Yorker riding the Subway home. But look a little a closer and you might notice this isn't your average commuter. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who has a net worth of $17.5 billion, was snapped travelling on a downtown train late on Sunday night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Google co-founder Sergey Brin was photographed travelling on the New York Subway on Sunday . And while he didn't appear to be the most glamorous of passengers, he was sporting his company's yet to be released Google Glasses - worth $1,500 a pair. Brooklyn resident Niah Zerkin captured the moment on his camera and even had a quick chat with the multi-billionaire. It is not the first time Brin has worn the internet spectacles out in public. The augmented-reality goggles allow users to find out the time, the temperature, talk to a friend or get directions. They are not yet on sale but a promotional video promoting the gadget called Project Glass was  released last year prompting claims they are going to revolutionise the way we live. The wraparound glasses feature a miniature display that sits above one eye, allowing users to surf the internet, make video calls, listen to music and update the diary without lifting a finger.

A prototype is being tweaked and tested in public by the company’s employees before it goes on sale. The technology, known as ‘wearable computing’, is expected to launch a new generation of gadgets which display a layer of information over everything the wearer sees. The glasses are mainly voice-controlled to bring up contacts, send emails and search the web . The wearer can even be given information instantly from buildings they are looking at, landmarks or friends in the area. The technology was unveiled last April and demoed when Brin sky-dived into a Google conference wearing a pair. They are expected to go on sale to consumers by early to 2014.

chatgpt: Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who is one of the world's richest men, is said to be at the helm of top-secret developments at Google. The 39-year-old billionaire is known for his leadership of some of the most innovative and advanced projects at the tech giant, including Google X, which is the company's mysterious research laboratory. Among the top-secret projects currently under the charge of Brin is the development of Google's self-driving car. The autonomous vehicle has been in the works for several years, and is expected to revolutionize the way people travel. Brin is reportedly closely supervising the development of the project, which is already in the testing phase in certain cities across the United States. Another big project Brin is working on is Google Glass, the company's revolutionary wearable technology. The device, which was unveiled to much fanfare last year, is essentially a small computer that can be worn like a pair of glasses. It has a camera, a microphone, and a small screen, and can be used to access the internet, make phone calls, and even take photos and videos. However, Brin's role at Google extends far beyond just overseeing the development of new products. He's also a key figure in the company's day-to-day operations, and has reportedly played a key role in the tough negotiations between Google and the European Union over antitrust issues. Despite his significant accomplishments at the company, Brin is known for his low-key demeanor and reluctance to give interviews. However, he's widely respected among those who know him, and is known for his sharp intellect and ability to think outside the box. Brin's wealth, which is estimated at around $26.5 billion, makes him one of the wealthiest people in the world. He and Google co-founder Larry Page are among the few tech billionaires who have been able to hold onto their fortunes despite the ups and downs of the industry. Despite his success, however, Brin remains focused on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of technology. He is reportedly always on the lookout for new and innovative ideas, and is known to be one of the most forward-thinking leaders in the industry. For those who are interested in the future of technology, Brin is undoubtedly a name to watch. With his impressive track record, his keen intellect, and his unwavering commitment to innovation, it's clear that he will be a force to be reckoned with in the tech industry for many years to come.
