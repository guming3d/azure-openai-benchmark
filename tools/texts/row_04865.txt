article: Washington (CNN) -- Justice Department civil rights prosecutors have concluded there was no wrongdoing in an FBI agent's shooting of Ibragim Todashev, an associate of the alleged mastermind of the Boston Marathon bombing who was killed in a scuffle with agents during questioning, U.S. law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said. The finding concurs with an FBI internal review of the shooting, which supported the agent's account. It also matches what the Florida state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties has found in his investigation. Evidence reviewed includes photos of the agent showing his injuries, the officials said. The federal review is expected to be released next week, alongside the review by the state investigators. The Justice Department's civil rights division routinely does "color of law" reviews of such shootings to look into whether there are any civil rights violations by federal agents. The shooting occurred on May 22, 2013, as Massachusetts state troopers, accompanied by FBI agents, questioned Todashev, 27, in his apartment in an Orlando suburb, according to U.S. law enforcement officials. Massachusetts investigators were pursuing information about a grisly 2011 triple murder that they thought could have been tied to Todashev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who allegedly carried out the deadly bombing last April with his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed as he and his brother confronted police in the days after the bombing. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later arrested and jailed. He's awaiting trial. Todashev's shooting has raised questions about the FBI's handling of the matter, because any evidence he could have provided is now lost. Todashev's family has disputed that he posed any threat to the law enforcement officers and agents in his apartment. "My son was definitely unarmed, because he never had a gun," his father, Abdulbaki Todashev, told CNN in Moscow in a June 2013 interview. "He couldn't attack them or fight them; he couldn't do anything because even two men could easily handle him." U.S. law enforcement officials said Todashev made statements implicating himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the murders. The FBI had interviewed Todashev before about the Marathon bombing because he was a friend who, like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, trained in martial arts, and the two were friends. He was cooperative, and the FBI didn't consider him to be involved. The subsequent questioning came at the request of Massachusetts investigators who had begun taking a new look at the killings outside of Boston in Waltham, Massachusetts. After several hours of questioning, U.S. law enforcement officials said he lunged at the agent.

chatgpt: The death of Ibragim Todashev, who was killed during an interrogation on May 2013, has sparked many questions regarding the way law enforcement officials handled the situation. Knowing the alleged Boston Marathon bombings mastermind, Todashev was being questioned in Florida in connection with a triple homicide when an FBI agent fired a fatal shot at him. According to U.S. law enforcement officials, Todashev lunged at the agent, prompting him to fire his weapon, killing Todashev. However, the family of the victim disputed this claim, arguing that Todashev did not pose a threat to law enforcement. Todashev's death has since fueled controversy over the use of force by law enforcement officials in situations like his. Despite some protests and calls for accountability, most people do not question the persistence of the larger problem of police brutality and the use of excessive force in the US. Several conspiracy theories have also emerged following Todashev's death, with some people speculating that he was silenced because of his link to the Boston Marathon bombings. However, no evidence has been presented to support these allegations. In further attempts to clear up any doubts about their actions, law enforcement officials released a statement in which they claimed that Todashev had confessed to his involvement in the triple homicide, as well as implicating Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, in the crime. Tsarnaev, who was killed in the aftermath of the bombing, has been identified as the mastermind behind the attack, which claimed the lives of three people and injured hundreds. His younger brother, Dzhokhar, who was also implicated in the bombings, was later sentenced to death. Todashev's death remains a tragedy that deeply affected his family and friends, as well as raising questions about the role that law enforcement played in his fate. Although the case may never be fully resolved, it serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that law enforcement officers are accountable for their actions and that they operate within the limits of the law. In conclusion, Todashev's death has generated controversy that has yet to be fully resolved. The incident underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to policing that emphasizes transparency, fairness, and accountability, and puts an end to the persistent and pervasive use of force in communities of color.
