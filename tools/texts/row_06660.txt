article: The battle for Rangers took another twist on Sunday night when it emerged that American financier Robert Sarver had submitted an £18million offer for a controlling stake. Sarver, who owns the Phoenix Suns basketball team, made his offer to PLC chairman David Somers in the days after Christmas. He wanted a general meeting called to approve the issue of new shares and was willing to spend a further £15m to buy up 100 per cent of the club. American financier Robert Sarver had submitted an £18million offer for a controlling stake in Rangers . However, the acquisitions made recently by Dave King and a consortium comprising Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor – who now have around 34 per cent between them - have since altered the picture significantly. None of those wealthy fans would have any intention of selling as they seek to force regime change. While the initial format of his bid appears unlikely to succeed, Sarver may still have a role to play as it is understood he would be willing to work alongside fan groups and Rangers-supporting businessmen. The 52-year-old chief executive of Western Alliance Bancorporation is thought to have had some limited contact with the Park consortium. Should the broad coalition of fans succeed in toppling the current board, then he could figure in plans to try and rebuild the financially-stricken club. ‘Sarver is a serious player with superb credentials,’ one source told BBC Scotland. Sarver, who owns the Phoenix Suns basketball team, made his offer to PLC chairman David Somers . ‘He knows what it takes to make major sports clubs successful and would bring a tremendous track record to Rangers. ‘He is regarded as a straight-talking and very determined guy with a genuine passion for sport and an impressive record of success at the highest level of US sport and business. ‘Of course, he sees this as an exciting opportunity to invest in a major sporting institution, but given his involvement in the NBA, he fully realises that, without the broad support of fans, any proposals are doomed to failure.’ At least 75 per cent of shareholders would have to agree to new shares being issued to a non-shareholder at a general meeting, after resolution nine was defeated at club’s AGM in December. As it stands, existing shareholders must be given first refusal on the available new shares, which could raise around £6.5m. The acquisitions made by King and the Park group give them a strong hand – and they could apply to buy up any shares not taken up when the issue goes ahead. Second-placed Rangers are 13 points adrift of Hearts at the top of the Scottish Championship .

chatgpt: Scottish football team, Rangers, has been the subject of a tug-of-war over control as American financier Robert Sarver makes an offer for a controlling stake in the club. Sarver, who owns the US basketball team Phoenix Suns, has offered a staggering £18m for a controlling stake in the club. The latest move has been seen as a significant twist in the ongoing battle for control of Rangers. The club has had a tumultuous history in recent years, with financial difficulties leading to its demotion to the fourth tier of Scottish football in 2012. Sarver's offer could potentially give him control over the club, which has been under the stewardship of its chairman, Dave King. King's attempts to consolidate his position at the club have been met with resistance from some investors, leading to a protracted takeover battle. Speculation about Sarver's interest in the club has swirled for some time, with reports suggesting that he had been interested in investing in Rangers for several years. If the offer is accepted, it could see the club's fortunes change dramatically, with the potential for increased funding and investment in its facilities and infrastructure. Rangers, who are one of the most successful football clubs in Scottish history, have been working towards a return to the top flight of Scottish football since their demotion. The club has made significant progress over the past few years, but the latest twist in the control battle could have a significant impact on its future. Sarver's wealth and experience could bring a fresh perspective to the club, helping it to build on recent progress and develop further. However, his ownership of a US basketball team has also raised some concerns about his knowledge of football and the challenges that come with owning a club. In recent months, Rangers has also been hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which has had a significant impact on the club's finances. While the pandemic has affected football clubs all over the world, the financial difficulties at Rangers have been particularly acute. Despite these challenges, the club's recent success and potential for further growth make it an attractive proposition for investors. Sarver's offer for a controlling stake could be the start of a new chapter for the club, as it continues on its path towards success and prosperity. As the battle for control of Rangers continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what the ultimate outcome will be. However, Sarver's offer has certainly added a new and unexpected twist to the saga, casting the future of the club into uncertain territory once again. Rangers fans, investors, and observers alike are eagerly awaiting the next move in this ongoing saga.
