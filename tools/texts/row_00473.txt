He had served five years for the killing of Damilola . Taylor (right) Preddie was originally released in September 2010 but sent back to jail last March for breaking the conditions of his licence . Ten-year-old Damilola bled to death after being stabbed with a broken bottle on a council estate in Peckham, South London, in November 2000, as he walked home from the local library after school. He had moved to Britain from Nigeria only a few months before. Preddie, now 24, was first released in 2010, four years into an eight-year sentence. Only six months later he was recalled after returning to the Peckham estates he terrorised as a boy in breach of his licence. On January 25 this year, he was freed a second time. Police were alerted after he was seen in Southwark, where he was thought to be associating with gang members. Yesterday Damilola’s father Richard said he was planning to write to the Prime Minister calling for an inquiry into how ‘the system has failed so badly in this case’. He said: ‘I am very angry with the Parole Board for the way they handled this and the way they have ignored my advice.’ Mr Taylor, 64, had previously pleaded with the authorities not to release Ricky Preddie or his brother Danny, both of whom were jailed for eight years for Damilola’s manslaughter in 2006. Danny was released last September. Mr Taylor has said the pair should be hanged. After Ricky’s second release, he said: ‘He has not served enough time behind bars for what he did. ‘He has not had the opportunity to reflect on what he has done and it is obvious he will return to criminality.’ Gary Trowsdale, managing director of the Damilola Taylor Trust, said: ‘For the second time in 18 months, the boy has been recalled due to breaking the terms of his licence. Neither of these boys has shown any remorse. ‘Every time this happens the Damilola family are being dragged back through all the pain.’ Heartache: Damilola's father Richard, with his late wife Gloria, who died in 2008.

chatgpt: Ricky Preddie, one of the two brothers convicted of killing 10-year-old Damilola Taylor back in 2000, was released from prison once again just 16 days ago. However, he was recently recalled to prison as a result of breaching his parole terms. Reports have surfaced that Preddie entered an exclusion zone, and has been in contact with former gang members. This behaviour is a clear violation of his parole conditions, which expressly prohibit him from associating with any individuals with a criminal record or gang affiliations.  Damilola's father, Richard, is calling for a public inquiry into the handling of his son's case. The family has long argued that the justice system failed them and could have done more to bring the perpetrators to justice. The release of Ricky Preddie has sparked fury from Damilola's father, and others who are still mourning the loss of the young schoolboy. They refer to the Preddie brothers as 'heinous child killers,' and question whether the justice system is working effectively to keep dangerous individuals off the streets. The case of Damilola Taylor shocked the nation when it happened, and it has continued to resonate with people for years. The young boy's life was so tragically taken from him in what was a senseless act of violence. It has left a permanent scar on his family and friends. Ricky Preddie was just 13 years old at the time of the murder but was found guilty, along with his brother, of stabbing Damilola with a broken bottle. The brothers were sentenced to eight years in custody, but have since been released multiple times on parole. The recent recall of Ricky Preddie to prison highlights the challenges that the justice system faces in managing dangerous offenders. It also raises concerns about the effectiveness of the parole system and whether there are enough safeguards in place to protect society from those who pose a risk of reoffending. It is important that the family of Damilola Taylor receives justice, and that the public can have confidence that the justice system is working effectively. The call for a public inquiry into the handling of the case is a timely reminder of the importance of independent scrutiny and accountability. The tragic case of Damilola Taylor is one that will stay with us for a long time. It serves as a reminder that we must do everything we can to prevent such senseless acts of violence from happening in the future. We must also ensure that those who commit such atrocities are held accountable for their actions, and that they are not allowed to cause any more harm to society.
