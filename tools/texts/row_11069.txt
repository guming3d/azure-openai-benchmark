chatgpt: UKIP leader, Nigel Farage has announced that he has gone teetotal for the entire month of January after drinking pints throughout the entirety of 2014. The politician, whose drinking has been heavily documented, admitted that he needs a break from the habit after every UKIP triumph last year was marked with him posing for pictures with a pint in hand. Farage, who was said to have been stunned by UKIP's success in 2014, was also criticized for often being too drunk to speak while campaigning. However, the politician has denied that his chosen break from drinking is linked to any specific event, stating that he just needs to detox. The UKIP leader has previously faced criticism from opponents who claim that his drinking habits make him unfit to lead the party. However, Farage has dismissed such claims, stating that as long as he can still do his job, what he does in his spare time is his business. Despite this, last year the politician was even seen stumbling out of a pub in front of a group of reporters, causing further embarrassment to the party. However, Farage has defended his decision to go teetotal, stating that he simply needs to take a break from the habit in order to stay healthy. He also revealed that he has been working hard to lose weight and has already lost half a stone.  “I just need to detox, that’s all. I’m not a habitual drinker, I just like a good pint. I’m doing this to prove to myself that I can go without it for a month. It’s easy to slip into the habit of having a drink every night, but it’s not good for you. I need to stay healthy if I’m going to lead this party,” Farage told reporters. Despite this, some have criticized Farage for only going teetotal for a month, claiming that it isn’t enough to establish any long-lasting change. However, the UKIP leader has called for people to be more tolerant of others’ lifestyle choices. “I’m not telling people what to do with their own lives. I’m just choosing to take a break from drinking for a month. People should be allowed to make their own choices, without fear of judgment,” he said. Although it remains to be seen whether Farage will stick to his teetotal pledge, the decision has been praised by many as a step in the right direction towards better health. “The fact that Farage is taking steps to look after his health is a positive move. Hopefully, he can see the benefits of going teetotal and perhaps even make it a permanent lifestyle change,” said a spokesperson for the UKIP party. In the coming weeks, it remains to be seen whether Farage will stick to his teetotal pledge, or whether he will return to his drinking habits. Nonetheless, his decision to take a break from the habit has been seen as a positive move towards better health, regardless of whether he decides to keep it up in the long-term.
