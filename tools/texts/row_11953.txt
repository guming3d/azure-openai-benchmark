chatgpt: Daniel Vorderwulbecke, a 37-year-old DJ from Germany, has been accused of harassing Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan. According to reports, Vorderwulbecke had "bombarded Lohan with Instagram pictures and texts".  The incident happened in London's Playhouse Theatre, where Lindsay Lohan is currently rehearsing for her upcoming play. It is alleged that Vorderwulbecke attacked a doorman at the theatre after he was barred from entering the rehearsal.  During the hearing, the prosecutor told the court that Vorderwulbecke believes he is married to Lindsay Lohan. This belief had prompted his repeated attempts to contact the actress.  The prosecution argued that the DJ's actions amounted to harassment and that he poses a risk to Lohan's safety. They also argued that he is not fit to stand trial and should be held in a specialist facility.  The court heard that Vorderwulbecke is currently being treated at a specialist hospital and is "acutely unwell". The doctors who are treating him believe that he would be better off being treated in Germany.  Vorderwulbecke's lawyer argued that his client was not in a fit state to stand trial and that he should be allowed to return home to Germany. They also argued that his actions were not malicious and that he did not pose a risk to Lohan's safety.  The judge in the case has ordered Vorderwulbecke to remain in the UK until a decision is made about his treatment. The case has been adjourned to allow for further medical assessments to be carried out.  There has been no response from Lindsay Lohan or her representatives regarding the incident. However, the actress has been vocal about her own experiences with harassment and the importance of speaking out against it.  The case has drawn attention to the issue of harassment in the entertainment industry and the need for stricter laws and regulations to protect performers from such behavior.  Overall, this incident has once again highlighted the importance of addressing harassment in all its forms, and the need to ensure that those who engage in such behavior are held accountable for their actions. It remains to be seen what the outcome of this case will be. However, it is clear that this is a serious issue that requires immediate attention from authorities and the public alike.
