article: London, England (CNN) -- In the latest edition of Fanzone's look at famous soccer fans, South Africa captain and Portsmouth midfielder Aaron Mokoena tells all about his favorite team and their bitter rivalry with the Kaizer Chiefs. Who do you support and why? In South Africa my favorite football team is Orlando Pirates. I played for professional team Jomo Cosmos but I always love Orlando Pirates because that's was the team that I grew up supporting. How did you start supporting them? My elder brother, he made me support Pirates and used to take me to watch the games. That really made me fall in love with the team. They had so many good players as well. That's why I fell in love with the club. Do you remember your first game? It was Orlando Pirates against Kaizer Chiefs, the biggest derby game in South Africa, I went to watch and it was unbelievable; really, really amazing. That was the derby of Soweto, I think it was probably 1990. That is a game that everyone wants to watch. It's like Manchester United versus Manchester City or Liverpool. It's a game that you can't miss. How are they doing at the moment? They're still doing well. Lots of youngsters... it's been generations after generations. The generation they have now are more younger players. They're adapting well and doing very well. What is the most memorable game from Orlando Pirates you've seen? They won the African Champions League in 1995. It was the first team in South Africa to win such a tournament. That tournament is the toughest tournament to play ... and they did extremely well, they won the cup. That really stands out for me. Is Kaizer Chiefs the team you love to hate? Not that I do hate Kaizer Chiefs but as they are the arch rivals to Orlando Pirates, I tend to have a soft spot for Pirates but not for Kaizer Chiefs. I would go back to South Africa and play for Kaizer Chiefs to be fair but I don't hate them, they are really professional. But between Pirates and Chiefs, I would always choose Orlando Pirates. Would you play for Orlando Pirates? Has that opportunity come up? I have been so fortunate to sit down with the owner of Orlando Pirates and he said, "Look the moment you retire from your football in Europe make sure you come down to Orlando Pirates" -- so it's an opportunity that is there for me. I am an ambassador for "Education -- One goal for all" and I spoke to him at the launch two months ago at the Emirates stadium and that's when we had a chat. He's a really respectable person in South Africa and him saying that meant a lot to me.
