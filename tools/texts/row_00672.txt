A four-member rescue team reached the . 52-year-old German cave researcher yesterday. He had suffered head and . upper body injuries a day earlier in a rockfall deep inside the caves. One of his two companions made a 12-hour solo climb back to the cave entrance to call for help, while the other stayed with him. Mr Reindl said the cave system has tight spots where only a slim person can squeeze through, and explorers also have to contend with water. Another mountain rescue official, Stefan Schneider, told a televised news conference that a doctor was in the cave, but it wasn't clear when he could get to the patient. 'It's going round the clock, and it's going to last a few more days,' Mr Schneider said. Rescuers working in several small teams of up to four people each have laid a telephone line several hundred metres along the route to help with their efforts. Others have set up camps inside the cave system, which lies on the border with Austria. Fifty-two cave rescue specialists from Bavaria, 28 from Austria and some from Switzerland were at the scene.

chatgpt: A German cave researcher, aged 52, is currently trapped in a cave system located on the German-Austrian border. On Sunday morning, the explorer was hit by rocks and has since been trapped in the caves. Over 80 mountain rescue workers have been working tirelessly to free him since the incident, but due to the restricted access to the caves, the rescue mission could take several days. Marienheide, a small town in North Rhine-Westphalia, is where the cave researcher is from. He was visiting the system to explore it further, as he was an experienced cave explorer. The accident happened on Sunday morning when he was travelling through one of the caves. The cause of the incident is not yet known, but the man was hit by rocks that led to him being trapped within the cave system. The rescue operation began soon after the accident, which involved more than 80 mountain rescue workers. These trained professionals were joined by six cave experts who are with the man now. Despite being trapped, reports suggest that the man is conscious and can walk with help. This has been a positive sign for the rescue team who have been keeping a close eye on his condition. The rescue mission has been taking place under challenging circumstances. The cave system where the man is trapped is known for its restricted access, meaning that rescuers have had to navigate through tight spaces and challenging terrain. The mission has been complicated further due to the risk of further rockfalls. To ensure the safety of both the man and the rescuers, the mission has been planned out meticulously, taking into account various scenarios and challenges. The rescue team has reported that they have made progress, but they still have a long way to go. The current situation is that their main priority is to provide the man with basic necessities such as food, water and blankets. The team has been working around the clock, taking turns to stay with the man to ensure that he gets the best possible care. The man's family have been notified of the situation, and they are being kept up to date with the latest developments. The local authorities have also been briefed on the situation, and they have been working with the rescue team to ensure that everything goes according to plan. The accident has highlighted the dangers associated with cave exploration, and it serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adhering to safety procedures. The German Cave Research Association has expressed their support for the rescue team, and they have commended their efforts in trying to save the trapped explorer. As of now, the rescue mission is ongoing, but the rescue team is doing everything in their power to free the man as soon as possible. With the support of the local authorities and the German Cave Research Association, the team remains optimistic that they will be able to free the man soon. Until then, they will continue to work hard to provide him with the care he requires.
