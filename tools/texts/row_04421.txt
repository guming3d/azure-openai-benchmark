Google faces legal action by European data protection agencies after the American internet giant failed to comply with EU privacy laws. France's CNIL data protection authority said that the European agencies will meet next week to approve an action plan after Google was warned in October last year that their new privacy policy did not obey EU regulations. They faced an ultimatum: comply to the instructions of EU agencies within four months or face legal action. European warning: Google faces legal action by European data protection agencies after the American internet giant failed to follow their instructions to comply with EU privacy laws . Google introduced a new privacy policy in March last year which allowed the company to track users across various services to target advertising. The changes sparked an outcry from American and European consumer advocacy groups. The California-based firm argued that the changes simplified and unified its policies across their various services such as Gmail, Android mobile systems, internet search, YouTube and social networking. Critics argued that the changes give Google, the world’s largest search engine, unprecedented power to track and monitor users. The policy also offers no opt out option other than refraining from using Google services. Data protection agencies in Europe had suggested Google improve the information provided for users, especially on data being processed and for what purposes and services. CNIL also asked they provide specific timeframes for holding personal data. User experience: Google argues their new privacy policy simplifies its policies across its services including Android mobile systems, YouTube and Gmail but critics say it gives them unprecedented power to track and monitor users . France’s CNIL data protection agency said: ‘At the end of a four month delay accorded to Google to conform and promise to implement recommendations, no response has been forthcoming by the company.’ The European Commission supported the agencies’ stance, ‘applauding’ their efforts to ensure data protection laws were followed. Mina Andreeva, the spokesperson for EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, said: ‘Companies that offer services to consumers in the EU most follow European data protection rules. ‘It is essential that consumers know exactly how their data is processed’ to make informed decisions about using internet-based services. Google said today that their privacy policy respects European privacy laws.

chatgpt: Next week, European data protection agencies are set to approve an action plan in response to Google's new privacy policy. These agencies argue that the policy is not in compliance with EU privacy laws, and are taking action to address the issue. Google's new privacy policy, which was introduced in 2012, consolidated over 70 privacy policies for different Google services into one policy. European regulators have been scrutinizing the policy ever since its introduction, arguing that it does not provide users with enough control over their personal data. In a statement, the regulators said that Google's policy "does not enable users to exercise their right to control their personal data." They also noted that the policy "makes it difficult, if not impossible, for users to determine which services are covered, what data is combined and for what purposes." Under the proposed action plan, the regulators will ask Google to make changes to its privacy policy to ensure that it complies with EU privacy laws. If Google is not willing to make the necessary changes, the regulators could take legal action against the company. The proposed action plan comes at a time when data privacy is a major concern for many people. With the rise of social media and other online services, people are sharing more personal information than ever before. This has led to a growing concern about the ways in which companies are using this information and whether they are doing enough to protect users' privacy. In the case of Google, the regulators are particularly concerned about the company's data collection practices. Google collects a wide range of information about its users, including their search history, location data and even voice recordings. While Google claims that this data is used to improve its services, critics argue that it gives the company too much power over users' personal lives. The proposed action plan is just one of many steps that European regulators are taking to ensure that companies like Google comply with EU privacy laws. In recent years, regulators have fined several companies for violating these laws, including Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Despite these efforts, some privacy advocates argue that the EU needs to do more to protect users' privacy. They argue that companies are still collecting too much data and that regulators need to take stronger action to limit the amount of personal information that companies can collect. In the meantime, Google and other companies will need to comply with the EU's privacy laws if they want to operate in the region. While this may be a challenge for some companies, it is an important step towards protecting the rights of users and ensuring that their personal information is not being used without their consent.
