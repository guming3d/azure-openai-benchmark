chatgpt: A man from either African or Arabic origin has tragically died after attempting to smuggle himself into the UK. The stowaway, believed to be in his twenties or thirties, clung onto a coach for an astonishing 200 miles before he was struck by a driver who was unaware of his presence. The unnamed man is believed to have sneaked onto a coach that was on a three-day trip from France to the United Kingdom. Despite the coach company carrying out appropriate border checks, the man managed to evade detection and clung onto the coach throughout the journey. It wasn't until the coach arrived at the depot in west London, that the driver noticed something was amiss, finding the man's body stuck to the underside of the vehicle. Reports suggest that the driver was completely unaware of the stowaway's presence during the journey. An investigation is ongoing, as authorities tried to identify the man and determine the cause of death. A Home Office post-mortem will be conducted, which is expected to shed some light on how the man met his tragic end. The coach company, which has not yet been named, has released a statement expressing their condolences to the man's family and friends. The statement reads, "We are deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred at our depot. Safety is our top priority, and we carried out appropriate border checks in accordance with the law. We are cooperating with the authorities to assist their investigations." This incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of people attempting to sneak into the country illegally. The UK has strict border control measures in place, and those who try to circumvent them put themselves in grave danger. While the identity of the man who died has not yet been released, authorities are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward. It's not yet clear how the man managed to cling on to the coach throughout the journey, but the investigation is expected to uncover the circumstances that led to his tragic death. In conclusion, the death of the stowaway has left many questions unanswered, and authorities are working hard to uncover the truth behind the incident. Our thoughts are with the man's family and friends during this difficult time.
