article: (CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. is responding well to treatment for bipolar depression, the Mayo Clinic said Monday. The Rochester, Minn.-based clinic said Jackson is regaining his strength but offered no further information on his condition. In early July, the congressman's office announced he was "receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder." A few weeks later, his office said he was undergoing an "extensive inpatient evaluation for depression and gastrointestinal issues" at the Mayo Clinic. Jackson's wife, Sandi, said earlier this month her husband had "good days and bad days" and doctors were increasing his depression medication to "therapeutic levels." Wife: Rep. Jackson still 'very depressed' The Illinois Democrat and son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, has not been on Capitol Hill since late May. Jackson and his family have not said much about his ordeal, though his father told The Huffington Post that when he visited his son in Washington in June, he learned the junior Jackson hadn't slept in three days. What the family thought was exhaustion, the Rev. Jackson said, was "something much deeper, much broader, and it lasted much longer." Sandi Jackson has firmly denied her husband had attempted suicide or was receiving help for alcohol or drug addiction. She said earlier this month it was unclear when he might return to work -- including whether he would be at the Democratic National Convention in early September. What is bipolar II disorder? Jackson's illness comes as the House Ethics Committee is examining allegations that in 2008, he or one of his associates offered to raise money for then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for Jackson being appointed to the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama after he was elected president. The congressman has maintained his innocence and pledged to continue to cooperate with authorities. Blagojevich was convicted last year on corruption charges in connection with his efforts to profit from appointing the successor to the Senate seat. He began serving a 14-year sentence in March. Bipolar disorder is a treatable condition that affects parts of the brain controlling emotion, thought and drive, the Mayo Clinic says. Many Americans suffer from it, and it is most likely caused by a complex set of genetic and environmental factors, it says. Medical experts are still weighing whether gastric bypass surgery that Jackson underwent in 2004 for weight loss might have helped trigger his depression, his wife said. The Mayo Clinic said that type of surgery is increasingly common in the United States and can change how the body absorbs food, vitamins, nutrients and medications.

chatgpt: Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who has not been on Capitol Hill since May, is currently undergoing treatment for depression at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Jackson's wife, Chicago Alderman Sandi Jackson, recently confirmed his condition, saying that he has been "very, very depressed" and that "it's been a tough summer." Jackson's absence from Congress has sparked speculation and concern among his constituents and colleagues. He has missed several key votes and public appearances, including the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. In June, Jackson's office released a statement saying that he was taking a medical leave of absence to receive treatment for a "mood disorder." The statement did not provide any further details on his condition. Jackson's political career has been clouded in controversy in recent years. In 2010, he was investigated for ethics violations relating to allegations that he offered to raise funds for former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich in exchange for being appointed to President Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. Jackson denied the allegations and was not charged with any wrongdoing. More recently, Jackson has faced criticism for his handling of funds related to his campaign. An ongoing House Ethics Committee investigation is looking into allegations that he used campaign funds for personal expenses and attempted to buy President Obama's old Senate seat. Despite the controversy, Jackson is a popular figure in his Illinois district, which includes parts of Chicago's South Side and suburbs. He first won election to Congress in 1995, at age 30, and has been reelected by comfortable margins in every subsequent election. Jackson's condition has sparked concern among his colleagues on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement wishing him a speedy recovery, saying that "Jesse Jackson Jr. is a respected and effective leader who has served his constituents with distinction. We all stand with him and his family during this difficult time." Jackson's office has provided few updates on his condition, but his wife expressed optimism about his recovery. "Jesse's a fighter," she said. "He's going to be alright." Depression is a common illness affecting millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in life. Treatment may include talk therapy, medication, or a combination of both. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, is one of the top medical facilities in the country and is renowned for its treatment of mental health issues. Jackson is reportedly receiving care in the facility's psychiatric unit. The news of Jackson's condition has brought attention to the issue of mental health in America, particularly among politicians and public figures who may face intense pressure and scrutiny in their careers. Many have praised Jackson for being open about his struggles, and have urged others to seek help if they are experiencing similar issues. As the country watches and waits for updates on Jackson's condition, one thing is clear: the congressman is not alone, and he has the support of his colleagues, his community, and many Americans across the country as he works towards recovery.
