article: The principal of a Queensland primary school who banned handstands and cartwheels in the playground has been subjected to 'cowardly cyberattacks' by parents, the state education minister said. Peregrian Springs State School parents were advised in a school newsletter in August that handstands, cartwheels and other 'cheerleading-style' stunts were not allowed unless children were under supervision of a trained physical education teacher. Some parents and others in the school community were outraged by the ban, which critics said placed unnecessary restrictions on their children's play time. Peregian Springs State School's decision top stop students from doing cartwheels and handstands without supervision has prompted 'cowardly cyberattacks' on principal Gwen Sands . Queensland Education Minister John-Paul Langrbroek told Parliament on Tuesday he stood by principal Gwen Sands' decision to impose the ban, which was made after two students were injured at school while doing 'gymnastic cheerleading' in the concrete playground. 'Gwen Sands was held up to ridicule by the media, pilloried internationally as a perpetrator of crimes against children and derided as the worst of the nanny state officials,' Mr Langrbroek told Parliament on Tuesday. 'But the most hurtful were the cowardly cyberattacks launched via Facebook and Twitter, many from parents of the students in her care,' he said. 'There were single lines and stinging rebukes sent without thought for the consequence or the power that words can have, even against adults.' These parents were the same people who expect schools to protect their children from bullies and who 'march straight into the principal's office demanding these measures for their children,' Mr Langrbroek said. The handstand ban follow injuries to two students while doing 'gymnastic cheerleading' in the school's mostly concrete playground, Queensland Education Minister John Langrbroek said . 'Do we now need to start a campaign to protect our teachers and principals from the very people who should know better, the parents of the children entrusted to their care?' Mr Langrbroek said. 'I spoke to principal Sands and I told her I had her back 100 per cent because I support our principals to make the right decisions for their communities.' The Queensland Department of Education has said it was up to the school to make individual decisions about activities in the playground. Not all parents were unhappy with the decision. Others took to Facebook to say they supported Dr. Sands and the school's commitment to the students' safety.

chatgpt: The principal of a school in the United States has become the latest target of vitriol on social media platforms after implementing a ban on ‘gymnastic cheerleading’ due to safety concerns. Gwen Sands, the principal of the school, has been labeled as ‘the worst of the nanny state officials’ by several critics on social media platforms. Many of the most severe attacks came from parents of students who were negatively impacted by the controversial ban. The decision to prohibit gymnastic cheerleading followed two reported injuries on the playground during these activities. The resulting backlash towards Principal Sands has been fierce, but she has remained steadfast in her decision, citing the safety of students as her top priority. Despite the wave of animosity from the affected parents, the Education Minister has given his full support to Principal Sands. He has assured her that, despite public criticism, he stands by her decision “100 per cent.” The implications of the ban, which limit the physical activities of students, have sparked concerns. In response to the controversy, many parents and students have come forward with support for the ban. They argue that safety should be the top priority, and that the risks associated with gymnastic cheerleading are simply not worth the potential physical dangers. Some members of the broader community have raised questions about the appropriateness of social media attacks on school officials. Critics argue that the unfounded animosity is not productive and serves only to create a negative environment for students and school staff alike. Despite the criticisms and pushback, Principal Sands has remained resolute in her decision to prioritize student safety. She has defended the gymnastic cheerleading ban, stating that it is necessary to ensure the well-being of all students in the school. While many parents and members of the community continue to debate the merits and drawbacks of the ban, it appears that Principal Sands is determined to stand firm in her conviction. Regardless of public opinion, she has made it clear that students’ safety is of the utmost importance, and she will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure their physical well-being.
