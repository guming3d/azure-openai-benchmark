article: (CNN) -- Eduard Shevardnadze, whose political career seesawed between two extremes, has died, Georgia's GHN news agency reported Monday. He was 86. Around the world, he was hailed as the man who helped end the Cold War. At home, he was the man whose resignation as president of Georgia was greeted by cheers and fireworks. Born in Georgia in 1928, he worked his way up the Communist Party chain until he became the foreign minister for the Soviet Union under President Mikhail Gorbachev. It was then that Gorbachev announced his policy of "perestroika," or change, in the Soviet Union. Shevardnadze was the international face of it. Perestroika led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Shevardnadze helped broker the deal that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall, and he normalized Moscow's ties with Washington. The breakup of the Soviet empire gave birth to many independent republics; Georgia was one of them. Shevardnadze went home to preside over the infant nation. When he replaced ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia in 1992, Shevardnadze was expected to bring the country's 4.5 million people a better life. Instead, according to the watchdog group Transparency International, corruption became endemic during his 11 years in charge. Georgia landed on a list of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world. "In the West, we think of Shevardnadze as a man who helped to peacefully end the Soviet Union, but here he became a despised man, and people described him as a dictator whom they simply could not stand having in power anymore," CNN correspondent Jill Dougherty said at the time. Renewed hope for the future came with Shevardnadze's promise of free and democratic elections. But the day after 2003's parliamentary vote, hopes faded when the election commission's first figures showed Shevardnadze's party in the lead. The opposition cried fraud, and the protests began -- around the clock for more than a week. Bad news came again on November 6 when officials announced a two-week delay in releasing final results. Shevardnadze tried to work things out with the opposition, but the talks failed, and up to 20,000 protesters converged on the capital city to demand his resignation. But Shevardnadze refused to step down and convened the newly elected Parliament. To many Georgians, it reflected just one more broken promise. Tired of his presidency, Georgians ushered in the bloodless Rose Revolution. Amid huge pressure from tens of thousands of protesters, Shevardnadze stepped down. "At the beginning, I had a different mood, but now I see that it is impossible to avoid bloodshed. I never betrayed my people," he said. "Now, I say it's much better to resign with no bloodshed, no victims." People we lost in 2014 .

chatgpt: Eduard Shevardnadze, a prominent political figure in both Soviet and post-Soviet Russia, has passed away at the age of 86. Shevardnadze was a crucial figure in ending the Cold War and served as Mikhail Gorbachev's Foreign Minister from 1985-1991. During his tenure, he played a pivotal role in negotiations with the United States and other Western powers, leading to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Shevardnadze went on to become President of Georgia in 1995. His time in office, however, was marred by accusations of corruption and mismanagement. Shevardnadze's administration was accused of widespread corruption, with allegations of embezzlement and bribery swirling around both the President and his closest advisors. Despite these serious allegations, Shevardnadze remained in power until his resignation in 2003. His resignation was greeted with cheers and fireworks as crowds took to the streets of Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, to celebrate his departure. Shevardnadze had faced mounting pressure from protesters demanding his resignation, and ultimately chose to step down rather than face impeachment. Despite the accusations of corruption that plagued Shevardnadze's presidency, his legacy as a key figure in ending the Cold War remains an important one. His work as Foreign Minister helped pave the way for improved relations between the Soviet Union and the West, and his efforts to negotiate arms reduction agreements were instrumental in reducing tensions between the two superpowers. Shevardnadze's passing represents the loss of a significant figure in modern Russian history. While his later years were tainted by the accusations of corruption that plagued his presidency, his early work as Foreign Minister served as a beacon of hope during a time of great political tension. His memory will continue to be honored as an important part of the story of the end of the Cold War. In honor of Shevardnadze's passing, both Russian and Georgian officials have issued statements expressing their condolences. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Shevardnadze "a brilliant statesman and a true patriot," while Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili praised his work in promoting democracy and fostering better relations with Russia. As the world reflects on the life and legacy of Eduard Shevardnadze, it is clear that his contributions to modern history will be remembered for generations to come.
