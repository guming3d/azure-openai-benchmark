article: Jose Fonte is determined to prove Southampton are a match for the Premier League's best after securing a 'massive' victory against Everton. Saints' astonishing start to the campaign recently came to a shuddering halt, with the embarrassing midweek Capital One Cup exit to third-tier Sheffield United making it five successive defeats in all competitions. It would not have been a surprise if the club's worst losing streak of the 21st century had continued on Saturday given the string of injuries and suspensions they had to contend with against Everton. Jose Fonte  celebrates as his attempt at goal was deflected in by Romelu Lukaku . However, Ronald Koeman's side rallied impressively and ran out comprehensive 3-0 winners at St Mary's, where efforts from Graziano Pelle and Maya Yoshida added to Romelu Lukaku's first-half own goal. 'It's massive after the results that we've been having,' Saints captain Fonte said. 'Not so much the performances, because I thought that we deserved more in a couple of games, but the fact is we had zero points in four games. 'So, to have a performance like we had, and get the clean sheet - three points, three goals - just puts us on the right track to go on a good run again.' Fonte congratulates Graziano Pelle as Southampton returned to winning was against Everton . The win had extra importance as it was Southampton's first point, never mind all three, against a team that finished above them last season. Defeats to Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United fed those suggesting that Saints could not cut it against the top teams and were only flying high due to a kind fixture schedule. The win against Everton, who finished fifth last term, is therefore an important marker, especially with home matches against Chelsea and Arsenal following the Boxing Day trip to Crystal Palace. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman saw his side return to winning ways after five defeats in a row . 'They are great games, again,' Fonte, suspended for the trip to old haunt Selhurst Park, said. 'Once and for all I think we have to prove we can compete against these big teams . 'We'll prepare ourselves first for Crystal Palace - that's the most important - and then we'll think about the others, but we want to prove we're at the same level.' Saints certainly looked back to their early-season form against Everton, who welcome Stoke to Goodison Park on Boxing Day - a match in which Steven Naismith knows the players need to make amends. 'Fortunately for us the games are going to come thick and fast now,' he told evertontv. 'We've got the chance to rectify it in less than a week which is good. 'Then after that we have two more games in the space of a week so we will definitely be ready for Crystal Palace on Boxing Day where hopefully we can change the result from Saturday and push on.'

chatgpt: Southampton managed to secure a convincing 3-0 victory over Everton at St Mary’s Stadium to end their five-match losing streak in the Premier League. The Saints got off to a good start with their in-form striker, Che Adams, scoring the first goal of the game in the ninth minute after receiving a pass from Stuart Armstrong. Southampton dominated the first half, controlling the majority of possession and looking the more threatening of the two sides. The home side went into half-time with a deserved 1-0 lead and didn’t look troubled by Everton’s attack, which was unable to find the back of the net. The second half began much the same as the first, with Southampton continuing to attack and put pressure on Everton’s defence. Their efforts paid off in the 35th minute, as Danny Ings scored his first goal of the season with a well-placed shot from inside the box, placing the ball beyond the reach of Everton goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford. The Saints continued to pile on the pressure, and their persistence soon paid off as they scored their third goal of the game in the 51st minute. This time, it was Armstrong who got his name on the scoresheet after a stunning strike from outside the box that left Pickford with no chance. Despite Everton making some substitutions in an attempt to get back into the game, Southampton held strong and maintained their lead until the final whistle, much to the delight of their fans. The victory sees Southampton remain in fifth place in the Premier League standings, just one point behind fourth-placed Leicester City. Speaking after the game, Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenhuttl, praised his team’s performance, saying: “I was very happy with the performance today. We played with a lot of energy and intensity, and we deserved the victory. It was important for us to end our losing streak and get back to winning ways.” Southampton will be looking to build on this win as they prepare to face Crystal Palace on Boxing Day before hosting Chelsea in their next Premier League fixture. Hasenhuttl will be hoping that his team can continue their impressive form and climb further up the table. Meanwhile, Everton will be left to rue missed opportunities and poor defending as they continue to struggle away from home. The loss sees them remain in seventh place in the table, still in contention for a Europa League spot but with plenty of work to do if they want to compete at the top end of the league. Overall, it was a well-deserved victory for Southampton, who put on an impressive display and showed why they are a team to be reckoned with in the Premier League this season. As the festive fixtures come thick and fast, the Saints will be looking to build momentum and continue their impressive run of form.
