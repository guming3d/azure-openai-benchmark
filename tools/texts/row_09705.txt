article: A stressful job and lifestyle could damage a person's short-term memory in old age, scientists have warned. A study at the University of Iowa has found a potential link between a hormone and short-term memory loss in older people. It revealed that having high levels in cortisol - a natural hormone in the body, which increases when a person is stressed - can lead to memory lapses as a person ages. High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can increase the risk of short-term memory loss in old age, researchers have warned . Short-term increases in cortisol levels are vital for survival. The hormone allows a person to cope, helping the body to respond to life's challenges by making it more alert and allowing a person to think on their feet. But abnormally high or prolonged spikes in cortisol, which can happen when a person is dealing with long-term stressful situations, can lead to digestion problems, anxiety, weight gain and high blood pressure, studies have shown. Jason Radley, an assistant psychology professor at the University of Iowa, said: 'Stress hormones are one mechanism that we believe leads to weathering of the brain. 'Like a rock on the shoreline, after years and years it will eventually break down and disappear.' Scientists linked the raised levels of cortisol to the gradual loss of synapses in the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that houses short-term memory. Synapses are the connections that help the brain process, store and recall information. As a person ages, repeated and long-term exposure to cortisol, can cause synapses to shrink and disappear. While previous research has shown . cortisol produces similar affects in other regions of the ageing brain, . this is the first study to examine its impact on the prefrontal cortex, . the university said. Researchers discovered prolonged exposure to high levels of the hormone affected the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is responsible for short-term memory . Although . the results are preliminary findings, scientists said they could . provide the basis for research into how short-memory decline in ageing . adults could be slowed or prevented. The study,Â published in the Journal of Neuroscience,  could also raise the possibility of finding treatments that reduce cortisol levels in susceptible individuals. It could mean treating people who have naturally high levels of cortisol, including those who are depressed, or those who experience repeated, long-term stress due to traumatic life events, such as the death of a loved one. The study found short-term memory lapses linked to high levels of cortisol begin to affect a person around the age of 65. But researchers warned that it is important to remember that stress hormones are only one of a host of factors which affect mental decline and memory loss as a person ages.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Iowa has found a correlation between high levels of stress hormone cortisol and lapses in short-term memory in individuals over the age of 65. The findings could prove instrumental in developing new treatments for age-related memory loss, which is a significant concern for many older adults. The study, which was led by psychology professor Jason Radley and his team, aimed to explore the impact of stress hormones on brain health in older adults. The research focused on the relationship between cortisol levels and changes to the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a crucial role in forming and retrieving memories. The researchers collected data from over 1,000 participants, measuring their cortisol levels and administering memory tests. The results of the study showed that individuals with higher cortisol levels were more likely to experience lapses in short-term memory. According to Professor Radley, stress hormones are one mechanism that leads to the "weathering" of the brain, which can have a negative impact on memory and cognitive function. He added that the findings of the study underscore the importance of managing stress levels and engaging in activities that promote brain health as individuals age. The study found that the loss of short-term memory typically appeared around the age of 65, which is consistent with previous research on age-related cognitive decline. The researchers hope that their findings will encourage researchers to explore new treatment options for memory loss, particularly those that aim to reduce stress and promote brain health. While there is no cure for age-related memory loss, there are several strategies that individuals can employ to help maintain cognitive function over time. In addition to managing stress levels, experts recommend engaging in regular physical activity, getting enough sleep, and maintaining a healthy diet. The findings of the study could prove particularly relevant for individuals who are at risk for developing conditions like Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized in part by memory loss and cognitive decline. By understanding the mechanisms that contribute to memory loss, researchers may be better able to develop treatments and interventions that can slow or even prevent the progression of these conditions. While more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between stress hormones and memory loss, the study at the University of Iowa represents an important step forward in our understanding of how brain health changes over time. As the population continues to age, finding effective ways to promote healthy cognitive function will become increasingly important, and the findings of this study could prove crucial in developing new treatments and interventions to help support brain health in older adults.
