article: By . Peter Lloyd . Hugh Grant has urged Britain to reintroduce National Service, saying:  ‘It goes with our personality. It suits us.’ Although the actor has never served in the  Forces, he paid tribute  to Britain’s military  tradition, which made heroes of his forefathers. Speaking at last week’s launch of singer and photographer Bryan Adams’s book Wounded: The Legacy Of War, Grant, 54, said: ‘My father and grandfather both served and it shaped them. Ideal: The actor said Britain is an ideal nation for military service because 'we get on with things' ‘National Service can definitely benefit society. Britain is an ideal nation  for military service because we get on with things.’ Calling for a return to National Service is usually the preserve of Tory politicians, but Grant added: ‘I have left views, but I also have right views.’ The actor’s grandfather Major James Murray Grant served with the Seaforth Highlanders and  was awarded a Distinguished Service Order  for bravery and leadership during the Second World War. He had defied an order to surrender to overwhelming German troops when stranded at St Valery-en-Caux, France, after the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation. Grant’s father, also called James, trained at Sandhurst and spent eight years in the Army. Hero: Major James Grant, Hugh's grandfather, won the Distinguished Service Order for bravery and leadership during the Second World War . But the millionaire actor admitted that ‘probably the closest I’ll get’ to military service is playing a  naval intelligence commander in Guy Ritchie’s forthcoming film The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Tory MP Philip Hollobone, who has drawn up a Private Member’s Bill calling for Britain to reintroduce National Service, said: ‘Hugh is clearly a very sensible chap. Now he has spoken out I hope we can eventually secure a debate in Parliament.’ However, an online campaign to prevent the return of National Service has 35,000 supporters.

chatgpt: British actor Hugh Grant recently shared his views on mandatory military service during an interview. The 54-year-old actor expressed that he believes it would be an ideal policy for the country as it teaches discipline and helps young people to make the transition into adulthood. Grant, who comes from a family with a military background, revealed that both his father and grandfather served in the military. His grandfather, Major James Grant, was honoured with a medal for bravery during World War II. The "Notting Hill" actor said that his experience working alongside ex-military actors on the set of the movie "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain" gave him a deeper appreciation for the skills that come with military training. He added that he believes mandatory military service could also bring benefits in terms of community building. "We get on with things; we work hard; we learn to support each other. So, it would be ideal,” Grant expressed. While there are pros and cons to mandatory military service, Grant's viewpoint adds to the ongoing debate on the topic across various countries. Critics typically argue that mandatory military service is a violation of individual freedom and that it can lead to discrimination, abuse, and exploitation. On the other hand, proponents of the policy defend it as an effective means of promoting national security, imparting discipline and a sense of civic responsibility among citizens, and bringing people from different social backgrounds together. Grant is not the first British citizen to express support for mandatory military service. In 2015, a poll conducted by the British Army revealed that over 60% of the UK's population were in favour of some form of national service. Whether or not mandatory military service will ever be implemented in the UK remains to be seen. But with the rise of global security concerns, it is a topic that is likely to remain on the public agenda for some time to come.
