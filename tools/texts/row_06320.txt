Liu Hsiung is suing a hospital in China after he found his dead wife alone on an operating table following the birth of their child . Hsiung, 29, had asked nurses for updates on his wife Zhang Chun, 27, after he was warned she was suffering critical complications . Hours later Hsuing finally managed to force his way into the operating theatre, where he found his wife's body on the table with a cleaner sitting nearby smoking a cigarette and eating a coconut. The baby survived the birth. He said: 'I was going out of my mind outside wondering what had happened, yet they had gone home and my dead wife was left on a table in front of a guy eating his lunch.' He added: 'When I got into the room it was too late she was already dead and none of the surgical or medical team were anywhere to be seen.' Hospital officials have said complications arose after Hsiung and his wife Chun refused a Caesarean section because the baby was so large. A hospital spokesman said: 'After giving birth, the patient suffered from excessive bleeding. 'As an emergency her uterus was removed after five hours, but it was not enough to save her, and she passed away that night.' Hospital officials have said complications arose after Hsiung and his wife Chun (pictured) refused a Caesarean section because the baby was so large . An official inquiry found Chun died of a rare condition, an amniotic fluid embolism. But Hsiung is suing hospital authorities for compensation claiming they bungled the delivery. 'The reason they kept me away for so long was to give themselves time to cook up their story and get rid of incriminating evidence,' he said. 'But I want to see all the papers, all the medical records and all the statements,' added Hsiung. A hospital spokesman confirmed: 'We are in negotiations with the patient's husband and family over compensation. We admit that not everything went as it should have done in this case.'

chatgpt: Husband Finds Wife Dead on Operating Table After Requesting Updates From Nurses Liu Hsiung is mourning the loss of his wife after a routine C-section procedure resulted in her unexpected death. Hsiung had requested updates from the nurses about his wife's condition after being warned about complications, but was repeatedly told she was in the operating theatre. However, Hsiung was suspicious because it looked as if the theatre was closed with nobody inside. Hours later, Hsiung forced his way into the operating room to find his wife's lifeless body lying on the table.   The tragedy occurred at a hospital in the eastern province of Fujian, China. According to a statement released by the hospital, Hsiung's wife died of a rare condition known as an amniotic fluid embolism, where amniotic fluid or other debris enters the mother's blood system and triggers an allergic-like reaction. Following the incident, an official inquiry was launched to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death. The hospital claimed that the medical team did everything they could to save Hsiung's wife, but tragically, the condition was too severe to be treated. The local health authorities have also launched an investigation into the incident to determine if any medical negligence occurred. Hsiung has called for a thorough investigation into the matter, stating that he believes the hospital was trying to cover up their mistake. The tragic death of Hsiung's wife has once again highlighted the issues surrounding medical negligence in China. In recent years, there have been several high-profile incidents where patients have died due to medical errors or faulty equipment in hospitals across the country. The Chinese government has made efforts to improve the quality of healthcare services in the country and crack down on medical malpractice. However, the problem persists, and incidents like Hsiung's wife's death raise serious concerns about the safety and quality of medical care in China. As Hsiung continues to mourn the loss of his wife, his experience has become a cautionary tale for patients across the country who place their trust in healthcare professionals to provide them with adequate care. The incident has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability within the Chinese healthcare system to ensure that incidents like this do not continue to occur in the future.
