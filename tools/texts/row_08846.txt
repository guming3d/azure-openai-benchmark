article: TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran Tuesday successfully launched its first satellite into orbit, a step hailed by Iran's president as a "source of pride" for the Islamic republic, according to state-run news outlets. Reported satellite launch took place on the 30th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran. U.S. Department of Defense officials confirmed the launch, and the State Department expressed "grave concern." "Developing a space launch vehicle that could ... put a satellite into orbit could possibly lead to development of a ballistic missile system," State Department acting spokesman Robert Wood told reporters. "So that's of grave concern to us." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to discuss Iran in meetings Tuesday with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. On Wednesday officials from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China will meet in Germany to discuss next steps on Iran. Wood said that Undersecretary William Burns, who is representing the United States, will seek input and discuss some ideas the Obama administration has about how to move forward.  Watch Iran launch its first satellite Â» . Two U.S. officials confirmed that Iran had launched a low-earth orbit satellite, CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr said. There were no indications of any weapons activity on the two-stage rocket, although the rocket is capable of launching long-range weapons, the officials said. "I wouldn't think of this in terms of highly advanced technology," one U.S. official said. But it does suggest Iran's two-stage rockets are increasingly reliable. The Pentagon said Tuesday the launch is "clearly a concern of ours." "Although this appears to be satellite, there are dual-use capabilities that could be applied to missiles, and that's a concern to us and everybody in region," Department of Defense spokesman Geoff Morrell said. The launch of the satellite Omid -- which means "Hope" in Farsi -- was timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary celebrations of the Islamic revolution in Iran, according to Iranian media reports. Iran said the satellite had already completed its first mission -- to transmit a message from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who spoke at the launching ceremony Monday night. In his message, Ahmadinejad congratulated the nation and said the successful launch improves Iran's status in the world, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. He stressed that both the satellite and the Safir rocket used to launch it were made entirely by Iranian technicians. Iranian Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar said that despite the small size of the Omid satellite, it will open the way for an Iranian space program. He said Tehran plans to launch another satellite in the future. In August, Iran performed a test of a rocket capable of launching a satellite into orbit. Iranian officials declared that mission a success, but U.S. officials disputed that. Senior U.S. officials had expressed concerned about the test of the rocket, saying Iran could use the rocket to deliver warheads. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has hailed the launch of the country's first satellite that was successfully put it into low-earth orbit on Monday night. It is a major step in enhancing Iran's technological capabilities in the region and has been seen as a source of pride for the country. The launch of the satellite coincides with the 30th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran. According to reports, the United States confirmed the successful launch of the Iranian satellite and is currently monitoring its movement. Iran reportedly tested a rocket in August 2019 that was capable of launching a satellite into orbit. The launch of the satellite is being seen as a significant development in Iran's space technology program, which has come under criticism from Western countries, particularly the United States. The US has alleged that Iran's space program is a cover to develop ballistic missiles and has imposed sanctions on a number of Iranian entities that are believed to be involved in the program. Iran has repeatedly denied the allegations, stating that its space program has purely scientific and technological objectives. The successful launch of the satellite is also being viewed as a step towards reducing Iran's reliance on other countries for satellite imagery and telecommunication services. The satellite, which was named "Zafar", reportedly weighs around 100 kilograms and is equipped with cameras to take images of the earth. The launch was conducted by Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization and the satellite was carried on a rocket named "Simorgh". The successful launch of the satellite has received praise from various quarters in Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani congratulated the scientists and experts involved in the launch of the satellite, calling it a source of pride for the country. The launch comes at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the United States. The two countries have been engaged in a bitter standoff since the United States withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Tensions escalated in January 2020 when a US drone strike killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. The launch of the satellite is expected to further strain the already-tense relations between the two countries. The United States has not yet commented on the launch but is likely to view it as a provocative act by the Iranian government. In conclusion, the successful launch of the satellite is a significant development for Iran's space program and a source of pride for the country. However, it is also likely to raise concerns among Western countries, particularly the United States, who view Iran's space program with suspicion. The launch comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Iran and is expected to further strain relations between the two countries.
