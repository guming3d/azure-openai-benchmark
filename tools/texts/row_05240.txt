Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has been pictured on state television just hours after rebels claimed to have attack his motorcade with shells. The dictator was on his way to a mosque in Damascus today to celebrate the end of Ramadan when he apparently came under fire from the Free Syrian Army. But government officials denied the claim, and a TV station controlled by the regime broadcast footage of Assad praying alongside the country's grand mufti.

The Tahrir al-Sham rebel brigade said it fired several artillery shells towards Assad's convoy in the heart of the capital and that at least some hit their target. If confirmed, the attack would be one of the most direct against Assad in two years of civil war which have pitted mainly Sunni rebels against the Alawite president. Rebels have targeted Assad's residences in Damascus and a bombing in the capital last year killed four of his inner circle, but there have been no reports of Assad himself coming under fire. Video footage distributed by the rebels apparently showed smoke rising from the Malki district, where Assad and his close aides have homes. Other activists also reported rocket fire into the area. However, the government information minister Omran Zoabi said: 'The news is wholly untrue.' Prayer: Assad and his ministers were attending celebrations for Eid ul-Fitr, the end of Ramadan . Smiling: Assad has denied claims that his motorcade was hit with rockets fired by rebel fighters . Firas al-Bitar, head of Tahrir al-Sham, said his fighters had carried out reconnaissance of the route of Assad's motorcade and fired 120mm artillery towards the president's convoy early on Thursday. 'The attack rattled the regime, even if Assad was not hit,' he said. 'There were two motorcades, one containing Assad and a decoy - we targeted the correct one.' Bitar's brigade operates mainly in the Ghouta region of Damascus. Another Tahrir al-Sham official said Assad's forces fired rockets and artillery 'like rain' on the region in response to the reported attack. Following the statement, Syrian state television showed footage of Assad praying with ministers and other top officials. It said the footage was from Thursday's Eid ul-Fitr prayers at the Anas bin Malek Mosque in Malki. Assad appeared unharmed and smiled at the worshippers as he entered the mosque.

Islam Alloush of the Liwa al-Islam, another rebel brigade, said that rebels fired rockets which struck Assad's motorcade. 'Assad was not hit but the information we have based from sources within the regime is that there were casualties within his entourage,' he added. More than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in Syria's civil war, which began as a largely peaceful uprising in March 2011.

chatgpt: In a dramatic turn of events, an opposition group claims to have targeted the motorcade of President Bashar al-Assad with rockets on the first day of Eid al-Adha. However, the regime has denied the claims, and state TV has shown footage of al-Assad apparently visiting a mosque for Eid celebrations. The incident occurred in the Syrian capital, Damascus, as the president's convoy was travelling through an area that has been subjected to multiple attacks in the past. The opposition group, which remains unidentified, released a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, saying they had successfully hit the motorcade with rockets. The statement further elaborated that the group had planned the attack as part of their ongoing efforts to remove al-Assad from power. However, the regime has refuted the claims, stating that there was no attack on the president's motorcade. State TV has aired footage that appears to show al-Assad visiting a mosque for Eid celebrations. The footage shows the president interacting with people and walking around the mosque, apparently unfazed by the alleged attack on his motorcade. The incident has raised concerns about the stability of the regime, which has been facing opposition from multiple groups since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011. With the country already facing high levels of violence and instability, any further escalation could have dire consequences. The claim of responsibility by the unidentified opposition group has sparked fears of retaliation by the regime, as well as the possibility of further attacks. The international community has called for calm and urged all parties to avoid any actions that could lead to further violence. The incident has also raised questions about the effectiveness of the regime's security measures, and whether they are capable of protecting al-Assad from such attacks. The opposition group's claim of responsibility raises the possibility of more attacks in the future, and underscores the need for greater security measures in the country. The Syrian civil war has been ongoing for nearly eight years, and has left the country in a state of chaos and destruction. The war has resulted in the displacement of millions of people and has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Multiple groups are battling for control of the country, and the situation remains fluid and volatile. In conclusion, the claim by an opposition group to have targeted the motorcade of President Bashar al-Assad with rockets on the first day of Eid al-Adha has raised concerns about the stability of the regime, and sparked fears of retaliation and further attacks. While the regime has denied the claims and state TV has shown footage of al-Assad visiting a mosque for Eid celebrations, the incident highlights the ongoing violence and instability in the country. The international community has called for calm, and urged all parties to avoid actions that could lead to further violence and instability in Syria.
