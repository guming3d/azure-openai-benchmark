article: There is always a group of children waiting to hand the Queen the customary posy of flowers when she walks out of morning service. But yesterday Prince Philip was also given his own treat when the couple emerged from a church in West Newton, Norfolk. As Her Majesty smiled as she looked on, the Duke of Edinburgh appeared equally delighted to receive a bag of sweets from a young well-wisher outside the church in the heart of the Sandringham Estate. Sweet treat: Prince Philip was given a bag of Morrisons chocolate éclairs by a young girl, left, after attending a church service in West Newton, Norfolk . Inedible gifts: As has become tradition, the Queen accepted bouquets of flowers from waiting children . The sweets - an 89p bag of own-brand chocolate éclairs from Morrisons - were later spotted on the Prince's lap as he was driven away. Parents crowded round with camera phones to capture the moment as their sons and daughters bravely stepped forward to meet the monarch - while some hung shyly back. The bouquets are often tactfully placed in a separate car by one of the Queen's security team. But the éclairs seemed to find a special place in the Prince's heart, and was spotted still on his lap as the Royal car pulled away. The Royal pair had attended a service at the Church of St Peter and Paul, which is on the Sandringham estate. Happy and glorious: The Queen beamed as excited parents and children crowded round in the sunshine . Spectators: During the service, the Queen and Prince saw a Biblical play performed by Sunday school children . According to local media, the Queen and Philip had just enjoyed a performance of a Biblical play - Whither Thou Go'est - performed by children at the church's Sunday School. The monarch often accepts flowers after morning service when she is staying at Sandringham, although in recent weeks the practice has become a little haphazard. Last week the Queen dashed straight to her waiting car because of heavy rain, following successive Sundays in which she has accepted bouquets of flowers. She had refused to accept flowers from children for two Sundays over Christmas and New Year, reportedly because she had to collect so many on Christmas Day she was late for lunch.

chatgpt: Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, made a visit to West Newton, Norfolk on Sunday where they attended a church service. The Queen was met by a group of children who lined the entrance of the church and were eager to give her the traditional gift of bouquets of flowers. However, it was the Duke of Edinburgh who ended up receiving a special treat during their visit. A young girl, in a gesture of kindness, presented the Duke with a pack of sweets from a brand which carries her name. The Duke of Edinburgh was visibly pleased with his unexpected gift and even showed his appreciation by opening the packet and trying one of the sweets. The couple's visit to the church in West Newton, which is about 100 miles northeast of London, was a part of their stay at Sandringham Estate. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh often spend their time at Sandringham Estate in Norfolk during the Christmas holidays. The royal couple's visit to the church was not just another regular visit, as it was said to be a special occasion in the local community. Church officials had even arranged additional seating for those who had come to catch a glimpse of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh has been married for over 70 years and have a long history of supporting the Church of England. The Royal Family is known to frequently attend church services and has been attending the Church of England since its establishment. The Queen was dressed in a light green outfit and a matching hat, while the Duke of Edinburgh wore a navy blue suit with a purple tie. The couple, both in their nineties, appeared to be in good spirits during the visit and seemed to enjoy the warm welcome they received from the local community. As the visit came to an end, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were seen leaving the church, waving at the gathered crowd as they made their way towards their car. For the young girl who gave the Duke of Edinburgh the packet of sweets from her own brand, it will surely be a moment she won't forget anytime soon.
