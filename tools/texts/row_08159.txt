article: By . Rachel Reilly . Toys that contain powerful lasers such as the lightsaber could cause permanent eye damage . Toys that contain small lasers could cause serious injuries and even blindness, health authorities have warned. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has flagged up that many toys, such as lightsabers and spinning tops, contain powerful lasers that can cause permanent damage to the eye. Laser injuries do not usually hurt, but vision can deteriorate slowly over time. These injuries may go unnoticed for days and even weeks, and could be permanent, they said. ‘A beam shone directly into a person's eye can injure it in an instant, especially if the laser is a powerful one,' Dan Hewett, health promotion officer at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in an FDA release. He said that the toys that most typically cause damage include lasers mounted on toy guns that can be used for aiming, spinning tops that project beams while they spin, hand-held lasers used during play as lightsabers and lasers intended for entertainment that create optical effects in an open room. He added that advertisers often promote their toys as playthings, so parents and children believe they're harmless. But this is often not the case and vigilance must be maintained by parents while children play with the electronic toys. In recent years, the power of lasers has increased while prices have fallen, Mr Hewitt added. Laser injuries don't usually hurt, but vision can deteriorate slowly over time with injuries going unnoticed for days and even weeks . The FDA recommends that users never aim or shine a laser directly at any person or animal. In some cases the light energy from a laser aimed into the eye can be even more dangerous than staring directly into the sun. They also advise not to aim a laser at any reflective surface. In addition to this, they say to keep in mind that the startling effect of a bright beam of light can cause serious accidents when aimed at a driver in a car or lead to injuries among people doing other activities, such as playing sports.

chatgpt: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has raised an alarming concern that has been overlooked for far too long. Many toys, especially toy guns, that are marketed and meant for children contain lasers that could potentially damage the retina of the eye. Laser injuries typically go unnoticed as they do not cause any pain, but they can slowly deteriorate vision over a period of several days and even weeks. Parents are being urged to pay close attention to the toys their children are playing with, especially those that contain lasers. While laser pointers have been the focus of safety warnings over the years, it appears that toy manufacturers are yet to fully comprehend the extent of the damage that lasers can cause. According to the FDA, lasers with powers of 5 milliwatts or more can damage the retina after only a few seconds of direct exposure. The FDA warns that it is not enough for toy manufacturers to include safety instructions on the packaging alone. Parents must be actively involved in ensuring that their children play with toys that are not harmful to their health. The damage caused by laser injuries may not necessarily be immediately noticeable, which makes it even more critical that parents take all the necessary precautions. The effects of a laser injury to the retina can be severe and long-lasting. The retina is the part of the eye that captures light and sends signals to the brain, allowing us to see. Any damage to the retina can cause blurry vision or even partial blindness. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for a damaged retina, so prevention is truly the only solution. The FDA has been pushing for better regulations regarding the use of lasers in children's toys for years, and they are now encouraging parents to report any toy that they believe contains dangerous lasers. The agency has also emphasized that it is imperative for children to understand the seriousness of the situation and the potential risks involved in playing with toys that contain lasers. In conclusion, the U.S. FDA's warning about the potential dangers of lasers in children's toys should not be taken lightly. Parents must prioritize their children's safety by remaining vigilant about the toys they buy and actively monitoring their playtime. The consequences of a laser injury may be irreversible, and it is crucial for everyone to take proactive measures to prevent them.
