A Texas mother has been arrested after she threw her child out of the car on a busy freeway and ordered him to walk home. Angela Garcia, 34, was arguing with her 10-year-old son and decided to punish him by having him make his own way down a freeway southeast of Houston. The boy walked in the dark for about 15 minutes before authorities stopped him, League City police said. Local police received a report of a child walking on the freeway shoulder at around 8.30PM. The police vehicle that picked him up eventually encountered Ms Garcia, parked on the shoulder of the Interstate 45, known as Gulf Freeway. She had been driving 300ft in front of the boy, but he had not been able to see the car as it was dark outside. League City Police has charged Ms Garcia with Abandoning or Endangering a Child after the incident. ‘Making your child walk home on I-45 at 8.30 at night in the dark, in a busy stretch where many fatalities have occurred that is crossing the line,’ League City Police Officer Reagan Pena told MyFoxHouston.com. ‘It's on a major roadway. There are many cars going, it's also a stretch of freeway we've had many fatalities in the last month. The child truly was in danger.’ ‘The way things are, he could have been kidnapped, killed,’ a League City resident told told KHOU-TV.com. ‘That’s not right. You don’t treat children like that. Either take care of your kids or you don’t have any.’ High-risk punishment: The boy was picked up by police by the Interstate 45 (pictured) after he had walked on the freeway shoulder for 15 minutes . One of Ms Garcia’s neighbours told the website it was a surprise to hear of the incident, and said it was out of character for the mother-of-two. ‘I can’t believe it. They are a nice family,’ the neighbor said. ‘The boys are so nice.’ Garcia, a resident of League City, held Tuesday at the Galveston County jail on a $7,500 bond. The boy and his brother, who was also travelling in the car, have been released into the custody of their father.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a 10-year-old boy was found walking alone in the dark along the freeway in Houston, Texas. The police picked up the child after receiving a call from concerned motorists who noticed the boy walking along Interstate 45 near Crosstimbers. The police reported that the boy was upset and crying when they found him. He informed the officers that his mother, Angela Garcia, had forced him to walk along the busy freeway following an argument earlier in the night. Garcia, a 34-year-old resident of Houston, has been arrested and charged with abandoning or endangering a child. The police allege that Garcia put her son's life at risk by forcing him to walk on a busy freeway in the middle of the night. According to witness reports, the boy was walking on the shoulder of the freeway with no adult supervision. The witness who initially called the police said that they saw the boy walking near the northbound lanes of the freeway, wearing only shorts and a t-shirt, and carrying a backpack. The boy's safety was a top priority for the police, who immediately took him to a nearby hospital for a check-up. Fortunately, he did not suffer any injuries and was later released into the custody of his father, who was notified of the incident by the police. Child Protective Services was also notified of the incident and their investigation is still ongoing. The agency will determine if there is any evidence of neglect or abuse that may warrant the removal of the child from his mother's care. This incident has once again highlighted the crucial role of citizens in reporting cases of child endangerment or negligence to the authorities. According to child safety experts, it's vital for individuals to speak up if they see children in dangerous situations or being mistreated. Meanwhile, Angela Garcia remains in police custody, awaiting further legal proceedings. Her arrest has certainly raised questions about the impact of domestic arguments on children's safety and well-being, as well as highlighting the importance of seeking help and support in times of distress.
