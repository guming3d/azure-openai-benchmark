article: By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Shakira performs  at the 62nd annual BMI Pop Awards at the Regent Beverly Wilshire in California. Her hit song 'Loca' broke copyright rules according to a New York judge . A hit song performed by pop star Shakira was copied from another songwriter's work, a New York judge  has found. Shakira's Spanish-language version of Loca, released in 2010, infringed a song by Dominican singer Ramon Arias Vazquez, according to Judge Alvin Hellerstein. The song went on to sell more than five million copies and topped Billboard Magazine's Latin charts. It was a collaboration with Dominican rapper Eduard Edwin Bello Pou, known as El Cata – and was widely released as a single around the world. In a ruling on Tuesday, Judge Hellerstein said that  the hit single had been based on an earlier version of a song recorded by Bello, El Cata, which had been copied from Arias Vasquez's original song. 'There is no dispute that Shakira's version of the song was based on Bello's version,' wrote the judge in his ruling. 'Accordingly, I find that, since Bello had copied Arias, whoever wrote Shakira's version of the song also indirectly copied Arias,' he concluded. Ramon Arias Vazquez penned his song Loca con su Tiguere in the 1990s, but Bello denied copying it. Vasquez says he wrote and recorded the song after his sister had been caught up in a love triangle between a wealthy man  and her boyfriend, a 'Tiguere' — Dominican slang for 'street tough'. The singer-songwriter said he performed the song for rapper Bello in 2006 or 2007 when they met outside a rehearsal studio in the hope that he would record it. Loca was a collaboration with Dominican rapper Eduard Edwin Bello Pou, known as El Cata, and he is thought to have stolen the song from Ramon Arias Vazquez . But Bello claimed the song as his own. He later took the song to Shakira, who reworked it with him and rapper Pitbull, and put it out on her 2010 album 'Sale el Sol.' Shakira's song was distributed by Sony in both Spanish and English, but the copyright lawsuit mainly focused on the Spanish version. The English language version of Loca - which featured Dizzee Rascal - was 'not offered into evidence' at the trial. Neither version of Loca was released as a single in the UK. Damages have not yet been determined for the plaintiff, Mayimba Music, which holds the rights to Arias' work. The Colombian singer performed at the World Cup closing ceremony in Rio de Janeiro.

chatgpt: Shakira's hit single 'Loca' has been the subject of a long-standing legal battle over claims that it was indirectly copied from another songwriter. It has now been established that the Spanish-language version infringed a song by Ramon Arias Vazquez. According to reports, rapper Eduard 'Bello' Pou, who is also known as El Cata, stole the song and took it to Shakira. The track, which was released in 2010, sold more than five million copies worldwide. The case was brought before Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who ruled in favor of Vazquez on Tuesday. The damages have yet to be decided but it is expected to be several million dollars. The controversy began in 2011 when Vazquez's song 'Loca con su Tiguere' was brought to the attention of Shakira's legal team. The plaintiff claimed that El Cata had copied his song and used it as the basis for Shakira's hit single. Shakira initially denied the allegations, stating that she had never heard of Vazquez's song before recording 'Loca'. However, it became apparent that El Cata had played a key role in the creation of the track. The court heard that El Cata had taken Vazquez's song and changed the lyrics and melody, before presenting it to Shakira's team as his own work. Shakira's team then produced the track, which was released as a single in 2010. The legal battle has been ongoing since 2011, with various appeals and lengthy court proceedings. Shakira's defence team argued that the differences between the two songs were significant enough to prevent any claim of infringement. However, Judge Hellerstein disagreed, stating that 'Loca' was a clear copy of Vazquez's song. He ruled that the similarities were significant enough to prove that Shakira's team had knowingly used a copyrighted work without permission. The ruling is a significant victory for Vazquez, who has been battling for recognition and compensation for several years. In a statement after the ruling, Vazquez said: "I am very pleased with the decision of the court today. This has been a long and difficult battle, but I am glad that justice has been done. I hope that this case serves as a warning to others who may try to steal someone else's work." Shakira and El Cata have yet to comment on the ruling. It is unclear whether they plan to appeal the decision. The case is one of several recent legal battles involving plagiarism and copyright infringement in the music industry. It serves as a reminder that artists and producers must be careful to ensure that their work is original and does not infringe on the rights of others.
