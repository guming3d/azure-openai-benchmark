article: (Financial TImes) -- The Bank of Japan has lifted its assessment of Japan's economy, and underlined progress towards its price target by saying that inflation expectations "appear to be rising." In an upbeat statement following a two-day policy meeting, the BoJ said the world's third-largest economy is "recovering moderately", boosted by a pick-up in exports and investment in fixed assets by companies on the back of higher profits. Public investment is also rising, it noted, while the housing sector is looking stronger. As such, the BoJ kept its main policy settings on hold, as it has done every month since April, when governor Haruhiko Kuroda unveiled what he called a "new phase" of "quantitative and qualitative monetary easing." The aim is to hit a 2 per cent target for inflation by buying up huge amounts of assets, mostly longer-term bonds. This week the BoJ reported that Japan's monetary base expanded 42 per cent from a year earlier in August, to Y172tn ($1.72tn), marking an all-time high for the sixth straight month. Meanwhile, the balance of current accounts deposited at the BoJ more than doubled to Y84tn, as banks parked proceeds of bond sales. Analysts say that the BoJ is now at a delicate juncture in its easing programme, where it is hoping that so-called "bad inflation" caused by the drop in the yen since late last year is gradually replaced by "good inflation", signalling a virtuous cycle of demand. For now, the evidence is mixed. The Japan-style core measure of consumer price inflation, which excludes food but not energy, climbed to 0.7 per cent in July, its highest level in nearly five years. The US-style core measure, which strips out both food and energy, is also on a rising trend but is still negative, at minus 0.1 per cent in July. Prices for items such as housing, furniture and medical care all fell from a year earlier. Meanwhile, lending activity is still relatively subdued, with total loans rising 2.2 per cent in July. Base salaries are generally flat, or falling. However, prices are moving in line with the policy board's forecasts, which means that the BoJ is under little pressure to do more to try to force the index higher. The onus now shifts to the government, say analysts, as it prepares to address some of the structural reforms set out in the growth strategy of Shinzo Abe, prime minister. Abe wants to make Japan a more competitive place to invest and to do business, thus stimulating employment, incomes and consumption. "[BoJ] policy board members are continuing to shun 'incremental easing'", said Izumi Devalier, economist at HSBC in Hong Kong. She expects the BoJ to leave monetary conditions unchanged for the remainder of the fiscal year to April. "With the central bank out of the hot seat for now, the focus is squarely on the government."

chatgpt: Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), has decided to maintain its main policy settings unchanged, as it has done every month since April. The decision comes amid ongoing concerns about the country's economic growth and efforts by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to make the country a more competitive place to invest and do business. At its meeting this week, the BoJ decided to keep its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1% and its pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields at around 0%. The central bank also maintained its massive asset purchasing program, known as quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE), with an annual target of purchasing Â¥80 trillion ($720 billion) of Japanese government bonds. The BoJ's decision comes as the government looks to implement a series of economic reforms aimed at making Japan more attractive to foreign investors. Prime Minister Abe has highlighted his goal of boosting the country's competitiveness and increasing private sector investment. This week, the BoJ also released data showing that Japan's monetary base expanded by 42% from a year earlier in August. The monetary base, which includes cash in circulation and deposits at the central bank, is a key indicator of the BoJ's monetary policy. The increase reflects the central bank's continued efforts to stimulate the economy through monetary easing. However, despite these efforts, Japan's economy continues to struggle. In the second quarter of this year, Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted at an annualized rate of 1.2%. This marks the first contraction in two years and is a worrying sign for the country's economy. One of the main challenges facing Japan is an aging population and a shrinking workforce. This has led to a lack of demand and a stagnant economy, which has forced the government to implement a series of economic stimulus measures. Prime Minister Abe has also been working to implement structural reforms aimed at boosting the country's productivity and increasing its competitiveness. In recent years, Japan has also been engaged in a trade war with the United States, which has threatened its export-oriented economy. Despite these challenges, the BoJ remains committed to its policies aimed at supporting the economy. The central bank has reiterated its pledge to continue with its QQE program until inflation reaches its target of 2%. In a statement following the BoJ's decision, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank "will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary to achieve its inflation target." Overall, while Japan's economy continues to struggle, the BoJ's decision to maintain its monetary policy unchanged highlights the bank's commitment to supporting the country's economy. Prime Minister Abe's reforms aimed at boosting competitiveness and increasing private sector investment will likely play a critical role in Japan's economic recovery in the years ahead.
