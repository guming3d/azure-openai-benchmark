article: A retired soldier who sued Burger King after he found two needles in his sandwich has reached an out of court settlement with the fast food chain. Clark Bartholomew, a retired Army sergeant, claimed one needle pierced his tongue after biting into a Triple Stacker and the other lodged in his small intestine, requiring hospital treatment.

chatgpt: After finding two needles in his burger purchased at a Burger King franchise on Schofield Barracks, Honolulu, Clark Bartholomew decided to take legal action against the fast-food chain. According to the plaintiff, one needle had pierced his tongue, while the other had lodged in his small intestine.  Bartholomew's lawsuit not only targeted Burger King but also included the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange, the organization responsible for operating the franchise. However, a recent update revealed that Bartholomew has since reached a settlement with Burger King, as confirmed by his lawyer. The details of the settlement, including the amount paid, have not been disclosed.  Despite the settlement with Burger King, the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange is still facing trial over the incident. The exchange operates numerous fast-food franchises on military bases across the country, including Burger King, and Bartholomew's case could have implications beyond this single incident.  Following the incident, Burger King conducted an investigation and determined there was no evidence of tampering within the restaurant where Bartholomew purchased his burger. The company released a statement saying, "While we are saddened by this incident, it is important to note that we have strict food safety procedures in place, and the safety and well-being of our customers is our top priority."  Bartholomew is not the first person to find foreign objects in their fast food. Reports of customers finding everything from chicken heads to finger nails have plagued the fast-food industry for years. These incidents highlight the need for greater food safety measures to protect customers. Cases like Bartholomew's serve as a reminder to both consumers and fast-food chains to take food safety seriously. While customers have the right to expect safe and clean food, fast-food chains must ensure they have effective measures in place to prevent incidents like this from occurring.  As for Bartholomew, the details of the settlement are undisclosed, but the experience is sure to leave a lasting impression. It remains to be seen what impact the ongoing trial against the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange will have on fast-food chains and their customers.
