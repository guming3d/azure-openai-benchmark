Two councillors are locked in a libel court battle after one of them circulated a leaflet depicting his rival as Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses star. Plaid Cymru's Neil McEvoy, a former deputy leader of Cardiff City Council, claims the leaflet implied that he was 'not to be trusted'. However, Labour councillor Michael Michael, who distributed the image, insists that it was not meant to be taken literally. Court battle: Neil McEvoy, left, is suing Michael Michael, right, over a leaflet depicting him as Del Boy . The leaflet, which shows a cartoon of Del Boy superimposed with Mr McEvoy's face, was distributed in the Fairwater area of the Welsh capital. It carried a message saying it was 'printed and promoted' by Mr Michael, chair of the council's planning committee. Mr McEvoy is now suing Mr Michael, arguing that it is defamatory to refer to a public figure as 'Del Boy'. Barristers for the two rival councillors put forward legal arguments at a High Court hearing in Cardiff this week. David Hughes, for Mr McEvoy, said: 'We all know who Del Boy is. He's not to be trusted. He's a rogue. Which of us would like to be compared to Del Boy?' 'Rogue': The character played by David Jason in Only Fools and Horses was devoted to get-rich-quick schemes . But Hugh Tomlinson QC, for Mr Michael, said: 'The comparison between Del Boy and the claimant wouldn't be taken literally by readers of the leaflet. 'Suggesting that Councillor McEvoy is like Del Boy Trotter because he is a roguish character and a fantasist is obviously a comment rather than a statement of fact and can't be read in any other way.' The lawyer added that he was 'in a minority of one' because he had never watched Only Fools and Horses and did not previously know who Del Boy was. The leaflet was approved by local Assembly Member Mark Drakeford, Wales's health minister, the court heard. Judge Andrew Keyser QC reserved judgement in the case. Del Boy, played by David Jason in the long-running BBC comedy, was portrayed as a chancer with a love of get-rich-quick schemes.

chatgpt: In the run-up to Welsh parliament elections, the Labour candidate Michael Michael has been embroiled in a row over a campaign leaflet that depicts his Plaid Cymru rival Neil McEvoy as the Only Fools and Horses character Del Boy. McEvoy has claimed that the image implies he is an untrustworthy 'rogue', and that it is an attempt to smear his character. In a statement, he accused Michael of "descending into juvenile and insulting tactics". But Michael has insisted that the leaflet was not intended to be taken seriously. In a statement, he said, "I'm sorry if anybody has taken offence, but it was intended to be a bit of lighthearted fun. I've always had a good relationship with Neil, and I hope we can continue to disagree on policy without resorting to personal attacks." The leaflet, which shows McEvoy in a trademark Del Boy outfit, complete with gold chain and camel hair coat, has caused a stir on social media, with many people expressing surprise and shock at its content. The controversy over the leaflet has overshadowed other issues in the election campaign, with many voters expressing frustration that the candidates are focusing on personality rather than policy. One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said, "I don't care whether Neil McEvoy wears a camel hair coat or a Hawaiian shirt. I want to know what he's going to do for my community if he's elected to parliament." Despite the criticism, Michael has refused to withdraw the leaflet, saying that it is "perfectly legal and within the bounds of acceptable campaigning". The row between the two candidates underscores the importance of the Welsh parliament elections, which will determine the shape of the future government in Wales. With the contest likely to be closely contested, it is vital that candidates focus on the issues that matter to voters, rather than descending into personal attacks and name-calling. As the election draws near, it remains to be seen whether the controversy over the Del Boy leaflet will have any impact on the outcome. But one thing is clear: the Welsh public will be looking carefully at what each candidate has to offer, and making their choice based on policy, not personality.
