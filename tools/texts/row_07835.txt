article: By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Outrage: Rock Mill restaurant manager Chao Ya-hsin, 24, of Taiwan, holds the dish controversially named 'Long Live the Nazis' An Italian restaurant in Taiwan which named a dish on its menu 'Long Live the Nazis' has claimed it did so to 'help customers'. Chao Ya-hsin, 24, who manages the Rock Mill restaurant in Banciao, New Taipei City, said she did not realise the name would be offensive. She has since apologised for her lack of sensitivity over the title of the spaghetti dish - which contains German sausages and broccoli. She told the Wall Street Journal: 'When we were deciding on a name for this pasta dish, it never occurred to us that the word Nazi would stir up such controversy.' Ms Chao claims that for the past year the sickeningly-named meal has been one of her most popular dishes. The restaurant recently came under fire when a local TV station featured a story about it. Both the Israeli and German representative officers in Taiwan told the European Pressphoto Agency that they were appalled by the name of the dish, saying it showed a lack of understanding about the Nazis and their slaughter of the Jews. During the Holocaust, the Nazis killed approximately 15 million people, including Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, and prisoners of war in Russia and Poland. In response to the public outcry, Ms Chao said she now plans to rename the meals 'Long Live Purity'. She added: 'We hope from now on, customers who eat this dish will enjoy it in sheer joy.' Rock Mill's move to name a dish 'Long Live the Nazis' comes 14 years after a restaurant in the city covered their walls with photographs of Nazi concentration camps. The 192-seat restaurant, called 'Jail' featured emaciated faces of Jews incarcerated in Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps in framed photos. After it was reported, its owner took down the images, saying he did not know they were offensive.

chatgpt: In a bizarre turn of events, a Taiwanese restaurant manager has appalled her customers with a meal name that paid tribute to the Nazi regime. The incident occurred in Taichung, where Chao Ya-hsin, 24, is the manager of a popular restaurant. According to reports, Chao introduced a new dish called "Long Live Purity," which was a German sausage spaghetti dish. The meal name struck a chord with many customers who immediately pointed out the reference to the Nazi slogan 'Sieg Heil,' and the policy of racial purity promoted by the regime. When asked about the meal name, Chao appeared oblivious to the controversy surrounding it, insisting that it was simply a tribute to the quality of the ingredients used in the dish. However, she admitted that she was ignorant of the historical connotations of the phrase. The incident has sparked outrage and condemnation from the public and Jewish rights groups. Many have called for a boycott of the restaurant, while others have demanded an apology and the removal of the dish from the menu. In the aftermath of the uproar, Chao has vowed to rename the dish, saying that she did not know that it would stir up such controversy. The new name of the dish is yet to be announced. Many customers, however, are not convinced by Chao's explanation and have called for greater sensitivity from businesses towards historical and cultural issues. Some have criticized her for her lack of education, while others have pointed out that the use of Nazi symbols and language is banned in several countries, including Taiwan. The incident highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity and education, particularly in multi-cultural societies. It also serves as a reminder that businesses need to be mindful of their customers' feelings and should avoid confusion or offense, which might jeopardize their reputation. As the restaurant seeks to rebuild its image, most customers hope that Chao will choose a new name for the dish that reflects the shared values of respect and diversity, rather than promoting racial superiority or oppression. Until then, the story of the Nazi spaghetti dish is likely to remain in the public eye as a cautionary tale of cultural missteps and a need for greater awareness.
