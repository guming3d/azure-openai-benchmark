Symphony of the spheres: This amazing picture captures comet PanSTARRS as it streaks over Hohenzollern Castle, not to return for another 110,000 years. Photographer Stefan Seip spent the whole day planning the shot of the comet, which is named after the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System . Talking of the photo, taken last week, Stefan said: 'I used a whole day just planning to get this picture. The goal was to find a place far away from the castle, but with the setting comet above it. 'It was just a question of making sure I was in the right place at the right time. 'From this place, I used a really big telephoto lens to combine the castle as well as the comet in an appropriate size in one single image. Luckily there was no cloud, the comet and castle lit up beautifully and it all paid off.' The comet is visible next to a crescent moon in the western sky after sunset over Maryland in the U.S. The comet was first visible to amateur astronomers in May last year and by October they estimated the comet and trail was 75,000 miles long. It was brightest to northern hemisphere observers around March 10 this year. Once it rounds the sun its orbit will bring it back in 110,000 years. It is literally a once-in-a-lifetime comet.

He is the author of several photography books on the sky, the night sky and on astrophotography and travels the globe in search of the locations for his images. Hohenzollern Castle was first documented in 1267. In 1423 it was completely destroyed after a nine months siege and from 1454 a second and larger castle was constructed. It fell into ruin towards the end of the 18th century but was rebuilt in its present form, as one of the most impressive neo gothic castles in Germany. It was also spotted above Las Vegas (top left) over the Stratosphere Casino Hotel, along with a waxing crescent moon .

chatgpt: An incredible image has been captured over the beautiful Hohenzollern Castle near Stuttgart, Germany. The photograph captures the Comet PanSTARRS as it passes behind the sun, rendering it invisible to the human eye for millennia to come. Comet PanSTARRS, also referred to as C/2017 S3, was discovered in September 2017 by astronomers in Hawaii. The comet was first spotted by a telescope that is part of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), which is located on the island of Maui. The comet was classified as a long-period comet, meaning that it has an orbital period of more than 200 years. The comet was expected to make its closest approach to the sun in August 2018; however, it was not predicted to brighten enough to be easily visible to the naked eye. Despite this, astronomers were still able to capture some incredible images of the comet as it passed near the sun. One such image was captured over the Hohenzollern Castle near Stuttgart, Germany. The photograph shows the comet as a faint streak of light against the backdrop of the sun. Sadly, the passing of the comet behind the sun means that it will not be visible to the human eye for millennia to come. This is because the sun's glare will be too bright for the comet to be seen.  Comets are celestial objects that are made up of ice and dust. When a comet passes near the sun, the heat causes the ice to vaporize and release dust particles, creating a tail that can be seen from Earth. Comets have been viewed as both omens and wonders throughout history. In recent years, advances in technology have allowed astronomers to study and observe comets in much greater detail. The ESA's Rosetta spacecraft, for example, was able to land on a comet and take measurements of its surface and environment. Comets have also played a role in the development of life on Earth, as they may have brought water and other organic molecules to our planet.  Despite the passing of Comet PanSTARRS behind the sun, there are still plenty of other celestial objects to observe in the night sky. Amateur astronomers can observe planets, stars, and other objects using telescopes and binoculars. In conclusion, the passing of Comet PanSTARRS behind the sun marks the end of its journey through our solar system. While it may not be visible to the human eye for millennia to come, the incredible image captured near Hohenzollern Castle serves as a reminder of the beauty and wonder of the cosmos.
