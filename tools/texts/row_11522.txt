A council which banned apostrophes from the names of new streets because it did not want to baffle residents with punctuation has decided to reverse the decision. The leader of Mid Devon Council said he would be recommending to the ruling cabinet that the policy was changed so that apostrophes would again be used. Councillor Peter Hare-Scott said he did not find it acceptable that incorrect grammar was being used on the council's street signs. Change: Mid Devon Council has reversed its decision to ban apostrophes from the names of new streets. It means apostrophes such as the one seen on an avenue in Devon will also be placed on new signs . It followed a storm of protest last week when the policy to ban apostrophes was revealed. 'The convention not to use apostrophes when naming new streets has been in place since long before this administration took over,' councillor Hare-Scott  said. 'Personally I'm not happy about using English that's incorrect and don't find this acceptable. 'We are reviewing the situation and I shall be recommending to cabinet on March 28 that they amend the policy so that street names may indeed in future have apostrophes.' The proposed naming and numbering policy document states streets should not be given names 'that may be considered or construed as obscene or racist', while those 'that may be open to re-interpretation by graffiti or shortening of the name shall be avoided'. Baffling: Residents slammed Mid Devon Council for issuing the bizarre guidance . It adds: 'In order to avoid causing offence either by inclusion or exclusion, no street shall be named after any living person. 'All punctuation, including apostrophes, shall be avoided.' Last year book retailer Waterstones removed the punctuation from its brand name.

chatgpt: Mid Devon Council's leader is calling for the return of apostrophes in street names, following a storm of outrage after revealing a policy to remove them. The original plan to cut down on punctuation was aimed at reducing confusion, but instead provoked mass backlash from grammar enthusiasts and the general public. Councillor Bob Deed believes that dropping apostrophes from street names is a mistake that undermines the historical and cultural significance of the English language. "Apostrophes add clarity and meaning to the written word," Deed said. "We owe it to our residents to ensure that their community is accurately represented in all documents and signage." The use of apostrophes in street names has been a contentious issue in the UK for years. Some councils have opted to eliminate apostrophes entirely, while others insist on keeping them to preserve the integrity of the language. In a statement, the Mid Devon Council recognized that the decision to scrap apostrophes was "unpopular" and assured the public that it will be reviewed. However, the council has yet to clarify whether apostrophes will be reintroduced. The move to remove apostrophes from street names was met with swift criticism from residents, with many calling it a "dumbing down" of the English language. "I appreciate that some people find apostrophes confusing, but abandoning them entirely is not the answer," resident Samantha Jones said. "We should be promoting literacy and a love of language, not dumbing it down for convenience." In recent years, there has been a renewed focus on the importance of grammar in schools, with many educators and politicians calling for a return to traditional teaching methods. The removal of apostrophes from street names, in this context, is seen as a concerning departure from the standard of proper English. As the debate rages on, residents of Mid Devon will no doubt be keeping a watchful eye on the council's decision regarding apostrophes. For many, it is a matter of principle and a symbol of the ongoing struggle to preserve the integrity of the English language.
