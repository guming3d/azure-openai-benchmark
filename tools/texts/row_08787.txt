'Just like the Mr Brown from the books, my home is just off Portobello and I have listed it with Airbnb for over a year now. 'I get visitors staying from all over the world and I thought it would be fun to see if any Peruvians, like Paddington, would like to stay for free - hopefully they are as excited about the film as I am.' The home of Mr Brown will be available in its entirety to Peruvian travellers . The listing is on the Airbnb website, and Mr Brown's home is available all year round . Airbnb is the world's largest community-driven hospitality company, which connects thousands of guests and hosts online every day. With Mr Brown's listing available for anyone to book all-year around, the one bedroom apartment is available for anyone to book from roughly Â£150 per night. Peruvian visitors keen to take Mr Brown up on his offer can contact him directly through airbnb.com to request the complimentary stay (December 5-7). Guests will also be treated to a special Paddington goody bag when they arrive at Mr Brown's house . Mr Brown is a big fan of Paddington Bear, and felt with his name, it was important to offer a unique stay . Holly Clarke Acting Country Manager, Airbnb UK & Ireland, said: 'We want people to feel that wherever they go, anywhere in the world, they belong. 'Paddington Bear came to London from Peru looking for a place to belong, and Mr Brown provided just that. This captures the very spirit of us as a brand and it's great to see hosts like Roifield really champion this. 'Our community is everything to the Airbnb experience; these magical moments are what makes it so special'. Paddington comes to UK screens on November 28.
