article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Nigella Lawson had her belongings moved from the marital home she shared with multi-millionaire art collector Charles Saatchi into the London flat she's staying at following their very public altercation, she probably hadn't thought her Cannabis habit would be exposed. Luckily, for the domestic goddess, it was a perfectly legal Cannabis energy drink (£4.99, firebox.com) and not the real deal. The can was pictured wedged into the bottom of a Perspex box along with her other most essential belongings, such as a blender and cookery books. Nigella Lawson would appear to be a fan of Cannabis energy drinks, the high-caffeine legal tipple, packed with taurine, hemp seed extract, B vitamins and sugar, which were pictured inside one of her removal boxes . The drink, branded with a marijuana leaf and billed as ‘Amsterdam's coolest energy drink', may be guilty of crass marketing, but its ingredients are innocent. It contains hemp seed extract, caffeine, taurine (an amino acid which helps regulate the blood), B vitamins and a substantial 11 g of sugar, so it'll give you a sugar high but not a narcotic one. The drug cannabis is also an extract from the hemp family, but is made from a different variety of plant. Hemp has been used for years in products such as eco-clothing and natural carpeting. But now the oil is the biggest buzzword, as the manufacturers' boast that it is a good source of protein and essential fatty acids has led to sales of the drink soaring. It has been available in the UK only for 18 months, but a 50 per cent rise in sales is predicted this year. The drinks were spotted inside boxes lifted into a removal van outside the London home Nigella Lawson shared with Charles Saatchi . Hemp's natural nuttiness also lends itself to tea. German eco-brand Hanf Natur is behind a range of smoky teas made from dried hemp. One is mixed with raspberry leaves, rosehip and hibiscus to ‘soothe and calm your senses' (£4.35 from sativabags.com). And farmers in the Swiss Alps cultivate hemp to mix with green tea for an iced drink (£1.45, thehempshop.co.uk). Need perking up? Try hemp coffee (£8.90, hempiness.co.uk). While the marketing for Nigella's Cannabis can and other drinks may be tasteless, their contents are anything but.

chatgpt: A new cannabis-infused drink has hit the market in the UK, and it's already causing quite a stir. The drink, which is called "Legal Cannabis Drink," is now available on the Firebox website for £4.99. But what makes this drink so unique is that it contains a mix of caffeine, taurine, hemp seed, B vitamins and sugar, making it a possible alternative to energy drinks. Recently, the drink was spotted inside removal boxes as a celebrity chef left a house shared with famous entrepreneur Charles Saatchi. The legal cannabis drink is the latest addition to Firebox's lineup of quirky products that are designed to make people's lives more interesting. The drink contains cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis that is believed to have therapeutic benefits. CBD has been shown to help with anxiety, depression, and pain relief, among other things. Despite containing cannabis, the drink does not contain THC, which is the compound that causes people to feel high.  The legal cannabis drink is just one of many cannabis-infused products that have emerged in recent years as countries around the world relax their marijuana laws. In fact, the UK recently legalized the use of medicinal cannabis, which has opened up new opportunities for companies such as Firebox to create innovative products for a wider market. Some people are concerned that the drink will encourage young people to experiment with drugs. But supporters argue that the product is no different from other energy drinks that contain stimulants such as caffeine and sugar. They also point out that the drink is completely legal and has gone through rigorous testing to ensure that it is safe for consumption. The legal cannabis drink is not the first time that Firebox has created a cannabis-infused product. The company has previously launched CBD-infused popcorn, which was a big hit with consumers. The popcorn contains 5 mg of CBD per serving and has been described as a healthier alternative to traditional snacks. Overall, the legal cannabis drink is an interesting addition to the ever-growing market for cannabis-infused products. With its unique blend of ingredients and health benefits, it is likely to attract a lot of attention in the coming months. Whether it will become a mainstream product remains to be seen, but for now, it's an exciting new addition to the world of alternative beverages.
