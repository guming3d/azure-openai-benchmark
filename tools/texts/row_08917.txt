article: (CNN) -- Five people died late Sunday in shootings at an apartment complex near Seattle, including the gunman who was shot by police, authorities said. A domestic dispute set off the events, said Brian Wilson, chief of police in Federal Way, Washington. A man got into a fight with a woman with whom he shared an apartment in the Pinewood apartment complex and fatally shot her, he said. The man then went to the parking lot of the apartment complex and fatally shot two men. The relationship between the gunman and the two victims in the lot is unclear, Wilson said. Wilson did not identify the gunman; it was not clear why the identity was withheld. The gunman then returned to his apartment and retrieved a shotgun, he said. Neighbors who had heard the gunfire came into the hallway, and the gunman shot and killed one of those neighbors through an apartment door, Wilson said. Police intercepted the man on his way back to the parking lot, the police chief said. Police ordered the man to drop his weapon, but he refused, so the officers shot him, Wilson said. The man then dropped his weapon, continued to the parking lot and obtained another weapon. Police again ordered him to drop his weapon, he again refused, and police shot and killed him. Eight officers are on administrative leave, as is standard after officers fire at a suspect, Wilson said. The suspect had a valid concealed weapons permit, he said. When officers arrived at the scene in the city just south of Seattle, they could still hear gunfire, said police spokeswoman Cathy Schrock. They also saw two men lying wounded in a parking lot. No officers were injured. CNN's Deanna Hackney contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Federal Way, Washington – A shooting that began as a domestic dispute led to the deaths of four people before police fatally shot the gunman, authorities said. The incident took place on Saturday night in the city of Federal Way, about 20 miles south of Seattle. Police received a 911 call reporting gunfire, and when officers arrived at the scene, they found that the shooting was still ongoing, according to a police spokeswoman. The gunman, who has not been identified, had killed four people before officers intervened. Police Chief Andy Hwang said the shooter had ties to three of the victims, but the nature of those ties was not immediately clear. “This is a tragic day for Federal Way and for all of us who call this community home," Hwang said at a news conference. "Our hearts go out to the families and friends of the victims." The shooting occurred in a residential neighborhood, and police urged residents to stay indoors while they secured the area. The gunman was reportedly in a house on the block where the shooting took place. The officers who arrived at the scene were quickly met with gunfire from the suspect, who was armed with a large caliber weapon. They returned fire, striking the gunman and killing him. Police did not immediately release the identities of the victims, but said they were all adults. The motive behind the shooting is still under investigation. Mass shootings have become a disturbingly frequent occurrence in the United States, with over 40,000 gun-related deaths in the country last year alone. The shooting in Federal Way is just the latest tragedy to shake a nation grappling with the issue of gun violence.
