article: Moscow (CNN) -- Russian authorities on Friday seized radioactive material from the luggage of a passenger on a flight from Moscow to Tehran, Iran. The luggage, belonging to an Iranian citizen, contained 18 metal objects packed in individual steel cases, Russia's Federal Customs Service said. The agency said the material, the radioactive isotope Sodium-22, can be obtained in a nuclear reactor. The news sparked concern that the incident may have been related to Iran's nuclear program, which the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report last month could be geared to produce weapons. Iran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Nuclear expert Michael Friedlander said Sodium-22 has no applications related to weapons. It is generally used to calibrate nuclear instruments in medical equipment, he said. Initial tests showed that radiation levels of the objects were 20 times above normal, the Russian customs service said. Radiation expert Paddy Regan, a professor at England's University of Surrey, said the material was unlikely to present a major hazard. He said Sodium-22 can be made in medical accelerators and is usually not produced in reactors. It is also not used in reactors as a component of fuel, he said. The customs agency said the objects were sent to a Moscow prosecutor's office that deals with air and water transport. A criminal investigation is under way. No details were available on the identity of the Iranian passenger, who apparently flew to Tehran on the flight. Iranian news media quoted an embassy official in Moscow as saying any reports that the passenger had been arrested were false. "These false allegations are meant to destroy relations between Iran and Russia," the official told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency. "A month ago there was a misunderstanding about a university student who was carrying material used in dentistry," he said. "This misunderstanding was resolved quickly and the student received apologies." CNN's Jo Shelley, Alla Eshchenko, Danielle Dellorto and Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Authorities in Russia have confirmed that a small quantity of radioactive material was seized at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. The material was found in the luggage of a passenger traveling to Tehran. The Russian customs agency has already confirmed that the material, identified as beryllium, can be obtained from a nuclear reactor and is not considered dangerous in small amounts. A nuclear expert has also weighed in on the situation, stating that the beryllium discovered in the luggage cannot be used for nuclear weapons. It appears that the substance is being used purely for scientific research. Russia's atomic agency, Rosatom, has also stated that the beryllium found in the airport is being used for scientific purposes only. A spokesperson for the agency explained that beryllium has several applications in scientific research, including as a means of detecting and measuring radiation. It is not uncommon for scientific research materials to be transported via commercial aircraft, but the incident has triggered heightened security measures at airports across the globe. The discovery of the radioactive material in airport luggage is a concerning development for aviation security officials. The potential of nuclear materials falling into the wrong hands is always a concern, especially with the ongoing threat of terrorism. However, in this case, it appears that the beryllium was being transported for legitimate scientific purposes. Russian authorities have been praised for their swift action in responding to the situation. The passenger responsible for transporting the material has been identified and is currently cooperating with authorities. There is no indication that there was any malicious intent behind the transportation of the material. With the threat of nuclear terrorism still very real, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of stringent security measures at airports worldwide. The incident also highlights the importance of constant vigilance and intelligence sharing between nations when it comes to detecting and preventing the transportation of illegal or dangerous materials.
