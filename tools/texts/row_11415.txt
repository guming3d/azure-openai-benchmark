article: New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India has unveiled a $35 computer prototype as part of its program to provide connectivity to its students and teachers at affordable prices. Kapil Sibal, the country's human resources development minister, displayed what he called a low-cost computing and access device in New Delhi on Thursday. The ministry said the price would gradually fall to $10 apiece. India said connectivity to all its colleges and universities is key to achieving its education goals. Home to a billion-plus population, the country's literacy rate stands at 65 percent, according to the 2001 census figures. Nevertheless, the South Asian nation has made giant strides in various areas since it opened up its economy in the early 1990s. The country ushered in a telecom revolution that delivered mobile telephony to nearly 600 million people in just a little more than a decade with highly competitive call tariffs. Now, India is preparing for another leap into the digital world. Recently, it auctioned off its airwaves for third-generation services to enable super-fast multimedia streaming of wireless. The move is aimed at bringing India's online market on a par with its booming cell-phone business through Internet penetration with technology allowing quick access, data transfer and entertainment on mobile handsets. The country has announced plans to link up all its 250,000 village councils by 2012 in a bid to plug massive broadband divides between rural and urban communities as it emerges as one of the world's few growth markets. Authorities say technical institutions involved in designing the new device are now setting up research to address price and quality issues in developing budget gadgets for students. "The aim is to reach such devices to the students of colleges and universities, and to provide these institutions a host of choices of low-cost access devices around Rs 1,500 [$35] or less in near future," the human resources ministry said at the launch of the computer. Ministry spokeswoman Mamata Varma said the government aimed to introduce the new touch-screen computing tool at higher educational institutions in 2011. The ministry, she said, is expected to tender out contracts to private companies for mass production of its prototype. The Linux-based computer is equipped with an Internet browser, a PDF reader and several other facilities, she said.

chatgpt: Access to education is a fundamental right that every individual should have. India is a country with a literacy rate of 65 percent, which means a large population is still deprived of basic education. However, officials believe that connectivity to all colleges is the key to achieving education goals. The Indian government has launched several programs to increase access to education, including digital education. With the widespread availability of the internet, the government believes that connectivity can play a significant role in providing access to education to those who need it the most.  Officials have stated that the price for internet-enabled devices would gradually fall to $10 apiece, making it more affordable for students from different financial backgrounds to purchase. They believe this will significantly increase the number of students who have access to online learning. The government has also provided several initiatives to ensure that colleges across the country get connected. With access to learning resources and streaming services, students can get the most out of their education, even if they are studying remotely. The goal is to ensure that every student in India has access to a quality education, regardless of their location or financial standing. The officials' belief that connectivity is the key to achieving this goal seems to be credible, as it opens a wide range of opportunities for students in remote areas of the country. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of digital education. With schools and colleges shut down, online learning has become the only way for students to continue their education. The government's initiatives have ensured that students across the country can continue their education even during these challenging times. However, there are still challenges to overcome. Not all areas in the country have access to the internet. In addition, even with access, students face challenges such as power cuts and limited bandwidth, which can make online learning difficult. In conclusion, connectivity to colleges is one of the most significant steps that the government can take to ensure that all students have access to education. While there are still challenges to overcome, the government's initiatives show a promising future for the education sector in India. With a gradual decrease in the cost of internet-enabled devices, more students will have the opportunity to learn online, which can significantly improve their access to quality education.
