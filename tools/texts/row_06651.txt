article: Ride sharing service Uber has issued an apology after it jacked up prices as frightened Sydneysiders fled last week's siege at Martin Place. With police calls to evacuate the area, demand for Uber outstripped its supply of cars, kicking in an automatic price surge to attract more cars to the area. During the early stages of the siege, Uber's fares reportedly jumped fourfold. In a statement, Uber apologised, saying: 'The events of last week in Sydney were upsetting for the whole community and we are truly sorry for any concern that our process may have added.'

Initial response: Uber responded to growing outrage about the cost of its services by saying it was to 'encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers' Staff and customers were held hostage inside the Lindt chocolate cafe store in the heart of Sydney's CBD last week . The company said it wanted to help get as many people as possible out of the CBD, but it communicated its intentions poorly, leading to misunderstanding about its motives. 'We didn't stop surge pricing immediately,' Uber said in its statement. 'This was the wrong decision.' But the company later reversed course, offering free rides out of the city centre and refunds to those hit by higher prices. 'It's unfortunate that the perception is that Uber did something against the interests of the public,' Uber said. 'We certainly did not intend to.'

'We are all concerned with events in CBD,' the company said last week. 'Fares have increased to encourage more drivers to come online & pick up passengers in the area.' But commuters weren't buying it. 'What a shameful disgrace,' tweeted web developer Tyson Armstrong. 'How low can you go?

chatgpt: Uber, the ride-hailing company, has come under fire after raising prices in Sydney during the recent siege at Martin Place. The move, which saw prices surge by more than four times their usual level, provoked a backlash from users and media alike. Initially, Uber justified the price increase on its blog, saying it was intended to encourage more drivers to come online, and thus make more cars available during the crisis. However, the explanation did little to quell the anger of passengers, who called the move "exploitative" and "disgusting". In response, Uber announced that it would offer free rides to and from the Sydney CBD, where the siege was taking place. The move was welcomed by many, but some continued to criticize the company for raising prices during a time of crisis. More than a week after the siege ended, Uber issued an apology on its blog. The company acknowledged that it had "got things wrong" during the crisis, and promised to learn from the experience. It also said that it would be making changes to its pricing strategy in the future, in order to ensure that passengers were not taken advantage of during emergencies. The incident has shone a light on the debate around surge pricing, which many users feel is unfair. While Uber has defended the strategy in the past, arguing that it is necessary to ensure that cars are available at times of high demand, critics say that it allows the company to take advantage of passengers who are in desperate need of a ride. For its part, Uber has promised to be more transparent about its pricing practices in the future. It has also said that it will work closely with governments and regulators to ensure that its services are not abused during times of crisis. The incident in Sydney has prompted renewed calls for the regulation of ride-hailing services around the world. While many countries have been quick to embrace the new technology, critics argue that it has created a regulatory "wild west", where companies are free to operate without any oversight. For now, Uber remains one of the most popular ride-hailing services in the world, with millions of users in hundreds of cities. However, the incident in Sydney serves as a stark reminder that the company's success has come at a cost, and that it still has much work to do if it is to win the trust of the public and regulators alike.
