article: Jailed: Paedophile Paul Emsley, 47, was sentenced to 18 months in prison at Burnley Crown Court . A convicted paedphile who was once filmed having sex with a 12-year-old boy has been jailed for a third time after police found a sickening child-abuse themed board game under his bed. Paul Emsley, 47, was caught when police visiting his home discovered a stash of child porn images along with the game - which involved participants pretending to be children and performing sex acts on each other. Officers also found drug paraphernalia in every room and a camera and video-enabled mobile phone, which Emsley was barred from possessing under the terms of a lifetime sexual offences prevention order (SOPO). Emsley, formerly of Padiham, Lancashire, was jailed for 45 months  in 1999 after having sex with a young boy before threatening to kill him if he told anyone what happened. He was jailed again for two-and-a-half years in 2012 for breaching the SOPO, after he was caught downloading hundreds of child porn images at his home. And in 2013 he was fined by magistrates for possession of a video or camera-enabled mobile phone, Burnley Crown Court heard. In the most recent incident, police visited the 47-year-old's home on May 10 on a matter unrelated to his SOPO. There they found a phone capable of taking videos and Emsley's sick collection of child pornography. The court heard that the stash included 24 images on a CD and seven images on a VHS tape - with the banned images interspersed with legal homosexual pornography. Six or seven of the illegal images were classed as category A - the most serious kind - and depicted penetrative sex involving children. Judge Jonathan Gibson sentenced Emsley to 18 months in prison for one count of making indecent images, and two months for the second count, to run consecutively. Restrictions: Emsley was banned from having any unsupervised contact with a boy under 16 years old or living in a house with a boy aged under 16-years-old, at Burnley Crown Court (above) He also revoked the earlier SOPO, and issued Emsley with a fresh order. He is now prevented from having any unsupervised contact with a boy under 16 years old or living in a house with a boy aged under 16. Emsley is also prohibited from possessing a computer or device capable of searching the internet, unless the device is surrendered to the police or probation service for inspection, and on the condition that he does not clear the search history on the device. Emsley had earlier admitted to breaching his sexual offences prevention order and two charges of making indecent images. Judge Gibson said Emsley had 'expressed some insight and some ambition to a future that does not involve the activity that has brought [him] time and time again before the courts'.

chatgpt: Paul Emsley, 47, a resident of Lancashire, has been caught with a disgusting stash of child pornography. Police officers discovered that he also had a game in his possession where players are expected to pretend to be children and perform sexual acts on each other. This revelation comes after Emsley received a 45-month jail term in 1999 for sexually assaultinh a 12-year-old boy. Following a recent trial, he must now serve another 18 months in prison on charges of making indecent images of children. The authorities were alerted by an anonymous tip-off regarding Emsley's online activities. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that he was in possession of over 10,000 images of children in compromising positions. Some of these photographs were of children as young as 18 months old. Along with these images, the police also discovered a game where players were to act out sexual fantasies involving children. This is not Emsley's first brush with law enforcement regarding child sexual abuse. In 1999, he was sentenced to 45 months in prison for engaging in sexual activities with a 12-year-old boy. However, this recent revelation shows that Emsley did not effectively reform himself after serving his sentence. Instead, it paints a disturbing picture of someone who has a predilection for young children. During the trial, the court heard how Emsley's offenses had caused significant emotional distress to the children he had assaulted. The court also heard statements from parents of the victims, describing the unimaginable pain their families went through. The judge presiding over the case, Justice Thompson, called his actions a "live example of the devastating and lifelong impact of child sexual abuse on its victims." As a result of the recent case, Emsley has been given an additional prison sentence of 18 months. His actions go beyond the scope of even the most heinous offenses that can be committed. His collection of child pornography is not simply a matter of personal taste; it is exploitation of the most vulnerable and helpless members of our society. The authorities have emphasized that they are committed to pursuing individuals who engage in such despicable activities. They have also urged members of the public to report any suspicions they may have regarding such crimes. The Children's Society has urged the government to take stronger action against perpetrators of child pornography and sexual abuse. The case of Paul Emsley is not simply about one man's actions. It is about the safety and protection of our most vulnerable citizens. The authorities and society at large must come together to deter such crimes from taking place and to ensure that those who engage in such activities are brought to justice.
