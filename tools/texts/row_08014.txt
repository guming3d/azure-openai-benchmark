article: (CNN) -- From luxury hotels in colossal tower blocks to traditional "ryokan" and functional capsule hotels, there's plenty of variety in Tokyo's hotel scene. Sample the salaryman lifestyle at the Capsule Inn Akihabara. If you can afford it -- and you probably can't -- you owe it to yourself to stay at the Peninsula Hotel (1-8-1 Yurakucho, Chiyoda-ku). As well as overlooking the Imperial Palace, what makes this hotel so special is the incredible array of high-tech mod cons in the rooms. There are wall panels that show the outdoor weather conditions, in-room nail dryers and espresso machines and, best of all, the toilets have a heated, self-lifting seat and built-in power deodorizer -- ingenious. Another top-end option is the Park Hyatt (3-7-1-2 Nishi Shinjuku), immediately recognizable as the setting for the movie "Lost in Translation." The hotel occupies floors 41 to 52 of the Shinjuku Park Tower, and with breathtaking views over the city and towards Mount Fuji, its popularity with visiting celebrities is understandable. A more economical option is the Park Hotel Tokyo (Shiodome Media Tower, 1-7-1, Higashi Shimbashi), which also has great views, along with modern, unfussy rooms. The hotel even employs "Pillow Fitter" staff to make sure you get a good night's sleep. Marunouchi Hotel (1-6-30 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku) has comfortable rooms and is surprisingly luxurious for a business hotel. A "ryokan" is a traditional Japanese-style inn, often featuring communal baths and rooms with futons and "tatami" (straw mat) flooring. They also tend to be cheaper than regular hotels. Family-run Ryokan Sawanoya (2-3-11 Yanaka, Taito-ku) is cheap and homely. The English-speaking owner is exceptionally helpful and keen to immerse you in Japanese culture. If you're lucky, his family will put on a tea ceremony or lion dance for your viewing pleasure. Ryokan Asakusa Shigetsu (1-31-11 Asakusa, Taito-ku) is a more expensive but more traditional option. Most rooms have private bathrooms but it's worth using the communal baths just for the views of the nearby five-storied pagoda. 'Western-style' rooms are also available. If you're on a tight budget, or just curious, you could always try a 'capsule' hotel, where guests sleep in coffin-sized capsules, just big enough to sit up in. Aimed primarily at workers too tired or too drunk to make it home, capsule hotels are only really suitable for single-night stays. Asakusa Riverside Capsule Hotel (2-20-4 Kaminarimon, Taito-ku), with a women-only floor, is one of the few capsule hotels in Tokyo that allows female guests. You'll be provided with a dressing gown and toothbrush and you'll have access to communal bathing facilities. Be sure to take earplugs, as the snores of drunken salarymen won't do much for your beauty sleep.

chatgpt: Looking for a unique and memorable hotel experience during your travels? Look no further than the Peninsula Hotel, which offers its guests in-room espresso machines for the perfect cup of coffee in the morning. But if it's stunning views you're after, consider staying at the Park Hyatt. The hotel's views were featured prominently in the critically acclaimed film "Lost in Translation", with the city skyline serving as a breathtaking backdrop to the film's emotional moments. For those looking for a more traditional experience, a ryokan could be the perfect choice. These traditional Japanese inns feature futons and tatami floor mats in the rooms, providing guests with a taste of Japanese culture and hospitality. The ryokan experience also typically includes communal baths and meals, giving guests a chance to connect with locals and immerse themselves in an authentic Japanese experience. But for those on a budget or seeking a truly unique experience, a night in a capsule hotel might be just the ticket. These compact accommodations feature individual capsules or pods for sleeping, similar to a hostel but with added privacy. While some capsule hotels offer only basic amenities, others offer luxury features such as massage chairs, saunas, and even karaoke bars. No matter what type of hotel experience you're looking for, these options offer something for everyone. From the convenience of in-room espresso machines to the cultural immersion of a ryokan, or the novelty of a night in a capsule, these hotels are sure to provide an unforgettable stay for any traveler. Of course, with travel restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it's important to check with each hotel regarding current safety measures and guidelines. Many hotels have implemented new procedures to ensure the safety of their guests, including regular disinfection of high-touch surfaces, increased ventilation, and contactless check-in and check-out. So whether you're planning a future trip or looking for a staycation closer to home, consider these unique and unforgettable hotel experiences for your next adventure.
