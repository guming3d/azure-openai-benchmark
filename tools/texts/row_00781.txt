article: Paris, France (CNN) -- French investigators said they are looking into problems encountered by an Air France jet last month in nearly the same spot over the Atlantic where another Air France jet mysteriously crashed in June. Air France flight 445 was flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, the night of Nov. 29 when it encountered the problems, the French accident investigation agency, BEA, said in a news release this week. It is the same route taken by Air France flight 447 when it went down in the Atlantic Ocean in stormy weather June 1, killing all 228 people aboard. The investigation agency has not established the cause of the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found. "The analysis of what happened could lead to complementary explanations about the accident of flight AF 447," the investigation agency said. Flight 445 encountered "severe turbulence" about four hours after takeoff on Nov. 29, forcing the pilots to descend, Air France said in a statement after the flight. The crew sent out an emergency radio message to indicate it had left its flight level, Air France said. The flight, with 215 people aboard, "continued normally" after half an hour of moderate to severe turbulence, the airline said. Air France declined to comment on the investigation agency's statement this week. The BEA said the November flight was an Airbus A330-203, the same model involved in the June crash, but Air France said the November incident involved an Airbus A330-200. While French authorities have not yet determined what caused the June crash, tests have brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which are used to measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed. Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages before it crashed that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich. -- CNN's Luc Lacroix contributed to this report .

chatgpt: An Air France jet carrying 303 passengers encountered severe turbulence near the area where another Airbus jet crashed earlier this year. Flight 445 was en route from Buenos Aires to Paris when it hit the turbulence about four hours after takeoff on November 29. This news comes as investigators continue to search for answers in the crash of Flight 447, which went down in the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, killing all 228 people on board. The search was called off in July 2019 after two years of searching with no success.  Air France officials have assured the public that Flight 445 encountered no damage or injuries from the turbulence, and the plane landed safely in Paris. However, the incident has raised concerns about the safety of Airbus jets, which were involved in both incidents. The French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) has launched investigations into both incidents and has yet to determine the causes of the crashes or the turbulence. In the meantime, Air France has released a statement reminding passengers that turbulence is a common occurrence during flights, and that the airline's pilots are trained to handle it safely. Despite the reassurances, many passengers remain anxious about flying on Airbus jets. Several airlines, including Air France, have had to ground their A380s due to engine problems, adding to the troubling news surrounding Airbus aircraft. Airbus, one of the largest commercial aircraft manufacturers in the world, has faced mounting pressure to improve their products' safety in the wake of these incidents. Airbus has stated that they are taking steps to improve their technology and training to prevent future incidents from occurring. France's transport minister, Elisabeth Borne, has said that she will convene a meeting with representatives from Airbus and Air France to discuss the safety concerns surrounding the A380s. She has also called for increased transparency and communication from the airline industry to ensure passenger safety. As investigations into Flight 445 continue, many are hoping for answers to the questions surrounding the safety of Airbus jets. The public's trust in the commercial airline industry is at stake, and only swift action and transparency can restore it.
