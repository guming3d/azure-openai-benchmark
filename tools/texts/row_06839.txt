article: A multi-million pound penthouse flat near London's Regent's Park is at the centre of an acrimonious legal battle between a wealthy sheikh and the wife he married and divorced twice. The High Court in London heard that Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khojah, 89, was 'outraged' when his ex-wife and mother of his two children, Melina Abuchian, 63, laid claim to the £20million flat in north London. The story of the ex-couple’s extraordinary life together emerged when a judge revealed that they had married in 1979, had two children, as well as homes in Jedda, London, Paris and Cannes, divorced, remarried - and were now divorced again. The 89-year-old sheikh and his 63-year-old wife are fighting over a flat in this block in Regents Park, London . The sheikh divorced Mrs Abuchian for a second time in an Islamic Talaq ceremony in May this year, the court heard, but the 63-year-old said she had now made her home in London and needed somewhere to live. Senior family judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Abuchian claimed to have moved permanently to London in September last year as her marriage collapsed. But her ex-husband, a successful property developer, disputes that the penthouse is really her home and has been trying to get his ex-wife out of the flat since March. Mrs Abuchian, however, has responded by winning a temporary injunction against him and his off-shore company, which owns the flat, preventing them from selling it from under her. The court was told that Sheikh Abdul was 'outraged' that she had resorted to the English courts, insisting that their divorce was a 'deeply, deeply' Saudi Arabian affair. Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Abuchian can continue her legal battle for the flat in the English courts . He bought the flat in the 1970s, it was revealed, but was now 'very anxious to get on and sell the property' for fear of the hyper-inflated central London property market collapsing. He asked Mr Justice Mostyn to block his ex-wife’s campaign, disputing the amount of time they had spent at the flat during their married life. However, Mrs Abuchian insisted that, although she liked her 'beautiful home' in Cannes, she now 'intended to live in London for the rest of my life'. She said she had made her 'permanent base' in Regents Park and she 'simply wished to live out the rest of my life in a safe and familiar environment'. In May, she had obtained an 'investor's visa', entitling her to stay in Britain for a five-year renewable period, the court was told. Mr Justice Mostyn said that, although the flat was formally owned by a Dutch Antilles company, Sheikh Abdul had stated it was really his. The judge ruled that Sheikh Abdul had 'come nowhere near' to landing 'a knock-out blow' to his ex-wife's case. His decision means that Mrs Abuchian can continue her fight in the English courts to keep the flat and for other financial provision from her ex-husband's fortune.

chatgpt: Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja, an 89-year-old Saudi businessman, is in the middle of a legal battle with his ex-wife, Melina Abuchian, over a penthouse flat in London's prestigious Regents Park. The couple, who have two children together, divorced for the second time in May, and now find themselves in disagreement over the ownership and possession of the property. Mrs Abuchian is eager to keep the luxurious flat, claiming that it belongs to her under the terms of their divorce settlement. However, Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja maintains that the flat is his and has expressed his desire to sell it. The dispute between the former spouses centers around the amount of time they each spent in the property before their split. The matter was brought before Mr Justice Mostyn in the High Court in London, who ruled that Mrs Abuchian was entitled to continue her legal fight in England. The couple's first divorce was settled in Saudi Arabia, where Mrs Abuchian signed a document relinquishing all claim to the flat, according to Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja's legal team. However, Mrs Abuchian's lawyers argued that she had been coerced into signing the document and that it was thus invalid. The case has attracted significant attention due to the high net-worth of the couple and the exclusive nature of the property in question. The penthouse, which boasts stunning views over London and is situated in one of the city's most sought-after areas, is said to be worth millions of pounds. The legal dispute has also shone a light on the cultural differences between the UK and Saudi Arabia when it comes to divorce and property ownership. In Saudi Arabia, the husband is usually considered to be the head of the household and has greater legal rights than his wife. Property is often held in the husband's name, and it is not uncommon for women to lose the right to live in the marital home after a divorce. In contrast, English law emphasises equality between spouses in divorce proceedings and considers each party's contributions to the marriage, regardless of their gender. This approach can lead to more favourable outcomes for women in cases where they have made significant contributions to the marriage and the family home. The case between Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja and Melina Abuchian is a reminder of the complexities involved in international divorce proceedings and the importance of seeking legal advice from experienced professionals. As the dispute continues to play out in the courts, it remains to be seen who will ultimately prevail in the battle for the Regents Park penthouse.
