article: (CNN) -- Just when you thought this divorce couldn't get any messier. Weeks after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region, it plans to take custody of dolphins in the nation as well. Not just any dolphins. These highly trained military mammals detect risks such as sea mines or enemy scuba divers trying to slip through. Sea mines are sophisticated weapons that can sink ships and other watercraft. "The combat dolphin program in the Crimean city of Sevastopol will be preserved and redirected toward the interests of the Russian navy," state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday. Dolphins are a crucial part of open-water security. They detect sounds and objects in murky waters that human beings can't, making them uniquely effective at highlighting dangers on the sea floor. Harnessing the military power of animal intelligence . Ukraine was using outdated military equipment for the dolphin program and planned to disband it next month, RIA Novosti said. The Ukraine Defense Ministry told CNN that the nation has an ocean dolphin facility, but declined to provide details, saying they're classified. The dolphin program dates to the 1960s, when Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union, but was handed over to Kiev after independence. The U.S. Navy in San Diego also trains dolphins and sea lions to help protect its assets and find dangerous objects underwater. Tensions between Moscow and Kiev have escalated since Russia reclaimed the Crimea region after a referendum this month that overwhelmingly supported the annexation. The United States and its allies have pledged to isolate Russia for its actions. Ukraine also has combat sea lions that operate under the same base. It's unclear whether they'll be barking allegiances to Moscow or Kiev. CNN's Lisa Emmanuel and Victoria Butenko contributed to this report.

chatgpt: According to recent news reports, Russia is planning to take control of Ukraine's combat dolphins. These highly trained aquatic animals are deemed to be a crucial part of open-water security and are utilized to identify potential threats. The move by Russia is seen as yet another blow to the already strained relations between the two neighboring countries. Dolphins have long been used in militaries around the world due to their remarkable abilities. They possess an exceptional sense of hearing and can detect sounds from miles away. In addition, their powerful sonar and echolocation skills make them excellent at identifying obstacles and potential dangers on the sea floor. These qualities make them invaluable when it comes to detecting mines, explosives, and other potential security threats. In Ukraine, the combat dolphin program was established in the early 1970s, and it has been an essential part of the country's military ever since. However, the program has come under scrutiny over recent years, with some animal rights activists protesting against the use of dolphins for military purposes. Reports suggest that Russia's decision to take custody of Ukraine's combat dolphins is motivated by military interests. They see the dolphins as a valuable asset that can be used in their efforts to secure their maritime borders. Furthermore, the move may be viewed as a strategic power play, aimed at asserting Russia's dominance over Ukraine. At present, it is unclear how Ukraine will respond to Russia's move. Some reports suggest that the country may be looking to establish a new combat dolphin program, while others suggest that they may be looking to phase out the program entirely. In summary, Russia's decision to take custody of Ukraine's combat dolphins has raised concerns amongst animal rights activists and added another layer of tension between the two countries. However, it is clear that these highly intelligent animals will continue to play an essential role in open-water security both in Ukraine and around the world.
