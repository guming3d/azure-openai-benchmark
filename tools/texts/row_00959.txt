article: Scuba diving is the perfect way to witness the underwater world up close. But one diver got more than he bargained for when an eager remora fish - also know as a suckerfish - attached itself to his wetsuit. Snorre E. Johnsen was swimming off Australia's northeastern shores when the remora fish attached itself dangerously close to his crotch area. Wearing a 2-3mm wetsuit, the diver manages to signal to his friend to use his GoPro camera to capture the fish on camera. Although it didn't hurt, the diver admits he could definitely feel the suction through his wetsuit. 'As you can see from the video, I wasn't scared for my nuts,' diver Snorre E. Johnsen told MailOnline. 'Prior to that dive I'd experienced plenty of cool stuff and fishy things; there is always new experiences and interesting things that you never see above water,' he said. The remora fish latched on while Mr Johnsen was diving at the Moltke wreck, off Magnetic Island in Queensland, Australia. Look down, mate: Norwegian diver Snorre E. Johnsen tells his diving buddy to focus the GoPro camera down to showcase the sea life attaching itself to him . 'I wasn't scared for my nuts': Mr Johnsen claims the remora fish latching on didn't hurt, but that he could feel the suction through the 2-3mm wetsuit . Mr Johnsen is certainly no inexperienced diver, either: he's dived in northern and southern Australia, Thailand, Greece, Spain, Norway, Malta and the Spanish party island of Ibiza over the past five years. Norwegian diver Mr Johnsen claims that this wasn't even his most 'epic' diving experience - citing the SS Yongala wreck dive site, also in northern Queensland, as the best experience he's had while diving. 'No other dive site on earth is that crowded with huge animals,' he said of the SS Yongala wreckage.

chatgpt: A Norwegian diver, Snorre E. Johnsen, had a unique encounter during his dive in Queensland, Australia. He was exploring the underwater world when he felt an unusual sensation on his skin. Upon closer inspection, Johnsen realized that a remora fish, also known as a suckerfish, had latched onto him. The remora fish is known for using its suction cup-like mouth to attach itself to larger marine animals such as sharks and whales. However, in this case, the fish had chosen Johnsen as its host. Despite the initial surprise, Johnsen reported that the suckerfish's grip didn't hurt. He could only feel the pressure of the suction as it held on tight to his skin. To capture this unique moment, Johnsen managed to take a photo of the fish as it clung to his arm. He was thrilled to have encountered such a fascinating sea creature during his dive. The suckerfish seemed equally content, as it continued to latch onto Johnsen for several minutes before deciding to let go and swim away. This is not the first time that a diver has experienced an encounter with a suckerfish. In fact, these curious fish are often drawn to divers, attracted by the sound and movement of their fins. Some divers even use this to their advantage, using suckerfish to clean algae and parasites from their equipment. Despite its unusual attachment, the remora fish is harmless to humans, and encounters like these serve as a reminder of the diversity of marine life that exists beneath the waves. Johnsen's encounter with the suckerfish will undoubtedly be an unforgettable part of his diving experiences, and a reminder of the fascinating creatures that call the ocean home.
