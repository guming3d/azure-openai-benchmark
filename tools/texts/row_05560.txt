article: (EW.com ) -- The CW just gave every one of its freshman dramas a full-season order. "The Originals"? Full season! "The Tomorrow People"? Full season! "Reign"? Full season! The network is like Oprah giving away cars. Or Miley giving away tongue wags. Or something else that's easy to get from something that gives away stuff. "The Originals" was a given. "The Vampire Diaries" spin-off has averaged 2.7 million viewers and a 1.3 rating among adults 18-49 and The CW needs to keep at least one show for a full season. With its solid-ishy performance, the drama was clearly headed toward a pickup. "The Tomorrow People" (2.4 million, 0.9) and "Reign" (2.1 million, 0.8) felt like one might survive while the other might not. Not because either are doing really well, exactly, but because The CW has limited inventory to play with (The CW has Twilight-but-with-aliens-romance Star-Crossed and Lost-meets-Avatar-meets-Lord of the Flies drama The 100 in the pipeline). Specifically, many in the industry expected Reign to get beheaded. Explained CW president Mark Pedowitz: "In just a few seasons, we have built a much stronger primetime schedule. Our on-air ratings are up year to year, and our digital viewing continues to grow exponentially. We're excited about the creative momentum the producers have established for all three of our new series, and now our fans will have the chance to see the full stories unfold for them this season. With the additional episodes ordered, plus two new dramas and new reality for midseason, we'll be able to continue our commitment to adding more original programming all year long."

chatgpt: The CW Network has made an impressive move by announcing that they will be picking up all of their freshman dramas this year. The decision was a surprising one, given that earlier it seemed that only one of them could survive into the next season. The two dramas in question were "The Tomorrow People" and "Reign." Despite strong ratings and a dedicated fan base, both shows were on the brink of cancellation. Many believed that only one could continue, but to everyone's surprise, the CW decided to reinvest in both their freshman dramas. According to Mark Pedowitz, the president of CW, the decision was made because "we have built a much stronger primetime schedule this year." He emphasized that he was impressed with the network's new shows, saying "We believe in these shows and the creative teams behind them." Both "The Tomorrow People" and "Reign" have been praised for their creativity, excellent writing, and acting. "The Tomorrow People," a science fiction drama, follows the story of a group of young people with extraordinary powers. On the other hand, "Reign" is a period drama that focuses on the early years of Mary, Queen of Scots. The announcement has received mixed reactions from fans. Some are happy to see their favorite shows get another chance to shine, while others believe that it would be better for the CW to focus on one show, rather than spreading their resources thin. Regardless, it's clear that the CW is committed to building a strong lineup of shows. The decision to pick up both "The Tomorrow People" and "Reign" is just one example of the network's dedication to producing quality programming. We will have to wait and see how these shows perform in the next season, but for now, it's good news for fans of both dramas.
