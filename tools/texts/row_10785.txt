A man has been charged with child abuse and cruelty after he whipped a girl to the beat of Robin Thicke's controversial 'Blurred Lines' song while filming it on his phone. Steven Fillingim, 40, of Pensacola, is accused of repeatedly physically abusing an underage female. A charge sheet shows that the victim claims Fillingim returned home on Saturday night and branded her lazy for not vacuuming and deliberately missing school earlier in the week. He allegedly hit her face with a belt and his hands. According to an arrest report, he forced his victim to hold a 20-pound weight in front of her body, and then hold an 8-pound weight behind her body, Miami New Times reported. He allegedly then forced her to dig mud for 90 minutes before eventually allowing her to stop and go to bed at 1.30 am. The victim told police that on the day she missed school Fillingim had punished her by using a 2.5ft long switch to whip her thighs, North Escambia reported. The accused allegedly hit her in time with Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' song, which has been condemned as trivialising rape and promoting an unhealthy attitude towards sexual consent. The 40-year-old allegedly whipped a girl to the beat of Robin Thicke's song, which has been widely condemned . Fillingim allegedly began to record the incident on his phone, before sending the video to his girlfriend in a text message, entitling it 'She's Home', Huffington Post reported. The woman showed it to police and Fillingim was arrested and charged with three counts of cruelty to a child and child abuse without great bodily harm. Robin Thicke's worldwide hit has been widely panned, with some critics claiming it refers to non-consensual sex in some of the song’s lyrics. The main chorus from the song includes the lines: ‘I hate these blurred lines’, ‘I know you want it’ and ‘must get nasty’. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
