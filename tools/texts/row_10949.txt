chatgpt: France kicked off their World Cup preparations in style after comfortably beating Norway 4-0 in a friendly match. Didier Deschamps' side showed glimpses of the fluid attacking play that helped them reach the quarter-finals at the 2014 World Cup and were particularly impressive in the second half. The French attacked from the off and opened the scoring in the 15th minute through Paul Pogba, who slotted calmly into the bottom corner from the edge of the box after a clever one-two. The Juventus midfielder was at the heart of everything good that France produced and showed why he is regarded as one of the best young players in the world. France continued to dominate proceedings and, after several near misses, finally doubled their lead just before half-time. Olivier Giroud, who started ahead of the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Anthony Martial, showed great composure to finish from close range after some neat build-up play from his teammates. Giroud continued his fine form after the break and scored his second goal of the night just minutes into the second half. The Arsenal striker was on hand to sweep in from close range after some more slick passing from the French midfield. The fourth and final goal of the night came from the penalty spot after Norway's Jo Inge Berget was adjudged to have handled in the area. Substitute Dimitri Payet stepped up and made no mistake, slotting confidently into the top corner to put an exclamation mark on a fine performance from Les Bleus. One player who was notably absent from the squad was Loic Remy, whose future at Chelsea is uncertain. The striker, who spent last season on loan at Crystal Palace, has been linked with a number of clubs this summer, including French side Marseille. Remy was left out of the squad due to an injury but his absence will only serve to fuel speculation about his future. The 30-year-old is unlikely to feature in Antonio Conte's plans at Chelsea next season and it seems likely that he will leave the club this summer. Despite Remy's absence, the French side looked in great shape and will be confident heading into the World Cup. With a squad packed full of talent, they will be expected to challenge for the trophy and will certainly be one of the teams to watch in Russia next summer.
