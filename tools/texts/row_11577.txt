article: It is still more than a year away from a big-screen release, but interest in the new Star Wars movie is already seemingly having an impact on our travel plans. Back with a bang: The three big stars of the original Star Wars film will all feature in the latest movie . New travel figures reveal that a film lovers are apparently booking trips to Abu Dhabi, where portions of the seventh movie in the feted franchise are currently being created. Statistics released by holiday accommodation website LateRooms.com show a 19 per cent increase in hotel reservations for breaks to Dubai’s big Emirati neighbour. Desert delight: Star Wars movies have also been filmed at Ong El Jemel, in Tunisia . Thanks to its sandy landscape, Abu Dhabi is currently masquerading as Tatooine, the fictional planet at the heart of the Star Wars tale that – as all good Jedis know – is the home of both Luke Skywalker and his father Anakin (better known as Darth Vader). Images from the set which leaked online earlier this month appear to show scenes being filmed in the desert palace of Jabba the Hutt – the giant slug-like alien who dies in Return of the Jedi, after being strangled by Princess Leia. Pieces of movie history: The Sidi Driss Hotel is still visible in Matmata, Tunisia . ‘As one of the biggest film franchises, it is not surprising that Star Wars fans are eager to sneak a glimpse of any filming action they can,’ says Lynda Matthews of LateRooms.com. ‘We would not be surprised to see the bookings continue to rise as fans flock to the desert to combine a short break with a glimpse of Hollywood action.’ The announcement, made in 2012, that three new Star Wars movies will be produced, has further invigorated interest in a franchise that is never short of devotees. Cinematic classics: Remnants of Star Wars sets also linger in the desert at Tozeur in Tunisia . The original Star Wars trilogy dominated cinematic release schedules between 1977 and 1983, and made celebrities of actors like Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. A second trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005 – including the much-anticipated Episode I: The Phantom Menace – was less well received by critics, but still sparked enormous profits at the box office. Unfavoured: A snapshot of Tatooine - and the little-loved character Jar Jar Binks - from The Phantom Menace . Star Wars has also shone a spotlight onto Tunisia, which featured heavily in the first trilogy. The north African country’s sparse contours made a perfect double for Tatooine, with key passages filmed in locations such as Matmata, Tozeur and the island of Djerba. And away from the film set: Abu Dhabi is better known for the beauty of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque . Tataouine, in southern Tunisia, also inspired the name of the movie planet. As yet untitled, Stars Wars Episode VII is due to be released in time for Christmas 2015.

chatgpt: The force is strong in the United Arab Emirates as directors and actors for the seventh installment of the iconic sci-fi franchise, Star Wars, began filming in the country this week. Fans eagerly anticipate the upcoming movie, set for release this December. As the crew captures stunning footage in the desert landscape of the UAE, comparisons are being drawn to the original trilogy's use of Tunisia as a backdrop. The desert locations in Tunisia played a vital role in the first three Star Wars films, depicting the barren planet Tatooine, where protagonist Luke Skywalker was raised by his aunt and uncle. The use of the landscape in Tunisia was integral in setting the tone for the Star Wars universe, with its sweeping dunes and harsh environment adding to the sense of danger and adventure. It appears that the filmmakers of the latest Star Wars installation are keen to replicate this effect, with the UAE providing a similarly dramatic and rugged terrain. It is said that the newest movie's setting will include a planet with an environment similar to Tatooine, thereby requiring extensive shots of desert landscapes. "The UAE's renowned desert landscape will be a magnificent backdrop to one of the most thrilling movies of our times," says the chairman of the Abu Dhabi media zone authority. "The Star Wars saga has been part of the lives of many, and we are honoured to spread this legend across the globe". The UAE has been forging a growing reputation within the international film scene, with a number of recent productions choosing to utilise the country's striking deserts and futuristic urban areas. With the inclusion of Star Wars, this trend is sure to continue, further bolstering the region's credentials as a top filming destination. Excitement is building for the upcoming Star Wars film, with reports revealing that the storyline is set 30 years after the events of the Return of the Jedi, the third film in the original trilogy. Fans are eagerly anticipating the return of classic characters, including Harrison Ford's iconic Han Solo. While the narrative remains a closely guarded secret, producers have recently released a teaser trailer, which set the internet alight with speculation and excitement. Fans were thrilled to see familiar characters and locations from the original trilogy, while also being introduced to new elements within the Star Wars universe. The seventh installation of the iconic franchise is set to be a box-office juggernaut, with pre-release ticket sales already breaking records. It is said that the new Star Wars film could become one of the highest grossing movies of all time, with a potential worldwide box-office take of over one billion dollars. As the Star Wars crew continues to shoot footage in the stunning landscapes of the UAE, fans eagerly await the release of the new movie this December. With the magic of Star Wars, the striking beauty of UAE's desert terrains, and a storyline that promises to expand and enhance the Star Wars universe, the seventh installation of this iconic franchise promises to be a cinematic event like no other.
