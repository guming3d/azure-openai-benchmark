article: (CNN) -- It's a South Korean car crash that has been viewed online 2 million times over the past week and has sparked a government-led investigation. A couple in their 60s were driving to a department store in Daegu, 238 kilometers (148 miles) south of Seoul, when their car suddenly accelerated. Their son, who wants to be identified only by his surname, Kwon, posted the video from May 6 onto an Internet forum, he says to prove his father was not at fault. Kwon told CNN, "My father said he heard an odd noise from the car. He thought there was something wrong, then felt the vehicle suddenly accelerating. He twisted the car wheel to the left as he was trying to avoid the cars in front of him, and that is when the vehicle accelerated at a crazy speed. He continued to avoid traffic and people but in the end, there was nowhere else to dodge, and he crashed into a car." The footage from a camera attached to the rearview mirror -- a common practice in South Korea -- shows that the car also drove through two red lights before it crashed into the stationary car at a speed believed to be 80 mph (129 kph). You can hear the couple saying, "Oh my God, what is happening, what is wrong?" The wife screams "Oh no" just before impact. Kwon says his mother, 63, had an operation for internal bleeding and is awaiting a second operation on her back. His father, 65, suffered a fractured finger and fractured ribs. The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs says it is investigating the claim of sudden unintended acceleration. Sohn Young-sam, an official at the ministry, told CNN that 80 claims of such acceleration have been investigated since 2003. Hyundai declined a CNN interview request but sent a statement saying, "The vehicle is being investigated by the Korean National Forensic Service. There is no time estimate for the conclusion of the investigation." CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A South Korean couple's routine trip to the store turned into a terrifying ordeal when their car suddenly accelerated, resulting in a crash. Their son shared the shocking footage captured on the car's rearview camera. The video shows the car slowly driving through a residential area before suddenly accelerating and crashing into a wall. The couple can be heard screaming in shock and confusion as they try to regain control of the vehicle. The incident has caught the attention of the South Korean Ministry, which has announced an investigation into the claim of sudden unintended acceleration. The ministry will be looking into the possible causes of the incident and assessing whether or not it is an isolated case or a wider issue affecting the vehicles in question. Hyundai, the manufacturer of the car involved in the crash, has declined interview requests. However, they have stated that the National Forensic Service is also investigating the incident. Sudden unintended acceleration has been a concern for car manufacturers for many years. It occurs when a vehicle accelerates without the driver pressing the accelerator. It is often linked to an issue with the car's electronics or mechanical systems. This incident has once again highlighted the potential dangers of sudden unintended acceleration and raised questions about the safety of vehicles on the road. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of installing cameras in cars, as they can provide crucial evidence in the event of an accident. The investigation will be closely watched by the public and the automotive industry alike, as the results could potentially have far-reaching implications.  In the meantime, drivers are advised to remain vigilant and report any issues they experience while driving their vehicles to the relevant authorities. Safety must always be the top priority when on the road, and manufacturers must take all necessary steps to ensure their vehicles are as safe as possible.
