However, what came next was an even bigger shock to Cat. David told her that he was also gay and had been keeping his sexuality a secret from her all along. Despite the revelation, the couple maintained their love for each other and a close relationship. However, they were no longer living together. David had made the decision to start living as a woman named Dani, after transitioning. The couple's child remained a part of their lives and they continued to co-parent him together. Although the decision to live separately was a difficult one, it has allowed Cat and Dani to explore their true selves and live their lives authentically. In an interview with a local news outlet, Cat expressed support for her partner's transition and how it had allowed them to grow as individuals. "Our love for each other hasn't changed," Cat said. "But Dani's transition has allowed her to become the person she's always felt she was inside. It's brought us both a lot of joy and a sense of freedom." The couple's story has been met with mixed reactions from the public. While some have applauded their commitment to their marriage and co-parenting their child, others have criticized their decision to stay married despite both being gay.
