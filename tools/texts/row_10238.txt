article: (CNN) -- Mississippi's governor declared a state of emergency Thursday for 12 counties after a severe weather system moved across the southern half of the state overnight Wednesday and Thursday. The storms, which included two tornadoes, damaged at least 108 homes. The storms -- which included two confirmed tornadoes -- damaged 108 homes and injured 24 people, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency's Emergency Operations Center. Simpson County, about 40 miles southeast of Jackson, was hit the worst, it said. A tornado touched down in the county about 4 a.m. Thursday, said Katherine Gunby, spokeswoman for the Emergency Management Agency. Sixty homes were damaged and 20 people were injured in the county, the agency said. Seventeen people were treated in local hospitals and three were transported to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, it said. Condition reports were not immediately available. Another tornado was reported in Lauderdale County, in eastern Mississippi, where one business was destroyed and 11 homes and a business were damaged, according to the agency. The state of emergency declared by Gov. Haley Barbour "will allow state resources to be used throughout the affected areas to assist local governments as they respond to this disaster," said Mike Womack, director of the Emergency Management Agency, in a written statement. Damage to homes also was reported in Jasper, Jones and Lawrence counties, and power lines and trees were down in Adams, Amite, Lincoln and Madison counties, the agency said. Three injuries were reported in Jones County and one in Jasper County, it said. It gave no further details. The tornadoes destroyed Corinth Baptist Church in Simpson County, leaving only its doors standing. "The church means so much to this community," Pastor Jay Westbrooks told CNN affiliate WAPT. "We're going to survive. The building is destroyed, but the church is alive," he said. "We're going to come back and rebuild. The weather's not going to stop us." The Mississippi Department of Transportation and utility companies are working to restore power to the state, Gunby said. While the state of emergency is currently only for nine counties, it will be extended to any future counties that report damage, the Emergency Management Agency said.

chatgpt: Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant has declared a state of emergency in 12 counties after a series of devastating twisters ripped through the state on Wednesday night. The storms left destruction in their wake, with a suburban church flattened and two people airlifted to the hospital for injuries sustained during the severe weather. The twisters touched down in two separate county areas, with one outside the city of Jackson and the other in Lauderdale County. Both tornadoes were particularly vicious in nature, wreaking havoc on the surrounding communities and causing widespread damage. The church that was destroyed in the storm was located in Pearl, a suburb of Jackson. Witnesses reported seeing the building crumble to the ground as the twister tore through the area, leaving nothing but debris in its wake. Thankfully, no one was reported inside the church at the time of the incident. Emergency responders were quickly on the scene to provide support to the affected communities. Reports suggest that the two individuals airlifted to hospital were suffering from serious injuries but are expected to make a full recovery. No fatalities have been reported at this time. Governor Bryant issued a statement following the storm, urging residents in affected areas to take all necessary precautions to remain safe. He also praised the work of emergency responders, stating that they had demonstrated remarkable courage and dedication in their efforts to help those affected by the twisters. The National Weather Service confirmed that the storms were part of a larger weather system that swept through parts of the southeastern United States on Wednesday. Similar storms were reported in neighboring states, including Georgia and Alabama, although the damage in those areas was not as severe as in Mississippi. The devastation caused by the twisters has once again underscored the importance of being prepared for severe weather events, especially in areas such as Mississippi that are prone to tornadoes. Authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant and to monitor weather reports closely in the coming days, as the risk of further severe weather remains high. In the wake of the storm, communities affected by the tornadoes are coming together to support one another and to begin the daunting task of cleaning up and rebuilding. The road ahead will be a long one, but with the resilience and determination of the people of Mississippi, it is one that can be overcome.
