article: (CNN) -- Arsenal ensured that top spot in the Premier League changed hands for the third time in as many days when winning 2-1 at Aston Villa on Monday. Leaders on Saturday morning, the Gunners first saw Chelsea move into pole position as Jose Mourinho's side won 2-0 at Hull. By Sunday afternoon, the team sitting on top of an enthralling Premier League was Manchester City after Manuel Pellegrini's side survived a scare at Newcastle to also win 2-0. Chelsea have 46 points, Manchester City boast 47 but Arsenal, who sat third prior to kick-off, are now back in front with 48 - thanks to a magical minute that took the tie away from the hosts. Just after the half hour, Jack Wilshere gave Arsenal the lead and within a minute Oliver Giroud had doubled that advantage. "It's a massive three points -- especially because we dropped a bit in the second half," Wilshere told Sky Sports television. "In the past we used to feel the nerves when we were up against it. But this season we haven't." Villa produced little until Christian Benteke's first goal since September provided a rousing finish, with the visitors holding on for a crucial victory. The win avenged Arsenal's defeat at home to Aston Villa on the opening day of the season, which prompted many Gunners fans to call for the head of coach Arsene Wenger. The Frenchman must have felt a degree of satisfaction at the health of his team come the return fixture, with Arsenal having topped the table for much of the season. Without a trophy since 2005, Arsenal are bidding to win their first Premier League title in ten years. In Italy, struggling Inter Milan failed to use home advantage to beat Verona, the team lying immediately below them in the table, and the 1-1 draw ended with the hosts being booed off by their own fans. Victory at the San Siro would have closed the gap on fourth-placed Fiorentina to three points, but the draw still leaves Walter Mazzarri's side five points adrift. Inter have won just one of their last seven league games, with the solitary success coming in the derby against Milan just prior to Christmas. Earlier on Monday, Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri was sacked following the seven-time European champions' dismal start to the season, trailing leaders Juventus by 30 points.

chatgpt: Arsenal regained their control of the English Premier League (EPL) with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Aston Villa on Sunday. The Gunners battled hard to secure the crucial three points, which take them back to the top of the standings. It was a crucial victory for Arsenal after their recent slump in form that has seen them drop points against sides they should have beaten. However, their performance against Villa was a top-notch display of offensive firepower and defensive resilience. The first half was dominated by Arsenal's attacking prowess, with two of their standout players, Olivier Giroud and Jack Wilshere, scoring early goals within a span of 11 minutes. Giroud, who recently returned from an injury layoff, opened the scoring in the eighth minute with a well-placed header from a fine Serge Gnabry cross. Wilshere, on the other hand, doubled his side's lead in the 19th minute, after some brilliant link-up play with Mesut Ozil. Villa, who had enjoyed an unbeaten start to their EPL campaign, were rattled by Arsenal's quick-fire goals and struggled to get a foothold in the game. Arsenal continued to dominate possession, and Villa had to rely on their goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, to keep the scoreline respectable. The home side finally managed to pull one back in the 76th minute, through a goal from Jacob Ramsey. The young midfielder scored his first-ever EPL goal with a well-taken shot from outside the box that beat Arsenal's goalkeeper, Bernd Leno. Despite intense pressure from Villa in the final minutes of the game, Arsenal held on for a vital win that takes them ahead of their London rivals, Tottenham, who had temporarily gone top of the table with a win against Fulham on Saturday. In Italy, Inter Milan's struggles continued, as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Verona on Sunday. It was Inter's second consecutive league draw at home, following their 2-2 draw with Parma last week. The result leaves Inter Milan five points behind league leaders AC Milan, who beat Bologna 2-0 on Saturday. Inter took the lead in the 19th minute through a goal from Ivan Perisic, but Verona equalised in the second half, with a goal from Federico Dimarco. Inter tried to push for a winner, but Verona held on for a crucial point. Inter Milan will need to bounce back quickly if they hope to keep up with AC Milan in the race for the Serie A title. They face a tough test next week, as they take on second-placed Sassuolo away from home.
