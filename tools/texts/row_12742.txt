A huge aquatic lizard has been discovered that terrorised European rivers 84 million years ago. The new species was discovered in Hungary is the first known example of a group of scaled reptiles to have lived in freshwater river environments. They were the biggest and most dangerous predators in the water and occupied a similar niche to freshwater dolphins of today. Mosasaurs were terrifying aquatic predators which evolved to live in both the seas and freshwater rivers. Researchers believe the largest of the ancient lizards grew up to 20 feet (6m) long, though most would have been 10-13 feet (3-4m). The new species was named Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus by the scientists who discovered it. Armed with rows of sharp teeth they would have siezed and eaten anything they could get into their mouths. It belonged to the mosasaur family which most fossil remains have show to be monstrous sea creatures. But the fossil remains from Hungary are believed by scientists to have come from a freshwater predator that shared its tropical environment with crocodiles. Fossil remains of the newly discovered creature represent a range of individuals, ranging from small juveniles to large adults. They had limbs like a terrestrial lizard, a flattened, crocodile-like skull, and a tail unlike other known members of the mosasaur family. The fossils were recovered from an open-pit mine in the Bakony Hills which were once flood-plains. Some of the fossilised bones were so little weathered that the animal they belonged to is believed to have been washed away in a sudden flood and rapidly buried. According to the study, this is the first known mosasaur that lived in freshwater and only the second to have been found in rocks that were not once deposited in the ocean. Researchers pieced together a haul of fossils from an ancient Hungarian flood plain to reveal Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus . Laszlo Makadi, of the Hungarian Natural History Museum who conducted the study with colleagues from the University of Alberta in Canada, said the ancient lizard family evolved to adapt to several different freshwater environments. 'The evidence we provide here makes it clear that similar to some lineages of cetaceans, mosasaurs quickly adapted to a variety of aquatic environments, with some groups re-invading available niches in freshwater habitats,' he said.'The size of Pannoniasaurus makes it the largest known predator in the waters of this paleo-environment.' The Hungarian and Canadian research team added in their report, published in the journal PLoS ONE: 'We consider the crocodile-like flattened skull to be a useful adaptation for water-level ambush hunting of terrestrial and shallow water prey.'

chatgpt: Scientists have identified a newly discovered species of reptile, which lived in the waters of what is now Hungary, 84 million years ago. Dubbed Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus, this fierce predator is believed to have lurked just beneath the surface, waiting for its prey before ambushing them. Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus belonged to a group of reptiles called mosasaurs, which are known for their fearsome appearance and powerful predatory abilities. This newly discovered species, however, is particularly unique due to the way it hunted. According to the study's lead author, Dr. Gabor Botfalvai of the Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary, Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus had elongated teeth that were well-suited for catching slippery prey, such as fish and squid. But what really made this reptile stand out was its hunting strategy. "Based on our analysis, it seems that Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus was a surface lurker," Dr. Botfalvai explained. "It likely spent most of its time just beneath the water's surface, waiting for unsuspecting prey to come within striking distance. Once a suitable target was spotted, it would use its powerful tail to propel itself forward, closing the gap between itself and its prey before launching a surprise attack with its sharp teeth." While mosasaurs are commonly associated with the late Cretaceous period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago, Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus lived during the earlier part of the same period, the researchers noted. This indicates that mosasaurs were already well-established and diverse by this time, with an array of unique adaptations to suit their respective hunting styles. Furthermore, the discovery of Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus sheds new light on the evolution of mosasaurs, particularly their transition from land-dwelling reptiles to sea creatures. According to the researchers, studying these ancient reptiles can help us better understand the history and biodiversity of the world's oceans. The researchers also highlighted the significance of this discovery for Hungary, which is known for its rich fossil record. Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus is the latest in a long line of prehistoric creatures that have been unearthed in this region, adding to our knowledge of the country's ancient past. "We are fortunate to have such a wealth of fossil material in Hungary, which offers us a glimpse into the world of these incredible creatures from millions of years ago," Dr. Botfalvai said. Overall, the discovery of Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus is a significant step forward in our understanding of mosasaurs and the evolution of marine predators. The researchers hope that further study of this and other mosasaur species will shed more light on the prehistoric world and the creatures that inhabited it.
