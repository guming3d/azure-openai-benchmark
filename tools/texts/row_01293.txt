article: Manchester United travel to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon searching for redemption after the 4-1 mauling they suffered there last season. But how should Louis van Gaal's side set themselves up tactically? Sportsmail's Martin Keown takes a look. MANCHESTER UNITED . Watching Marouane Fellaini at the World Cup, he did well operating in a midfield three. In his last two United games he has played in a similar role – on the side of a diamond that can become a three. He looked much better for it. It’s a role that allows him to break forward from deep but also help out and cover when needed. United have finally found some rhythm and the system seems to be improving, but the problem now for Van Gaal is picking out his best XI. Belgian midfielder Marouane Fellaini has flourished for Manchester United in recent weeks . Fellaini points to the name on his back after scoring for United away at West Bromwich Albion recently . Spanish playmaker David Silva will miss the derby after coming off injured against Newcastle United . 18-6 The aggregate scoreline to City in the last five PL meetings . 47 Goals scored by City’s strikers in 2014. That’s almost twice as United’s tally (26), . 476 Goals in 167 Manchester derbies. That’s an average of 2.9 per game. MANCHESTER CITY . Last year City found the perfect balance between defence and attack, but this season they are struggling. You have to admire Pellegrini’s philosophy of playing with two strikers but to continue their incredible record in this fixture – they have won five of the last six Premier League Manchester derbies – City need an extra midfielder. With David Silva out, they will miss a lot of creativity so they could use two holding midfielders and push Yaya Toure forward. It’s time for Toure to come alive and there’s nothing like a derby game to bring out that passion and desire. Yaya Toure faces a fitness test on Saturday to determine whether he'll face Van Gaal's United the day after . Sportsmail's Martin Keown asserts that it is time for Toure to come alive from midfield this season .

chatgpt: Manchester United will be looking to claim a vital victory against their cross-city rivals, Manchester City, when they travel to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Louis van Gaal's side currently sit four points behind City in the Premier League table and will need to secure all three points if they wish to challenge for a top-four finish.  One player who will be crucial to United's chances is Marouane Fellaini. The Belgian international has been in fine form of late, particularly in a midfield three, and could prove to be a real handful for City's defenders. Fellaini's physicality and aerial ability makes him a difficult opponent to handle, and he will be hoping to add to his recent goal-scoring exploits for United. City will be hoping that Yaya Toure is fit to play in Sunday's fixture. The Ivorian midfielder has had an injury-plagued season and has been a largely absent figure for City. However, if Toure is fit, he has the ability to take control of the midfield battleground and dominate the game. With players such as David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne in the side, City will be hoping to create chances for their attacking players using Toure's vision and passing ability. The clash between these two sides is pivotal in the race for a top-four finish, with both United and City looking to secure Champions League qualification for next season. A victory for United would see them close the gap on City to just one point, while a defeat could see them fall further behind in the race for a top-four place. United have a good recent record against City, having won three of their last four meetings. However, City will be confident of claiming all three points on home soil, with their attacking talent and a number of key players returning from injury. The scenes will be set for a pulsating derby day encounter, with both sides knowing that a victory could prove crucial in their quest for a top-four finish. The game is scheduled to kick off at 4:30 pm GMT and is sure to be a thrilling spectacle for football fans across the world.
