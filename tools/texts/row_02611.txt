Although they appear to be slow and docile, wombats are very alert and can move quickly with great agility when needed. But in contrast kangaroos can move a lot quicker and hop so efficiently that they can reach great speeds. Although tiny at the moment as they get older their sizes will also start to differ greatly. Peggy will become powerfully built, weighing about 30kg - about the size of a small pig, although wombats are rarely dangerous.

chatgpt: At the Wildlife Kilmore Rescue Centre in Victoria, Australia, Anzac the joey and Peggy the wombat have become unlikely friends. Not only do they spend their days playing together, but they also sleep together, providing each other with a source of comfort and security. According to the rescue center, the two animals have formed a strong bond that has helped them cope with the stresses of their current environment. Anzac was found abandoned and near death on a roadside in 2015, while Peggy was rescued from her dead mother's pouch after she was hit by a car earlier this year. Both animals were in need of extensive care and attention, and they found comfort in each other's company. The rescue center has stated that the friendship between Anzac and Peggy is not about cuddling, but rather about the movement and heartbeat that they provide each other. This movement and warmth mimic the feeling of being with their mother, and this helps to reduce their stress levels. The center also added that it's not unusual for different species to form close bonds, especially when they are in a situation where they only have each other to rely on. The staff at the center have observed that Anzac and Peggy have a deep understanding of each other's body language, and they communicate in their own unique way. Anzac is a five-month-old kangaroo joey, which makes him vulnerable and in need of protection. Peggy, on the other hand, is a six-month-old wombat that can be quite feisty and protective of her friend. Their bond became apparent to the staff at the rescue center after they noticed that Anzac would jump into Peggy's pouch, which is something that young kangaroos typically only do with their mother. Peggy, in turn, would snuggle up to Anzac, creating a cozy space where they could both feel safe and secure. The friendship between Anzac and Peggy has captured the hearts of people all over the world, with the center receiving messages of support, love, and admiration for the pair. The center has also used this unique friendship as a way of promoting conservation and the need to protect wildlife habitats. Anzac and Peggy have become ambassadors for their species, showing that there is more to animals than their stereotypical behavior. They have shown that animals can form friendships across species boundaries, and that all creatures have the ability to show kindness and compassion. As the two friends sleep together, they continue to provide each other with a sense of security and comfort. Their bond is a reminder of the beauty of the natural world, and the need for all of us to come together to protect and preserve it.
