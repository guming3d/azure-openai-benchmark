Melbourne retired civil engineer Joseph Drago, 69, is charged with murdering Anthony Richard Dockerty over a dispute regarding Mr Dockerty's rowdy dog . 'He has contemplated crime after crime after crime before the man died,' Mr Tinney told the court on Friday. Victorian Supreme Court prosecutor, Andrew Tinney SC, said Balwyn North local Drago had complained to police after Mr Dockerty failed to appear at court last year when both were charged with offences relating to their dispute. Mr Tinney said Drago told police in November: 'If you're not going to do your job I will and you're not going to like what I do.' CCTV footage played to a previous court hearing showed Drago accelerating over Mr Dockerty, dragging him under his car some 116 metres down the road . On December 2 Drago drove to the Thornbury factory where Mr Dockerty worked to take photos of him. The pair had an altercation before Drago climbed into his car, while Mr Dockerty stood in front of the vehicle to block his escape. CCTV footage played to a previous court hearing showed Drago accelerating over Mr Dockerty, dragging him under his car some 116 metres down the road. Drago's barrister Constantine Helliotis QC said the anti-social acts that took place between Drago and Mr Dockerty were not on the plan of action. 'There is no connection between what's on the computer and what happened in real life,' Mr Helliotis said.

Drago reportedly told police in November: 'If you're not going to do your job I will and you're not going to like what I do.' Psychologist Patrick Newton said the plan was contemplated action rather than implemented action and Drago had lost perspective. 'People in heated disputes, protracted disputes, often consider things that are out of proportion,' Mr Newton said. Judge Paul Coghlan said the extraordinary material found on the computer had not been properly addressed by Mr Newton's reports. He adjourned the bail application to allow further psychological testing on Drago.

chatgpt: A Melbourne man has been charged with the murder of his neighbor after allegedly running over the latter with his car. Joseph Drago appeared in court on Tuesday, where he was formally charged with the murder of his neighbor. The incident occurred after a heated argument over a barking dog. According to reports, the relationship between the two neighbors had been tumultuous for some time, with frequent arguments over petty issues. The latest altercation centered around the neighbor's barking dog, which is said to have provoked Drago, leading to a physical altercation on the street. However, the incident took a deadly turn when Drago allegedly got into his car and ran over his neighbor, resulting in the neighbor's death. Police responding to the scene arrived to find the victim lying in the street, with Drago standing nearby. It has since emerged that Drago had been planning the attack on his neighbor for some time, with a detailed revenge plan found on his computer. The plan reportedly involved putting an inflatable kangaroo on the road at night, in the hope that his neighbor would crash into it. The discovery of the revenge plan has only served to heighten the severity of the case against Drago. The prosecution argued in court that Drago had shown premeditation and intent in his actions, which had led to the death of his neighbor. The defense, however, argued that Drago's mental state at the time of the incident was questionable, and that he had undergone significant psychological trauma in his life. Drago is now undergoing further psychological testing as part of the ongoing investigation into the incident. The case has attracted widespread attention in Australia, with many people expressing shock and concern over the nature of the incident. Many people have called for greater resources to be devoted to resolving disputes between neighbors before they escalate to the point of violence. The incident has also sparked discussions about the role of mental health in cases of violence and the need for greater awareness and resources to be devoted to this issue. Overall, the case of Joseph Drago has highlighted the destructive impact that personal disputes can have, and the need for greater understanding and resolution of such conflicts before they lead to tragic and irreversible consequences. It is hoped that the ongoing investigation will provide clarity and closure for all those affected by the incident.
