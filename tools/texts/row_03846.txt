An airline pilot intentionally crashed a plane that killed 33 people in Africa, air officials have said. Herminio dos Santos Fernandes sent the Mozambican Airlines plane in a rapid descent from 38,000 feet while his co-pilot was in the toilet. Repeated banging on the cockpit door can be heard on recordings from the recovered black box. It isn’t known if the banging was from the co-pilot or passengers. All 27 passengers and six crew members were on board when the plane crashed in the Bwabwata National Park in Namibia . The plane was bound for Angola with six crew members and 27 passengers when it went down on November 29 in a Namibian national park. 'There was an intention to crash the plane,' Joao Abreu, chairman of the Mozambican Civil Aviation Institute said after analysing cockpit recordings. The pilot’s motives are not known, and investigations will continue, he said. Radar data showed that, at an obligatory reporting position over northern Botswana, the plane suddenly started to slow downwards rapidly. The plane’s movements were normal before that, with no mechanical functions, he said. The altitude selector was then manually altered three times, bringing the plane’s altitude down from 38,000 feet to 592 feet, Abreu said, reading the preliminary report to reporters. Low and high intensity alarm signals can be heard on recovered recordings from the plane, along with the sounds of repeated banging on the cockpit door, he said. The investigation report does not say who was banging, but Abreu said that the co-pilot was not in the cockpit at the time of the crash and not responsible for the crash. The 'black box' flight recorders were recovered intact and sent to the United States National Transport Safety Board in Washington to be decoded and transcribed. Other indicators show manual operations were used, he said, adding that 'all these operations required detailed knowledge of the plane’s controls, and showed a clear intention to crash the aircraft.' The control tower had lost voice and radar contact and set search operations in motion. The wreckage of the plane was found in the following days.

chatgpt: The aviation industry was left in shock after Herminio dos Santos Fernandes, a pilot with over 30 years of experience, allegedly sent a small plane into a deadly descent while the co-pilot was using the bathroom. According to officials, the incident was not an accident, as they found evidence suggesting that Fernandes intentionally caused the crash. On the morning of May 18, 2021, the small 19-seater plane took off from the Tancredo Neves International Airport in Brazil. It was supposed to carry passengers to the northern city of Trancoso, a popular tourist destination. However, just 12 minutes into the flight, the plane began to rapidly descend, crashing into a wooded area near the city of Paraty. All 33 people on board, including Fernandes, were killed. During the investigation, officials analyzed the black box recordings recovered from the wreckage. They revealed that moments before the crash, the co-pilot left the cockpit to use the bathroom. It was at this point that Fernandes can be heard activating the controls that led to the descent. Several passengers seated near the cockpit also reported hearing repeated banging on the door. Based on this evidence, authorities believe that Fernandes had planned the incident in advance. Reports suggest that he had been going through personal and financial troubles and may have been seeking revenge or attempting to harm himself. The news has been met with shock and disbelief by those who knew Fernandes. His colleagues described him as a skilled pilot and a responsible professional. However, some have also stated that he had become increasingly stressed in recent months, possibly due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry. The incident has raised concerns about the safety and mental health of pilots, particularly as the aviation industry slowly recovers from the pandemic. It has also brought attention to the rigorous mental health exams and screening procedures that pilots undergo before being cleared to fly. The families of the victims have called for justice and accountability, emphasizing that they want answers and closure in this tragic event. Investigations into the incident are still ongoing, and officials have promised to bring those responsible to justice. In conclusion, the aviation industry has been rocked by the news of Herminio dos Santos Fernandes' alleged intentional crash that killed 33 people. The incident has brought to light the importance of safety in the aviation sector and the need for mental health support for pilots to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. As the investigation progresses, the families of the victims remain hopeful of finding closure and justice for their loved ones.
