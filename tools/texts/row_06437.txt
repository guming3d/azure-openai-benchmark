article: By . Mark Prigg . Doctors have been warned to think twice before recommending smokers switch to e-cigarettes. Scientists say more research is needed on the gadgets - and say they could also be harming people's health. This study is believed to be the first to measure attitudes toward e-cigarettes among physicians treating adult smokers. Scientists say more research is needed on the e-cigarettes - and say they could also be harming people's health. The new survey of North Carolina physicians published in PLOS ONE surveyed a random sample of 128 North Carolina physicians about their attitudes towards e-cigarettes. Two thirds (67 percent) of the surveyed physicians indicated e-cigarettes are a helpful aid for smoking cessation, and 35 percent recommended them to their patients. 'Even in the absence of evidence regarding the health impact of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, a third of physicians we surveyed are recommending e-cigarettes to their patients to help quit smoking,' said Leah Ranney, PhD, one of the authors of the survey and associate director of the Tobacco Prevention and Evaluation Program at UNC. 'Yet, e-cigarettes are not approved by the FDA for smoking cessation. 'It is clear that physicians should refrain from recommending e-cigarettes until more is known about their safety.' According to Wells Fargo the estimated total size of the retail market in the US is $2bn. The study found that physicians were more likely to recommend e-cigarettes when their patients asked about them or when the physician believed e-cigarettes were safer than smoking standard cigarettes. e-cigarettes are not approved by the FDA for smoking cessation - but doctors are increasingly recommending them, researchers found . However, physicians often have inconsistent information about the safety of using e-cigarettes and in this survey 13 percent are unaware that e-cigarettes are not approved by the FDA. 'Physicians may choose to use FDA approved medications rather than devices and products not approved by FDA,' says Dr. Adam Goldstein, a UNC Family Medicine physician and study co-author. The researchers concluded that the area needed more research. 'This research provides a first look at how e-cigarettes are being used as cessation devices among physicians who treat adult patients. 'Our results suggest that physicians see potential in these products as a cessation device and that some make recommendations for their use. 'As e-cigarettes become more mainstream, physicians may be called on to engage in conversations with their patients about the safety and efficacy of these products. 'It is essential that the FDA critically review the current evidence on e-cigarettes and provide clear guidance about e-cigarettes and tobacco cessation.'

chatgpt: A new study has found that e-cigarettes - also known as vaping devices - may not be safe for use as cessation tools, and could potentially be harmful to users' health. The research, which marks the first time physicians' attitudes towards e-cigarettes in the context of adult smoking were measured, indicates that more research is necessary to determine the devices' true impact. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California San Francisco and published in the journal "PLOS ONE," surveyed 776 physicians about their attitudes towards e-cigarettes as a tool to help adult smokers quit smoking. Only 13% of the physicians surveyed recommended e-cigarettes to their patients for cessation purposes, while 36% discouraged their use. One of the major concerns voiced by the physicians surveyed was the lack of regulation surrounding e-cigarettes. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved e-cigarettes as a cessation tool, and the study's authors say that the devices' long-term health impacts remain unknown. In addition, due to lower manufacturing standards for e-cigarettes compared to traditional cigarettes, they may actually pose a greater risk to users' health. According to Dr. Stanton Glantz, one of the study's authors and director of the UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, "E-cigarettes are not approved by the FDA for smoking cessation because evidences show that they may harm health; furthermore, they are subject to lower manufacturing standards than FDA-approved cessation aids." The study also revealed that the majority of the physicians surveyed did not believe e-cigarettes were an effective cessation tool, though only a small percentage actively discouraged their use. Instead, healthcare providers often recommended traditional cessation aids, such as nicotine patches or gum, as a safer and more effective option for quitting smoking. Critics of the study argue that e-cigarettes are a lesser evil than traditional cigarettes, and may offer smokers an easier way to quit. However, the study's authors warn that more research is needed to truly understand the potential impact of e-cigarettes on users' health. As the popularity of e-cigarettes continues to grow, their safety and efficacy as cessation tools remain a hotly debated topic both among the medical community and among users themselves. While some continue to advocate for their use, others point to the lack of regulatory oversight and the potential health risks as reasons to avoid them. In light of the study's findings, it may be wise for physicians to approach e-cigarettes with caution when recommending cessation tools to their patients. Until more research is conducted, there remains a significant degree of uncertainty surrounding the safety and efficacy of these devices.
