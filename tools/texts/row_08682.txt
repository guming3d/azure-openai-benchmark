chatgpt: Italian striker Mario Balotelli is set to return to the Italy squad after missing out on the last two games. Balotelli, who plays for Liverpool, has been called up by national coach Antonio Conte for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia on Sunday. The match is slated to be held in Split and will be a crucial game for the Azzurri. Balotelli's return to the squad marks the first time the striker has been called up by Conte. The Liverpool man was left out of the last two games due to poor form and lack of playing time. Italy missed Balotelli's influence in their last game against Bulgaria, which ended in a 2-2 draw. The Azzurri had many chances to seal the win, but their lack of firepower upfront proved to be their downfall. The striker appeared to be in good spirits as he trained with the rest of the team in Florence on Wednesday. Balotelli was seen joking and laughing with his teammates, clearly relishing his return to the national team. Conte has expressed his happiness for Balotelli's return, stating that the Liverpool man has the ability to make a difference for Italy. "Balotelli has the quality to change a game, to make the difference," Conte was quoted as saying by Sky Sports. Balotelli's form at Liverpool has been patchy since he joined the club from AC Milan last summer. The striker has managed just four goals in 28 appearances for the Reds, which is not an impressive record by any means. However, Conte is confident that Balotelli will replicate his performance on the international stage. The Italian coach is likely to start Balotelli up front against Croatia, alongside Eder and Graziano Pelle. Italy currently sits at the top of Group H with 10 points in four games. The Azzurri are unbeaten in their last six games and will be looking to extend that run against Croatia. The game against Croatia is an important qualifier for Italy. Croatia is currently second in the group with nine points, so a win for the Azzurri will put them in a commanding position in their bid for a place in Euro 2016. Balotelli's return to the squad will provide Conte with the much-needed firepower upfront. The Liverpool man has a point to prove and will be looking to put in a good performance for Italy. It remains to be seen if Balotelli can replicate his form for Italy, but Conte's faith in the striker suggests that the former Manchester City man still has a lot to offer. The game against Croatia will be a key test for Balotelli, but he has the quality to make a difference and help Italy secure a crucial win.
