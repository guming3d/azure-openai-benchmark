article: (CNN) -- Natalie Montanaro, 52, a research assistant from the College of Charleston, South Carolina, volunteered for the U.S. Peace Corps and moved to Romania in May 2009. Now, more than a year later, Montanaro lives in the small rural community of Brusturoasa, a collection of five villages in the north-east of the country with a population of around 3,000. Steeped in tradition and religion, life in rural Romania is a far cry from Charleston, as Montanaro explained to CNN: . "It's very old world. There are many animals -- chickens, horses and cows. You have to watch out what you're crossing in front of on the street, especially the cows!" Read about Montanaro's travels on iReport . Montanaro works at the village's three schools, teaching English to students from kindergarten to grade eight. On top of lessons she gives afternoon conversation classes and teaches the students computer skills after school. But the project closest to Montanaro's heart is the international cooking day she hosts once a month for the 12 to 15-year-old students. "They learn about different ways of preparing meals, healthy choices, food safety, kitchen methods, terms, tools, and other things like cooperation, timing, dinner conversation and how to set an entertaining table," she said. With no supermarket in the village Montanaro has transformed her garden into a thriving vegetable patch. She explained to CNN: "I've planted a garden with spinach, artichokes, red lettuce, rosemary, leeks, peppers and basil, to name just a few. "We will use these along with other garden staples like potatoes, carrots, onions, tomatoes, eggplant and cucumbers to make more dishes this summer that they haven't had a chance to taste yet," she said. For Montanaro, becoming a Peace Corps volunteer has been a life long ambition and one she has not regretted. "For me, my service has been a blessing. I have been able to fulfil a promise, realize many dreams, live among kind people, learn from others about new traditions, share culture and time with people who are now my friends," she told CNN. "The children are wonderfully expressive, thoughtful, intelligent, and spirited and the beauty that I've seen here during my days as a Peace Corps volunteer makes everything worthwhile."

chatgpt: Natalie Montanaro is making a tangible impact in the rural community of Brusturoasa by volunteering with the U.S. Peace Corp. The small village located in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains in Romania has no close supermarket and limited resources, making Montanaro's contribution to the community all the more significant. Montanaro, who hails from California, has been living with a host family in Brusturoasa while volunteering with the Peace Corps. While the program pays for her rent, Montanaro has been relying heavily on the produce from her garden due to the village's limited access to supermarkets. Her garden serves as a primary source of fruits and vegetables for her and her host family, which has proven to be both sustainable and practical. Montanaro's decision to be a volunteer with the Peace Corps wasn't an easy one, but she ultimately chose to pursue the opportunity as a way to make a difference. "I felt like I needed to do something that was giving back," Montanaro said in a recent interview. "I think we are all part of this planet, and I felt like I needed to be doing something for it." Living with a host family has allowed Montanaro to fully immerse herself in the local culture and customs, giving her a unique perspective on life in the village. "I think living with a host family is a really important part of the experience," Montanaro said. "It allows you to really see what their daily lives are like." Montanaro's work with the Peace Corps has involved a variety of projects aimed at improving the lives of people in the village. One of her main focuses has been on promoting healthy living habits among local residents. This has involved everything from teaching people how to cook healthy meals to educating them on the benefits of regular exercise. Overall, Montanaro's experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in Brusturoasa has been a positive one. She credits the experience with helping her to grow both personally and professionally. And while her time in the village is coming to an end, Montanaro is proud of the work she has done and the impact she has made. "I feel like I've learned so much from this experience," Montanaro said. "And I hope that I've been able to make a positive impact on the community."
