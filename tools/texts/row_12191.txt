The Australian reports Hackett's manager, Chris White, confirmed that the swimming champion had voluntarily attended a Melbourne police station on Friday to answer questions about the incident. It's believed he was in Melbourne to spent time with his twins, Charlize and Jagger, 5,  and returned to the Gold Coast. 'There is little I can say at this stage,' Hackett told the Australian while at the airport. Police have confirmed they interviewed a 34 year old Queensland man regarding the Melbourne incident  and that he was released pending further inquiries. 'We cannot comment any further,' said a police media spokesperson. In February, Jagger had gone missing from the hotel room the family was staying in. He was later found safe and well by Crown Security within the casino complex, according to reports. It is unclear where exactly Jagger was found, but it is understood he was not on the gaming room floor or on any licensed premises. Hackett reportedly awoke in the early hours of Saturday morning when he realised his son had disappeared.

chatgpt: Former Olympic swimmer and Australian icon, Grant Hackett, has been questioned by police regarding an incident at Melbourne’s Crown Casino earlier this year. Reports indicate that Hackett was searching semi-naked for his missing four-year-old son, Jagger, within the casino complex.  The incident reportedly occurred in February of this year when Hackett was in Melbourne attending the Australian Swimming Championships. Hackett had taken his young son to the Crown Casino and had momentarily lost sight of the child. In a panic, Hackett began searching for Jagger in a state of undress. Photos subsequently emerged of the former swimmer, wearing only his underwear and with a distressed look on his face.  Following the incident, the young boy was found safe and well within the casino. However, the situation resulted in a significant amount of media attention and raised concerns regarding Hackett’s wellbeing.  In the months following the incident, there were reports that Hackett had sought treatment for mental health issues. Hackett’s management team have since made statements regarding the athlete’s state of mind, suggesting that he has been actively seeking treatment and support. Recently, Hackett voluntarily attended Melbourne’s police station to respond to questions regarding the incident. Hackett’s manager, Chris White, released a statement confirming that the former swimmer had cooperated fully with the authorities.  “Grant voluntarily attended the South Melbourne police station to assist police with their inquiries, as concerning an incident that occurred in the Crown Casino complex on 19 February 2017. Grant has cooperated fully with police and no charges have been laid, or are expected to be laid in respect of this incident.” White went on to state that Hackett is fully committed to addressing his mental health issues and is currently undergoing treatment. “Grant is continuing his treatment for mental health issues, supported by his family and professional team. It'll be a slow and steady road back to good health for Grant. His journey is by no means over but he is heading in the right direction day by day.” Despite the athlete’s admission of struggling with mental health issues, Hackett’s management team have confirmed that he remains committed to his career in the public eye. Hackett is a highly respected sportsman in Australia and has achieved considerable success as an Olympic athlete.  Whilst the recent incident involving Hackett and his son at the Crown Casino was undoubtedly a concern, it has brought to light the importance of supporting individuals dealing with mental health issues. Hackett’s openness regarding his struggles will no doubt help to raise awareness of the issue and encourage others to seek help and support when needed.
