chatgpt: After 23 years of racing with Hendrick Motorsports, Jeff Gordon has announced that he is stepping away from full-time competition in NASCAR. The 43-year-old driver from Pittsboro, Indiana, is coming off one of his best performances in years, finishing sixth in the season standings despite not winning any races. In a statement made to the press, Gordon said that he wasn't officially calling it retirement. He said that there's always the possibility that he would compete in selected events in the future. But for now, he's excited to explore opportunities outside the race track. "I won't be racing the full schedule anymore, but I'm excited about exploring other opportunities that will allow me to remain around the sport and continue to give back to the fans who've supported me over my career," Gordon said. Gordon's career as a NASCAR driver began in 1992, and he has since become one of the most successful drivers in the sport's history. He has 93 career wins, four championships, and is third on the all-time wins list behind only Richard Petty and David Pearson. He has spent his entire career with Hendrick Motorsports, where he has cemented his legendary status in the sport. Gordon has long been considered one of the most talented and accomplished drivers in NASCAR history. His success on the track has been matched by his contributions off it, both as a philanthropist and as an ambassador for the sport. His charitable work has included the Jeff Gordon Children's Foundation, which has raised millions of dollars for pediatric cancer research. Hendrick Motorsports owner Rick Hendrick praised Gordon's contributions to the team, saying that he was "one of the biggest reasons for the success of this organization." "We're a better team and better people because he's been a part of our organization," Hendrick said. "As someone who's been around the sport for a long time, I can tell you that Jeff is one of the greatest drivers of all time." Gordon's announcement marks the end of an era in NASCAR, but his impact on the sport will be felt for years to come. He will be remembered not only for his success on the track but for his contributions off of it, and his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of drivers and fans alike.
