A prisoner was killed in a high-speed car chase with police after breaking out through the roof of an Arkansas jail with his cellmate. Stephen Mitchell, 39, who had been on remand at the Jackson County Detention Centre facing a charge of first-degree battery, died yesterday afternoon pursued by police in Missouri. He and fellow prisoner Steven Reed, 22, had escaped late on Sunday night after removing a light fixture from the ceiling of a cell that was in a surveillance camera blind spot.

Reed was later recaptured while Mitchell died in a car chase with police . The pair had worked at the hole left until it was big enough to climb through into the jail's attic, from where they were able to escape on to the roof, ABC News reported. Reed was recaptured on Monday evening in a nearby rural community, but Mitchell was not found until the next day, when a Missouri highway patrol officer stopped a White Nissan Sentra for speeding and spotted him inside. Mitchell's wife, Jessica, was driving the car, with her husband in the front passenger seat. But as she stepped out of the vehicle to answer the patrolman's questions, the fugitive leapt into the driver's seat and sped off. He got away, but hours later Missouri police again spotted the car and gave chase - until a catastrophic car wreck ended his bid for freedom, and his life. Jackson County Sheriff David Lucas told ABC News: 'During the pursuit, Mitchell wrecked his vehicle and sustained fatal injuries, which led to his death.' Missouri police are investigating the cause of Mitchell's accident. His wife placed in custody in Mountain View, Missouri, awaiting an extradition hearing to be returned to Arkansas, where police hoped to question her about any involvement in the escape. Reed, Mitchell's co-escapee, was meanwhile charged with first-degree escape and sent back to jail with bail set at $1million. Before his escape he had been awaiting transportation back to state prison for a parole violation. Mitchell and Reed's escape was not discovered until Monday morning, some ten hours after they broke out of jail, giving them a considerable headstart on police. Sheriff Lucas said conditions at Jackson County Detention Center had not helped matters. The jail is designed for 26 prisoners but usually holds around 50. 'I am not making excuses, but it is hard when you have limited staff and are underfunded and overcrowded,' he said.

chatgpt: Two inmates managed to escape from a county jail in Oklahoma last week, sparking a manhunt that lasted several days. Stephen Mitchell, aged 39, and William Reed, aged 22, were able to exploit a surveillance blind spot to gain access to the facility's attic. From there, they began to burrow through the ceiling, eventually making their way out of the prison's perimeter. Reed was the first of the fugitives to be apprehended, with police discovering him hiding in a nearby rural community. He was returned to custody without incident. However, Mitchell was able to evade recapture for several days, making it across the Missouri border before he was eventually tracked down by local law enforcement. Mitchell's escape came to an abrupt end when he was involved in a high-speed car chase with Missouri police. The fugitive was attempting to evade his pursuers when he lost control of his vehicle and crashed. Tragically, Mitchell did not survive the accident and was pronounced dead at the scene. The escape from the jail has raised serious concerns about the security of the facility. The surveillance blind spot that Mitchell and Reed exploited has now been identified and corrected, but there is still a sense that more needs to be done to ensure that prisoners cannot escape in this way. Speaking to local reporters, the sheriff for the county in which the jail is located said that he was "grateful for the hard work of law enforcement from both Oklahoma and Missouri in tracking down these fugitives." He went on to highlight the need for better training and equipment for prison staff, noting that "we need to do everything we can to prevent escapes from happening in the first place." The escape and subsequent chase have also brought attention to issues around prisoner transportation. Mitchell and Reed were both awaiting trial for serious crimes, and were being held in the jail while they awaited their court dates. However, it is clear that the current system is not working - when prisoners are able to escape while in custody, it puts both the public and law enforcement at risk. There will no doubt be an investigation into how the escape was able to happen, and what steps can be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. However, for now, the focus will be on bringing closure to the families of those affected by the two fugitives. The death of Stephen Mitchell is a tragic reminder of the dangers that can happen when criminals are on the loose, and of the hard work and sacrifice by law enforcement officials to keep citizens safe.
