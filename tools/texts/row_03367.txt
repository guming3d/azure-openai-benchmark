An artist has transformed ugly run-down public structures into works of art by camouflaging them into their background using paint. Dutch designer Roeland Otten has used mosaics, geometric paint designs, and high resolution photograph wall coverings to recreate the otherwise blocked and lost views of the city streets. He has managed to turn an air quality measuring station, an electricity substation and a public toilet in Amsterdam into artistic creations. Now you WC me, now you don't: Dutch designer Roeland Otten likes to brighten up urban streets by camouflaging misplaced public structures . How to lose loos: Public buildings are decorated from all sides so the optical illusion works from all directions . Mosey on by: Jogger runs past a mosaic used to create a replica of the scene behind it . His aim is to disguise eyesores on picturesque urban streets and pathways and rejuvenate the area by doing so. His City Camouflage project, featured in Dezeen magazine, includes a pixelated view of Jan van Galenstraat shopping street in Amsterdam using tiles. Otten's project began in 2009 with the transformation of a former electricity substation on the corner of Graaf Floristraat and Heemraadsingel in Rotterdam.

Drive to distraction: The clever artwork involving these parked cars makes you forget there is even a building there .

Acrylic paint is used to transform a rusty electricity substation on the Boompjeskade waterfront in Rotterdam . He decorated the building in sheets of aluminium printed with high-resolution photographs of the surrounding streets, so that it seemed almost invisible among the houses and trees. Last year he used acrylic paint to transform a rusty electricity substation on the Boompjeskade waterfront in Rotterdam. The bold graphic paintwork makes the substation blend in with the water and foliage nearby. An old public toilet building used to measure the quality of the air was used for another part of the project, which you can find out more about atÂ www.roelandotten.com.

chatgpt: In the world of architecture, one designer has found a new way to bring life to the city streets. Roeland Otten, a Dutch artist and designer, has used a combination of mosaics and geometric paint designs to create stunning works of street art that not only capture the attention of passersby but also recreate otherwise blocked and lost views of the city. Otten's work is inspired by the geometric patterns found in Islamic art and architecture, and he uses them to create intricate and visually striking designs. Using a combination of shapes, colors, and textures, he transforms blank walls, utility boxes, and other urban structures into works of art that celebrate the beauty and diversity of the city. One of Otten's most significant projects involved the transformation of a series of blank walls that blocked the view of a busy street. Working with the city's planning department, he created a series of mosaics and geometric paint designs that not only beautified the area but also opened up new views of the city. Now, residents and visitors alike can enjoy the street's vibrant atmosphere and unique character. Otten's work has also drawn attention from other cities around the world, and he has been invited to create similar projects in cities such as London, Paris, and Tokyo. His work serves not only to beautify the urban landscape but also to encourage people to explore and engage with their surroundings. What sets Otten's work apart is his commitment to combining geometric patterns with local culture and traditions. By incorporating elements of local history, architecture, and design into his creations, he creates a sense of place and belonging that resonates with people and helps to create a stronger sense of community. For Otten, the possibilities of street art are limitless, and he sees his work as a way to create a more livable and sustainable city. By transforming dull and lifeless spaces into works of art that people can enjoy and interact with, he hopes to inspire others to see the potential for urban design to create positive change in our lives. As cities continue to grow and urbanization becomes the norm, designers like Otten play a vital role in shaping our public spaces and creating dynamic and vibrant communities. With his unique blend of creativity, innovation, and community engagement, Otten is paving the way for a more inclusive and sustainable urban future.
