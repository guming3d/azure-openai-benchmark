chatgpt: Matt and Pat Monschein have been married for a remarkable 46 years. However, the couple's golden years have turned out to be far from the idyllic retirement they had hoped for. Mr. Monschein, 71, has been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer, while his wife Pat, 68, is a double amputee as a result of complications from diabetes.  Despite these challenges, the Monscheins remain positive and determined to live each day to the fullest, cherishing the time they have left together. The couple has faced adversity before, having lost their home to a fire in 2017, but they refuse to let life's challenges get them down.  When Mr. Monschein received his cancer diagnosis earlier this year, it was a devastating blow for the couple. However, they are determined to make the most of their time together, and have spent the past few months travelling and enjoying each other's company. They recently took a trip to Colorado, where they were able to spend time with their family and take in the sights. Despite his condition, Mr. Monschein remains upbeat and is determined to fight his illness for as long as he can. "I've been blessed in so many ways," he said. "I have a wonderful wife, a great family, and amazing friends. I don't want to waste any of the time I have left." Meanwhile, Pat Monschein is an inspiration to all who know her. Despite losing both legs to diabetes, she refuses to let her disability define her, and remains active and independent. She enjoys knitting, reading, and spending time with her family, and has even returned to work part-time at a local hospital. In a time when many people would feel justified in giving up, the Monscheins are a shining example of resilience and determination. Their love for each other and their positive outlook on life are an inspiration to all who know them. As the couple faces this difficult chapter of their lives, they have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from their community. Friends and family have rallied around them, offering help with everything from meal preparation to transportation to medical appointments. The Monscheins are grateful for the love and support they have received, and are cherishing every moment together. "We are taking it one day at a time," said Pat Monschein. "But we are determined to make the most of each and every one of those days."
