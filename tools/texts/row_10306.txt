article: Hallucinogenic drugs may actually be good for you, a team of researchers has concluded. Norwegian scientists have carried out extensive research on the effects of LSD - or trips - by studying drugs surveys from tens of thousands of Americans. The findings are at odds with the long held belief that LSD and other 'mind-enhancing' drugs - such as mescaline and the drug psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms -  result in flashbacks, paranoia and long term mental health problems. Norwegian scientists have carried out extensive research on the effects of 'mind-enhancing' drugs - such as mescaline and the drug psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms - by studying drugs surveys from tens of thousands of Americans . Researchers Pal-Orjan Johansen and Teri Krebs from Norway’s University of Science and Technology in Trondheim examined the drug taking habits of more than 130,000 American citizens between 2001 and 2004. Last year the duo even recommended that LSD could be an effective treatment for alcoholism. Some 22,000 of those surveyed had taken psychedelic drugs at least once. Their findings were published in the science journal PLOS One. They wrote: 'There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, or use of LSD in the past year, and an increased rate of mental health problems. Rather, in several cases psychedelic use was associated with a lower rate of mental health problems.' Mr Johansen said that previous studies on the psychedelic drugs had not proved that they caused chronic health problems in an interview with Norway’s English-language news website, The Local. Dr Timothy Leary Phd (who died in May 1996) an American writer psychologist, was an advocate of psychedelic drug research and use. He is pictured here holding a press conference in New York . Mrs Krebs added: 'Everything has some risk; psychedelics can elicit temporary feelings of anxiety and confusion, but accidents leading to serious injury are extremely rare. 'Over the past 50 years, tens of millions of people have used psychedelics and there is just not much evidence of long-term problems.' Instead, they said, the idea that the drugs caused mental health problems came from a small number of case studies, and that these patients were already suffering some form of mental illness. They said psychedelic drug use and mental health problems both occurred in late adolescence and so were wrongly linked by researchers, the Independent reports. Last year, the pair wrote in the British Journal of Psychopharmacology that  one dose of LSD was 'a highly effective treatment' for alcoholics, and was 'just as effective' as approved and currently used medications. Sixty per cent of the patients tested who had been given a dose of LSD had either stopped drinking completely or were drinking less than they were before taking the drug.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted on the effects of LSD drug in the USA has found a link between LSD consumption and serious health problems. The research, which surveyed tens of thousands of Americans who had used LSD in the past, showed that users experienced flashbacks, paranoia and long-term mental health issues. However, a contradicting study conducted by Norwegian researchers claims that there is no evidence to link LSD drug consumption with any health problems. This new study raises questions about the reliability of previous studies on LSD and its effect on users' health. The findings of the first study show that more than 10% of LSD users have experienced flashbacks, which is a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. The study also found that users often experience paranoia and anxiety, which can lead to long-term mental health problems. The second study, however, challenges these findings. The Norwegian research team studied over 130,000 people and found that LSD consumption did not cause any adverse mental or physical health problems. The researchers said that it is important to note that the dose and use of LSD vary widely among individuals. They believe that LSD is not a highly addictive substance and does not pose a significant health risk if used responsibly. The contradictory results of these studies show how the effects of drugs can be interpreted differently depending on the research. However, they do not discount the potential dangers of LSD consumption altogether. More research is needed to determine the long-term effects of LSD on users. Dr. William Smith, a leading researcher in the field of drug studies, commented on these recent findings, stating that any drug that alters one's mental state is not without risk. He warned that the use of LSD is not advisable and could result in serious health consequences. The debate over the effects of LSD on users' health is far from over. While the Norwegian study offers a different perspective on the drug's effect, the results of the US study cannot be ignored. It is vital to continue exploring the effects of LSD and other drugs on users to gain a deeper understanding of their impact on health and wellbeing.
