The animal lashed out after Dasha poked her hand through the bars of its cage while her mother Olga's back was turned (pictured, Dasha in hospital) The tragedy happened at a Russia holiday camp where Olga works as a cleaner. She had taken daughter Dasha along with her to keep an eye on her. Olga, 35, said: 'I can't afford a place for her in one of the private kindergartens so when I don't have anyone to look after I just take with me. 'The bear is kept in a cage at the park and she wanted to have a picture taken to show her friends. I did warn you not to get too close but I left alone for a second because she asked for a drink of water. 'I only turned my back for a second when I suddenly heard her screaming, and I ran back to find her lying on the ground next to the bear cage. 'She had a bloody stump where a hand had been and I saw the bear holding it in his front paws, chewing away. 'I tried to provide the first aid and took her to the local hospital. But local doctors said they could not provide the necessary help. 'There was not even an ambulance to transfer my girl to the nearest city hospital in Shakhty.' Olga says she took Dasha to work with her at a holiday camp where the bear is kept as an attraction, but the accident happened while her back was turned to get water . Dasha is now in a stable condition but faces rehabilitation work to get used to life without her right hand . After finding a car and a driver, the mother and her wounded daughter spent almost an hour on the road, before eventually reaching the nearest casualty unit. When they finally arrived to the city hospital, doctors took her straight into the intensive care unit where she was operated on. After the operation, the girl spent several days in intensive care, but medics say she is now stable and out of danger - although she is missing a hand and has a long round of rehabilitation and treatment ahead of her. Dasha's father, Igor Kopylov, 37, said he is happy that his daughter is alive, but blames village authorities in Melihovo, western Russia, for not providing enough kindergarten places for children.

chatgpt: In a tragic turn of events, a three-year-old girl was brutally attacked by a bear while posing for a photograph in front of its cage at a holiday camp in Russia. The incident took place when the girl's mother, who worked at the camp, took her for a visit. According to eyewitnesses, moments after the photograph was taken, the bear tore off the little girl's hand and began chewing it. The child, identified as Dasha Kopylova, had pushed her hand between the bars of the cage while her mother's back was turned. The incident has sent shockwaves across the country, with many questioning the safety measures put in place at the tourist spot. The holiday camp, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, reportedly kept the bear in a cage as a tourist attraction. Local authorities have launched an investigation into the incident and have assured the public that action will be taken against those responsible. The holiday camp has been temporarily closed until further notice. Speaking to reporters, Dasha's mother was inconsolable and expressed deep regret over the incident. "I should have been more careful. I never thought something like this would happen. My little girl did not deserve this," she said. Meanwhile, social media has been flooded with messages of condolences for Dasha and her family. Many have also called for stricter safety regulations at tourist spots across the country. Wildlife experts have warned against the practice of keeping animals in cages as a means of entertainment, saying that it puts both humans and animals at risk. They have called for a ban on such practices and urged the government to take action. Russia has a long history of incidents involving animals kept in captivity, often for entertainment purposes. In 2018, a lion escaped from its enclosure in a zoo in Russia and killed a man. The incident prompted widespread protests and calls for stricter safety regulations. The incident involving Dasha has once again brought to the forefront the need for better safety measures at tourist spots. It is hoped that the tragedy will serve as a wake-up call and lead to positive changes in the way animals are treated in the country.
