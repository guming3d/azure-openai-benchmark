One small garden lizard showed extreme bravery squaring up to a cat intent on making it a meal. The Oriental garden lizard decided to fight back when the pet took a swipe at it on a grassy patch in Malaysia. The cat, a local stray, was so surprised by the lizard’s boldness that the reptile was able to make a quick getaway and incredibly, survive the feline’s attack. Put up a fight: This Oriental garden lizard bravely took on this stray cat as it tried to take a swipe at it in Malaysia . The lizard stood its ground, raising itself on its front legs and opening its mouth in an attempt to scare off the cat as it stood threateningly over the lizard. Amateur photographer Adzrin Taib spotted the assault and quickly grabbed his camera, capturing these amusing, mid-fight pictures. He said: ‘I loved the idea of the lizard being so brave and I decided to grab my camera, luckily it had a happy ending too. The stare off: The moggy was surprised to find that the little lizard stood its ground, allowing the lizard to make a quick get away . ‘The little lizard got away this time. I think the cat was surprised his dinner was trying to fight back. ‘In Malaysia we have a lot of lizards and I love seeing them in the garden. 'They all seem to have their own little characters. But a lot do get attacked by cats sadly.' Oriental garden lizards are found throughout Asia and can change colour to bright red, black and brown. During breeding season the male's throat turns bright red which has led to the incorrect nickname of 'bloodsucker'. They are related to iguanas and can move each of their eyes in different directions like a chameleon.

chatgpt: In a rare display of courage, a small Oriental garden lizard stood its ground when faced with a stray cat in Malaysia. Amateur photographer Adzrin Taib happened to be present and captured the entire fight in pictures. The images show the lizard bravely staring down the cat as it approached. The cat, appearing uncertain of how to approach the situation, slowly prowled around the lizard, assessing its prey. As the cat came closer, the lizard quickly sprung into action, lunging towards the cat with lightning-fast reflexes. Despite its small size, the lizard put up an impressive fight. It dodged and weaved around the cat, nimbly evading its claws at every turn. The cat, outmatched and outsized, eventually gave up and retreated, defeated. Scientists say that this kind of behaviour is not uncommon among many species of lizards. They are known for their quick reflexes, impressive speed, and incredible agility, traits that had served this particular lizard well during its encounter with the cat. According to Adzrin Taib, who was thrilled to capture these amazing images, the fight lasted only a few short minutes. Yet, the photos tell the story of an epic battle that may have lasted far longer in real-time. The photographs have gone viral on social media, with many people praising the courage of the small lizard. They have also sparked a discussion about the natural instincts of animals and their ability to defend themselves in the face of danger. Adzrin Taib, who is an avid photographer, says that he was lucky to be in the right place at the right time to capture the images. He hopes that his photographs will inspire people to appreciate the beauty and diversity of nature and to respect the natural instincts of animals. The photographs of the small Oriental garden lizard's brave fight against a stray cat have captured the imagination of people all over the world. They are a reminder of the amazing and often-unseen world of nature that surrounds us and the incredible resilience of the creatures that inhabit it.
