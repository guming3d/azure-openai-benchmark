Following such a positive reaction to last year's GAYTMs, the selected ANZ machines are back brighter and better than ever complete with rainbow-coloured receipts for the customers. As if that wasn't fabulous enough - some of the GAYTMs play dance music that is motion-activated, as well as display messages including 'Hello darling!' and 'Push my buttons' with one machine on Oxford Street displaying a glittering disco ball to really get you in the mood.
