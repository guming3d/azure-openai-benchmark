chatgpt: In a fortunate twist of events, two men survived a plane crash in a remote area miles away from the nearest town. The incident happened when Larry Minton was flying his small aircraft and lost power in the engine, causing it to crash land. The aircraft flipped over during the impact, but both Larry and his passenger were unhurt.  It took search and rescue teams three days to locate the downed plane, as it was located in a remote area with difficult terrain. When the rescuers found the plane, they were relieved to see that both men had survived the crash. The two men had managed to fend for themselves for three days by surviving on just a can of salmon and some trail mix.  Larry Minton, a seasoned pilot with over 20 years of flying experience, credits his survival to his training and experience in dealing with such situations. "When the engine lost power, I knew I had to find a place to land quickly. I spotted a field and aimed for that. Although we crashed, I made sure to take all necessary precautions to ensure that me and my passenger were not hurt," said Minton from his hospital bed. The other passenger in the plane, whose name has not been disclosed, is grateful to have made it out alive. "I am just so thankful that we survived the crash. We were lost in the wilderness without any food or water, and we had to find ways to stay alive. It was a difficult experience, but we managed to pull through," said the passenger after the incident. The local authorities have commended the rescue teams for their bravery and quick response. "Locating an aircraft in such a remote area is a difficult task, but our teams went above and beyond to ensure that the two men were rescued," said a spokesperson for the local authorities. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of safety measures while flying. Larry Minton's experience and quick thinking helped him survive an otherwise fatal situation. It also highlights the importance of wilderness survival skills, as the two men managed to survive with minimal resources for three days. In conclusion, the survival of the two men in the plane crash is a testament to their resilience and the efforts of the search and rescue teams involved. It also showcases the significance of safety precautions and training while flying. The incident is a reminder to all pilots and passengers to be well-prepared for emergencies while in the air.
