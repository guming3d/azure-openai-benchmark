A 33-year-old man who held a sign up on a Texas road warning of a police speed trap has been defending his actions in court. Ron Martin was arrested in October after an officer spotted him in the median of Eldorado Parkway in Frisco, with a sign that read: 'Police ahead'. The officers were alerted to Martin's presence when drivers started to wave at them as they drove past the speed trap. In court on Wednesday, Martin said he held up the sign because he was worried for the safety of the traffic police. Martin said he had filed several complaints about what he believed were unsafe practices of the traffic officers on the busy stretch of highway. 'They hide behind signs and they use . their motorcycles sitting in the road, sun going down, without lights or . anything,' Martin, a sign painter, told Fox News. 'I just feel like it was a little bit unsafe, not only for citizens, but for police officers having to do their job.' Texas police said they had spotted Martin holding a sign on the same stretch of road on two other occasions. On the day of Martin's arrest, Officer Thomas Mrozinski wrote in his report: 'I observed a couple cars drive by traveling westbound waving at us.' The officer accused Martin of trying to interfere with speed enforcement. But in court Martin likened himself to the traffic police, saying: 'Ultimately, weâ€™re trying to do the . exact same thing. I just donâ€™t wear a uniform.' Caught: Martin was arrested for standing in the median of this six-lane Frisco road . He added: Iâ€™m the same thing as a speed limit sign, just reminding people that . there is a limit here.' Martin has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor sign for holding a homemade sign. Texas law doesn't ban people from warning drivers of speed traps, but signs can only be held or displayed on private property. '

chatgpt: Ron Martin, a concerned citizen and retired police officer, is speaking out about a recent decision made by the Texas legislature. In an effort to promote transparency and accountability, the state has allowed citizens to put up signs warning drivers about police presence. However, these signs must be on private property, and Martin worries about the safety of traffic officers who rely on the element of surprise. Martin's concerns stem from his experience as a police officer. He knows that traffic stops can be dangerous for both officers and drivers, and that the element of surprise can sometimes protect both parties. He worries that if drivers become accustomed to seeing warning signs, they may become more aggressive or unpredictable, putting both themselves and police officers in danger. "I understand the desire for transparency and accountability," Martin said in a recent interview. "But we have to balance that with the safety of our officers. If drivers know exactly where they might encounter a police officer, they may try to avoid that area, or they may be more likely to take risks." Martin is not alone in his concerns. Many police unions and associations across the country have spoken out against similar signage laws, arguing that they put officers in danger. Some states, like Florida, have even gone so far as to outlaw such signs on public property entirely. Proponents of the Texas law argue that it is an important step towards building trust between law enforcement and the community. They say that by informing citizens about police presence, they can reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings and conflicts. However, Martin worries that the potential benefits are outweighed by the potential costs. He says that ultimately, the safety of police officers has to be the top priority. "I understand the intention behind the law," he said. "But we have to be careful not to put our officers in harm's way. At the end of the day, their safety is what matters most."
