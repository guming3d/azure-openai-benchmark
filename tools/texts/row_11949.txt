article: (CNN) -- The oil and gas industry's injection of wastewater deep into the Earth is "a likely contributing factor" to the 50% increase in Oklahoma earthquakes since October, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The jump in temblors significantly increases the chance for a damaging quake -- 5.5 magnitude or greater -- in the Great Plains state, the federal agency said. "As a result of the increased number of small and moderate shocks, the likelihood of future, damaging earthquakes has increased for central and north-central Oklahoma," the USGS said Monday. The increase in earthquakes "do not seem to be due to typical, random fluctuations in natural seismicity rates," a recent USGS statistical analysis found. Rather, a finding by the USGS and the Oklahoma Geological Survey "indicates that a likely contributing factor to the increase in earthquakes is wastewater disposal by injection into deep geologic formations," the USGS said. The Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, however, urged a wait-and-see approach in judging the USGS's assertions. "Because crude oil and natural gas is produced in 70 of Oklahoma's 77 counties, any seismic activity within the state is likely to occur near oil and natural gas activity. The OIPA and the oil and gas industry as a whole support the continued study of Oklahoma's increased seismic activity, but a rush to judgment provides no clear understanding of the causes," the industry group said. Between last October and April 14, the state experienced 183 quakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater, the USGS and Oklahoma Geological Survey said. That is an increase from the state's long-term average from 1978 to 2008 of only two magnitude 3.0 or larger quakes per year. "The water injection can increase underground pressures, lubricate faults and cause earthquakes -- a process known as injection-induced seismicity," the USGS said. "Much of this wastewater is a byproduct of oil and gas production and is routinely disposed of by injection into wells specifically designed and approved for this purpose." To better gauge the increased quakes, the USGS and Oklahoma officials have added monitoring stations, which now stand at 15 permanent facilities and 17 temporary stations, the agency said.

chatgpt: Oklahoma has seen a 50% uptick in its earthquake rate since October, and the US Geological Survey (USGS) says that a likely cause for the increase is the oil and gas industry's wastewater wells. However, industry groups are urging caution in rushing to judgment. According to a report from the USGS, Oklahoma now faces a greater risk for a major earthquake with a 5.5 magnitude or greater. The report states that "the rate of earthquakes in Oklahoma has increased by about 50 percent since October 2013, significantly increasing the chance for a damaging magnitude 5.5 or greater quake in central Oklahoma." The report goes on to say that the "most likely explanation for this increase in earthquakes is the disposal of wastewater from oil and natural gas production by injecting it into deep wells." This method, known as fracking or hydraulic fracturing, has come under scrutiny from environmental groups in recent years. Industry groups, however, argue that it is too soon to blame oil and gas production for the increase in earthquakes. Chad Warmington, president of the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association, said that "while we understand there is a correlation between oil and gas production, especially disposal wells, and increased earthquake activity, we urge caution in jumping to any conclusions." The industry has already implemented measures to address concerns about earthquakes, including reducing the volume of wastewater injected into wells and moving injection sites away from seismic activity. The USGS report emphasizes the need for further research into the cause of the earthquake increase and the potential for a major earthquake. "The fact remains that Oklahoma has experienced hundreds of small and moderate earthquakes in the past several years," the report states. "And the possibility of a larger, potentially damaging earthquake in the future cannot be discounted." The report also notes that earthquake activity has decreased in other states where oil and gas production takes place, such as Texas and Colorado. This suggests that the issue in Oklahoma may be specific to the state's geology or wastewater disposal practices. As Oklahoma grapples with the increased risk of earthquakes, the debate over the role of oil and gas production in the phenomenon will continue. The USGS report highlights the need for caution and continued research in order to determine the best course of action for mitigating earthquake risk while still allowing for economic development.
