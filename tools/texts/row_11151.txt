They face death threats for breaking tradition, but two dozen women have been recruited as special forces commandos in the Afghan Army. Colonel Jalauddin Yaftaly, head of elite units in the Afghan forces, sought to hire women in 2011 because they were needed to help conduct night raids. Night missions are considered the most dangerous operations because they involve raiding the homes of suspected Taliban insurgents under the cover of darkness and searching the inhabitants. Two dozen women were hired to play an important role in night raids carried out by the Afghan special forces . Before women joined the special forces the raids were seen as controversial because it is considered offensive for male troops to search female Afghans in their homes. Now, with new female recruits on board, where possible women search women. But despite the role the female recruits play to allow more dignity for the women they search, their work has made them targets in Afghanistan - where women face a culture of discrimination. Female recruits cover their faces with scarves to protect their identities because they face death threats . Zakia Halakim, 21, worked for the Afghan police force when she was head hunted by Colonel Yaftaly to join the special forces. She said: 'We do face death threats because our work is outside of our culture but this is an important job. Brigadier General Mohammadzai Khatool is the only woman general in the Afghan Army . 'My family supports me, they never told me not to do it. They know it is important for Afghanistan,' she told NBC. The women wear sunglasses and scarves around their faces to protect their identities, and their role has been limited to night raids. Mahbouba Seraj, an . executive board member at the Afghan Women’s Network, said: 'As far as the culture in this country, . no it’s not acceptable in this country at all. It goes against . every single grain of belief of an Afghan man. 'These women are amongst the bravest in . Afghanistan. I appreciate the first steps that they are . taking so much. I wish I could be alive and be around to see them become . generals in this country.' There are more than 1,000 women in the Afghan Army and Brigadier General Mohammadzai Khatool is the only female general. She had been forced to leave the military when the Taliban took over Afghanistan, but when the Taliban fell in 2002 she returned and was promoted to general. She said: 'Men and women are like two wings . of the one bird. Working together, both are trying to defend their . country and their people.'

chatgpt: In a groundbreaking move, female commandos have been recruited to take part in night raids on suspected Taliban homes. The decision was made in an effort to expand the number of troops available for these dangerous and controversial missions, and to show the Taliban that women will not be intimidated or excluded from active combat. However, the women face significant challenges working in this male-dominated environment. For one thing, they must cover their faces at all times during raids to protect their identities. This makes communication difficult and can cause confusion and misinterpretation of orders. Even more challenging is the fact that many of these women receive death threats on a regular basis. In fact, several have been targeted by name in online forums and social media, and some have even had their homes vandalized or been physically attacked. Despite these difficulties, the women soldier on, determined to show that they are just as capable and brave as their male counterparts. They have received extensive training in martial arts, weapons handling, and tactical strategy, and are eager to put their skills to the test. One of the most important aspects of their training has been learning how to work in a team, particularly with male commandos who may not have experience working alongside women. This has required a great deal of patience and diplomacy on both sides, but the women have shown themselves to be skilled mediators and quick learners. Despite the challenges, female commandos have played a vital role in the fight against the Taliban. They have been instrumental in helping to locate and apprehend key figures within the organization, as well as in gathering intelligence that has proved crucial in planning future raids. Their presence has also helped to send a powerful message to the Taliban: that women are just as capable and determined as men when it comes to defending their country and their beliefs. This has been a crucial step in breaking down the barriers that have traditionally kept women out of active combat roles, and has paved the way for further integration in the future. While the threats against these brave women are very real, they continue to put themselves in harm's way in order to protect their country and their fellow citizens. Their example serves as an inspiration to women everywhere, and a reminder that with courage and determination, anything is possible.
