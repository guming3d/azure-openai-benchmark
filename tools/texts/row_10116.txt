chatgpt: Crufts, the world's largest dog show, held its third day of competitions in Birmingham, England yesterday. Among the many highlights of the day was the Pets As Therapy (PAT) Best Dog On Competition, which celebrated dogs that have made a difference in people's lives as therapy animals. This year's winner was Scrabble, a beautiful Leonberger who has dedicated his life to bringing joy to others.  But Scrabble wasn't the only star of the show. Also present at Crufts was Mimi, a tiny Chihuahua who may not have won any awards, but certainly won hearts with her adorable appearance. Mimi was pictured alongside Scrabble, who towered over her, in what has become one of the most iconic images of Crufts 2021.  Mimi and Scrabble are both owned by passionate animal lovers who, like many of the competitors at Crufts, are committed to promoting the well-being and welfare of dogs. Scrabble's owner, Lisa Selby, spoke movingly about the impact that her dog has had on the lives of others: "Scrabble is a gentle giant who loves nothing more than spending time with people. He brings so much happiness to everyone he meets, and it's a privilege to be able to share him with others as a therapy dog." Mimi's owner, Laura Jones, agrees with the importance of therapy dogs: "Even though Mimi is small, she has such a big personality and has helped so many people in her role as a therapy dog. Seeing her alongside Scrabble, who is obviously so much larger, shows that size really doesn't matter when it comes to making a difference in people's lives." The Pets As Therapy Best Dog On competition is one of the most eagerly anticipated events of Crufts, and this year's finalists were all extraordinary dogs that have brought joy and comfort to countless people. But Scrabble stood out for his unique combination of size, strength, and gentleness. As Selby notes, "People are always amazed when they meet Scrabble because he is just so big, but then he leans his head on them and they realize how sweet he is. He always knows when someone needs a bit of extra love, and that's what makes him so special." While Scrabble may have taken home the top prize in the PAT Best Dog On competition, every dog at Crufts is a winner in their own way. The show celebrates the incredible bond that exists between dogs and humans, and the ways in which dogs enrich our lives. As Jones says, "Mimi may not have won any awards, but she has won hearts, and that's what really matters. At the end of the day, all dogs are winners because they make our lives better just by being in them."
