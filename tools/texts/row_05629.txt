article: New Delhi (CNN)"India is about to take off." That was the bold declaration from India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as he delivered his first full-year budget since his party won a resounding victory at the polls last May. India's budget is a closely-watched TV event, with pre- and post-game analyses on every TV news channel. Even by those standards, Saturday's budget generated more interest than in previous years, in part because of soaring expectations on the new government. Jaitley signaled in his speech that "incremental change" was not enough, as he announced a raft of measures to boost infrastructure and growth. Among the key announcements, Jaitley promised that a widely anticipated national Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be implemented by April 1, 2016. As CNN has reported, India's states have a myriad of different taxes, making trading between them a nightmare. A number of other announcements called for additional government spending in energy and housing. Jaitley announced an increase of $11.3 billion in infrastructure. He also promised a universal social security plan -- a vital need for India's millions of poor who have no access to pensions or health care. Perhaps the biggest cheer from the stock markets -- a special trading session was held Saturday -- came when Jaitley announced a cut in the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%. But it wasn't all about spending. Jaitley also announced a new 2% tax of the super rich, and promised a hefty 10 year prison sentence for people caught evading taxes. Avoiding income tax is common in India, with only 3% of Indians filing returns. On Indian TV channels, scores of analysts began to weigh in on the impacts of the budget. Tarun Das, who ran India's Confederation of Indian Industry for 30 years told NDTV that he couldn't find a negative in Jaitley's presentation. "It's a creative, confident budget," he said. "There's a lot for a lot of people." On the show Headlines Today, another regular commentator, Gurcharan Das, complimented the budget but said it stopped short of detail. Speaking of Jaitley's boss, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said "Modi was elected to control inflation and create jobs. He's controlled inflation, but he needs to show us how he will create jobs." Ahead of Saturday's budget, India released its annual economic survey on Friday. The data produced by the government showed that India is projected to grow as fast as 8.5% in 2016, making it the fastest growing large economy in the world. The data was calculated according to a new methodology.

chatgpt: The Indian budget announcement 2021 was eagerly awaited by many Indians, as the Modi government received high expectations by the public. The budget is considered a crucial aspect of governance as it sets the tone for the government's economic policies and outlines its priorities. The budget announcement has always been a highly televised and watched event in India. This year, the interest and anticipation were even higher, considering the ongoing economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people hoped that the budget would provide some relief to individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic-induced economic crisis. As expected, the budget presented by the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, reflected the government's focus on reviving the economy and bolstering infrastructure development. Several measures were announced in different sectors of the economy, including healthcare, agriculture, education, and technology. One of the most significant announcements was the increase in budget allocation for healthcare, which has been underfunded for years. The government had come under severe criticism during the pandemic for the lack of investment in the healthcare sector. The budget addressed this issue by allocating more than 2.2 lakh crores to healthcare, a 137% increase from the previous year. Among other things, this allocation will help to expand the capacity of primary health care centers, set up new hospitals, and improve the production of drugs and vaccines within the country. Another important sector that received a significant budget allocation was infrastructure development. The budget proposed massive funding for roads, railways, and ports, and airports, which will create employment opportunities, stimulate economic growth and enhance connectivity for people and businesses. The budget allocated INR 1.10 lakh crores to the railway sector, which will be used to modernize rail infrastructure, build new lines, and undertake major projects like the eastern and western dedicated freight corridors. Similarly, the road sector received a budget allocation of INR 1.18 lakh crores. This allocation will help to construct over 8,500 km of highways and augment the connectivity of rural areas. The budget also announced various measures to boost the education sector, including the creation of a Higher Education Commission of India, which will replace the University Grants Commission. The government has allocated INR 50,000 crores over five years to fund this ambitious initiative to transform the country's higher education system. Technology and digitalization found a significant mention in the budget announcement. The government plans to continue its ambitious Digital India program and will allocate INR 6,000 crores to increase internet connectivity in rural areas. This will emphasize the importance of technology in everyday life, and the government will try to modernize the country's public services, including agriculture, judiciary, and tax administration. To sum up, the budget announcement was well-received, and the Modi government has delivered on many of the public's high expectations. Although the budget has prioritized infrastructure and development, the government has also acknowledged the importance of social welfare and investment in sectors like healthcare and education. It is hoped that the measures announced in the budget will help the country recover from the pandemic's economic aftermath and steer the economy towards the path of growth and development.
