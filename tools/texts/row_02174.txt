It’s one of America’s greatest landmarks - a beacon that has welcomed countless millions of immigrants into New York and now appears on postcards and images sent around the world. But what you may not know about the Statue of Liberty is that it hasn’t always been green - as it was made with an exterior of copper and originally had a far more shiny appearance. Lady Liberty is made of copper 3/32 inches thick, which is the same as putting two pennies together, but it has naturally oxidised over time to form the green ‘patina’ coating.

This coating actually protects the copper behind it from naturally wearing away. But the copper, along with the statue’s height, also makes her a welcoming target for lightning strikes. The current replacement torch was installed 25 years ago and is a copper flame covered in 24 carat gold, according to the National Parks Service website. The statue, which is located on Liberty Island in New York, will be closed for a year at the end of next month as it undergoes a $27million renovation to redevelop the interior. But the renovations are limited to the monument, Liberty Island will remain open and the statue itself will be mostly unobstructed from view, officials said.

The National Parks Service, which manages the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island, said it will close the monument on October 28, after the 125th anniversary of its dedication. Joseph A. Natoli Construction Corporation of Pine Brook, New Jersey, will install improved stairways and upgrade electrical and fire suppression systems, elevators and bathrooms.

chatgpt: The iconic Statue of Liberty in New York City is made of copper, but it might surprise you to learn that the copper used in the statue's construction is just 3/32 inches thick. Despite its slim structure, the Statue of Liberty has stood tall and proud for over a century, welcoming millions of visitors to the United States each year.  One of the most recognizable features of the statue is its green 'patina' coating, which gives the statue its distinctive appearance. The patina is actually a result of the natural oxidation process that has occurred since the statue's construction in 1886. As the copper slowly reacts with the air and moisture, a layer of copper carbonate forms across the surface of the statue, giving it the greenish hue that we see today.  But it wasn't always this way. In fact, when the Statue of Liberty was first erected, its copper exterior was shiny and bright. However, over time, the copper began to interact with the elements, and the patina began to grow. The thin layer of copper carbonate acts as a protective barrier, preventing corrosion from damaging the copper underneath.  Despite this natural process, many people still wonder why the Statue of Liberty is covered in green. The truth is that the patina is a source of pride for many Americans. It symbolizes the idea that even the greatest and most enduring works of art can weather the passage of time and emerge even more beautiful than before. In a way, the patina is a testament to the strength and resilience of the American people.  The patina also serves as a reminder of the Statue of Liberty's origins. The statue was a gift from the people of France to the United States in honor of the two countries' shared values of freedom and democracy. The statue's copper construction was chosen specifically to represent the close ties between France and the United States, as France is one of the world's largest producers of copper.  Over the years, efforts have been made to preserve the patina and protect the Statue of Liberty from further damage. In 1982, a team of conservation experts was brought in to clean the patina and repair any damage caused by corrosion. The experts used a combination of gentle cleaning agents and specialized tools to remove the dirt and debris that had built up on the statue's surface.  Today, the Statue of Liberty remains as a beacon of freedom and hope for people all over the world. Its green patina is just one of the many fascinating aspects of this remarkable work of art. As the years go by, the patina will continue to grow and change, providing a lasting reminder of the statue's endurance and resilience.
