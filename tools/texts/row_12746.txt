article: Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- A few days ago, strangers appeared at the door of a Sri Lankan investigative journalist when he wasn't home, asking questions about him. Just before midnight Friday, three men stormed Faraz Shaukatally's house as he slept, police said. One of them shot him. Shaukatally survived the attack, which left him with a bullet lodged under the neck and questions about who may have wanted him dead. Journalists face heavy intimidation in Sri Lanka, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which has called the island nation a "highly restrictive and dangerous nation for the press." Police have not apprehended suspects in Shaukatally's case or established a motive, but the editor of his paper thinks he was shot over his critical articles. "He has been writing a number of investigative stories in the past weeks," said Shakuntala Perera, who heads the Sunday Leader in the capital of Colombo. "Our journalists have been under constant threat." British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt expressed shock and concern at the shooting. Shaukatally holds dual Sri Lankan and British citizenship, CNN affiliate ITN reported, and Burt said consular officials visited him in the hospital, where he had surgery Saturday to remove the bullet. "It remains unclear whether this horrific incident was connected to the victim's work as a journalist. The Sri Lankan authorities must quickly identify who committed this crime and bring them to justice," Burt said in a statement. Though the last journalist killings in Sri Lanka were four years ago, 25 members of the press have been murdered in the country since 1999, according to the CPJ. Nine of the murders in the past decade remain unsolved. More than 63% of journalists killed in the country covered politics as a part of their work. In the past five years, 20 journalists have fled the country amid "a climate of intense intimidation," the CPJ says. Last year, citing national security, the government blocked a freedom of information bill, further denying journalists and citizens access to documents. Perera's predecessor, Frederica Jansz, went into exile after a businessman with close government ties bought the paper last year. In recent weeks, the Leader ran articles critical of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Perera admitted that she does not know whether Shaukatally was attacked specifically for any of his work. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Navi Pillay, said Sri Lankan authorities should immediately give Shaukatally protection. She called the shooting an assassination attempt. In an interview with Britain's Channel 4 News, Pillay said she will report to the Human Rights Council her concerns over "extrajudicial killings, abductions, and this kind of treatment and suppression of freedom of expression." Journalist Iqbal Athas reported from Colombo. CNN's Ben Brumfield reported from Atlanta.

chatgpt: Colombo, Sri Lanka - Faraz Shaukatally, an investigative journalist with a prominent newspaper in Colombo, was shot and injured at his residence in the early hours of Friday morning. Police have launched an investigation into the incident but have yet to establish a motive or identify any suspects in connection with the attack. Shaukatally was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove the bullet. The journalist reportedly suffered injuries to his abdomen and leg. In a statement issued shortly after the attack, the Sri Lanka Working Journalist Association (SLWJA) condemned the act and expressed concern over the safety of journalists in the country. "Faraz Shaukatally is a respected journalist who has dedicated his career to uncovering the truth and holding those in power accountable. This attack on him is not just an attack on one individual but an attack on the freedom of the press," the SLWJA said in their statement. Journalists in Sri Lanka face heavy intimidation, with some reporters subjected to threats and attacks for their reporting on sensitive issues such as corruption, human rights abuses, and government misconduct. In recent years, several journalists in the country have been killed or gone missing under suspicious circumstances, with critics accusing the government of failing to adequately investigate these cases and bring the perpetrators to justice. The attack on Shaukatally has renewed calls for greater protection for journalists in Sri Lanka and for the government to take stronger action against those who seek to intimidate or harm members of the press. "The safety of journalists is a fundamental pillar of a free and democratic society. We call on the Sri Lankan authorities to take swift and decisive action to bring those responsible for this attack to justice," the SLWJA said in their statement. The incident comes just weeks after the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) adopted a resolution calling for Sri Lanka to take immediate steps to address human rights violations and ensure accountability for past abuses. The resolution also called for greater protection for journalists and human rights defenders in the country, where freedom of expression and the press have been under increasing threat in recent years. Shaukatally, who is known for his hard-hitting investigative reporting on corruption and other sensitive issues, had previously received threats in connection with his work. The attack on the journalist has sparked outrage among his colleagues and members of the Sri Lankan media community, who are calling for an immediate and thorough investigation into the incident. As of this writing, Shaukatally remains hospitalized but is said to be in stable condition.
