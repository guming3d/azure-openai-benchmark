article: Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- The Episcopal Church consecrated its first openly lesbian bishop Saturday in the face of objections from some conservative Anglicans. The Rev. Mary Glasspool, 56, is a new bishop surrounded by controversy. Conservative factions in the Anglican Communion, a 77 million-member denomination worldwide that includes the Episcopal Church, have opposed the ordination of gay bishops. Glasspool is the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church since Gene Robinson took office in New Hampshire in 2004. Episcopalians instituted a temporary ban on gay bishops after Robinson's ordination but revoked that ban last summer. The daughter of a priest, Glasspool was one of two openly gay candidates on the slate in the Los Angeles diocese. She has said that her sexual orientation is "not an issue." Bishop Jon Bruno of Los Angeles called Glasspool, an ordained priest for 28 years, a "highly qualified and experienced" cleric. "She's not afraid of conflict and is a reconciler," Bruno said, according to the Episcopal Church website. He added that Glasspool and her partner of 19 years, Becki Sander, are an example of living service and ministry. Glasspool is the second female bishop in the 114-year history of the Los Angeles diocese, consecrated just hours after the first, the Rev. Diane Bruce, was consecrated Saturday. Glasspool's consecration drew opposition from Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who said Glasspool's ordination would deepen rifts in the Church. It "raises very serious questions not just for the Episcopal Church and its place in the Anglican Communion, but for the Communion as a whole," said Rowan, according to the church's website. The Church of Ireland also issued a strong condemnation. That church is part of the Anglican Communion in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. "We wish to express sorrow that Mary Glasspool, a person who is living in a same-sex relationship, is to be consecrated," the Church of Ireland said in a statement. "The elevation to senior church leadership of a person whose lifestyle is contrary to the will of God revealed in scripture is both wrong and disappointing." Conservatives said the Episcopal Church was taking a provocative step that amounts to a deliberate snub to those in the church who believe homosexuality is a sin.

chatgpt: On Saturday, history was made in the Episcopal Church as the Rev. Mary Glasspool was consecrated as its first openly lesbian bishop. Glasspool, who is 56 years old, will serve in the Los Angeles diocese alongside the Rev. Diane Bruce, who was also recently elected as a bishop. While Glasspool's consecration is a step forward for LGBTQ+ representation in the church, it has been met with opposition from conservatives in the Anglican Communion. The issue of LGBTQ+ ordinations, particularly of bishops, has long been a controversial one in the church. Glasspool, however, remains positive about her new role as bishop. "This is a great day for me, and a great day for our church," she said in a statement after the consecration ceremony. "I am honored and humbled to be chosen for this role, and I look forward to serving the people of the diocese with love and dedication." Glasspool's election as bishop marks an important moment for women's representation in the Episcopal Church as well. Along with Bruce, Glasspool is one of the first two women to be elected as a bishop in the Los Angeles diocese. This move towards greater diversity and inclusion in the church is a welcome one for many members who have long been advocating for change. However, the opposition to Glasspool's consecration highlights the ongoing divide within the Anglican Communion over issues of sexuality and gender. While some churches have embraced LGBTQ+ members and granted them full rights and privileges, others continue to reject them. Despite this opposition, Glasspool remains committed to her role as bishop and to her faith. "I believe that the Episcopal Church has a vital role to play in promoting justice and equality for all people," she said. "I am proud to be a part of this church, and I will work tirelessly to uphold its values and mission." Glasspool's consecration as bishop is a significant moment in the church's history, and one that many hope will serve as a catalyst for greater change and progress in the future.
