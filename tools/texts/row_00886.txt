Dozens of people have been hospitalised in Italy after eating pesto sauce contaminated with Botulinum. More than 50 people, who had eaten jarred pesto from a local producer, sought help at local hospitals after suffering symptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea and high fevers. Tests on the pesto showed the presence of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which produces the toxin Botulinum, used cosmetically by television personalities such as Simon Cowell. When ingested the toxin causes a life-threatening kind of food poisoning. A local brand of Italian green pesto, made with basil (see stock picture), has been linked with Botox contamination after more than 50 people were hospitalised . Health and food safety workers were inundated with calls through the weekend requesting information on the scare. The victims are almost all from the area around Genoa, the birthplace of the famous pasta sauce, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported. Six of those admitted, including two children, were kept in overnight for observation as further tests are carried out. The local producer responsible for the outbreak has been growing the area’s renowned basil for almost two centuries, but only recently started selling pre-prepared jars of the sauce. Bruzzone and Ferrari alerted health authorities on Friday pulling the jars from supermarket shelves. The company said: ‘We made the discovery during our own tests and analysis of our fresh product, non pasteurised product, which contains no preservatives’. Local newspaper Il Secolo XIX reported on Saturday that Stefano Bruzzone, one of the company's owners, as saying: 'In one sample we found level of substances which forced us to recall a whole batch of the product.' Tests on the pesto showed the presence of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which produces the toxin Botulinum, used cosmetically to hide wrinkles and known as Botox . He told the paper they have done everything they should do to  take care of their customers, spending 25,000 euros a year on laboratory analyses to avoid such episodes. He added that the tests were still in progression. But today's national newspaper La Stampa reports: ‘In one of the batches of Pesto di Pra produced by the old established company Ferrari e Bruzone, in an internal test, the germs responsible for the toxin Cloostridium botulium have been found.’ The botulinum toxin can occur in conserves and jarred foods and attacks the nervous system. While it usually causes similar symptoms to food poisoning including vomiting, stomach pains and fever it can in extreme cases cause psychosis and even death. The name pesto comes from 'pestello', the Italian word for the pestle which was once used to grind basil, garlic and cheese into the well-loved sauce. The earliest known record of the sauce is an 1865 cookbook ‘Genovese Recipes’ in which it is defined as ‘beaten basil and garlic which is used to season pasta’.

chatgpt: Over 50 people were hospitalised from consuming pesto contaminated with Botulinum, a type of bacteria toxin that can cause severe illness or even death if ingested. The contamination occurred in a batch of pesto from the manufacturer Bruzzone and Ferrari, leading to concerns about the safety of their products.  In response to the outbreak, the company carried out tests on their pesto, finally confirming the presence of the bacteria toxin. The company said that the contamination could have been caused by a faulty batch of ingredients, and investigations are currently ongoing to determine the exact cause of the outbreak.  Botulinum is well known for its use in Botox, a cosmetic procedure used to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. However, when ingested, it is highly toxic and can cause severe illness, including paralysis and difficulty breathing. The contamination of the pesto with Botulinum is a serious public health concern, and the manufacturer has issued a recall of the affected products. The outbreak has raised questions about food safety and the regulation of food manufacturing processes. Consumers rely on manufacturers to ensure that their products are safe for consumption, and the contamination of popular food items such as pesto is deeply concerning.  The manufacturer’s response to the outbreak has been swift, with the company immediately recalling all affected products from the market. The company has also stated that they are working closely with health officials to identify the source of the contamination and prevent further outbreaks. It is important for consumers to be aware of the potential dangers of foodborne illnesses, and to be cautious in their purchasing and consumption of food products. Symptoms of Botulinum poisoning can include nausea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing, and anyone experiencing these symptoms after consuming pesto or other products should seek medical attention immediately. In addition to the health risks, outbreaks of foodborne illness can also have severe economic consequences for both manufacturers and consumers. The recall of contaminated products can lead to lost revenue for manufacturers and increased prices for consumers. Overall, the outbreak of Botulinum contamination in pesto highlights the importance of food safety regulations and the need for manufacturers to ensure the quality and safety of their products. The investigation into the cause of the outbreak is ongoing, and consumers should remain cautious when purchasing and consuming food products to protect their health and wellbeing.
