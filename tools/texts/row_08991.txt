article: Dave King held talks with influential Rangers shareholder Sandy Easdale on Wednesday as he attempts to advance a £16million bail-out plan for the club. The South African-based businessman is heading an alliance of potential investors offering substantial financial input in return for control via a new share issue. Easdale’s position is significant as he currently holds voting rights for 26 per cent of existing shares. That provides an effective power of veto over the King group plan, as a new share issue would require the backing of 75 per cent of existing shareholders at an AGM. Dave King, pictured in Glasgow earlier this year, held talks with Sandy Easdale on Wednesday . Neither party made any comment  after they attempted to address numerous issues in their telephone discussion, but King is expected to release a statement on Thursday. The Castlemilk-born tycoon is hoping to reach an agreement-in-principle with the Ibrox board before he returns to Johannesburg, although it remains to be seen if that will be possible. King is working in conjunction with other individuals including former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham, who loaned the club £1m in emergency funding earlier this year. It’s believed another loan could form part of the new package the group has put forward, with the aim of providing a financial bridge to the AGM. Rangers need for cash is pressing, with doubts about the ability to meet the December, or possibly even November, wage bill. That means the club would likely run out of money before any income arrives from a new share issue.

The situation is further complicated by the fact club accounts should be signed off ahead of an AGM. However, auditors Deloitte need to see a clear picture of the financial future before doing so. Formal agreement over a loan plus equity deal could be the answer, but it’s thought the King group would only agree to offering a loan if assured they will gain the 75-per-cent backing required for their larger investment plan. Should that proposal flounder then a loan from Mike Ashley would seem the likely alternative source of funding for the club. Ashley recently increased his Rangers shareholding to 8.9 per cent and has requested an EGM to remove chief executive Graham Wallace and ally Philip Nash from the board. The Newcastle United owner is thought to have been in talks over a loan prior to last month’s stop-gap £3.13m share offer, but those discussions reportedly broke down when Ashley wanted club trademark rights included in the deal.

chatgpt: Dave King, the South African businessman and Rangers supporter, held talks with the club's influential shareholder, Sandy Easdale, on Wednesday. The discussions are said to have revolved around King's proposal for a £16m bailout plan for the Glasgow-based club. According to reports from Sky Sports, the meeting took place in London and was attended by both King and Easdale. The talks were said to be productive, with both parties expressing a willingness to work together to find a solution to Rangers' ongoing financial woes. King has been a vocal critic of the current Rangers board, which he believes has mismanaged the club's finances and put it in a precarious position. He has proposed a plan that would see him inject £16m into the club in exchange for a controlling stake. It is believed that Easdale, who has a significant stake in Rangers, is open to the idea of working with King to secure the future of the club. However, he has also expressed concerns about the details of the proposal and the specific terms that would be involved. Despite the discussions being held behind closed doors, there is a growing sense of optimism among Rangers fans that King's proposal could finally provide the club with the financial stability it desperately needs. King is expected to release a statement on Thursday outlining the details of his proposal and his plans moving forward. The statement is likely to be eagerly anticipated by fans and investors alike, as it could mark a turning point in the club's recent struggles. Rangers have been in financial turmoil for several years, with the club going into administration in 2012 before being liquidated and reformed as a new entity. Despite winning the Scottish Championship last season, the club remains heavily in debt and faces ongoing challenges in terms of sustainability and competitiveness on the pitch. King's proposal has been met with mixed reactions, with some fans and investors questioning his motives and his ability to deliver on his promises. However, many see him as a potential savior for a club that has been struggling in recent years. The meeting with Easdale is seen as a significant step forward for King's proposal, as he seeks to build support among key stakeholders in the club. Whether or not his proposal is ultimately successful remains to be seen, but there is a sense that Rangers are at a crucial juncture in their history and that the decisions made in the coming weeks and months could have significant implications for the club's future.
