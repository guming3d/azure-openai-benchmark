article: (CNN) -- Panicking passengers turned to prayer as a Cathay Pacific flight with one engine ablaze made an emergency landing in Singapore on Monday, witnesses said. "We heard a series of loud bangs, then smelled fire, and the aircraft started shaking uncontrollably," a CNN.com online commenter under the name of Augustus2002 said. "The noise on board was incredible, we could not hear any of the announcements of the crew," he added. CNN has not been able to confirm his account, but it matches a description from a Reuters photographer who was on the plane with his family. The photographer, Beawiharta, who uses only one name, told the news agency that his 15-year-old son spotted flames out the window of the twin-engine Airbus A330, which was on the way to Jakarta, Indonesia, but turned back after the engine problems began. "Panicked, he then asked: 'Will we die? Will we die?' " the photographer recalled. The atmosphere among the plane's 136 passengers quickly changed to a "surprising calm," Augustus2002 wrote, as people began to pray. "God, save our flight," they said, according to Beawiharta's account. "Give us your protection." Flight CX715 landed safely, the airline said in a statement "following a stall warning" on one engine. No passengers were injured. The flight landed at Singapore  Changi Airport, where it had originated. "Fire services met the aircraft on arrival," Cathay Pacific's statement said. "The aircraft stopped on the taxiway and sparks from the No. 2 engine were reported. They were doused by fire extinguishers." Cathay Pacific and Rolls Royce, the maker of the engine, have launched an investigation into the incident, which has been reported to the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department, the airline said. "We are aware of the incident and working closely with our customers to provide support and technical assitance," Rolls Royce said in a statement. It was the second time one of the Hong Kong-based airline's Airbus A330 planes has made an emergency landing. Eight passengers aboard a Cathay Pacific plane were injured last year after an Airbus A330 with engine problems made an emergency landing in Hong Kong. Several tires deflated as the aircraft landed at high speed with severe braking, the company's CEO said at that time. Less than a month later, an Airbus A330 plane operated by Afriquayah Airways crashed just before landing in Tripoli, Libya, killing all but one of the 104 passengers on board. Shortly afterward, investigators said low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the plane's pilot. CNN's Ayesha Durgahee and Andrew Henstock contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Rolls Royce has confirmed that it is providing technical assistance following an incident involving one of its engines on a Singapore Airlines flight. Witnesses on board the flight reported hearing loud bangs and seeing sparks from the No. 2 engine, prompting prayers from passengers. The flight was en route to Jakarta, Indonesia, when the engine trouble occurred. As a result, the plane was forced to return to Singapore. Upon landing, the sparks were reportedly doused and no injuries were reported. Singapore Airlines has said that all passengers and crew have been accommodated with alternative travel arrangements. The airline is also cooperating with the relevant authorities to investigate the incident. This is not the first time that Rolls Royce has faced issues with its engines. In 2018, the company issued a warning to airlines that some of its Trent 1000 engines could pose a risk of in-flight shutdowns. The warning prompted airlines to ground a number of planes. The issue was related to the inability of the engine to withstand wear and tear, leading to cracks in certain components. As a result, several airlines were forced to cancel flights and make alternative travel arrangements. Rolls Royce has since been working to fix the issue and has reportedly made progress. However, this latest incident is a reminder that there are still risks involved with the use of the Trent 1000 engine. Singapore Airlines is not the only airline to have experienced issues with Rolls Royce engines. In 2017, several airlines, including Air New Zealand, Virgin Atlantic, and British Airways, were forced to cancel flights due to issues with the same type of engine. Rolls Royce has said that it is committed to working with airlines to ensure the safe and reliable operation of its engines. The company has also said that it is investing in research and development to improve the performance and reliability of its engines. However, as this latest incident shows, there is still work to be done to ensure that the Trent 1000 engine and other Rolls Royce engines are safe and reliable for use in commercial airliners. In the meantime, passengers on Singapore Airlines Flight 836 are grateful to have landed safely after what must have been a frightening experience. The incident serves as a reminder of the risks involved in air travel and the importance of ensuring that safety remains the top priority.
