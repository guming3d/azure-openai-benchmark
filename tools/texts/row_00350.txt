article: Homeowners face curbs on CCTV cameras on their properties after a surge of complaints about spying neighbours. Gripes about security cameras attached to neighbouring buildings, including homes and shops, to deter crime have almost tripled to six a day amid fears about snooping, it has emerged. The independent surveillance camera commissioner, Tony Porter, warned he would ask the Government to legislate if concerns about the growing use of domestic CCTV systems, which cost as little as £100, did not abate. Gripes about security cameras attached to neighbouring buildings, including homes and shops, to deter crime have almost tripled to six a day amid fears about snooping . He has vowed to issue new guidance next March about the use of cameras on private homes to tackle mounting worries about use of the technology. Many complaints focus on CCTV cameras which invade neighbours’ privacy by focusing on their garden or by pointing into their windows, or fears that paedophiles could use the state-of-the-art kit to leer at children. The Office of the Surveillance Camera Commissioner has seen a rise in the number of calls from people from around two a week – or about 100 a year – to up to six a week, as many as 300 a year. Some 80 per cent are about CCTV on someone’s home. In his annual report, Mr Porter said: ‘The use of surveillance camera systems within domestic environments continues to grow. This upsurge in domestic use is directly responsible for an increase in complaints around their use. ‘The most common concerns coming in to my inbox - around 80 per cent - are over the use of CCTV at someone’s home, in a domestic setting. The concerns are primarily about the intrusion into a neighbour's privacy.’ Commercial CCTV systems have to comply with a code of practice which sets out transparency requirements and a number of measures about how recordings can be stored and used. Home Secretary Theresa May, arriving for a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street this morning, may face calls to crackdown on the use of CCTV cameras on people's homes . However, the code does not apply to householders who have installed CCTV to deter burglars and other crime. Mr Porter said drones and body-worn video, including by bouncers, door supervisors or landlords, ‘present challenges’ but did not highlight any of the complaints received about the technology.

chatgpt: The use of surveillance cameras has become increasingly common, especially in densely populated areas. However, this rise in usage has also led to a surge in complaints about privacy violations. According to the latest data, gripes about security cameras attached to neighboring buildings have tripled, with an average of six complaints per day. Residents cite the use of CCTV cameras by their neighbors as a form of snooping. They claim that the cameras breach their privacy and are being used purely for surveillance purposes. Many have expressed their concern over the abuse of this technology, as it allows for persistent monitoring of individuals and groups. Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter, has warned that unless the operators of the cameras start to adhere to new regulations, a legal crackdown may be necessary. Beyond causing privacy concerns, the cameras must meet specific standards, including adherence to data protection laws and limiting the use of the footage for observation. Porter made it clear that security cameras must respect an individual's privacy, and operators must provide transparency about their operation. Additionally, cameras must have clearly defined operating policies, including signage and public awareness of their presence. In response to the increasing complaints, some cities have started to enforce stricter laws around CCTV cameras. Birmingham was the first city to introduce legislation requiring businesses and individuals to register their CCTV cameras. The move was widely praised as a positive step towards greater transparency and accountability for businesses and homeowners. However, the solution is not a one-size-fits-all solution, as there will be several different opinions about the use of cameras. Therefore, training and education are important for both businesses and individuals to understand the different laws and regulations that surround the use of these cameras. Legal action may be necessary to enforce the new legislation, but it is hoped that education and awareness will be enough to ensure that operators of CCTV cameras feel supported and encouraged to take the appropriate actions to protect privacy. As the use of surveillance cameras continues to grow, it is important to remember the impact they have on people's lives. While security is critical, it should not be at the expense of privacy. Regulations must be in place to ensure that CCTV cameras respect individual privacy while still providing security.
