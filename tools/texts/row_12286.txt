Study: Smokers cost their employers an extra $5,816 annually compared to nonsmoking workers . Smokers cost their employers an extra $5,816 annually compared to nonsmoking workers, according to researchers. The costs primarily come from higher health care expenses, excess absenteeism and lost productivity due to smoke breaks, according to the study, which was published in the journal Tobacco Control. 'This research should help businesses . make better informed decisions about their tobacco policies,' said lead researcher Micah Berman of Ohio State University. 'We constructed our calculations such that individual employers . can plug in their own expenses to get more accurate estimates of their . own costs.' The extra expense that an employer will pay on average for a smoking employee could run as high as $10,125, the study found. One . eight-minute smoke break a day could cost employers $1,641 annually, . based on the average hourly rate plus benefits ($26.49) earned by a . smoking employee. But the . researchers say it is more likely that employers lose even more money - . up to $3,077 annually - to smoke breaks, now that most companies ban . smoking directly outside of their offices, so employees must venture . further from the office to puff a cigarette. The larger number assumes that employees are taking two 15-minute smoke breaks daily. On an annual basis per smoker: . $1,641 to $3,077: Reduced productivity due to smoke breaks . $2,056: Health care costs for self-insured employers . $517: Excess absenteeism . $462: Reduced productivity related to the effects of nicotine addiction . In addition to smoke breaks, the . researchers say companies should also account for annual costs . associated with excess absenteeism ($517 annually), reduced productivity . related to the effects of nicotine addiction ($462 annually) and extra . health care costs for self-insured employers ($2,056 annually). Berman calls the cost estimates . conservative because, saying it even takes into account the annual . pension savings from a smoker's early death, which amount to roughly . $296 per year. 'Employers try to correct for the . idea that smokers cost more by paying them somewhat less,' lead . researcher Micah Berman of Ohio State University told NBC News. 'Even when we adjusted for that, smokers still cost more,' he said. By comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated a decade ago that productivity losses and medical costs amount to about $3,400 per smoker annually.

chatgpt: According to a new study published in the journal Tobacco Control, smoke breaks are costing employers more than just the cost of cigarettes. Researchers found that smokers are costing businesses between $1,641 and $3,077 per smoker annually in lost productivity due to taking smoke breaks. While many employers have policies in place to accommodate smoke breaks, such as allowing employees to take short breaks throughout the day, the study found that the time smokers spend outside smoking adds up to a significant amount of lost productivity over the course of a year. But that's not all. The study also found that smokers incur higher health care costs, averaging roughly $2,056 annually per smoker. This is due to the fact that smokers are at a higher risk for a number of health problems, including cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease. In addition, smoking also leads to excess absenteeism, which can cost businesses approximately $517 each year. When smokers are absent from work, they not only lose out on pay, but they also reduce their productivity and negatively impact the productivity of the rest of their team. The findings of this study are eye-opening, as they demonstrate that smoking has a significant impact not only on the health of individuals, but also on the productivity and bottom line of businesses. Employers who have a large number of smokers on their staff may need to consider implementing policies that help smokers quit, as this could have a positive impact on both the health and productivity of their workforce. This study comes at a time when more and more businesses are recognizing the importance of promoting health and wellness among their employees. From offering fitness classes and healthy snacks to providing mental health resources and support, businesses are realizing that investing in the health and well-being of their employees can have a positive impact on their overall productivity and success. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the need for greater awareness and action when it comes to the negative impact of smoking on businesses. While quitting smoking can be difficult, it's clear that the costs of smoking go far beyond the price of a pack of cigarettes. By promoting smoking cessation programs and encouraging employees to quit, businesses can help save money and improve the overall health and productivity of their staff.
