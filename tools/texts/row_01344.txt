article: By . Emily Davies . Prince Charles has stopped selling eggs at his farm shop after a fox attack on his hen coop killed 24 of the birds . Prince Charles was left with egg on his face after having to shut down his Close Farm egg business because foxes attacked his chicken coop. A total of 24 hens were slaughtered by foxes, leaving His Royal Highness unable to sell eggs from the farm, near his Highgrove Estate. Some of the birds survived the attack and have since been moved to another premises to keep them safe from being preyed on by foxes. The eggs are usually sold from his farm shop in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, which he owns in addition to others in Windsor, London, Bath. But yesterday customers in Tetbury were greeted with a notice to say: ‘Dear Customers, The fox killed 24 of our chickens now the rest of the surviving chickens have been brought to a more secure location. This will mean no more eggs to sell, sorry, regards.’ Despite the Prince’s passion for organic products, he has had misfortune in recent years with the business side of things. His Duchy Originals brand reported a loss of more than £3.3 million for the 2009 financial year and was taken over by Waitrose in the autumn of that year. Meanwhile the prince’s hopes of resurrecting his Veg Shed home delivery business of his vegetables to the locals in Gloucestershire have been sunk. According to a farm worker, Charles wanted to revive the delivery business last summer, but that never happened and plans have now been permanently abandoned. Prince Charles invested around £100,000 in his organic retail business when he moved it from Highgrove to Close Farm, Tetbury. Last year, Veg Shed shut down after the vegetable business was blighted by the long, cold spring. While some hens did survive the attack, they are now being moved to a safer nesting spot (stock image) The Prince did maintain a roadside, un-staffed shop, with an honesty box for public buyers of a limited range of produce. The Duchy Originals brand after being rescued by a Waitrose takeover now encompasses 230 products, sold in 30 countries, from Japan to America. In partnership with Waitrose since 2009, it boasts annual profits of £2.8 million and has raised £11 million for charitable causes.
