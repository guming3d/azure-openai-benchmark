A groundbreaking device that can diagnose cancer in just 20 minutes is being developed by British scientists. The world's first tumour profiler, as it is known, will allow doctors, nurses and pharmacists to quickly identify all known types of cancer while the patient waits. It is hoped the device, which will also gauge the correct drug to prescribe cancer sufferers, will be used across the NHS within the next three years. A British company has developed a device that can diagnose cancer in just 20 minutes - and decide the best drug for treatment . The device has been invented as part of a partnership between private firm QuantuMDx, Newcastle University and Sheffield University. Scientists say the Q-Cancer device will have a dramatic impact on the rapid and accurate diagnosis of cancer. Company officials said the device has the potential to prolong the lives of the 12 million newly diagnosed cancer sufferers around the world. It will enable surgeons to immediately remove most, if not all of the tumour, and allow cancer specialists to prescribe the correct treatment regime according to the type of cancer developed. The device makes use of advanced . nanotechnology, analysing submicroscopic amounts of tissue to work out . the type of cancer, its genetic make-up and how far it has developed. Professor John Burn (left), a renowned geneticist, and Jonathan O'Halloran, both of QuantuMDx, the company developing the device . Professor Sir John Burn, the Newcastle University academic who is also medical director of QuantuMDx, said: 'We have a world leading position to deliver complex DNA tumour testing to the routine pathology lab or even to the operating theatre. 'A low-cost device requiring no technical expertise will extract, amplify and analyse tumour DNA to make sure the patient gets the right treatment first time and without delay.' Chief executive Elaine Warburton said: 'Currently tumour samples are sent away to a centralised sequencing laboratory, which can take several weeks to turnaround results, usually at a very high price which is not routinely affordable to many economies. 'As far as we are aware, QuantuMDx’s current underlying technologies, which can break up a sample and extract the DNA in under five minutes represents a world first for complex molecular diagnostics. Cancer experts now believe that 42 per cent of Britons will get the disease in their lifetime. Of the 585,000 people who died in the UK in 2008, 246,000 had been diagnosed with cancer at some point. Dr Emma Smith, Cancer Research UK’s senior science information officer, said: 'Using lhe latest technology to analyse tumours quickly and cheaply could make a real difference to cancer patients and we will watch these developments with interest. It will need thorough testing to show it meets the standards required for routine use in the NHS.'

chatgpt: In a world-first breakthrough, a tumour profiler has been developed that will identify all known types of cancer while the patient waits. The groundbreaking development will also be able to determine the correct drug to prescribe, offering a fast and effective solution for treating cancer patients. The new technology is expected to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry, paving the way for more effective treatments and ultimately, saving lives. The device is based on advanced molecular technology that can quickly and accurately identify cancerous cells, allowing doctors to provide a targeted and personalized treatment plan for each patient. The initiative is being led by UK-based healthcare technology company, Intelligent Fingerprinting, and has been hailed as a major breakthrough by medical professionals. The machine has received extensive funding and support from the UK government's chief scientific advisor and the National Health Service (NHS). The tumour profiler has been designed to be used across the NHS within the next three years, offering patients access to fast, reliable and personalized cancer care. The device aims to reduce waiting times for diagnosis and treatment, speed up the development of new cancer drugs and significantly decrease mortality rates. According to recent statistics, around 8 million people worldwide die from cancer every year, making it the second leading cause of death globally. The development of this innovative and groundbreaking technology is expected to be a game-changer in the fight against cancer, offering a real-time solution to a problem that has plagued the healthcare industry for decades. The tumour profiler is the product of years of research and development, drawing on the expertise and knowledge of scientists, oncologists and other medical professionals. The device uses a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including advanced mass spectrometry and artificial intelligence, to provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Once a patient's tumour has been identified, the profiler will generate a full molecular profile of the cancer, including the specific genetic mutations that are causing it. This information can be used to select the best possible treatment options and avoid the use of ineffective drugs. The profiler has been rigorously tested and has proven to be highly effective in identifying a wide range of cancer types. The tumour profiler is also designed to be used in conjunction with existing cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. By providing detailed information on the molecular structure of the tumour, the device can help doctors to tailor treatments to the individual patient, maximising the potential for success and reducing the risk of side effects. Overall, the development of the world's first tumour profiler is a major milestone in the healthcare industry, offering a fast, effective and reliable solution for treating cancer patients. With the NHS set to roll out the technology across the UK within the next three years, patients can look forward to a brighter future, with more personalized, targeted cancer care than ever before.
