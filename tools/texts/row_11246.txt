article: One of Air New Zealand’s two Dreamliners is back in the skies again just days after it was hit by lightning during a fierce spring storm last week. The lightning strike occurred as the Boeing 787-9 landed safely in Perth following a seven-hour journey from Auckland last Thursday afternoon. Aircraft engineers discovered scorch marks on the fuselage, so the aircraft was taken out of service and flown back to Auckland without any passengers for further inspection and repairs.

An airline spokeswoman told the New Zealand Herald: ‘The incident forced the cancellation of a flight from Perth to Auckland which was due to operate on Thursday evening. ‘The aircraft, a Boeing 787-9, was assessed by engineers in Perth and cleared to operate positioning flight NZ6014 back to Air New Zealand's engineering and maintenance base in Auckland where full engineering support is available.’ In an attempt to ease any fears for nervous flyers, the spokeswoman said such incidents not uncommon and aircraft are designed to withstand lightning strikes. The lightning strike occurred as the plane landed in Perth following a seven-hour journey from Auckland . Air New Zealand didn’t provide statistics on the frequency of lightning strikes involving its planes, but at least 75 incidents have been reported in Australia in 2014, according to the country’s transport safety bureau. Dreamliners have a composite fuselage rather than metal, and its embedded conducting material is designed to absorb a lightning strike. The worst air tragedy related to a lightning strike occurred in the US state of Maryland in December 1963. Eighty-one people died after a bolt of lightning ignited fuel vapours and caused an explosion that brought down a Boeing 707-121 operated by Pan Am.

chatgpt: A plane has been taken out of service for repairs after it landed safely in Perth, Australia. The aircraft had been struck by lightning and required further inspection. The plane was flown back to Auckland without any passengers on board. This incident is one of many that have occurred involving lightning strikes on planes in Australia this year. According to recent reports, at least 75 planes have been struck by lightning in Australia. While many of these incidents did not result in any major damage or injuries, they have raised concerns about the safety of air travel during stormy weather conditions. Airline officials have stressed that lightning strikes are a common occurrence and that planes are built to withstand them. However, they do acknowledge that any incident involving a lightning strike requires careful inspection and maintenance to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew on board. The aviation industry has made significant improvements over the years in terms of safety measures and protocols. For instance, most airlines now have advanced weather monitoring systems in place that allow them to avoid severe weather conditions that could potentially lead to accidents. In addition, modern planes are equipped with state-of-the-art lightning protection systems that help to dissipate the electrical charge from lightning strikes. This technology helps to reduce the risk of damage to critical systems on board the aircraft. Despite these safety measures, incidents such as the recent lightning strike on the plane in Perth serve as a reminder of the importance of regular maintenance and inspection of aircraft. Proper upkeep is essential in ensuring that planes are safe and reliable for air travel. In conclusion, the recent incident involving a lightning strike on a plane in Perth highlights the ongoing safety concerns surrounding air travel in stormy weather conditions. While the aviation industry has made notable advances in safety measures, it is essential that planes be properly maintained and inspected to ensure the safety of passengers and crew.
