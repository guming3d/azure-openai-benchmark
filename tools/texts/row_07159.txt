The 46-year-old will take over the managerial duties at Aston Villa with immediate effect, and will be in attendance as an observer in the stands for the game against Leicester.  Following the dismissal of Steve Bruce earlier in the season, former Aston Villa CEO Tom Fox was on the lookout for a new manager to take the reins at the club. Sherwood was the only candidate that Fox spoke to about the role, and he was duly appointed in a deal that will keep him at the club for the next two and a half years. Tim Sherwood has some experience with Aston Villa, having managed the club in the previous season for six months. Unfortunately, he was sacked in October 2015 after a run of poor results. Sherwood parted ways with the club after losing six consecutive games in the Premier League.  The former Spurs boss has been away from football since he was fired by Aston Villa, but he was looking to make a comeback, and this opportunity has come at the right time. Sherwood has spoken about his delight at being back at the club and is eager to get started with his first official game in charge against Stoke City on February 21.  Aston Villa are currently struggling in the Championship, sitting in 17th place, and they need a strong leader to turn things around.

In conclusion, Tim Sherwood's return to Aston Villa is a welcome development for both the club and its fans. The former Tottenham and Villa manager has promised to deliver results, and his appointment will provide a much-needed boost to a team that has struggled so far this season.
