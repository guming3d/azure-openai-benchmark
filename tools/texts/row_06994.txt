Vince Cable has been moved from a key role at a Liberal Democrat rally in favour of the Minister caught up in the party’s ‘sex harassment’ row. Lib Dem rising star Jo Swinson, the Women’s Minister, has been picked ahead of Business Secretary Mr Cable to address party activists at their spring conference next weekend. The decision came after party managers demanded a female speaker because next Friday is International Women’s Day. Vince Cable's spokesman said he was 'perfectly relaxed' about the speaking arrangements, where rising star Jo Swinson will address party activists at next weekend's spring conference . But the move has surprised some Lib Dems who see Mr Cable as one of the party’s biggest hitters and the main potential successor to party leader Nick Clegg. Ms Swinson, a close ally of Mr Clegg, is also now facing demands to come clean on what she did know about the sex harassment claims – strenuously denied – against ex-Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard. Ms Swinson is facing demands to come clean on what she did about sex harassment claims - strenuously denied - against Lord Rennard . She has been accused of failing to act on previous information about Lord Rennard’s alleged behaviour towards female party members when she was equalities spokesman – a claim she denies. Last night, some party members feared that the change of speaker, agreed before the sex harassment claims became public, could backfire. One said: ‘If this was a calculated attempt to clip Vince’s wings, it is not looking very clever now the Rennard row has broken. ‘It’s embarrassing enough that our spring conference coincides with International Women’s Day without the fact we’re “headlining” one of the main party figures caught up in the row.’ Mr Cable’s spokesman said he was ‘perfectly relaxed’ about the speaking arrangements. The weekend rally in Brighton is set to be a lengthy celebration of the party’s Eastleigh triumph.

chatgpt: The Liberal Democrat spring conference next weekend is already making headlines for all the wrong reasons. The latest controversy concerns the party's Women's Minister, Jo Swinson, who is due to address attendees at the event in York. Swinson's appearance has been criticised by some party insiders who fear it could undermine the party's response to allegations of sexual harassment. The concerns stem from the ongoing controversy over Lord Rennard, a former party chief who has been accused of sexually harassing female party members. Rennard denies the allegations, but the claims have created a wave of anger within the party. Swinson's address at the conference is seen by some as a risky move, given her high-profile role as Women's Minister. Critics argue that it sends the wrong message to those affected by the Rennard scandal, and could be seen as condoning the alleged behaviour. However, Swinson herself has defended her decision to speak at the conference. In a statement, she said that she saw it as an opportunity to engage with party members and discuss the issue of gender equality. "I believe that it's important to show that the Liberal Democrats are committed to taking action on issues affecting women, and to supporting those who have been affected by harassment or discrimination," she said. Despite her protestations, the controversy is likely to overshadow Swinson's appearance at the conference. The party has come under intense criticism over its handling of the Rennard allegations, with many accusing senior figures of failing to take the claims seriously. The scandal has also led to wider questions about the party's commitment to supporting women, with critics suggesting that the Liberal Democrats have a long way to go before they can claim to be the party of gender equality. With tensions running high, Swinson's address at the conference is unlikely to be a smooth affair. However, the Women's Minister has made it clear that she is committed to tackling these issues head-on, and is prepared to face down her critics in order to do so. It remains to be seen whether her appearance will help to heal the rifts within the party, or whether it will simply add fuel to the fire of an already heated debate. One thing is for certain: the Liberal Democrat conference is shaping up to be a contentious and divisive affair.
