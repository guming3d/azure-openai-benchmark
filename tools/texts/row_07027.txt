article: Looking like a creature straight out of the Game of Thrones TV series, Fanny is a 30-foot high, fire-breathing mechanical dragon that can flap its 40-foot wings and walk on all fours. Designed by German electronic firm, Zollner Elektronik AG, the creature is powered by four remote controls, a two-litre turbo diesel engine and a series of hydraulic valves. The beast was created as part of the Tradinno project - a portmanteau of 'tradition' and 'innovation' - set up to build the dragon that features in German folk play Drachenstich. Scroll down for video . The 11-tonne mechanical creature called Fanny, pictured, was created by German firm Zollner Elektronik AG. Also known as Tradinno, the robot is 51ft long, 40ft wide, can walk on its four legs and is powered by a remote control. It was built as a character in the German folk play Drachenstich . Fanny was awarded the largest walking robot accolade in the 2014 edition of the Guinness World Records book. The dragon is made up of two hydraulic circuits consisting of 272 valves, 50 drives and uses 165 litres of oil. It also has 4,265 feet of electric cables and travels at around one mile per hour using its 140hp engine . Length: 50ft                Width: 12ft . Wingspan: 39ft           Height: 14ft . Weight: 11 tonnes      Max.speed: 1.8 km/h . Drives: 50                  Oil: 165litres . Valves: 272                Electric cables: 4,265ft . Blood: 80litres            Liquid gas: 11kg . Pneumatic lines: 360ft . Fanny was awarded the largest walking robot accolade in the 2014 edition of the Guinness World Records book. The Drachenstich play, which means Spearing the Dragon or more literally, dragon stab, has been performed in the town of Furth im Wald for the past 500 years. Its story is a take on the legend of Saint George and was adapted during the early 1950s to symbolise the threat of communism from the East. The current plot centres around the Hussite wars from the 15th Century. The dragon is made up of two hydraulic circuits consisting of 272 valves, 50 drives and uses 165 litres of oil. It also has 4,265ft of electric cables and 360ft or pneumatic lines. Fanny can travel at around one mile per hour using its 140hp engine. The beast also carries 80 litres of stage blood, which squirts out of its back when it is lanced with a spear during the play. Fanny, pictured, stars in the Drachenstich play which has been performed in the town of Furth im Wald for the past 500 years. Its story is a take on the legend of Saint George . Each of Fanny's legs has seven degrees of motion, which means it can move laterally and walk around corners. A spokesman from Zollner Elektronik AG said: 'Realising a radio remote-controlled, outdoor-capable four-legged robot walking robot in unheard-of dimensions, was what really motivated the developers and designers. 'The other fascinating aspect for the team was the fact that the mechatronic system was to star in the oldest German folk play.' It was completed on 27 September 2012.

chatgpt: The world's largest robot, Fanny, also known as Tradinno, has been making headlines for its impressive size and design. Measuring 51ft long with a wingspan of 40ft, this mammoth machine is a true engineering marvel. Developed by Zollner Elektronik AG, Fanny is as heavy as 11 tonnes with its inner mechanisms, fuel tank and outer shell combined. The Tradinno project was initially created to take part in a German folk play, and Fanny's grand debut was at the opening ceremony for the 2010 Football World Cup. Since then, it has become a symbol of innovation and technology, and it continues to attract attention from people all around the world. The robot's complex design and engineering features have fascinated experts, and it has been hailed as a landmark achievement in the field of robotics. Fanny operates through a series of hydraulic and mechanical systems that are controlled by a team of skilled technicians. With its impressive frame and remarkable capabilities, Fanny is capable of executing lifelike movements that make it appear almost alive. The creation of Fanny was no small feat. It took the team at Zollner Elektronik AG around six years to develop and construct the impressive machine, which required extensive research, development and testing. Engineers had to complete a series of rigorous checks and tests before Fanny could be deemed functional and ready for action. The robot has been used in various events across the world, including stage productions and corporate events. It has even been used in film production, providing a powerful and realistic backdrop for well-known Hollywood movies. Fanny's potential goes beyond entertainment, as it can also be used in various industries including construction, transport, and more. Its mechanical capabilities and impressive design make it an ideal candidate for difficult and challenging tasks that would otherwise be impossible for humans to perform. Incorporating robotics in various industries has been a topic of discussion for years. And with the successful creation of Fanny, it is clear that the potential of robotics is limitless. It has opened the doors to endless possibilities, making it easier to complete tasks quickly, efficiently and with minimal human intervention. As the world continues to rely on technology and automation, more companies are embracing the idea of using robotics in their operations. Fanny's success has proven that with the right technology and engineering, anything is possible. In conclusion, Fanny, the world's largest robot, has become an iconic symbol of technology and innovation. Its impressive design and engineering have captured the imagination of people across the globe, and it has left experts in disbelief. As technology advances, it is only a matter of time before robots like Fanny become the norm rather than the exception.
