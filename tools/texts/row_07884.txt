chatgpt: A cyclist has miraculously survived after being knocked off his bike and dragged under the wheels of a lorry in a shocking incident in North London. The incident happened when the lorry driver failed to spot the cyclist as he made a turn, according to eyewitnesses. CCTV footage of the incident, which happened near a busy junction, shows the cyclist being hit by the lorry's cab before being dragged underneath the vehicle. The rider can then be seen rolling under the wheels of the lorry, but miraculously avoids being run over by any of them. Despite escaping with only cuts and bruises, it was reported that the cyclist was in a state of shock after the incident. He was treated by paramedics at the scene, but did not require hospitalisation. The lorry driver appears not to have stopped at the scene of the collision, raising serious concerns about his conduct. Police are now investigating the incident and calling on witnesses to come forward with any information they may have. Commenting on the incident, the London Cycling Campaign said: "This is a harrowing incident and we're relieved to hear that the cyclist survived with only scrapes and bruises. However, this serves as a stark reminder of the need for lorry drivers to be vigilant and to take extra care when sharing the road with vulnerable road users such as cyclists." The incident has also reignited debate about the safety of cyclists on the capital's roads, with many calling for more action to be taken to protect them from accidents involving motor vehicles. This is not the first incident in which a cyclist has been involved in an accident with a lorry in London. Last year, six cyclists died after being hit by lorries in the capital, prompting campaigners to press for more action to protect cyclists on the roads. The incident also reinforces the importance of CCTV cameras in identifying and prosecuting dangerous drivers who endanger the lives of vulnerable road users. Although it is unclear whether the lorry driver will be identified, the CCTV footage may prove crucial in bringing the perpetrator to justice.
