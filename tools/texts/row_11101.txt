chatgpt: A man is in police custody after an altercation in a Florida Applebee's restaurant left an elderly man battered and shaken. Mikie Dominic Sawyer, a 26-year-old man, was heard using expletives in the bar area of the Port Orange establishment. This prompted 80-year-old Harry Sander to approach him and ask him to refrain from using such language in public. According to eyewitnesses, Sawyer was disrespectful and uncooperative when Sanders asked him to stop using the 'F' word in public. The young man told Sanders that he was free to use any language he wished, and he had no intention of stopping. The argument escalated, and Sawyer ended up punching Sanders in the face. Police arrived on the scene and quickly arrested Sawyer, who now faces charges for battery. Sanders was left shaken with a black eye and a bruised ego. He was taken to the hospital for treatment, where he is now recuperating. The incident has caused outrage among the local community, with many expressing their disgust that a young man would have so little respect for an elderly person. The incident has sparked a national discussion on the topic of respect for the elderly in society, with many people calling for a change in attitudes towards the older generation.
