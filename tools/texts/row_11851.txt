article: By . Tara Brady . Husband and wife Albert and Carolee Hickman . A husband and wife used black magic to terrify an 11-year-old schoolgirl into taking part in depraved sex sessions, a jury has heard. Their alleged victim blotted out her three-year ordeal for almost four decades before a torrent of suppressed memories resurfaced, a court was told. Carolee Hickman, 64, is accused of preying on the Bridgend schoolgirl, convincing her she was a witch in a powerful coven linked to devil worship. Her terrified victim allegedly returned to Hickman’s home again and again, where she was regularly sexually abused. Hickman gave the girl and a number of her friends 'pagan crosses' to wear and plied them with cigarettes and alcohol, it is claimed. Husband Albert Hickman, 65, allegedly raped the schoolgirl during an encounter set up by his wife. Hickman was with the RAF based at St Athan during the period in question. A jury at Cardiff Crown Court watched a DVD recording of an interview the couple’s alleged victim made for the police. A bearded Hickman listened in silence. His wife sat in court in a mobility scooter. He denies a single charge of rape. His wife denies three counts of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape. All charges relate to a period between September 1972 and September 1975. The jury has been told the couple have already been jailed in the past after being found guilty of indecently assaulting children. Their alleged victim, now aged 52, said in interview that she began visiting the couple with other friends aged 11. Charged: A bearded Hickman listened in silence in court while his wife sat in a mobility scooter . She said Hickman later claimed she was a witch, talked about the occult, used black magic and did readings with tarot cards. She said the older woman used a bejewelled knife wrapped in black silk, and kept in a wooden box, to cut the girl’s thumb and suck the blood. 'She got us believing in Satan and that she was this powerful person,' said the alleged victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. 'She used to tell me that I was hers, I was special. 'She told me that in the night she was going to come and get me and take me to her coven and they would fetch the devil and I would be part of the circle. 'Being so young I was gullible and believed her.' The court heard repressed memories of her schoolgirl abuse allegedly resurfaced during bereavement counselling after the death of a son.

chatgpt: A woman from Bridgend has accused a couple of subjecting her to extreme and horrific abuse for almost four years. According to court documents, Carolee Hickman, 64, allegedly convinced the victim that she was a witch who possessed immense powers and belonged to a powerful coven. Hickman allegedly preyed upon the victim for three years, during which she and a group of her friends were given pagan crosses to wear as a mark of their status within the coven. The victim claims that Hickman and her husband, Albert Hickman, 65, were part of a larger group of adults who took advantage of them and used them for their own sinister purposes. Mr. Hickman is a former RAF serviceman, who was based at St Athan during the period in question. He allegedly raped the victim on numerous occasions during the four-year period. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has finally found the courage to come forward and testify against the Hickmans after a long and painful struggle with substance abuse and psychological trauma. According to her statement, she had repressed the memories of her ordeal for almost four decades. The Hickmans, who have been charged with multiple counts of sexual offences, are now standing trial for their alleged crimes. The trial, which began earlier this week, has attracted a lot of media attention due to the disturbing nature of the allegations. Prosecutors allege that the Hickmans used their dominant position within the group to abuse and control their victims. The victims, who were mostly teenagers at the time, were brainwashed into believing that they were part of a special and privileged group that had access to special powers and privileges. According to the prosecutors, the Hickmans' behaviour was nothing short of sadistic and cruel. They are alleged to have gone to great lengths to ensure that their victims were completely under their control, including isolating them from their families and friends. In light of these allegations, the Hickmans' legal team has denied all culpability and has claimed that the alleged victim and her friends were willing and enthusiastic participants in the group activities. They have also claimed that the allegations against Mr. Hickman are baseless and unfounded. The trial is expected to continue for several more weeks as the prosecution presents its case against the Hickmans. It is a grim reminder of the pervasive and insidious nature of sexual abuse and the devastating impact that it can have on victims and their families. The case has sparked a renewed debate on how society can better protect vulnerable individuals from predatory behaviour and ensure that victims of sexual abuse receive the support and justice that they deserve.
