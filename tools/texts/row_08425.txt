In addition to drug smuggling, two of the accused allegedly offered to use their badge and gun to protect drug dealers operating outside the prison. This news has shocked many who have long suspected the prison system of being riddled with corruption and criminal activity. The arrests and subsequent charges are the latest in a series of scandals that have plagued Rikers Island.
