School scandal: Students at the Gustine elementary school in Texas (pictured) complained that staff members ordered them to pull down their pants to check for signs of poop after some was found in the gym . Gustine Independent School District Superintendent Ken Baugh, who is investigating the claims, said the children were asked to pull down their trousers just a little. But Medina's 11-year-old daughter Eliza said she was told to pull them down 'to where your butt is'. 'I felt uncomfortable, and I didn't want to do it,' she said. 'I felt like they violated my privacy.' Her mother said she was furious when she learned what had happened. 'If you can't do your job or you don't know what you're doing, you need to be fired,' she told WFAA. 'You shouldn't be here.' Baugh said that the district does not support the decision and is looking into possible disciplinary action against the staff members involved. He said that he hopes to interview all the staff members and have a final answer by Wednesday. Parents have said they plan to protest against the action at a school board meeting on Thursday.
