article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . They have never been the most tantalising of snacks – due in part, no doubt, to their use as a natural constipation remedy.

Endorsements by celebrity chefs such as Heston Blumenthal have also helped boost demand for the dried plums, which have recognised medical benefits due to high antioxidant levels.

Imports from California, the world’s largest producer of prunes, rose to 664 tonnes during January and February, 14 per cent up on  the same period in 2012. Trade magazine The Grocer  said: ‘Brits are developing a serious taste for prunes. ‘Sales are soaring and retailers and manufacturers are putting the once-unfashionable dried plums into a growing range of products.’ Waitrose used Californian prunes in its Heston Blumenthal Christmas Cake. The chef often praises the snack . Much of the increase was  down to Brits snacking more on prunes, but sales have also been boosted by retailers using them  as an ingredient in an increasingly wide range of products, according to a spokesman for the California Prune Board. She cited the example of M&S launching a prune-based brioche and a cheese containing the fruit  in 2012, and Waitrose using California prunes in its Heston Blumenthal Christmas Cake – one of its  top festive sellers. The spokesman added: ‘Prunes are a versatile product, illustrated by their increasing use in food manufacturing over the last year.’ She said retailers such as Aldi and health food chain Holland & Barrett reported that they had seen ‘significant increases’ in prune sales in the past year.

However, recent studies have revealed the impressive health benefits of this humble dried fruit, leading to a spike in demand. The trend has been especially noteworthy among health-conscious consumers, who have been seeking out prunes for their high fiber content, which can help lower cholesterol levels and improve digestion. Additionally, prunes are rich in antioxidants, which can reduce inflammation and lower the risk of heart disease and other chronic illnesses. Leading nutritionists have been advocating for the inclusion of prunes in diets for years, but it was celebrity chefs like Heston Blumenthal who helped to put the fruit back on the map by featuring them in their recipes. He praises the sweet, deep flavor of prunes, which can add depth and complexity to savory dishes as well as desserts. The rise of prunes as a health food has also led to an increase in product development, with more and more food and beverage companies incorporating them into their offerings. From prune juice to protein bars and baked goods, the fruit is proving to be a versatile ingredient that appeals to a wide range of consumers. One of the reasons for the growing popularity of prunes is their versatility in cooking. They can be used in both sweet and savory dishes, making them a great addition to any meal. In addition to being used in traditional prune-based recipes such as stews and cakes, they are now finding their way into more unusual dishes like prune and lamb tagine or prune and feta salad. There is also a growing trend in using prunes in place of sugar or other sweeteners in recipes. This is particularly appealing to those looking to reduce their sugar intake, as prunes provide a natural sweetness without the added calories. The popularity of prunes as a health food is set to continue as more people become aware of their benefits. It seems that this formerly maligned snack has finally found its place in modern diets, thanks to a combination of celebrity endorsement, nutritional research, and innovative product development.
