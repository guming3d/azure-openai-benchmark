article: Cycling could help ease the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, scientists believe. The exercise improved connections between brain regions linked to the disease and boosted patients’ co-ordination and balance, research has shown. Exercising on a bike is ‘an effective, low-cost therapy for the disease’, one researcher said. Some 120,000 Britons have Parkinson’s. Symptoms include tremors, speech problems and a gradual slowing down of the body. As the disease progresses, speech and balance can be affected and some sufferers become wheelchair-bound.

High-profile patients include Michael J Fox, who was just 30 when he was diagnosed with the condition, and Muhammad Ali. US neuroscientist Jay Alberts began the research after noticing improvements in his companion, a Parkinson’s patient, after a long-distance tandem ride across Iowa. Dr Alberts, of the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Ohio, said: ‘The finding was serendipitous. I was pedalling faster, which forced her to pedal faster. 'She had improvements in her upper extremity function, so we started to look at the possible mechanism behind this improved function.’ In the study, he carried out a series of scans on the brains of 26 Parkinson’s patients who used exercise bikes three times a week for two months. Some pedalled at their own pace, while others undertook ‘forced-rate’ cycling, in which they were made to pedal faster by motors fitted to their bikes. The scans revealed pedalling, particularly vigorous pedalling, boosted connections between brain regions linked to movement, the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago heard. Research: The study was carried out at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College Research Institute . Researcher Chintan Shah, also from the Cleveland Clinic, said: ‘The results show that forced-rate bicycle exercise is an effective, low-cost therapy for Parkinson’s disease.’ The scientists are now studying how patients fare with exercise bikes in their homes. They also want to see whether other forms of exercise such as swimming and rowing have similar benefits. The charity Parkinson’s UK welcomed the research, saying the balance and co-ordination can be badly damaged as the disease progresses. However, it also cautioned that not all patients will be capable of exercising intensely. Dr Kieran Breen, the charity’s director of research, said: ‘While it is too soon to encourage people with Parkinson’s to get on their bikes three times a week on the basis of this study, we do know that exercise can be beneficial. ‘A regular exercise routine can help those with the condition to not only improve their general fitness but can also help to improve movement and balance as well as other symptoms of the condition such as anxiety and depression.’

chatgpt: A new study reveals that exercising on a bike may be an effective and low-cost therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease. The research was led by Jay Alberts, a neuroscientist based in the United States, who was inspired by the positive impact he observed on his partner, who suffers from the disease. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and can cause problems with balance, coordination, and muscle control. According to the Parkinson's Foundation, nearly 1 million people in the United States are living with the disease, and there is currently no cure. Alberts' research focused on the impact of pedaling on the brain function of individuals with Parkinson's disease. The study involved 26 patients who participated in a 45-minute cycling session three times a week for eight weeks. The participants were able to complete the exercise sessions without any reported negative effects. The study found that pedaling on a bicycle led to increased connectivity between regions in the brain that are responsible for movement. This increase in connectivity is significant because individuals with Parkinson's disease often experience a breakdown in communication between these regions, leading to problems with movement. "It's like turning on Christmas lights," Alberts explained. "We saw an increase in connectivity that was not there before. It was like the brain woke up." The improvements in brain connectivity were also associated with improvements in motor function. The study found that participants had reduced symptoms of tremors, stiffness, and slowness after eight weeks of cycling therapy. These findings suggest that exercising on a bike may be a simple and effective way to improve the motor function of individuals with Parkinson's disease. The therapy is also relatively low-cost, making it accessible to a wide range of patients. "We're not talking about fancy equipment or fancy gyms," Alberts said. "Our intervention was on a stationary bike, and it was effective." While the study was relatively small, the findings are promising and highlight the potential benefits of non-pharmaceutical therapies for Parkinson's disease. "It's not a cure, but it's a simple, effective therapy that can improve the quality of life for people with Parkinson's disease," Alberts said. The research also highlights the importance of exercise for brain health. Studies have shown that physical activity can improve brain function, reduce the risk of dementia, and improve mental health. "We know that the brain responds to exercise in so many ways," Alberts said. "It's a powerful tool for brain health." Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of cycling therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease. The findings may offer hope to the nearly 1 million people living with the disease in the United States and could inspire further research into non-pharmaceutical therapies for neurological disorders.
