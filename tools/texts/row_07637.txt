chatgpt: Former Premier League striker Charlie Austin looks set to be released by Queens Park Rangers (QPR) as the newly promoted club prepares for its return to the English top-flight. Sources say that the decision was made following a transfer planning meeting on Friday, with the club keen to assess their options ahead of the new season.  Despite QPR's decision to let Austin go, the 31-year-old remains confident in his ability to perform at the highest level. The striker was instrumental in the club's promotion last season, scoring a last-minute winner at Wembley to secure an immediate return to the Premier League.  Austin began his career at non-league side Poole Town before moving up the ranks to join Swindon Town in 2009. He subsequently moved to Burnley, where he became a prolific scorer, before joining QPR in 2013. He then moved to Southampton in January 2016 before returning to QPR on loan in 2019.  Austin's release from QPR will be a blow to the striker, who had hoped to continue playing in the top-flight. However, he remains confident that he can still contribute to a Premier League side.  "I'm disappointed not to be staying at QPR, but I'm confident that I can still do a job at the highest level," Austin said in a statement. "I'll be keeping my options open and assessing all offers that come my way." Austin's status as a free agent will no doubt attract interest from a number of Premier League clubs, who could benefit from his proven scoring ability. However, there is also a possibility that the striker could move abroad, as has been the case with other English players in recent years.  For now, Austin's next move remains uncertain, but the striker will no doubt be eager to secure his future as soon as possible. With the new Premier League season just around the corner, clubs will be keen to bolster their squads, and few players will be more sought-after than Charlie Austin.  QPR is yet to confirm the news of Austin's release, but sources close to the club suggest that an official announcement could be made in the coming days.
