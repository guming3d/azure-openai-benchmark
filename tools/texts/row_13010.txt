A not guilty verdict on Morrison's harassment charge was formally recorded on Monday in a case management hearing at Manchester Crown Court, which the footballer attended. Morrison will stand trial at the same court on January 26 on three remaining charges of assaulting Miss Mansoor, 19, and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, in the early hours of July 24. The ex-Manchester United player denied the harassment charge at a preliminary hearing held in August. He also pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault by beating and one of assault causing actual bodily harm. The 21-year-old midfielder (centre) is currently on a three-month loan deal at Cardiff City from West Ham . Morrison, originally from Manchester, was bailed on condition he lives at an address in Cardiff, does not contact directly or indirectly the two women complainants, and does not enter the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance or when he plays in his professional capacity. Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce later shipped him out on loan to Birmingham and QPR. Morrison, who has four England Under 21 caps, is currently playing for Championship club Cardiff City on a three-month loan deal. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: Footballer Ravel Morrison has been cleared of allegations of harassment made by his ex-girlfriend, Reah Mansoor. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) withdrew the charge of harassment ahead of his trial on Monday. The ex-West Ham United midfielder still faces charges of assault against Mansoor and her family. Morrison, who is currently on a three-month loan to Cardiff City from West Ham, faced allegations of harassing his ex-girlfriend for four years. However, Mansoor withdrew her statement in November 2020 and the CPS has now withdrawn the charge against Morrison. In a statement, the CPS said: "Following a review of the evidence, we have concluded that there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction for the offence of harassment, and the charge against Mr Morrison has been discontinued." Despite this development, Morrison still has three charges of assault against Mansoor and her family to answer to at a trial scheduled for 26th January at Manchester Crown Court. Morrison has had a turbulent career in football, with a well-documented history of off-field issues. However, he has made a positive start to his loan spell at Cardiff City, making four appearances so far. The midfielder started his career at Manchester United before moving to West Ham United in 2012. He has also had loan spells at a number of clubs, including Queens Park Rangers, Birmingham City and Middlesbrough. Morrison's talent on the pitch is undeniable, but his off-field troubles have often overshadowed his ability. He will be hoping to put these issues behind him and focus on his football. The outcome of the harassment charge will come as a relief to Morrison, who will no doubt be hoping it is a step towards rebuilding his reputation. However, the assault charges are still a serious matter and will need to be addressed at his upcoming trial. Morrison will be keen to continue his good form on the pitch and help Cardiff City in their push for promotion to the Premier League. Only time will tell if he can put his off-field troubles behind him for good.
