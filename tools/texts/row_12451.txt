article: Air passengers are paying up to eight times as much for their seats as the person sitting next to them - including in coach class. Fliers are routinely being ripped off if they book a route which is popular with business travellers even if they are using it for a holiday. A study found that as a result air passengers were paying up to $1,200 (£710) more than they should on a flight that took just one hour. On board: Fliers are routinely being ripped off if they book a route which is popular with business travellers even if they are using it for a holiday (file picture) The findings will likely enrage consumers who are nowadays being forced to pay for many things that once came a standard. Airlines like Ryanair routinely hit passengers with hidden fees of $17 (£10) per trip and $120 (£70) for checking in at the airport. The study looked at flights in the US and found that some airlines had a greater price disparity between the lowest fares and the highest than others. Fares varied the least on Spirit Airlines, five per cent. On Virgin America they had a 15 per cent disparity, and United Airlines had 18 per cent variability. The study also looked at the amount it cost you if you booked the wrong seat. Flying between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, . a one hour journey, the highest paid for a seat in coach was $1,400 (£830) and . the cheapest was $200 (£120), a difference of $1,200 (£710). Differences: The study looked at flights in the US and found fares varied 15 per cent on Virgin America . Other fares were not so high in monetary terms but up to eight times more than the lowest seat. Overall, the study showed that flights to popular destinations like Hawaii were not so likely to have a price variability because consumers are more willing to switch to another airline. However trips to Washington DC and Chicago changed more because business travellers had to take them regardless, meaning the airlines could take advantage of them. The study was compiled by travel website Hopper.com, which advised passengers to book early and watch prices closely. Hopper.com analysed flight data using its own software which monitors 10million flight requests a day. The survey was carried out at the start of May.

chatgpt: Flying can be an expensive affair, and a new study conducted on flights in the United States has revealed that the prices passengers pay for tickets can vary widely. According to the study, some fliers are unknowingly paying a lot more than they should for their flights. In fact, on some popular routes, passengers are paying up to $1,200 more than they need to. The study, which was conducted by the travel website Hopper, looked at fares for flights in the United States on a number of routes. The researchers found that the biggest price difference was on the Los Angeles to Las Vegas route, where some passengers were paying as much as $1,400 for a one-hour flight, while others were shelling out just $200 for the same flight. That's a difference of 15% on Virgin America and 18% on United Airlines. The study also found that Spirit Airlines had the smallest disparity in pricing, with just a 5% difference between the highest and lowest tickets on offer. Meanwhile, other airlines like United and Delta had price disparities of around 10%. So why are some passengers paying so much more than others? The study found that the biggest factor was the timing of the booking. In many cases, passengers who book their flights too early or too late can end up paying significantly more than those who book at just the right time. The study found that booking about two months ahead of your planned travel date is generally the best time to get the cheapest fares. Another important factor is the availability of seats. The study found that flights with fewer available seats tend to have higher prices, as airlines raise their fares in response to the increased demand. So what can passengers do to avoid paying more than they need to for their flights? The authors of the study recommend using a travel agent or a booking site that provides data on price trends to find the best deals. They also suggest booking well in advance, and being flexible with travel dates if possible. Overall, the study shows that there is a huge disparity in the prices that passengers pay for flights in the US. While some airlines offer relatively consistent prices, others have wide variations that can result in passengers paying unnecessarily high fares. By being aware of these disparities and taking steps to find the best deals, however, fliers can save themselves a significant amount of money.
