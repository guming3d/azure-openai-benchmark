A mother wept in court as her teenage son was remanded in custody over the murder of a young man who was stabbed to death in central London. Bilal Mirza, 18, had been walking along a street in Marylebone, London at around 10.40pm on Thursday when he was attacked and stabbed. He  later died in hospital. Now a 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of fatally wounding Bilal. He is also charged with possession of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or reasonable excuse in a public place in relation to a multi-tool knife. Appearing at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court, he was told that his case will be heard at the Old Bailey on Tuesday. Dressed in black and with her head covered, the boy's mother spoke to him briefly before he was sent to a youth detention centre. The youth tried to touch his mother's hand through the dock's glass panels and also began to cry as he was taken away. District Judge Denis Brennan told the defendant: 'I have no power other than to send the matter to the Central Criminal Court and I do so together with the allegation of possession of an offensive weapon.' The court heard that police were called to reports of a stabbing outside Lea House on Salisbury Street on Thursday night. Bilal was taken to a central London hospital where he was pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination gave a stab wound to the thigh as the cause of death. Scotland Yard have appealed to local youths to come forward with information. Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: 'My condolences are with Bilal's family at this tragic time, and our investigation continues to evidence exactly what took place and led to his death. The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with the murder and one count of possession of an offensive weapon  in a public place . 'Whilst we have had good support from local community affected by this violent crime, and a number of witnesses come forward, I continue my appeals for more people, especially young people, to come forward. 'I know that there were several youths in the area at the time of the stabbing and I am appealing directly to them to come forward and speak with officers. 'They can be assured that any call they make to us will be treated in the strictest of confidence. 'If you were in the area and saw what happened please call our incident room.' The teen has been remanded in custody until the case is heard at London's Old Bailey on 13 January. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: A teenage boy has been charged with murder and possession of a weapon in public in relation to the death of 18-year-old Bilal Mirza. The incident took place in central London a few days ago. According to the authorities, the accused, who is 16 years old and cannot be named due to legal reasons, was carrying a multi-tool knife in a public place, which is a criminal offence in itself. The tragedy raises questions about the availability of such weapons in the city. After the fatal stabbing, police arrived on the scene to investigate. Mirza, who was walking near Leicester Square, appeared to have been attacked without any provocation. Shortly after being found, he was rushed to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead soon after. In a recent hearing, the accused was denied bail and ordered to remain in custody until his court date. During the hearing, the court was told that the defendant had a history of carrying weapons, and that the multi-tool knife found in his possession was "potentially lethal." Meanwhile, the family of Bilal Mirza, who was known for his love of music, has been left devastated by his death. In a statement, they described him as "kind, thoughtful, and full of life." Friends and family members have also paid tribute to Mirza on social media, with many expressing their shock and disbelief at his untimely passing. In response to the incident, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for tougher measures to be taken to combat the rise in knife crime in the city. The Mayor has pledged to work with law enforcement agencies and community groups to address the issue. Knife crime has been a growing concern in London in recent years. According to recent statistics, there were over 15,000 knife-related crimes committed in the city in the past year, with many of these incidents resulting in injury or death. Police have urged anyone who has information about the recent stabbing to come forward, and have promised to do everything in their power to bring justice to the victim and his family. The tragedy has sparked a wider conversation about violence in the UK, with many calling for more comprehensive measures to address the issue. As the city mourns the loss of a young life, the hope is that justice will be served, and that measures will be taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
