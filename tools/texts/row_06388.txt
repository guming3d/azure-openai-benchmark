Grimes' daughter Crystal Hartt, 47, told MySanAntonio, a video provided by the funeral home shows Mireles putting her hands across the casket, setting her keys on top of the dead body and placing the chain in the waist band of her pants. 'How disrespectful is that to set your junk on top of my dad's dead body while you steal his necklace and stuff it into your pants,' Hartt said. She said the act was made even more upsetting as there was an 'unspoken bond' between her mother and father that he would never remove the chain.

Mireles, an acquaintance of the man, was arrested December 31 on the felony charge. She later was released from the San Patricio County jail on a $3,500 bond. The necklace was returned to the man's widow. 'To watch my mother's shaking hands when the detective placed that chain back into them, I just felt a huge relief for my mother that the necklace was back where it was supposed to be,' Hartt said.
