chatgpt: Tragedy has struck in the search for two missing climbers, a 48-year-old man from Sussex and a 21-year-old man from Hampshire, who were reported missing from South Stack cliffs last night. After an intense search and rescue operation, their bodies were found at 7:15 am this morning. The two men were last heard from on Sunday evening, and concerns were raised when they failed to return to their accommodation. A search operation involving the coastguard and mountain rescue teams was launched late last night, and continued throughout the night with the help of rescue helicopters. The search resumed at first light this morning, as rescue teams scoured the area for any sign of the missing climbers. Unfortunately, at 7:15 am, the search came to a tragic end when their bodies were discovered. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined, but bad weather conditions and treacherous terrain may have played a factor. The South Stack cliffs are known to be a challenging location for climbers, and accidents have occurred in the past. The coastguard and mountain rescue teams have expressed their condolences to the families of the two climbers, and have commended the efforts of all involved in the search operation. A spokesperson for the coastguard said: "Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the two climbers at this difficult time. We would like to thank all the rescue teams involved in the search operation for their efforts and hard work during this challenging operation." The tragedy is a reminder of the risks involved in climbing and the importance of safety measures. Climbers are advised to take proper precautions and to always be aware of the weather conditions and terrain. The loss of two lives is a sad reminder of the dangers inherent in this challenging and rewarding sport.
