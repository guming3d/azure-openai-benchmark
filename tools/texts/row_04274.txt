article: By . Damien Gayle . The bridge which carried interstate traffic through downtown Cleveland fell in a matter of seconds when engineers detonated explosives in a military-style demolition. Nearby neighbourhoods shook as the Innerbelt Bridge's remaining skeleton of steel girders collapsed after more than 50 years of holding up the main artery into the north-east Ohio city. Nearly a thousand locals who had gathered at East 14th Street and Broadway to watch the demolition cheered as the landmark was obliterated in a millisecond. Scroll down for video . Demolition engineers take a last look at the Innerbelt Bridge before blowing it up . Someone presses the magic buttons and charges detonate at 88 crucial spots around the steel frame . With its weight-bearing joints destroyed, the bridge begins to collapse . A cloud of dust is kicked up as, after 55 years, the massive bridge collapses onto the ground below . The 55-year-old bridge, which had aged faster than expected, is to be replaced with two new bridges, the first of which has already been built and the second of which is due for completion in 2016. At around 6am on Saturday morning, engineers pressed the button to detonate 182lbs of explosives placed at 88 crucial spots which, in half a second, sent the remaining 5,000 tons of tumbling to the ground below. Shortly before, a smaller 'scare charge' had been let off to scatter any peregrine falcons or other birds roosting in the superstructure. The spans on each end of the bridge, and over the Norfolk Southern railway and Cuyahoga River, which couldn't be blown up, had already been manually dismantled, leaving five of the nine spans for explosive demolition. The Innerbelt Bridge had carried Interstate-90 traffic in and out of downtown Cleveland since 1959. It was taken out of use last November, with traffic transferred onto the first of the dual bridges that will replace it, which are named after retired Ohio senator George Voinovich. Baltimore firm Controlled Demolition handled the razing of Innerbelt Bridge. Its president, Mark Loizeaux, told Cleveland.com's Alison Grant that for him it was 'just another day at the office'.

chatgpt: The Innerbelt Bridge, a commuting route that connected the shore of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio to downtown Cleveland since 1959, met its end with a loud explosion yesterday. The 5,000 tons of steel that made up the bridge were brought down with the help of 182lbs of explosives, which caused a loud boom heard throughout the city.  The demolition ceremony was held on the morning of the anniversary of the day the bridge was opened. A crowd gathered to watch as the first of two new bridges was officially opened to replace the old bridge that had served Cleveland for over 60 years. The new bridge is a cable-stayed design that spans 4,247 feet over the Cuyahoga River valley, offering a much safer and modern route into downtown Cleveland.  The Innerbelt Bridge was considered functionally obsolete by the Ohio Department of Transportation, and the decision was made to replace the aging structure with two new bridges. The demolition of the old bridge marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. The new structures will serve Cleveland for many years to come, providing safer and more efficient transportation for the city's residents and visitors. The demolition process started in the early morning hours, with explosives strategically placed throughout the old bridge to ensure it collapsed in a safe and controlled manner. A few moments after the detonation, the bridge buckled and fell into the river below in a massive cloud of dust and debris. The demolition team spent the next few hours clearing the debris from the river to ensure it is safe for boats and other watercraft to pass through. The second bridge, which is currently under construction, is expected to open to traffic in the coming months. The new bridges are state-of-the-art, offering advanced safety features and technology that the Innerbelt Bridge did not have.  The new bridges will undoubtedly improve travel in the region, increase safety, and provide additional capacity for vehicles traveling through Downtown Cleveland. The demolition of the Innerbelt Bridge may be the end of an era, but it is the beginning of a new one as Cleveland continues to modernize and evolve.
