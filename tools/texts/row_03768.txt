article: (CNN) -- She just can't seem to stay away. A day after she pleaded no contest to stowing away, Marilyn Jean Hartman was re-arrested at the Los Angeles airport on Thursday. She was seen earlier in the day arriving at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), where she spent about an hour "scouting out multiple passenger terminals before being arrested. "Airport Police officers did not observe Hartman attempting to purchase an airline ticket and she did not have a ticket or boarding pass in her possession when arrested," the airport said in a statement. Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said in the statement that flyers were distributed with Hartman's picture on it. "When we knew she was going to be released from custody, we were prepared," he said. This week, authorities say Hartman, 62, made it through a screening checkpoint at Mineta San Jose International Airport without a ticket and boarded a Southwest Airlines flight bound for LAX. She was initially arrested there Monday. She pleaded no contest Wednesday to a misdemeanor count of stowing away, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. She was sentenced to two years probation and three days in jail. She was given credit for time served and released. Outside the courthouse, Hartman refused to detail to reporters how she got through security. "I don't think it's wise to say how I got through. I don't want to help the enemy," she said. "...I want to go with a paid ticket. ... I want to do everything legal," Hartman said then. "It was clearly wrong on my part. ... It was stupid and it is something I don't want to repeat." Hartman has been described by authorities as a serial stowaway, who has repeatedly tried to board flights to Hawaii at San Francisco International Airport without a ticket. Earlier this year, she was sentenced to probation and ordered to stay away from the San Francisco airport. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter and Randi Kaye contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Marilyn Jean Hartman, a 62-year-old woman with a long history of attempts to sneak onto flights, was arrested yet again on Monday after stowing away on a flight from San Jose to Los Angeles. Hartman is accused of scouting out multiple passenger terminals before choosing her target, according to airport police.  "When we knew she was going to be released, which we were fairly certain was going to happen, we were prepared," said airport police chief David Maggard. Despite the security measures in place, Hartman was able to sneak past them and board the flight undetected. Hartman has a history of attempting to sneak onto flights, having made multiple attempts in the past. In 2018, she was sentenced to 177 days in jail after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway. She has also attempted to sneak onto flights out of San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix, and Chicago. It is unclear why Hartman continues to attempt these stowaway flights. Some speculate that she is seeking adventure, while others suggest that she may be suffering from mental health issues. She has been offered housing and assistance by local authorities, but has repeatedly declined. Hartman's most recent arrest underscores the ongoing issues of airport security and the difficulty of keeping determined individuals from accessing secure areas. This incident has raised questions about what more could be done to improve measures at airports to prevent unauthorized individuals from entering secure areas and potentially putting passengers and crew at risk. The TSA has implemented various security measures to prevent these types of incidents, including screening passengers and their luggage, using body scanners, and establishing secure perimeter fencing. However, these measures are not foolproof, and determined individuals like Hartman have been known to find their way past them. As screening technology and security measures continue to advance, so do the tactics of those seeking to bypass them. The incident involving Marilyn Jean Hartman is a reminder that security measures must evolve and improve to stay ahead of potential threats, and that individuals like Hartman may require more than just security measures to address the root causes of their behavior.
