article: (CNN) -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has left a New York hospital to recuperate at his home in the city, the official Saudi Press Agency said Wednesday. The king left the New York Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center Tuesday night, the news agency said citing the Royal Court. The statement did not say how long Abdullah will remain in New York. Abdullah first underwent successful surgery on November 24. He had a successful follow-up back surgery on December 3 to stabilize several vertebrae in his spine, the agency said earlier. The king traveled to the United States for treatment of a herniated spinal disc and a blood clot that was causing him back pain, Saudi state media reported. Abdullah, 86, had named Crown Prince Sultan to administer the state's affairs in the monarch's absence, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported at the time. The top three figures in the kingdom -- Abdullah, Sultan and Prince Nayef, the country's interior minister and second deputy prime minister -- are all sons of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, who founded modern Saudi Arabia in 1932. Abdullah has ruled the oil-rich kingdom since the August 2005 death of his half-brother, King Fahd. But Abdullah ran most of the kingdom's affairs for a decade before that on behalf of his ailing half-brother. Since coming to power, he has sought to establish rules and procedures for many Saudi institutions, giving him a reputation as a reformer in the highly conservative nation.

chatgpt: King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has undergone two successful surgeries in New York City. It is currently unknown how long the king will remain in the city following his medical procedures.  The surgeries were reportedly performed at New York Presbyterian Hospital and were successful according to sources close to the king. There has been no official statement from the hospital or the Saudi government regarding the king's health or the specifics of the procedures.  King Abdullah, who is 87 years old, has had a number of health issues in recent years, including back problems and a herniated disk. He has also reportedly been diagnosed with Parkinsonâ€™s disease.  The king's health and ability to rule has become a topic of concern for many within the Saudi government and for citizens of the country. However, the Saudi government has been tight-lipped regarding the details of his condition. The length of the king's stay in New York following his surgeries is not currently known. His absence from the country has caused some speculation regarding a potential power struggle or change in leadership. However, the Saudi government has maintained that the king is still in charge. Saudi Arabia is a key player in the global economy and has significant influence in the Middle East. The country is home to the world's largest oil reserves and is a member of the G20. King Abdullah has been in power since 2005 and has overseen a number of significant changes within the country, including the first elections in 2005, the establishment of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, and the Saudi Vision 2030 plan for economic diversification.  As the king's health remains uncertain and his stay in New York continues, the future of the country remains uncertain as well.
