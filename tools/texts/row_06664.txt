Everyone dreads the stress of Christmas shopping with the huge crowds fighting for a bargain and the overcrowded car parks. Now, a psychologist has claimed the experience is so painful that it sparks the primal ‘fight or flight’ mechanism. Dr David Lewis, founder of the independent research consultancy Mindlab International, says people become aggressive while they are doing their shopping because the swarming crowds activate basic survival mechanisms. Psychologist Dr David Lewis has claimed the experience of Christmas shopping is so painful that it sparks the 'fight or flight' mechanism . He added that the experience can also cause exhaustion and anxiety as well as guilt and feelings of inadequacy, The Telegraph reports. He says people who live in the countryside are most at risk of adverse effects as they are not used to the crowds. Dr Lewis told the paper: ‘Festive cheer all too easily gives way to seasonal shopping stress. ‘The presence of other people is a major factor. Other people present a great threat and strangers are more of a threat. ‘You can begin to see people who are moving more slowly than you, such as an elderly person, as the enemy. It leads to shopping rage.’ He explained that in these circumstances, a person’s heart rate increases, they sweat more and their body starts to produce cortisol – the stress hormone. He said this can promote aggression but that it can also make people want to escape meaning some will leave a trolley full of shopping as they cannot bear to spend any more time in the crowd. There is, however, some good news for shoppers. People become aggressive while they are doing their shopping because the swarming crowds activate basic survival mechanisms. It also makes some people anxious and exhausted . Dr Lewis says there are ways to make the experience less stressful. He says people should draw up a shopping list as this makes it easier to avoid unnecessary impulse buys. His second tip is that people should not shop while hungry as they buy more food when they are hungry and then end up throwing a lot of it away. He added that shoppers should walk away and think carefully before purchasing expensive presents as once they have walked away they will often change their mind. Finally, he said that people should do as much shopping as possible online so that when they do hit the shops they can take in the festive atmosphere in a more relaxed fashion.

chatgpt: It's the holiday season, and that means it's time to hit the shops and get your gift buying done. However, according to Dr. David Lewis, a psychologist and author, the swarming crowds during shopping can trigger basic survival instincts in people, leading to aggressive behavior. Dr. Lewis suggests that this behavior happens because when people are in crowded environments, their natural fight or flight response kicks in. The surge of people and noise can make some people feel anxious, and the exhaustion that comes with navigating through a crowded space only exacerbates the problem. Interestingly, Dr. Lewis also notes that people from the countryside are more likely to be adversely impacted by the crowds. Those who are used to open spaces may feel especially overwhelmed by the tight confines of a busy store. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate the stress of shopping. Dr. Lewis recommends writing a list before heading out to the shops and only getting the things on that list. This way, shoppers can avoid feeling overwhelmed by endless choices and can focus their attention on a specific goal. For those who really can't stand the crowds, online shopping is always an option. Many stores now offer online shopping options, allowing people to shop from the comfort of their own homes without the stress of crowds and long lines. The trend of online shopping has become increasingly common, and retailers are starting to catch on. In fact, many stores are now offering exclusive online sales and discounts. This means that not only can shoppers avoid the stress of crowds, but they can also potentially find better deals. As holiday shopping continues to ramp up, it's important to be mindful of your own stress levels. Dr. Lewis suggests taking breaks throughout your shopping experience, finding a quiet corner to regroup and relax. These short breaks can help prevent shoppers from becoming overwhelmed and more susceptible to stress-induced aggression. In conclusion, while the holiday shopping season can be stressful, there are ways to minimize the stress and make the experience more enjoyable. By writing a list, taking breaks, and considering online shopping options, shoppers can reduce the impact of crowds on their shopping experience. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and mental health during what can be a hectic and overwhelming time.
