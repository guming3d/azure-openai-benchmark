Making his mark: Stephen Ireland is determined to prove his critics wrong . 'Villa took the p***. They treated me like a toy. I was cast on on one side,' Ireland told the Daily Star. 'They even took me to a field on my own to train. It was an absolute nightmare. 'There was just me and the fitness coach in a field. He used to take me three or four pitches away from the main group. He would warm-up the first-team, run me around for 30 minutes and then leave to go home. 'I don't feel I was given the chances. It's difficult not to feel hard done by. I can't do anything about the past. All I can do is influence the future and that's what I'm planning to do.'

chatgpt: Former Aston Villa midfielder Stephen Ireland has spoken out about his time at the club, claiming that he wasn't given a fair chance during his four-year spell. The 34-year-old also revealed that he was paid just £85 a week while playing for Manchester City. Ireland joined Villa in 2010 and spent four seasons at the Midlands club before being loaned out to Stoke City in 2013. Despite making more than 125 appearances for Villa, the midfielder feels he never received the same opportunities as some of his teammates. Speaking ahead of Stoke's clash against Villa in the Premier League on Saturday, Ireland said, "I'm not going to lie, I was really disappointed with my time there. I feel like I wasn't given a fair chance, and that's something that still frustrates me to this day." Ireland also opened up about his early days at Manchester City, where he made his professional debut in 2005. Despite being touted as one of City's most promising youngsters, the midfielder claims he was paid just £85 a week, a stark contrast to the high wages paid to some of his teammates. "I remember sitting down with my agent and telling him how little I was being paid," Ireland said. "It was a difficult time, but I was just happy to be playing football." Despite his disappointment at Villa, Ireland enjoyed a successful loan spell at Stoke, where he made 17 appearances and scored twice. The midfielder eventually left Villa for good in 2014, joining Stoke on a permanent deal. As Ireland prepares to face his former club this weekend, he'll be hoping to make an impact and prove his worth once again. "I've got nothing against Villa, but I do feel like I have a point to prove," he said. "I want to show that I still have plenty to offer."
