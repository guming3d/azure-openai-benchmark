article: By . Political Correspondent . Tens of thousands of primary pupils are sitting tougher exams brought back by Michael Gove in 2012 . Tens of thousands of 11-year-olds are being stretched by more difficult tests that have been revived by Education Secretary Michael Gove. Only the brightest pupils are expected to pass the tougher versions of Level 6 exams. Labour axed the exams, which test 11-year-olds with material more suitable for 14-year-olds, in 2002 before the Coalition brought them back in 2012 for maths and reading. Last year, the tests were also brought in for grammar, punctuation and spelling. From 2016, the current standard tests for 11-year-olds will be replaced by a compulsory exam which will include many of the harder questions asked in the Level 6 papers. It means all youngsters will be expected to be taught at a higher level to meet the tougher exam requirements. Currently, the Level 6 is optional and teachers tend to test only the most academic pupils with it. But figures released today show that primary schools are increasingly using them to challenge students and raise aspiration. Last year, just 3 per cent – 2,200 out of 70,000 pupils – who sat the reading exam reached a Level 6 pass. Just 8,500 out of 59,000 passed the spelling, punctuation and grammar test (14 per cent) while under half – 35,000 out of 78,000 – passed the maths test. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We brought back these tests because we wanted to give teachers the chance to set high aspirations for pupils in literacy and numeracy. ‘We want to see every school stretching all their pupils. These figures show that primary schools have embraced the opportunity to stretch their brightest 11-year-olds by  teaching them more demanding new material, in line with the new curriculum, and by entering them for the Level 6 test.’ From 2016, the current standard tests for 11-year-olds will be replaced by a compulsory exam which will include many of the harder questions asked in the Level 6 papers . Mr Gove has said: ‘It is plain wrong to set a ceiling on the talents of the very brightest pupils and let them drift in class. 'Letting teachers offer Level 6 tests means that the most talented children will be fully stretched and start secondary school razor-sharp.’ To achieve a Level 6 in reading, children have to trace an idea, explore different levels of meaning in a text and explain how a writer tries to influence a reader. Those sitting a Level 6 in maths have to convert between fractions, decimals and  percentages, explain number patterns through graphs and algebra and understand formulae for calculating volume and area. To gain a Level 6 in grammar, punctuation and spelling, pupils must use complex  nouns, a range of verb forms and understand subordinate clauses as well as use semi-colons properly.

chatgpt: New data shows that primary schools are increasingly using Level 6 exams to challenge their brightest pupils, with more and more Year 6 students being presented with material designed for 16-year-olds. However, the pass rate for these exams remains low, with just three percent of pupils achieving a Level 6 pass in the reading exam in the previous year.  The Level 6 exams, which were introduced in 2012 to allow top-performing primary school pupils to demonstrate their abilities, are significantly more difficult than the standard Level 4 exams taken by most Year 6 students. They test students on advanced material and typically require higher-order reading and problem-solving skills.  While many primary schools have shied away from using the Level 6 exams in the past, there has been a recent surge in interest among schools looking to challenge their brightest students. This has been driven in part by the increasing use of streaming and setting in primary schools. By identifying their top pupils and challenging them with more difficult material, schools hope to stretch their abilities and ensure they remain engaged and challenged throughout their primary education. However, the results of these exams have been mixed. While some students have flourished under the more challenging curriculum, others have struggled to keep up, leading to concerns that the exams may be overly challenging for many pupils.  Last year's data provides a good example of the challenges involved in using Level 6 exams. In the reading exam, just three percent of pupils who sat the exam achieved a Level 6 pass, highlighting the difficulty of the material presented. This is in stark contrast to the much higher pass rates for the standard Level 4 exams, where the pass rate was over 70 percent.  Despite the low pass rate, there is still significant interest among primary schools in using the Level 6 exams. Many see them as an important tool for identifying their top performers and ensuring they are appropriately challenged. However, there is also recognition that the exams need to be carefully managed to ensure that they do not discourage or overwhelm students who are not yet ready for such advanced material. To this end, some schools have begun to use the exams primarily as a means of identifying students who may benefit from additional support or enrichment, rather than treating them as pass or fail exams. By viewing the exams in this way, schools hope to encourage a growth mindset, where students see challenges as opportunities for growth rather than sources of anxiety or failure. Overall, the increasing use of Level 6 exams in primary schools highlights the ongoing efforts to provide top-performing students with a challenging and engaging curriculum. While the exams may not be suitable for all students, they do have an important role to play in ensuring that primary education caters to the needs of a diverse range of learners. As schools continue to refine their use of the exams, we can expect to see more students benefitting from the additional challenges and opportunities they provide.
