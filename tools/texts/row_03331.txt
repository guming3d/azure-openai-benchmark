article: Roman Polanski in October in Paris. The U.S. has asked Poland to extradite the director over an unlawful sex charge with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 . The U.S. has asked Poland to extraditeÂ filmmaker Roman Polanski over a 1977 child sex crime conviction, officials said on Wednesday. A lawyer for the director - viewed by many Poles as one of . their greatest living cultural figures - said Polish . prosecutors already questioned Polanski last year and let him go . free, and since then nothing had changed. Polanski, 81, who was born to Polish parents but lives in . France, has been spending time in the southern Polish city of . Krakow, where he is planning to shoot a film. Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor general's . office in Warsaw, said the extradition request, which came from . prosecutors in Los Angeles, will be passed on to the . prosecutors' office in Krakow. 'Prosecutors will want to summon Polanski for questioning,' Martyniuk said. The spokesman said that as a rule Poland does not extradite its citizens. In October last year, prosecutors in Krakow interviewed . Polanski in connection with a U.S. warrant over the 1977 . conviction. They said there were no grounds to arrest him, and . they would await a U.S. extradition request before deciding on . any further steps. 'In our view no new circumstances have arisen which could . lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor's office in . October,' one of Polanski's Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, . told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday. The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex . with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los . Angeles, fuelled by champagne and drugs. Polanski served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea . bargain. He fled the United States the following year, believing . the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him . in jail for years. In 2009, Polanski was arrested in the Swiss city of Zurich . on the U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest. He was freed . in 2010 after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him to . the United States. His lawyers have been seeking assurances from the Polish . authorities that he can travel freely back and forth to Krakow . to work on the film project, about the 19th-century Dreyfus . affair, without risking another arrest. Paris-born Polanski spent his childhood and youth in Poland but lives in France. He holds Polish and French passports.

chatgpt: Roman Polanski, the acclaimed film director, is the center of legal controversy once again. Authorities in Krakow will consider an extradition request put forward by prosecutors from Los Angeles. Polanski, who holds both Polish and French passports, fled the United States after being convicted of unlawful sex with a minor in 1977. Polanski pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, a 13-year-old during a photoshoot. He spent only 42 days in jail before fleeing the United States, fearing that the judge in his case would overrule the plea deal and sentence him to years in jail. The situation has since been a thorn in Polanski's side, weighing heavily on his life and career. Polanski has lived in France since fleeing the United States and has faced a number of extradition requests over the years. Despite his legal troubles, he has continued to direct films, winning numerous awards and accolades, including the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival for his film "The Pianist." The extradition request to be considered by authorities in Krakow brings the case back into the spotlight once again. The Los Angeles prosecutor's office has been pushing for Polanski's extradition for years. In 2010, Polanski was arrested in Switzerland at the request of the Los Angeles authorities, but he was ultimately released and allowed to return home. Polanski's case has been fraught with controversy, with many of his supporters arguing that he has already paid his dues for his crime. Polanski has been the subject of extensive media coverage for decades, and the case has divided public opinion in both the United States and Europe. Polanski's childhood and youth were spent in Poland, but he left the country in the 1960s to pursue his career in France. His films have been praised for their technical brilliance and their ability to push boundaries, but his personal life has often overshadowed his accomplishments in the film industry. The latest extradition request from Los Angeles will be handled by authorities in Krakow, but it remains to be seen whether or not Polanski will actually be extradited to the United States. Given the many legal twists and turns of this long-standing case, it is likely that Polanski's legal woes will continue to be a subject of public scrutiny for many years to come.
