article: London (CNN) -- The European Union is spending more than $167 million to soothe the pain being felt by fruit and vegetable farmers hit by Russian food sanctions. The move comes as the trade war between the West and Russia intensifies, and looks likely to hit Europe's growth figures. Fears over the impact of chilling relations has already undermined Europe's fragile recovery. Around $2.7 billion worth of fruit and vegetables were shipped from the EU to Russia in 2013, the bloc's single biggest export to the market. The package announced by the EU Monday will support producers of fruit and vegetables that are already in season and can't be easily stored. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a tit for tat move against Western sanctions, banned imported European cheese, American chicken and Norwegian seafood from the country's dinner tables. The move was in response to countries imposing economic sanctions against Russia in the aftermath of the flight MH17 disaster. The Kremlin banned most agriculture products from the U.S., the European Union, Norway, Canada and Australia. Europe's food exports to Russia were worth $15.8 billion in 2013, making up around 10% of the bloc's agriculture exports, according to EU data. European countries sold $1.6 billion worth of pork and $1.3 billion worth of cheese and curd to Russia. The U.S. shipped $1.3 billion worth of food to Russia, with chicken and other poultry making up a quarter of the total value, around $310 million. The ban of foreign food is more than just an inconvenience for Russians who like imported food. Russia is the world's fifth largest agricultural importer and remains dependent on food supply from abroad -- its agricultural trade deficit extended to $26 billion in 2013, according to data from the European Commission. With billions worth of food disappearing from the market, prices are likely to go up and experts forecast increased Russian inflation, which is already running at 7.5%. Russians will still be able to enjoy European wines and spirits, as well as bread, pasta and cereals. These have escaped the embargo -- even though their ban would hurt Europe economically. In 2013, EU countries sold nearly $1 billion worth of spirits and $733 million worth of wine to Russia. Explore CNN's infographic above to see what items are likely to disappear from Russian menu.

chatgpt: Russia has escalated its trade war with the West by banning food imports from countries that have imposed sanctions against it. The ban, which includes meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products, is expected to hit Russia's consumers hard as the country heavily relies on food imports from abroad. As the world's fifth largest food importer, the move is seen as an attempt to retaliate against the sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine. According to the Russian government, the ban will be in place for a year, but could be extended if necessary. The ban will impact countries including the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada, and Norway. The ban will also include countries that have supported international sanctions against Russia. This ban is expected to hit the EU the hardest, as Russia bought $15.8 billion worth of food from the EU in 2013, which equated to around 10% of the EU's total food exports. While some EU countries, such as Spain and Italy, rely less on food exports to Russia, others, such as Poland and the Netherlands, will be heavily impacted. The United States, which exported $1.3 billion worth of food to Russia in 2013, will also be hit hard by the ban. This will impact producers of meat, poultry, and soybeans, among others. It is not yet clear how this ban will impact the global food market, but some experts predict there may be a shift in supplies and prices. Russia's reliance on food imports from abroad has been growing in recent years, as the country has struggled to produce enough food domestically. The country is particularly dependent on foreign food when it comes to meat and dairy production. The ban has been met with criticism from those in the food industry, who argue that it will harm not only Russian consumers, but also the producers and exporters of the banned foods. The ban could also lead to a rise in food prices in Russia, which could have a knock-on effect on the country's economy. The escalating trade war between Russia and the West has raised concerns about the impact it will have on the global economy. The food ban is just the latest in a series of retaliatory measures taken by both sides, with the West imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas sector, and Russia responding by banning Western food imports. As tensions continue to rise between Russia and the West, the impact of the trade war will be felt not only in Russia, but also in other countries that rely on global trade.
