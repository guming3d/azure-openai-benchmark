article: (CNN) -- Former Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has resigned as coach of English club Fulham amid reports linking him with the vacant job at Aston Villa. Hughes has only been in charge at Craven Cottage for a season, joining the London-based club seven months after he was sacked by City. He led Fulham to eighth place in the English Premier League last season and the club qualified for UEFA's Europa League competition due to their standing in Europe's fair play table. Hughes said he wanted a new challenge but insisted he hadn't been approached by any other club. In a statement he said: "I hope the supporters and all those connected with the club will understand I wish to move on to further my experiences. "I would also like to take this opportunity to clarify that neither myself nor my representative have approached or have been approached by another club. This decision to leave Fulham has not been influenced by any outside party." Hughes, a former Manchester United and Barcelona striker, spent 18 months in charge at Manchester City, as the club were taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour, who has since spent around $1bn. But Hughes was dismissed in December 2009 after a slump in league performances before he returned to the game to coach Fulham -- a job he claims he has done well. "I would like to thank the chairman, directors, players and fans of Fulham Football Club for their support over the last 12 months and wish them every success in the future," he added. "I believe my management team and I have done a good job and the club has a strong foundation from which they can go forward. "I sincerely wish Fulham a successful campaign in the Europa League next season and for their continued progress on and off the field." A statement on Fulham's official web site confirmed that Hughes had left the club. It read: "Fulham Football Club can confirm that Mark Hughes has provided notice, under the terms of his contract, to leave the club at the end of June. "After discussions with Mark the club has agreed to accept this notice."

chatgpt: Mark Hughes has resigned as the manager of English Premier League club Fulham, it was announced on Thursday. The Welshman's contract was due to expire in June but he has left with immediate effect after deciding he wants to further his experiences elsewhere. Hughes had joined Fulham in July last year, taking over from Roy Hodgson who had left to become the manager of Liverpool.  In a statement on the club's website, Fulham chairman Mohamed Al Fayed said he regretted Hughes' decision to leave but understood his desire to progress his career. "I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mark for his efforts as Fulham manager and to wish him the very best for his future," Al Fayed said. Hughes, meanwhile, thanked Al Fayed and the Fulham fans for their support during his time at the club. "I believe my management team and I have done a good job and it is with regret that I have made this decision," he said. "However, it is important to note that our decision to leave is driven by a desire to further our experiences and to pursue new challenges." English media have reported that Hughes is now in the running for the vacant Aston Villa job, which was left open when Gerard Houllier stepped down as manager due to health concerns. Villa are currently undergoing a period of transition following Houllier's resignation, and Hughes' experience in the Premier League could be seen as a valuable asset to the Midlands club. Hughes has also been linked with other jobs in recent months, including the manager's position at West Bromwich Albion and the Blackburn Rovers job, which was recently filled by former Sunderland boss Steve Bruce.  Many Fulham fans have expressed their disappointment at Hughes' decision to leave, with some suggesting that the club will struggle to find a replacement who can match his experience and expertise. However, Al Fayed has assured fans that he is working hard to find a suitable replacement, and has vowed to build on the success that Hughes achieved during his time at the club. Fulham finished in eighth place in the Premier League last season, and reached the final of the Europa League, where they lost to Atl√©tico Madrid. The club will now be looking for a new manager who can help them to build on this success, and take them to even greater heights in the future.
