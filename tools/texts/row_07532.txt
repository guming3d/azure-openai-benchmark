chatgpt: Belgium is set to take on Wales in a crucial Euro 2020 qualification game on Wednesday night without their captain Vincent Kompany, who is out with an injury. This news will be a significant blow to the Belgian side's defense as Kompany is known for his leadership skills and defensive abilities on the field.  However, Belgium's coach Roberto Martinez has stated that he has faith in his squad and will look to other players to step up in Kompany's absence. Christian Benteke, Romelu Lukaku, and Divock Origi are all available for selection and could make a huge impact in the game against Wales.  On the other hand, Wales has received a boost ahead of their match as Aaron Ramsey has returned after missing both of their October qualifiers due to an injury. Ramsey's return is undoubtedly a boost for the Welsh side as he has contributed significantly to their recent away form. Together with Gareth Bale, Ramsey has scored nine of Wales' last ten away goals.  The Welsh side is currently second in Group E behind Croatia, and they will be looking to secure a crucial victory over Belgium to increase their chances of qualifying for the Euro 2020. Meanwhile, Belgium sits comfortably at the top of the group with a flawless record of four wins from four games.  Belgium and Wales have faced each other several times before, and their last encounter was in 2016 during the Euro tournament where Wales emerged victorious with a 3-1 win. However, both teams have gone through significant changes since then, and this upcoming match is expected to be a close contest.  Speaking ahead of the match, Gareth Bale insisted that Wales is not afraid of Belgium and that they are well prepared for the game. Bale said, "We know Belgium is a good team, but we are not scared of anyone. We will take the game to them, and we are confident that we can come away with a result."  The match is set to take place at King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels, Belgium. With both teams eager to grab a victory, fans worldwide can anticipate an intense and entertaining encounter. Nonetheless, the injury of Vincent Kompany could be a significant factor in Belgium's performance, and they will need to work hard to cover his absence.  In conclusion, the absence of Vincent Kompany from Belgium's Euro 2020 qualifier match against Wales will undoubtedly influence the match. Still, Roberto Martinez has expressed confidence in his squad and will look to other players to step up in Kompany's absence. Aaron Ramsey's return to the Welsh side will undoubtedly boost their confidence, and together with Gareth Bale, they will look to extend their away form. With both teams eager to grab a victory, the match is expected to be a tight contest.
