article: (CNN) -- A travel website on Saturday flashed the word "CANCELED" in blinking red letters across an online flight schedule for Missouri's largest airport after a rash of severe weather stranded travelers across the region. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, the country's 30th busiest, was closed after a tornado struck the facility on Friday, but officials expect it to reopen Sunday. "All departing and arriving flights are canceled until further notice pending full safety assessments of airport facilities," the airport website said Saturday. St. Louis-bound flights were diverted to neighboring airports as a result of the storms, including more than a dozen flights to Kansas City International Airport, according to airport spokesman Joe McBride. Rerouted passengers were put up in hotels, and at least three airlines tried to accommodate frustrated travelers on Saturday by busing them from Kansas City to St. Louis, he said.

Friday night, lines of weary passengers wrapped around airport car rental centers in a frantic attempt to find alternate transportation. "It was pretty crazy," said Enterprise employee Daniel Tighe. "People were getting into Kansas City just to figure out that their flight had been canceled. "We took in 30 walk-in reservations just last night," he added. "Plus it's the holiday weekend." By Saturday the influx of one-way car reservations had abated as rerouted passengers made their way to St. Louis. "We had quite a few runs to the Greyhound bus station and train station downtown," said Chris Bos, an employee for Nick & Nino's taxi service in Kansas City. "Most people didn't complain. There's not much else they could do." AirTran said it will fly its St. Louis-bound passengers to Bloomington, Illinois, or Kansas City, Missouri, according to company spokesman Christopher White. But potential thunderstorms and flooding still loomed over the St. Louis area by Saturday afternoon, the National Weather Service said. Major damage was evident in nearby communities, where an estimated 30,000 homes were without power. See iReport images from elsewhere in Missouri . Meanwhile, 30-minute delays lingered at Chicago's Midway and O'Hare airports, where severe storms prompted more than 500 flight cancellations Friday, according to Karen Pride, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Aviation.

chatgpt: St. Louis was hit hard by a tornado on Friday, forcing the city's busy airport to shut down while officials assessed the damage. At the time, thousands of passengers were in the airport, awaiting flights. The tornado ripped through the city, causing chaos and destruction. Airport officials, along with airline partners, quickly came up with a plan to help the affected passengers. The Fort-Lauderdale International Airport, which is the primary hub for many airlines, including Southwest and American, was completely shut down. Passengers were forced to spend the night in the airport, while airlines scrambled to find alternate routes and accommodations. The airport officials, along with multiple airlines, had a difficult task ahead of them as they worked together to find new flights and hotels for the stranded passengers. The airlines had to work together to manage space availability as there was a shortage of hotel rooms for the affected passengers. Many passengers were relieved to hear that they would not be stranded in the airport, and that the airlines had arranged for them to be accommodated in local hotels. One passenger, Anne Burns, said "I was worried that we would be stranded here for days. The airline really came through and took care of everything. They found us a nice hotel room and flight out of here. I'm very grateful." The St. Louis airport is the country's 30th-busiest airport and sees a significant amount of traffic each day. Dealing with a situation like this was a new one for the airport officials and made the situation more challenging. The airport authority thanked the airlines for their quick response and cooperation in dealing with the situation. Passengers were able to leave the St. Louis airport on Saturday morning, although some had to fly through different airports. The incident highlights the importance of having a contingency plan in place to deal with such events. It also emphasizes the importance of proper communication between all parties involved. The quick response from the airlines and the airport officials resulted in a smooth operation, and all passengers were able to find alternate flights and accommodation in a timely manner. The airport officials have since carried out repairs and reopened the airport to the public. The incident serves as a reminder of the power of natural disasters and the importance of being prepared for such situations. Despite the chaos and destruction caused by the tornado, everyone involved worked to ensure the safety and comfort of the affected passengers.
