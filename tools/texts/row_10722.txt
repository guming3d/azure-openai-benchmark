chatgpt: Deryck Whibley, the lead singer of the pop-punk band Sum 41, recently revealed that he was treated for liver and kidney problems after collapsing at home. The musician, who was married to singer Avril Lavigne from 2006 to 2010, took to social media to share the personal news with his fans. In his post, Whibley confessed that years of hard-drinking took a toll on his health. The musician, who is now 41, admitted that he had been a heavy drinker since he was a teenager, and his addiction eventually landed him in the hospital. Whibley wrote, "The reason I got so sick is from all the hard drinking I've been doing over the years. It finally caught up to me." He went on to explain that his liver and kidneys were "completely shut down" due to alcohol abuse, and that his doctors warned him that he could have died if he had waited any longer to seek medical attention. After collapsing at his Los Angeles home, Whibley was rushed to the hospital where he spent a month undergoing intense treatment.
