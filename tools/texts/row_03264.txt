On the night his parent club went out of the competition at home to Southampton, it was the kind of inspiration they could have done with. Bradford, who famously reached the final of this competition two years ago, had plenty of chances to get back into the game, Mason Bennet and Jason Kennedy spurning the best opportunities as the visitors shaded possession.

MK Dons assistant manager Richie Barker was full of praise for the on-loan striker who has now bagged nine goals in this season's competition. 'Benik has scored a lot of one-on-ones because of his pace,' said Barker, 'but the way he took his first goal was excellent. I didn't realise how good it was until I watched it the second time around. 'He's got everything. And to be fair to him and Will Grigg - who have rotated - every time one of them starts they end up scoring and it gives us a headache in terms of team selection.' Afobe sank to his knees in celebration after securing MK Dons their best ever League Cup showing .

chatgpt: MK Dons secured their place in the last 16 of the Capital One Cup for the first time in the club's history with a 2-0 win over Bradford. Striker Benik Afobe was the star of the show, scoring at the beginning and the end of the game to give MK Dons a well-deserved victory. Karl Robinson's side had already caused a stir in the competition by knocking out Premier League giants Manchester United in the previous round. Despite the absence of some key players, including midfielder Dele Alli, who was rested ahead of the weekend's league fixture, MK Dons looked confident from the outset against Bradford. The hosts opened the scoring just six minutes into the game when Afobe latched onto a superb lofted pass from Darren Potter and slotted the ball past the advancing Ben Williams in the Bradford goal. Bradford had chances to equalise, with Filipe Morais and Jon Stead both going close, but ultimately it was Afobe who had the final say. With just a minute remaining, Afobe pounced on a loose ball inside the box following a corner and rifled the ball into the roof of the net to secure the victory and send the home fans wild with delight. MK Dons boss Robinson was understandably thrilled with his side's performance. He said: "I'm very proud of the players. We played some fantastic football at times and controlled the game from start to finish. We knew that Bradford would be a tough team to beat, but we stuck to our game plan and got the job done." Robinson also reserved special praise for his two-goal hero. "Benik has been fantastic for us this season and he was outstanding again tonight. He took his goals brilliantly and showed just what a top-class striker he is." The win means that MK Dons will now face Sheffield United in the next round of the competition. Robinson's side will be hoping to continue their impressive run in the Capital One Cup and make history by reaching the quarter-finals for the first time. Despite their success in the competition, Robinson insists that his side's main focus is on the league, with MK Dons currently sitting in ninth place in League One. "The league is our bread and butter and that's where our main focus is," he said. "But if we can go on another cup run and give the fans something to cheer about, then that's a bonus." Overall, it was a fantastic night for MK Dons and their fans, who will savour the memories of knocking out two of English football's biggest clubs in the space of a few weeks. With the likes of Afobe firing on all cylinders, they will be hoping to continue their impressive form and make a real impact in both the League One and the Capital One Cup this season.
