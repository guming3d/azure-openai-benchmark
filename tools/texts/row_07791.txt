article: (CNN) -- Portugal winger Nani has been ruled out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with a collar bone injury. Nani, who plays for English premier League side Manchester United, suffered the injury in a training session with his national side in Portugal, before leaving for the tournament which begins on June 11. Nani's injury was not immediately levelheaded by coach Carlos Queiroz, but the Portuguese football association announced that the winger would not be taking part in the World Cup on their official Web site on Monday. "After daily assessment of the evolution of the injury, including the carrying out of complementary exams, we have concluded that Nani was not able to compete," a statement read. Nani will be replaced in the squad by Benfica midfielder Ruben Amorin, ahead of Portugal's first match against Ivory Coast in Port Elizabeth on 15 June. With Nani watching from the stands, Portugal labored to a 3-0 victory Mozambique in their final warm-up game in Johannesburg on Tuesday. After a goalless first half, Danny collected a pass from Deco to open the scoring in the 51st minute, before striker Hugo Almeida came off the bench to score twice. Nani is the latest Premier League player to succumb to injury in the build-up to the finals. Chelsea duo Michael Essien of  Ghana and John Obi Mikel of Nigeria, and Manchester United's England Captain Rio Ferdinand, are also missing the showpiece. Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who also plays for Premier League champions Chelsea, is a doubt for the tournament after breaking his arm in his team's friendly against Japan on Friday. Meanwhile, European champions Spain warmed up for South Africa in style with a 6-0 thrashing of Poland. Winger David Silva and striker David Villa made it 2-0 at half-time before Xabi Alonso added a third early in the second period. Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres both marked their returns from injury by coming off the bench to score and Pedro added a sixth ten minutes before full-time. But many people's World Cup favorites suffered an injury scare when Barcelona star Andres Iniesta limped off after 39 minutes with a thigh injury. In other news, Switzerland defender Philippe Senderos has joined Fulham from Arsenal on a three-year contract.

chatgpt: Portugal winger Nani has been ruled out of the World Cup due to a collar bone injury, leaving his team to prepare for the tournament without one of their most experienced players. Nani joins a growing list of Premier League stars withdrawing from the tournament due to injury.  The news of Nani's injury broke after Portugal's final warm-up game before the World Cup. The team secured a comfortable 3-0 victory over Mozambique, but manager Fernando Santos will be disappointed to lose one of his key players to injury.  Nani, who plays for Orlando City in the MLS, was expected to be an important player for Portugal, bringing skill and experience to the team. The 34-year-old has made over 100 appearances for his country, scoring 24 goals in the process.  Meanwhile, Spain recorded an emphatic 6-0 victory over Poland in another World Cup warm-up match. However, the victory was overshadowed by an injury to Andres Iniesta, who was substituted in the first half. Iniesta, who plays for Japanese club Vissel Kobe, is one of the most decorated players in Spanish football history. He has won multiple domestic and international trophies with Barcelona and Spain.  Iniesta's injury will be a concern for Spain manager Luis Enrique, as the team prepares to defend their World Cup title. The 37-year-old is a crucial part of the Spanish midfield, providing creativity and leadership on the pitch. The extent of the injury is not yet known, but fans will be hoping that the veteran midfielder will recover in time for the tournament.  Both Portugal and Spain are expected to challenge for the World Cup, but injuries to key players could hinder their chances. Nani and Iniesta are just two examples of the toll that the long and grueling football season can take on players' bodies.  As the World Cup draws closer, teams will need to ensure that their players are fit and healthy to compete at the highest level. With so many Premier League stars already ruled out of the tournament, it is crucial that teams take extra precautions to prevent further injuries.  Time will tell how much of an impact Nani's absence and Iniesta's injury will have on their respective teams. The World Cup is a tough and unforgiving competition, and every player will need to be at their best if they hope to lift the trophy at the end of the tournament.
