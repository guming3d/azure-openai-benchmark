article: Headstones were pushed over and vandalised with swastikas by racist thugs in a sickening attack on a Jewish cemetery. Blackley Jewish Cemetery in Manchester was hit between 4pm on Sunday, June 22 and 3.30pm the following day, when the sickening damage was discovered. Two 13-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence on Friday. Racist: Nazi swastikas were scrawled on headstones at a Jewish ceremony in Manchester. Headstones were also pushed over and smashed in the attack . Now the defiant community has rallied around to clean up the cemetery. More than 100 people from different walks of life came together to help restore the site after the disgusting attack. Harry Johnston, who helped organise yesterday’s clear-up, said it was a ‘heartwarming’ event to be involved in. He added: 'These people have done a sterling job. We’ve had people from all different walks of society here - including Muslims, Christians and volunteers from Greater Manchester Police. 'A chap in a dog collar brought a whole bunch of people straight from a service down the road. 'It has been a really uplifting thing to watch a community battered into the floor again coil up like a spring and come back flying.' One grave was vandalised with a white power symbol and 'Kampf', likely a reference to Adolf Hitler's book. Right, Harry Johnston, from the North Manchester Jewish Cemeteries Trust charity, inspects the damage . Mr Johnston, from the North Manchester Jewish Cemeteries Trust (NMJCT) charity, said organisers had only expected around 20 people to show up - so were overwhelmed by the turnout. He added that so many people came that there was not enough cleaning equipment to go round - so the work had to be done in shifts. The volunteers cleaned up the grounds of the cemetery, on Rochdale Road in Blackley, and cleared away items that had been dumped there including a refrigerator, a settee and a mattress. Two 13-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence on Friday . Hope: A huge clean-up operation was held at the Jewish cemetery, with volunteers from numerous faiths . So many people volunteered that there was not enough cleaning equipment to go round - so the work had to be done in shifts . The damage to the headstones will take longer to repair and is the responsibility of the families affected. But Mr Johnston said wrecked children’s graves from the 1900s would be paid for by NMJCT. He added: 'I was extremely upset by the attack and felt terrible for the families turning up after it happened. But the community has come out on top.' The two teenagers have been bailed until July 25 pending further inquiries. Anyone with information can call police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

chatgpt: Headstones have been shattered and scrawled on at the Manchester cemetery, leading to shock and outrage among the local community. The destruction of the cemetery is a senseless act of vandalism that has no place in any civilized society. Two 13-year-old boys have been arrested in connection to the incident, and it is hoped that justice will be served promptly. The cemetery, like many others across the country, is a place of solemn mourning and reflection for the loved ones that are buried there. The destruction of the headstones is a clear lack of respect for the dead and their families. It is a stain on the community and a reflection of the increasing lack of empathy and morality in society. Despite the sadness and anger that many are feeling, there is still hope to be found in the community response that has followed the vandalism. People of many different faiths have rallied together to clean up the site and show solidarity with those who are grieving. This response is a testament to the fact that despite the terrible actions of a few, the vast majority of people still have a strong sense of compassion and humanity. One of the key messages that has emerged from this incident is the importance of respect for the dead. While it may be tempting to brush off incidents like this as the work of misguided youth, vandalism of this kind has far-reaching consequences. It sends a message that the dead are not deserving of our respect and that their final resting place is fair game for destruction. This is simply unacceptable. The arrest of two 13-year-old boys in connection with the incident is a stark reminder that actions have consequences. While it is not clear what motivated these boys to vandalize the cemetery, it is hoped that their punishment will send a strong message to others who may be considering similar actions. The response of the community to the vandalism is also significant in other ways. It shows that people from different backgrounds and of different faiths can come together in times of crisis to support one another. This is a powerful message that is sorely needed in today's world, where division and hatred seem to be growing. As the community comes together to clean up the cemetery and show their support, it is important to remember the importance of empathy and compassion. While we may not always agree on everything, we can still treat each other with dignity and respect. This is especially true when it comes to the dead, who cannot speak for themselves and who deserve our reverence. In the end, the vandalism at the Manchester cemetery is a stark reminder of the need for greater respect and empathy in society. As we move forward, it is important to remember the lessons that can be learned from this incident and to strive for a better, more compassionate world. The community response to the vandalism is a hopeful sign that this is possible and that we can work together to create a better future for all.
