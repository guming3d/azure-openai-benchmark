'At that time, both males fired their weapons toward store employees as they ran out the door.' Some shots hit a mannequin and others shattered the glass front door. A total of 11 shots were fired, police said. However the trio left empty handed. Fortunately neither of the two employees in the novelty shop were hurt. One hid when the men came in and the other happened to be in a back room at the time. After surveillance footage was turned over to authorities, the 16-year-old carrying the rifle was arrested May 30. The lookout was then arrested on June 4. The second 15-year-old, who was holding the revolver, was arrested July 24. All three were charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly robbery and remain at the Harris County Juvenile Detention Center. 'These are by far the clumsiest crooks I've seen in a long time,' Jeff Brieden, an HPD investigator in the Robbery Division, told The Houston Chronicle. 'They were unpredictable in the robbery. They fired without regard to anyone.'

chatgpt: A 24-hour adult store in Houston, Texas, Katz Boutique, became the target of a robbery in the early morning hours of last week when three teenagers, one aged 16 and two aged 15, entered the store at around 3am. According to sources, the trio entered the store with the intention of stealing from the cash drawer. However, they were unable to find any cash in the drawer and left the store empty-handed. Upon leaving the store, the teenagers fired 11 shots back into the store, but thankfully, no one was injured. Although the suspects would have thought they'd gotten away with it, they were far from the end of their ordeal. Law enforcement authorities in Houston were quick to investigate the incident and managed to arrest all three suspects recently. After their arrest, the teenagers confessed to their involvement in the attempted robbery and shooting at the store. While the motive for the robbery remains unclear, it is believed that the teenagers may have been motivated by a desire to obtain quick cash. In connection with the incident, the trio is facing various charges such as attempted robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and weapons possession. The suspects, whose names have not been released, will be tried in juvenile court later this year. While the folks at Katz Boutique are understandably shaken by the incident, they are relieved that nobody was hurt in the shooting. The store has, however, made changes to its security measures to avoid any such incidents from occurring in the future. In recent years, there has been a steady increase in the number of crimes committed by teenagers in Houston, particularly involving armed robbery and other violent offenses. While the issue is complex, authorities are working to address the root causes of these crimes, including poverty, lack of educational opportunities, and gang involvement. In conclusion, the attempted robbery at Katz Boutique is a stark reminder of the need for improved security measures in retail establishments, particularly those that operate 24 hours a day. Thankfully, the suspects have been apprehended and the store is taking steps to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. It is up to law enforcement authorities, however, to tackle the underlying causes of such crimes and prevent them from happening in the first place.
