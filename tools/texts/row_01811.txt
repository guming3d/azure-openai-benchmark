article: (CNN) -- A fiery crash in California left a sports car almost completely unrecognizable and its occupants lucky to be alive. The 2002 Ferrari crashed in Calabasas on Friday night after veering off a road, hitting two trees. A California Highway Patrol news release says Edmond Evan Aslin, 44, was driving the black Ferrari at a high rate of speed around 10 p.m., when the car veered to the left. The car then entered a grass median, struck two trees and continued into the opposite lanes before coming to a stop. No other vehicles were involved in the crash. During the accident, the car burst into flames. The crash left behind the twisted and charred remnants of the vehicle. The CHP report says the driver is hospitalized with major injuries at West Hills Hospital and his passenger escaped with moderate injuries. It's unclear what caused the driver to lose control of his car. Ferrari is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer founded by Enzo Ferrari. The company, famous for its Formula 1 vehicles, started building street-legal versions in 1947. The cars typically cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, with some fetching more than a million dollars. The cars are also highly collectible. Earlier this year, a 1962-63 Ferrari GTO Berlinetta was sold in California for $38 million, the most ever paid for a car at auction.

chatgpt: Two people survived a serious highway crash in Southern California on Monday morning. The accident resulted in an expensive luxury car going up in flames. According to the police, no other vehicles were involved in the incident. The accident occurred around 9:00 AM on Monday on the southbound lanes of Interstate 5 near Irvine. The luxury car, a Lamborghini Aventador, was reportedly traveling at high speed when the driver lost control and crashed into the center divider. The impact caused the car to burst into flames, trapping the occupants inside. Fortunately, both occupants were able to escape with only minor injuries before the car became engulfed in flames. They were transported to a nearby hospital for treatment. The cause of the accident remains under investigation, but it is believed that excessive speed was a contributing factor. Pictures from the scene of the accident show the charred remains of the car, which is valued at over $400,000. The car was completely destroyed by the fire, leaving nothing but a twisted and burned hulk. The incident caused significant traffic delays on the interstate, with all southbound lanes closed for several hours while authorities worked to clear the scene. Traffic was diverted onto side streets while the cleanup operation was underway. This accident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of excessive speed while driving. While the occupants in this case were fortunate to escape with their lives, the consequences of such crashes are frequently far more severe.
