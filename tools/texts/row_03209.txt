The skies of Arizona were lit up on Tuesday as a large meteor exploded across the night. The large rock, which was described by witnesses as having a slightly orange bright glow, exploded in the sky, rattling houses in Tucson, causing some concern among residents, who flood local TV stations with worried. 'We were eating dinner and heard a good bang that rattled the roof of our house,'Â  Astronomer Tod Lauer posted to Facebook, CNN reported. Scroll down for video . Arizona residents reported hearing a 'large bang' on Tuesday night - raising concerns for many - before a bright white meteor shot across the sky, similiar to this stock image. Scientists are trying to work out whether it landed . Social media also erupted, with hundreds of people from Las Vegas to Tucson reporting a bright object streaking across the horizon. Scientists are now trying to work if and where the meteor landed so it can be examined. Mesa resident John Duhigg captured the event on the dash cam in his car. In the video, which was posted to YouTube, Duhigg said he was driving near the Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airway around 7:11 pm. ABC15 Chief Meteorologist Amber Sullins said the meteor was likely part of a rare outburst of the Andromedids meteor shower. The Andromedids are showers that occur, usually around November, as the Earth passes through old streams of the comet 3D/Biela. The explosion also shook the house of Tony Kubrak, who told CNN he went outside to see what the commotion was. 'I see this tremendous, white, bright light in the western sky,' he said. 'And it was just ... it was absolutely enormous, I couldn't believe it.' The sighting comes a few days out from the annual Geminid meteor, which officially starts Thursday. It carries a maximum of 100 to 120 meteors per hour at its peak, which is expected to happen Friday night. ASA has said this years Geminid will be 'rich in fire balls'. They can be viewed best from 11 pm to 3 am ET. 'Of all the debris streams Earth passes through every year, the Geminids are by far the most massive,' said NASA astronomer Bill Cooke. 'When we add up the amount of dust in the Geminid stream, it outweighs other streams by factors of 5 to 500.' NASA calls it the' 900-pound gorilla of meteor showers'. Most meteor showers are caused by comets, but not Geminid, which contains the name of the constellation Gemini. A large space rock called 3200 Pheathon flings the debris that makes the sparkling storm in the sky. A Perseid streaks across the sky over the Mojave Desert in Landers, California, USA, on August 12, 2013. The Perseid meteor shower occurs every year in August when the Earth passes through debris and dust of the Swift-Tuttle comet .

chatgpt: A massive bright white meteor exploded over the skies of several Arizona cities on Tuesday night, leaving the residents stunned and a little concerned. Witnesses reported that the fireball was 'absolutely enormous' and described it as a bright white light that lit up the skies for several seconds before it exploded into a spectacular explosion. Some concerned locals even called in to report that they heard a loud bang and felt their houses rattling at the exact time of the explosion.  According to experts, the meteor was most likely a random event and not related to the upcoming Geminid meteor shower, which is set to mark its arrival on Thursday night. "The meteor was probably not part of the Geminid meteor shower, which is the largest meteor shower of the year," said Dr. Jennifer Johnson, an astronomer at Ohio State University. "But it was a spectacular event nonetheless, and we are all excited to learn more about it." Scientists are now evaluating the event and trying to determine where exactly the meteor landed. According to the local authorities, there have been no reports of any injuries or property damage so far, but some people who witnessed the explosion have expressed concerns that it could have landed in a populated area.  Meanwhile, astronomy enthusiasts and keen stargazers are gearing up for the Geminid meteor shower, which is expected to peak on Friday night. The annual event, which is also known as the 'King of Meteor Showers' is one of the most spectacular astronomical events of the year. The shower is named after the constellation Gemini, and it occurs when the Earth passes through the debris left behind by the asteroid 3200 Phaethon. The Geminid meteor shower is known for producing a large number of meteors, with up to 120 meteors per hour expected to light up the skies over the next few days. To make the most of this amazing event, astronomers and enthusiasts are advised to find a location with clear skies, away from any light pollution.  "This year's Geminid meteor shower is expected to be one of the best in recent years," said Dr. Johnson. "The moon will be just a crescent this week, so the skies will be dark, making it an ideal time to view the meteor shower." Overall, the recent meteor explosion in Arizona has been a reminder of the spectacular and unpredictable nature of our universe. As scientists continue to analyze the data collected from this event, astronomy enthusiasts and stargazers around the world are looking forward to the Geminid meteor shower and the chance to witness one of the most awe-inspiring astronomical events of the year.
