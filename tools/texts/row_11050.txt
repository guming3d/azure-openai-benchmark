And it is more common than shoving a dummy in their mouth or giving them a soft toy or even a bottle in these high tech times.

chatgpt: A recent study has revealed that 10% of parents allow their toddlers to play on their phones for up to two hours. The study also found that Scottish mothers are the most likely to entertain their babies with smartphones. In contrast, only nine percent of parents give their babies dummies. The study was conducted by the Childwise research agency and surveyed over 1,000 parents with children aged zero to four. The results showed that while smartphones and tablets can be valuable educational tools, excessive screen time at a young age can be detrimental to a child's development. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children under the age of 2 should avoid all screen time, apart from video-chatting with family and friends. However, in today's digital age, it might be hard for parents to completely restrict children's access to screens. In this study, Scottish mothers were found to be the most likely to use smartphones to entertain their babies, with 28% of them admitting to doing so. In contrast, only 15% of mothers in London reported using smartphones to entertain their babies. The study also found that parents are increasingly shunning dummies, with just 9% of parents giving them to their babies in comparison with 51% of parents in the 1970s. Researchers suggest this could be because of increased awareness of the potential harm they can cause to a child's teeth and speech development. Dr. Barbie Clarke, the managing director of Childwise, warns parents to be careful when it comes to screen time for young children. "We advise parents to be mindful of the amount and type of screen use by their children, and to balance this with plenty of real-world play and exercise," she said. It is important to note that excessive screen time at a young age can lead to obesity, sleep problems, and behavioral issues. In light of these findings, it is essential for parents to monitor and limit their children's screen time, including the use of smartphones and tablets. Overall, this study highlights the need for parents to be mindful of their child's screen time and to recognize the potential harm it can cause. By limiting screen time and encouraging more real-world play and exercise, parents can ensure their child's healthy development.
