article: Beijing (CNN) -- The Chinese government is ordering outspoken artist Ai Weiwei to pay 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) in back taxes, a move Ai calls "retaliation against a dissident." Ai said that two representatives from the Beijing tax bureau visited him Tuesday and presented him with documents from the tax authority, ordering the company FAKE Cultural Development Ltd. -- registered by Ai's wife Luqing -- to pay the taxes within 15 days. Ai, who designed the distinctive "Bird's Nest" stadium for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, said he is not even the legal representative of the company, but that police warned him Monday that as the "factual controlling person" of the company, he'd better prepare the money and pay it himself. "They told me that 'The country said that you evade tax, then you evade tax. The country won't change the verdict, so don't you ever think it will. There's nothing you can do,'" Ai said. The artist was detained in April on grounds of tax evasion. However, his family and human rights advocates believe that the real reason for his imprisonment is his criticism of the Chinese government. Ai was released on bail in June for his good attitude and medical concerns, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Local authorities held a closed hearing in July on the tax evasion allegations despite demands for an open hearing from Ai and the company's lawyers. According to the artist, authorities also declined their demand to publish the accounting records and other evidence that lead to the tax evasion charge. Ai told CNN he was initially detained and imprisoned on charges of "subversion of state power," but upon his release the charge was changed to tax evasion. "This is against judicial law, and is unethical. How can a country use this way to try to silence dissidents?" he asked. Ai said he'll consult with the lawyers on the next step, but so far there is no clear plan for him regarding how to pay the tax or if he is going to appeal. "The verdict is not reasonable, but we have to obey," Ai said. "If the government is not reasonable, no one can resist it." "China always uses tax issues to cover up political issues. If the government keeps taking revenge on its dissidents with the law, it will only lead the country to its opposite side," Ai said.

chatgpt: Beijing Olympics architect and renowned artist, Ai Weiwei, has been slapped with a tax bill of 13.2 million yuan ($1.94 million), sparking controversy regarding the artist's freedom of expression. The charges have been labelled as "retaliation" by the Chinese artist, who designed the iconic "Bird's Nest" stadium where the opening and closing ceremonies were held in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  Ai Weiwei believes that the tax charges are a direct result of his open criticism of the Chinese government and the regime's handling of national affairs. The artist has been a vocal critic of the Chinese government's censorship of free speech and human rights abuses. Although no official statement has been released by the Chinese authorities, many believe that the charges have been politically motivated. Speaking to reporters, Ai Weiwei stated that he is unsure whether he will appeal the order, as he believes that it will likely fall on deaf ears. "If I appeal, it's meaningless. They will just go through the motions, and they will not change the verdict," he said.  The news of the tax charges has sparked outcry amongst the international art community, with many expressing their support for Ai Weiwei. Critics have accused the Chinese government of suppressing freedom of expression and using taxation as a tool to punish those who speak out against the government.  In a statement, the Human Rights Watch called on the Chinese authorities to reverse the tax bill immediately. "This tax bill is just another tactic used by the Chinese government to silence dissenting voices," said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch. "Ai Weiwei has been a champion for human rights in China, and this is just another attempt to intimidate him and others who speak out against the government." This isn't the first time that Ai Weiwei has faced persecution from the Chinese government. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days without charge, leading to public outcry from the international community. Despite facing persecution, Ai Weiwei has continued to use his platform as an artist to raise awareness about human rights abuses and government censorship in China. The global art community has come out in support of Ai Weiwei, with many calling on the Chinese government to allow free speech and expression. Supporters of Ai Weiwei have taken to social media, using hashtags such as #FreeAiWeiwei and #SupportAiWeiwei to spread awareness about the situation.  As it stands, Ai Weiwei's fate is uncertain. The artist's supporters remain hopeful that the Chinese government will reverse the tax bill and allow him to continue his work as a champion for human rights and free expression in China.
