article: Tougher: Rachel Reeves has said a Labour government would crack down on unemployment by introducing a guaranteed jobs scheme . Labour will be tougher than the Tories on the long-term unemployed in a bid to slash Britain's giant welfare bill, the new shadow work and pensions secretary has said. Rachel Reeves, who replaced Liam Byrne last week following Ed Miliband's frontbench reshuffle, said under a Labour government those who have been out of work for long periods of time would have to take a guaranteed job offer or face losing their benefits. The guaranteed job scheme proposed by Labour would offer under-25s work if they have been unemployed for one year. Over-25s would have to take a job after two years of unemployment. The scheme would be paid for by reintroducing a tax on bankers' bonuses. The former Bank of England economist claims the scheme would take 230,000 people off benefits. In her new role, the 34-year-old also said she has three main priorities - to show people Labour is on the side of the 'ordinary people'; to force work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith to admit his introduction of a new benefit system was a failure and to promote a new Labour vision of 'responsibility, decency and fairness'. According to Miss Reeves, the government is spending Â£9billion more now on social security yet more people are unemployed, on housing benefit and 4.8million are being paid less than the living wage. She told The Observer: 'If you can work you should be working and under our compulsory jobs guarantee if you refuse that job you forgo your benefits. Rachel Reeves has said the introduction of Iain Duncan Smith's new benefit system was a failure after she replaced Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary (right) 'We have got some really good great policies - particularly around the jobs guarantee and cancelling the bedroom tax - that show we are tough and will not allow people to linger on the benefits, but also that we are fair.' Last . week all three party leaders wielded the axe as they fired key . figures from their frontbench to promote the team that will take them . into the general election. Ed .

Last month Miss Reeves was branded 'boring, snoring' by the editor of Newsnight. Ian Katz was forced to issue a series of humbling public aplogies after he slurred Miss Reeves to 26,000 followers.

chatgpt: Last week, Rachel Reeves was appointed as the new shadow work and pensions secretary, replacing Liam Byrne. The 34-year-old has already announced that she plans to introduce a scheme that would offer jobs to those who have been out of work for a long period of time, or otherwise risk losing their benefits. Reeves believes that this scheme is necessary to help tackle the high levels of unemployment in the UK, particularly among the long-term unemployed. She has stated that the scheme would be funded by introducing a tax on bankers' bonuses, which could potentially generate a significant amount of revenue. The proposal has received mixed reactions from both politicians and the public. Some have praised Reeves for her efforts to address unemployment issues, while others have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the scheme and the potential impact of the tax on the banking industry. In a recent interview, Reeves defended her proposal, stating that it is crucial to ensure that individuals are given the opportunity to work and contribute to society, rather than relying on benefits. She noted that there are many people who are struggling to find work and that offering them job opportunities would not only benefit them but also the wider economy. However, critics argue that the scheme is unlikely to be effective in getting people back into work, citing the high levels of competition for job opportunities and the potential for individuals to quickly lose their new jobs. Additionally, they argue that the tax on bankers' bonuses could create a backlash from the banking industry and result in job losses in that sector. Despite these concerns, Reeves remains committed to her proposal and has stated that she will work to ensure that it is implemented effectively. She has urged other politicians to support her in this effort and to recognize the importance of tackling unemployment issues in the UK. Overall, Reeves' proposal to offer job opportunities to the long-term unemployed and fund it through a tax on bankers' bonuses represents a bold vision for addressing unemployment issues in the UK. While the proposal is not without its challenges and detractors, it is an important step towards ensuring that individuals are given the opportunity to work and contribute to society. As such, it will continue to be a topic of debate and discussion in the coming months and years.
