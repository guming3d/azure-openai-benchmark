article: (CNN) -- A human rights group issued a new report detailing the widespread practice of female circumcisions in Iraqi Kurdistan, calling on Kurdish authorities to outlaw it. The 73-page report, released Wednesday by the group Human Rights Watch, cites previous studies estimating the circumcision rate for young women to range from 41 percent in a smaller sample of women up to 80 percent in larger studies. The Kurdish government does not keep statistics on female circumcisions or post-operative medial consequences. Human Rights Watch refers to the circumcisions as "female genital mutilation." The procedure involves partial or total removal of the clitoris, and is also known as clitoridectomy. The report describes the pain, fear, and physical and emotional distress that girls experience as they undergo the procedure. Although Islam does not mandate female circumcisions, some girls say it comes from the belief that anything they touch is unclean "until they go through this painful procedure," according to the group. Critics say the intent is to oppress women, and to curtail female sexual desire, even if the surgery poses a health risk. The report, entitled " 'They Took Me and Told Me Nothing:' Female Genital Mutilation in Iraqi Kurdistan," describes the pain and fear the girls and young women endure as they undergo the procedure, and the physical and emotional distress suffered afterward. It calls on the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government to ban the practice. "FGM violates women's and children's rights, including their rights to life, health, and bodily integrity," said Nadya Khalife, Middle East women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. "It's time for the regional government to step up to the plate and take concrete actions to eliminate this harmful practice because it simply won't go away on its own." The authors interviewed Baxcha A., 22-year-old Kurdish married woman, in 2009. "I was five," said Baxcha. "My mother took us, me and my sister, to a midwife, and I ran away. They [later] held me by force and removed a piece of flesh from my body. They opened up my legs, and it was very painful. They put water and then ash on the wound." The report says the previous regional government in Kurdistan decreed that anyone performing female circumcisions should be arrested and punished, but Human Rights Watch says it found no evidence the law is being enforced. The group acknowledged it won't be easy to change long-existing mindsets and traditions. "Eradicating it in Iraqi Kurdistan will require strong and dedicated leadership on the part of the regional government, including a clear message that FGM will no longer be tolerated," Khalife said.

chatgpt: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called on authorities in Iraqi Kurdistan to ban female circumcision, also known as female genital mutilation or cutting. Critics have argued that the practice oppresses women and girls. A report released by HRW highlighted the devastating consequences that arise from female circumcision. The report warned that the practice is deeply rooted in some communities and is often seen as a rite of passage. However, the procedure can cause severe physical and psychological trauma and is a violation of the human rights of women and girls. The report documents the personal story of a victim who described experiencing forced female circumcision at the age of 5. The victim was subjected to a procedure that involved cutting her clitoris and other genital parts. She expressed that she suffered unbearable pain, stitching, and scarring. This particular case demonstrates how even young girls are subjected to the practice, which often leads to lifelong physical and emotional scarring. Critics argue that female circumcision is a violation of human rights and an oppression against women. Many advocates consider the practice a form of gender-based violence, which can lead to psychological harm, long-term pain, and complications such as infections, painful menstruation, childbirth complications, and even death. The report calls for a clear message from authorities against the practice. According to researchers, the Kurdistan government has in the past made attempts to prevent female circumcision. However, end-users continue to engage in the practice, despite the prohibition. The report highlights the need for comprehensive legislation against female circumcision and increased awareness campaigns to promote the understanding of the damaging effects of the procedure. According to a 2014 United Nations report, an estimated 200 million girls and women have undergone female circumcision globally. Moreover, the study predicted that by 2030, the number will increase to 86 million in sub-Saharan Africa alone. The Kurdistan region has not been excluded from female circumcision practices, and the report aims to shed light on the negative impacts that persist in the region. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines female circumcision as any procedure that involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or injury to the female genital organs due to non-medical reasons. The WHO further classifies female circumcision as a human rights violation, which requires immediate attention from state actors and civil societies. The HRW calls on the Kurdistan government to take urgent measures to end female circumcision effectively. The organization also urged the international community to support Kurdistan authorities initiate preventative measures, which will help realize the prohibition of female genital mutilation or female circumcision. In conclusion, there is a need for the Kurdistan government and communities to collaborate in ending female circumcision in the region. The voices of victims must be heard to promote justice and advocacy against the practice. The HRW report presents a warning against female circumcision, and its findings should inspire action from the Kurdistan government and the international community to implement policies to end the practice.
