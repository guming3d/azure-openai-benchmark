article: Emergency services have been left red faced after being led on a wild goose chase following two hoax distress calls, about a plane that had crashed because of faulty landing gear. It's believed a man, called up the Brisbane air traffic control centre just before noon on Monday and pretended he was a pilot before proceeding to tell operators there were problems with his equipment on board. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the man's voice was slow and slurred in the recording of communication obtained by Fairfax Media. The controller was heard trying to keep the unknown man calm, before advising him to try to land at the Sunshine coast where emergency personnel would be waiting. A man called the Brisbane air traffic control centre (pictured) pretending to be a pilot claimed he was about to crash because of faulty landing gear. After hours of searching for the plane emergency services discovered the call was a hoax . The distressing call caused a frantic rush from police and emergency services, to locate the supposed plane or wreckage, including a rescue helicopter and even commercial airlines, including a Singapore airlines plane (pictured) to look out for any sign of the aircraft . But the recording suddenly got heated with the man claiming he had a warning in his engine. 'Not good. I've got a fire warning, it's getting difficult to fly,' said the man. 'We're gone, tell them I love them, we're gone.' The distressing call caused a frantic rush from police and emergency services, to locate the supposed plane or wreckage, including a rescue helicopter and even commercial airlines to look out for any sign of the aircraft. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority have said they passed the information onto the Queensland police to investigate . After hours of searching for the apparent plane and wreckage, nothing was found. But controllers did however get another strange call, this time from a pilot flying another plane named 'Wedgetail' according to the Sydney Morning Herald. It's believed the man, who tried to change his identity, was in fact the same man who made the first call and proceeded to tell operators that he was searching for the wreckage of the plane. 'We have got contact of interest, a boat, and are watching it very closely,' he said. But by this time authorities were ignoring the call, aware that it was in fact another hoax call. It's believed the Australian Maritime Safety Authority have passed information onto the Queensland police to investigate. Last month Queensland police issued a media release saying that the Queensland emergency services often receive hoax calls or prank calls. They said the valuable time spent attending the calls places a huge drain on resources. The release also said 'while Emergency Services are attending your prank call, somewhere someone else could be losing the valuable time they need to get assistance.' It reminds people that hoax calls to emergency services is an offence.

chatgpt: Emergency service crews are conducting a search and rescue mission in Queensland after a hoax distress call claimed that a plane was about to crash. The Brisbane air traffic control centre received a call from a man pretending to be a pilot who said there was a problem with the plane's landing gear. The controller on duty immediately instructed the alleged pilot to attempt a landing near Sunshine Coast. Emergency services were alerted and dispatched to the scene where they began a search and rescue operation. However, it soon became clear that this was just a hoax call, as there was no wreckage or victims to be found. To add to the confusion, a second call was made to the air traffic control centre, believed to be from the same individual, claiming he was searching for the wreckage. The identity of the hoax caller remains unknown, but authorities believe that the person responsible is likely to be charged with making a false report. The incident has prompted widespread concern about the impact of such calls. Emergency services, including police, fire and ambulance workers, have stressed the importance of using emergency services responsibly and only when genuinely needed. Hoax or fake calls divert critical resources away from genuine emergencies and put lives at risk. Queensland authorities have confirmed that they are aware of the hoax calls and are investigating the situation. It is not yet known what charges, if any, the hoax caller could face. As news of the hoax spread, many people have expressed their outrage and frustration on social media. One user said: "Such irresponsible behavior is beyond words. It is high time the strictest punishment is given to such people who make hoax emergency calls. They are risking lives, wasting resources, and causing severe delays in genuine emergency situations." Another user added: "It is alarming to see how some people think that playing a prank like this is funny. They must be made to understand the gravity of their actions, and strict and prompt actions must be taken against them to deter such behavior." Many people agreed that raising awareness about the consequences of such criminal behavior is necessary, and strict punishments must be in place to deter individuals from making fake emergency calls. The incident serves as a reminder of how critical it is to use emergency services responsibly and to avoid making hoax or fake calls. People should only call emergency services when a genuine issue arises, and everyone must respect the hard work of emergency service workers who are dedicated to saving lives and keeping the community safe. In conclusion, making a fake emergency call is a severe criminal offense that can have serious consequences. The hoax caller in this incident could face charges for wasting emergency services' time and resources, and Queensland authorities must take strict action against this kind of behavior. It's a lesson to society that people must use emergency services responsibly and should not play pranks that waste resources and put lives at risk.
