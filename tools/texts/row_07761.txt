Rant: A busking trumpeter in New York was subjected to a four-minute expletive-laden verbal attack . Abuse: The unnamed man continually told the musician that he sucked and demanded that he left the area . The clip begins with the passer-by telling the street musician in no uncertain terms to vacate the area. He said: ‘You suck! Get out. Get the f*** out of my neighbourhood. You’re a mediocre piece of s***. Get the f***out. How dare you come down here and do this.’ The musician wearily leans against a wall during the verbal abuse and at one point plays a few notes on his instrument, but gives up when the unnamed passer-by makes to hit him with a bag. Anger: The trumpet player initially tries to argue back but eventually just waits for the passer-by to finish his outburst . Frustration: After a short while the man pauses long enough to throw his bag down in anger . The trumpeter, after asking the irate man to leave, walks away out of shot but this does nothing to appease his attacker, who stands in front of the person filming and carries on shouting. He said: ‘You any kind of artist? Anybody know who you are? You’re a no-talent piece of s***. How dare you come down here and do this. You’re a disgrace. Who the hell do you think you are? You any kind of artist? This is one of the most important places in North America. ‘You're no artist. You obviously don't have any talent. An artist respects the silence. It serves the foundation of creativity. You don’t have enough respect for yourself. ‘I’m an NYU Phil school graduate, sucker. You suck! If you really had talent you’d go practice and get yourself a gig instead of ruining the end of the day for everybody down here. You’re everything that’s gone wrong in this world.' He added: ‘You’re a mediocre piece of s*** and I’ve earned my right to say it. 'I walked Bob Dylan up on stage. Who the f*** are you? I knew the Grateful Dead from 1966. You are nothing. You'll never be anything. How dare you! Shame on you. You little pimp. You're flat. You can't even carry a note.'
