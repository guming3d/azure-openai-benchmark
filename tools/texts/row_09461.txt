chatgpt: Tragedy struck Maharashtra on Friday afternoon when a bus carrying around 40 passengers plunged into a 120-metre gorge near Malshej Ghat. The incident occurred when the driver of the bus hit a lorry while driving on a mountain road. Eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud crash, followed by the vehicle splitting open as it hit the ground. The accident was so severe that at least 30 people lost their lives, and several others were injured. The injured were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. The incident left the entire nation in shock and disbelief. Recounting the events of the incident, a police official said that the driver of the bus lost control of the vehicle after hitting the lorry. The bus then fell into the gorge and split open as it hit the ground. The rescue operation was challenging due to the remote location of the accident site and the difficult terrain of the area. The official confirmed that at least 30 people had lost their lives, and two or three others were still unaccounted for as of late last night. Rescue teams, including police officials and local volunteers, worked tirelessly to reach the victims and extract them from the wreckage. Speaking to reporters, a survivor who had escaped with minor injuries, said that the passengers on the bus had no warning of the impending disaster. He added that the bus was travelling at a high speed and had no time to brake or avoid the collision. The incident has once again highlighted the need for better road safety measures and regulations in the country. Over the years, India has witnessed a sharp rise in the number of road accidents, many of which are caused due to reckless driving, poor road conditions, and insufficient safety measures. Responding to the news of the accident, several politicians and leaders expressed their condolences to the families of the victims. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, “Pained by the loss of lives due to a road accident in Maharashtra’s Malshej Ghat. My condolences to the bereaved families. May the injured recover at the earliest.” The incident has reminded the nation of the importance of safety on the roads, and the need for stricter regulations and enforcement measures to prevent such tragedies in the future. It is hoped that the government will take necessary steps to ensure that such accidents do not occur, and that those affected receive the support they require to recover from this traumatic experience.
