article: (CNN) -- The number of suspected heat-related deaths reported by health officials across the South and Midwest in the past week reached at least nine Wednesday as temperatures continued to hit triple digits. The health department of Kansas City, Missouri, said Wednesday that the Jackson County Medical Examiner was investigating the city's fourth suspected heat-related death since Friday. In Tennessee, Shelby County Medical Examiner Karen E. Chancellor said a 77-year-old man was found dead Tuesday evening in his Memphis home. His death resulted from natural causes, but heat was ruled to be a contributing factor. In Bartlett, Tennessee, a 67-year-old man collapsed in his yard Friday while mowing the lawn, Chancellor said. He died from chronic illnesses but heat exposure was ruled to be a contributing factor. In Mississippi, a 48-year-old Gulfport man died of heat exposure Monday, according to the county coroner. The man was working on road construction and "had cramped in the upper extremities," said Jackson County, Mississippi, Coroner Vicki Broadus. "It was his first day on the job as a concrete smoother." And an 81-year-old Monroe County, Mississippi, woman also died of heat stroke on Saturday, said Monroe County Coroner Alan Gurley. The Alabama Department of Health said one man died of heat exposure last week. No other information was available. The National Weather Service said heat advisories and excessive heat warnings are in effect from the southern and central plains through the lower Mississippi and Tennessee river valleys. The heat index -- what the temperature feels like when combined with the humidity -- is soaring across much of the South. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said that at 10 a.m. Wednesday the index in Memphis, Tennessee, was at 108 degrees; Little Rock, Arkansas, was at 106; and Jackson, Mississippi, was at 104. Morris said the heat indices could peak around 120 degrees later Wednesday. Those at greater risk of heat-related illness include infants and young children, people 65 or older and those who are already ill, especially with heart disease or high blood pressure. Some helpful tips for cooling off from the Jackson County, Missouri, government website: . -- Avoid liquids containing alcohol or caffeine. -- Schedule outdoor activities before noon or in the evening. -- When temperatures reach into the 90s, a cool shower can offer more help than a fan. -- Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, wide-brimmed hats and sunscreen. -- If you must work in the heat, monitor the condition of co-workers and ask them to do the same for you.

chatgpt: The sweltering heat wave that hit Missouri, Tennessee, and Alabama this week has been suspected to be the cause of four deaths in Missouri alone. Residents across the Midwest and Southern states are taking shelter as temperatures reached dangerous heights, with Memphis, Tennessee recording a heat index of 108 degrees on Wednesday. Among the victims of the heat wave is a man from Alabama who died from heat exposure. The authorities in the region are urging residents to take necessary precautions to avoid serious health consequences and fatalities. The National Weather Service issued heat warnings in several cities, including St. Louis and Kansas City, where temperatures approached the blistering triple digits. In Missouri, the victims of the heat wave included an elderly woman and a man in his 60s who were found dead in their homes. Another man died while working outside in the heat. The heat wave has prompted warnings from public officials and health experts, urging residents to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and to stay hydrated. Many are seeking refuge in air-conditioned spaces, such as public libraries, shopping malls, and community centers. "We want everyone to make sure they stay cool and hydrated during these extreme temperatures," said Chris Chinn, Director of the Missouri Department of Agriculture. "Check on your neighbor, check on your loved ones, and make sure you're drinking plenty of water." The heat wave also poses a threat to outdoor workers, such as construction crews and delivery drivers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued an advisory reminding employers to protect their workers from heat stress and other heat-related illnesses. “Employers must take precautions to prevent heat illness in outdoor workers," said Kurt Petermeyer, OSHA Regional Administrator in Atlanta. "It is important to allow them to take breaks and provide adequate water and shade.” In addition to the safety warnings, the heat wave is also taking its toll on energy grids, with power companies struggling to keep up with the increased demand for air conditioning. In Missouri, the electric company Ameren announced that the peak usage on Wednesday set a record for the company. The heat wave is expected to linger in the affected states for the next few days, with temperatures remaining well above average. Officials are urging residents to stay vigilant and take all necessary precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses. As the Midwest and Southern states continue to grapple with the heat wave, many are hoping for a reprieve from the oppressive heat sooner rather than later.
