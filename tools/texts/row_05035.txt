The girl was kept overnight in a police station after claiming she was raped by a man from a higher caste (file photo) A ten-year-old girl has been threatened with being stoned to death is she does not withdraw a rape claim against a neighbour from a higher caste. The family of the girl, who was detained in a women's police station alone for a night, is now under police protection amid the threats. Her mother took her to Kotwali women's police station after finding her unconscious in a field. The girl says a 35-year-old neighbour raped her, but the family says they are under pressure to drop the claim and accept a settlement instead. The mother told the Indian Express: 'They have been threatening to kill us, burn down our ancestral home and stone my daughter to death if we do not withdraw the rape case. 'Even the village panchayat (council), including the sarpanch (leader), is in favour of the accused and is asking the family to settle the matter.' An inquiry into why the girl was jailed for the night is underway with four officers from the station, nearÂ  Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, suspended. A police superintendent told the Daily Telegraph that the girl's detention was a 'misunderstanding' while the family is under the impression it was to try to make them too scared to pursue the claim. Vaibhav Krishna, who is leading the inquiry into her overnight stay, said a man had been arrested for the alleged rape. But the man, from the Lodhe Rajputs caste, denied the allegation and claimed the girl had been scared after he told her off for picking tomatoes from a neighbour's field, ran away and made the claim. Superintendent Krishna said a medical examination was inconclusive as to whether an assault had taken place.

chatgpt: A young girl was detained overnight in a women's police station in Uttar Pradesh, leading to the suspension of four officers. The family of the girl is currently under police protection, according to recent reports. The incident occurred after the girl's neighbor, a 35-year-old man from a higher caste, was accused of raping her. The girl's family reported the incident to the police, who took her into custody at the women's police station. The officers were supposed to register the First Information Report (FIR) under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which is related to rape cases. However, the police officers failed to do so and kept the girl under detention for the entire night. The family of the girl was unaware of her whereabouts until the next morning when they went to the police station. The family members tried to inquire about the girl's situation, but the officials did not respond in a satisfactory way. Upon pressure from the family, the officers finally registered the FIR. Following the incident, the Uttar Pradesh Police Department suspended four officers involved in the case, pending further investigations. The disciplinary action was taken against PSI Archana Singh and constables Archana Saini, Pooja Chaurasia, and Neha Kumar for not registering the FIR under the relevant IPC section. The accused neighbor has vehemently denied the rape allegations leveled against him. He has even claimed foul play from the girl's family due to the ongoing land dispute. However, the victim's family has dismissed these allegations, stating that they have enough evidence to prove the accused's involvement in the case. The girl's family is currently under police protection as they fear threats from the accused party. The Uttar Pradesh Police Department has assured the family that they will be provided with adequate security until the case is resolved. Further investigations are still ongoing, and the police department has promised to bring the accused to justice if found guilty.
