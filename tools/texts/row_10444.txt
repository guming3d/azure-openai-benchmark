article: (Fast Company)  -- Following increased pressure from the FTC, Google and Mozilla are introducing opt-out features to their Chrome and Firefox browsers. Soon, users will have the option to stop personalized advertisements, ads tailored to your Web-surfing habits that have sparked significant privacy concerns. Will these new features allay privacy fears and FTC meddling? Last month, the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection proposed a "Do Not Track" tool to curb concerns over personalized or behavioral advertising. The FTC hoped the tool might be similar to the "Do Not Call" registry -- the system that deterred telemarketers from causing so many headaches -- but offered very few technical details. Such a comprehensive opt-out registry, as some have pointed out, would be difficult to implement. Unlike "Do Not Call," which relies on unique telephone numbers, "Do Not Track" could not depend on similar identifiers, as IP addresses are constantly changing. Google and Mozilla have addressed some technical issues with their features, but are far from offering streamlined opt-out systems. On Chrome, the feature is available as an extension called Keep My Opt-Outs, which enables users to save opt-out preferences even once a browser's cookies have been cleared. Before, when one's history was erased, so too was any opt-out preference. With this extension, Google has made these particular cookies permanent; however, users will still be required to opt-out of ad tracking themselves. Firefox's "Do Not Track" feature has a gaping loophole. For the tool to work, ad tracking companies essentially must opt-in to the system, and agree not to monitor web-surfing habits of users who have chosen to opt-out. Thus far, according to the Wall Street Journal, no companies have openly agreed to participate in Firefox's "Do Not Track" program, though Mozilla is urging advertisers to "honor people's choices." "Mozilla recognizes the chicken and egg problem," Alexander Folower, Mozilla's global privacy head, wrote in a blog post. And so won't many users, who are likely to realize both Google's and Mozilla's "Do Not Track" features are not comprehensive. It's also important to note that these extensions are opt-out systems, rather than opt-in. Many consumer advocacy groups and government officials have pushed for the latter feature, which would mean behavioral advertising would no longer come default -- users would have to opt-in in order to see personalized ads. If Mozilla, Google, and other browser companies don't address these concerns soon, they could face legislative mandates, as FTC chair Jon Leibowitz has threatened. And such legislation could be as annoying to them as, well, telemarketers and personalized ads are to us. Copyright © 2010 FastCompany.com, a unit of Mansueto Ventures, LLC. All rights reserved.

chatgpt: In a bid to give users more control over the ads they see on the internet, a new tool could soon be launched which allows users to stop personalized advertisements. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is currently working on the tool, which they hope will function in a similar way to the "Do Not Call" registry, providing users with an easy and effective way to block ads that they don’t want to see. Some industry experts have praised the move, calling it a "step in the right direction" for online privacy. They argue that personalized ads, which use data acquired through tracking users' online behavior, can feel invasive and annoying to many internet users. By giving people the option to opt out of such ads, the FTC could help to restore trust in online advertising and alleviate concerns about online privacy. However, there are those who doubt the efficacy of the tool. Many users may not realize that the option to stop personalized ads is not comprehensive, and may continue to see ads that are tailored to their interests based on data such as search history or location. Additionally, some experts have raised concerns about potential loopholes that could be exploited by advertisers to continue serving personalized ads to users who have opted out. Despite these concerns, the FTC remains optimistic about the new tool's potential to help users control the ads they see. Speaking to reporters earlier this week, a spokesperson for the Commission said that the tool would "bring clarity and transparency to the online advertising landscape" and would be an important step towards ensuring that users' online choices are respected by marketers. The timing of the FTC's move is notable, given recent scrutiny of online privacy practices by lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups. High-profile incidents such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal have brought concerns about data security and privacy to the forefront of the public's attention, and many tech companies are facing increasing pressure to address these concerns. For users who are interested in exercising more control over their online ad experiences, the new tool is likely to be a welcome development. And while there may be some initial confusion about its limitations, savvy internet users will likely be able to use the tool effectively to block unwanted ads and protect their online privacy. Only time will tell whether the tool is an effective solution to the privacy concerns that plague users of the web, but for those who are looking for ways to take more control over their web experience, the new tool may offer a promising solution.
