article: (CNN) -- Newcastle wasn't the opposition but there was another seven-goal classic at Anfield. Jordan Henderson scored deep in the second half to give Liverpool a 4-3 win over Swansea City, rekindling memories of the Reds' victories over Newcastle by the same score in 1996 and 1997. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wasn't afraid to say this month that his men were title contenders and with the offense flowing, his team trails Chelsea by a mere four points atop the standings. Daniel Sturridge -- second behind only teammate Luis Suarez in league scoring -- netted for an eighth straight Premier League outing to close in on Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of 10. "It was an important win for us," Rodgers told Sky Sports. "We certainly weren't at our best today but the offensive part of our game, which is very strong, came out on top again. "It's an outstanding result for us and the game typified the character of this team." Liverpool looked set to cruise when Henderson and Sturridge gave Liverpool a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes. But Swansea, under newish boss Garry Monk, didn't cave in. Jonjo Shelvey began a comeback against his former club and Wilfried Bony made it 2-2 in the 27th minute. After Sturridge and Bony traded goals -- the latter's second came via the penalty spot -- Henderson settled the affair in the 74th minute when he scored on his own rebound. A rejuvenated Henderson has been another bright spot for Rodgers this season but the defense is a worry. Defender Martin Skrtel particularly struggled Sunday, giving away the penalty when he clashed with Bony. Liverpool has conceded 35 goals, the most of any team in the top seven. "As always as a coach, you'll analyze where you can be better, and we're looking to improve (on defense) for next week," said Rodgers. The top four all won this weekend but fifth-place Tottenham suffered a blow in its chase for a Champions League spot, losing 1-0 at relegation threatened Norwich City. Loic Remy scored in second-half injury time to give Newcastle a 1-0 win against Aston Villa at home, leaving Villa, like Norwich, four points above the relegation zone.

chatgpt: Liverpool secured a 4-3 victory over Swansea on Sunday, thanks to a goal from captain Jordan Henderson. The Reds took control of the match from the very beginning, with Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana scoring two quick goals. However, Swansea didn't give up easily and managed to pull it back to 2-2 by half-time with goals from Gylfi Sigurdsson and Fernando Llorente. In the second half, Liverpool continued to dominate, and regained the lead through a stunning goal from James Milner. However, the visitors refused to roll over and scored again through Sigurdsson after some poor defending by Liverpool. It took until the final minutes of the game for the match to be decided, with Jordan Henderson unleashing a powerful shot into the bottom corner of the net. The result leaves Liverpool four points behind Premier League leader Chelsea, who won against Arsenal on Saturday. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was happy with the win, saying "It was a very difficult game. We were really good, but they were good too. It's important to win these games, especially when you're chasing the title. We just need to keep going." Elsewhere in the Premier League, Newcastle United piled more misery on Aston Villa with a late 1-0 victory. The Magpies looked to be heading for a stalemate, but a goal from Aleksandar Mitrovic secured all three points for Rafa Benitez's side. The result means Newcastle moves up to 16th place in the table, while Aston Villa remains rooted to the bottom, now ten points adrift of safety. Meanwhile, Tottenham's chances of qualifying for the Champions League suffered a setback with a 1-0 defeat to Norwich City. The game was a tight affair, but a goal from Robbie Brady was enough to secure all three points for the hosts. Tottenham remains fifth in the table, five points behind fourth-placed Manchester City. Overall, it was a busy weekend in the Premier League, with plenty of twists and turns in the title race, relegation battle and the race for the top four. With only a few more games to go, every point counts, and the pressure is on for all the teams involved.
