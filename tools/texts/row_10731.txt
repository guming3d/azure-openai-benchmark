article: An enraged Muslim mob beat a Christian couple to death in Pakistan and burnt their bodies in a brick kiln where they worked on Tuesday for allegedly desecrating a Koran, police said. The incident took place at the town of Kot Radha Kishan, some 40 miles southwest of the city of Lahore, and is the latest example of mob violence against minorities accused of blasphemy. A police officials told AFP: 'A mob attacked a Christian couple after accusing them of desecration of the holy Koran and later burnt their bodies at a brick kiln where they worked. Pakistani security officials have been placed on high alert since the married couple were killed near Lahore . A mob accused the couple of desecrating a copy of the Koran who then beat them and threw them into a kiln . The Christian couple were attacked in the town which is just 50 miles from Lahore and thrown into a kiln . 'Yesterday an incident of desecration of the holy Koran took place in the area and today the mob first beat the couple and later set their bodies on fire at a brick kiln,' he added. Another police official confirmed the incident. The victims were only identified by their first names, Shama and Shehzad, and were a married couple. Pakistan's brick kiln workers are often subject to harsh practices, with a study by the Bonded Labour Liberation Front Pakistan estimating that 4.5 million are indentured labourers. Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has constituted a three-member committee to fast track the investigation of the killings and ordered police to beef up security at Christian neighbourhoods in the province. Mohammad Asghar, left, from Glasgow, was shot last month in a Pakistani prison while he waited for his execution for blasphemy, his daughter Jasmine Rana, right, wants an investigation into her father's case . Blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in the majority Muslim country, with even unproven allegations often prompting mob violence. Anyone convicted, or even just accused, of insulting Islam, risks a violent and bloody death at the hands of vigilantes. A Christian woman has been on death row since November 2010 after she was found guilty of making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Mohammed during an argument with a Muslim woman. An elderly British man with severe mental illness, Mohammad Asghar, who was sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan in January, was shot by a prison guard last month.

chatgpt: In another horrific example of mob violence against minorities, a Christian couple was killed in Muslim-majority Pakistan after being falsely accused of desecrating the Koran. The attack occurred in Kot Radha Kishan town, where the couple worked in a brick kiln. The mob, incited by false rumors of blasphemy, burned their bodies in the kiln. The couple, identified as Shahzad Masih and his wife Shama, were parents to three children. The police have arrested over 30 people in connection with the attack, including the owner of the brick kiln. The incident has sparked outrage among human rights activists and religious minorities in Pakistan. The blasphemous allegations stem from a claim that Shahzad had burnt pages from the Koran, an accusation that he and his wife vehemently denied. The couple was brutally beaten by the mob before being dragged to the brick kiln, where their bodies were burned. The killings have highlighted the alarming rise in violence against minorities in Pakistan, particularly Christians and members of the Ahmadiyya sect. The government has been accused of failing to take action against those responsible for such violence, with many lamenting the lack of justice for victims like Shahzad and Shama. The desecration of religious texts is often used as a pretext for mob violence against minorities, with little to no evidence needed to incite a frenzy among the perpetrators. Following the attack, the police have boosted security in Christian neighborhoods in Kot Radha Kishan town. However, many remain fearful and traumatized by the incident, which has brought to light the persecution and marginalization faced by religious minorities in Pakistan. In response to the killings, social media has been flooded with calls for justice and an end to the violence against minorities. The hashtag #JusticeForShahzadAndShama is trending on Twitter, with users expressing their outrage and grief at yet another tragedy that underscores the urgent need for human rights protections in Pakistan. The international community has also condemned the attack, with the United Nations expressing its concern for the safety of religious minorities in the country. In a statement, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said, "This brutal incident highlights the extreme vulnerability of religious minorities in Pakistan, who are frequently targeted by mobs." The killings of Shahzad and Shama are a tragic reminder of the importance of protecting religious minorities and upholding human rights in Pakistan. As the country struggles with rising sectarian tensions and violent extremism, it is essential that authorities take action to prevent such atrocities and hold those responsible accountable for their crimes. Until then, minorities in Pakistan will continue to live in fear and uncertainty, wondering if they will be the next victims of mob violence and bigotry.
