article: Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Since the 2011 revolution, Egyptians have seen near non-stop protests, the toppling of two presidents, six elections, and a seemingly endless political crisis. But what they haven't witnessed yet is what has been demanded all along -- a better economy. As the country goes to the polls next week to elect a new president, both candidates insist this is something they can be trusted to deliver. Former army chief Abdel Fattah el Sisi pledges new roads, housing, airports, jobs and an end to the energy crisis. Sisi's lone opponent, left leaning politician Hamdeen Sabahi, has vowed to dish out millions of dollars in investments to help reopen government factories, create new jobs, build new housing and improve health care. These are lofty promises. But has either candidate offered specifics on how they will get things done? "Not yet," said Cairo based economist, Angus Blair. "We've still got a few weeks before elections but the pressure is growing on both of them to come up with plans and that includes Sisi." Blair believes that in order to deliver on campaign promises, Egypt's next president must attract investors from both inside and outside Egypt through large scale economic reform. "It's not going to be easy," he added. "The problems are surmountable but I have to say the structural problems of Egypt's economy are enormous." These problems include rising food prices, unemployment at roughly 14% and a crippling budget deficit of around 12% of GDP. On top of all that, passions are still running high over the ousting and trial of former president Mohamed Morsy who was removed from his post by the army in 2013. A critical step to recovery, many business-minded economists say, is cutting costly food and fuel subsidies that eat up roughly one third of Egypt's budget. But for the country's poor, cutting subsidies will be an extremely tough pill to swallow. To ease the impact, Blair says Egypt's next leader must launch projects to help the masses -- like improving transport and affordable housing -- that can be kick-started by billions of aid received from Gulf Arab states. "If the right policies are in place, Egypt will respond quickly," Blair said. "But changing sentiment is the key by putting right policies and right people in place to show something is changing." Only then, he concludes, can Egypt's next president truly improve the economy and meet the demands of millions of Egyptians still waiting for a better life three years after revolution came to the country.

chatgpt: Egyptians are gearing up for presidential elections scheduled to take place on May 26 and 27, amidst high hopes for a brighter future. Only two candidates are in the running, Adel Fattah el Sisi and Hamdeen Sabahi, with reviving the crumblng economy topping the priority list for the ultimate winner. Egypt has been in turmoil since the 2011 revolution, with much of the blame for the country's stagnation resting on the shoulders of the ousted Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi. Under his leadership, the economy took a severe hit, with tourism and foreign investment drying up, the Egyptian Pound dwindling in value, and high rates of unemployment plaguing the country. In subsequent years, the transitional government headed by el Sisi has worked to stabilize the situation, but the economy has remained sluggish, with poverty and inflation both on the rise. To make matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the already dire economic situation. Egypt is in need of a leader who can jump-start the economy and foster economic growth, generating the jobs and income needed to lift many Egyptians out of poverty. Many believe that of the two candidates, el Sisi is the better equipped to make this happen. He has already started many initiatives aimed at reviving the economy, but it remains to be seen whether he can follow through with his promises. Sabahi, his opponent in the presidential race, has focused more on social justice and democratic values, but his economic plan is considered less credible. In contrast, el Sisi's economic reforms are based on market-oriented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment, promoting entrepreneurship, and creating jobs. So far, his methods have yielded some positive results, with more than 400,000 new jobs created in 2020, a steady growth rate of 2.5 percent, and inflation rates that are expected to decline in the coming years. Despite these successes, however, there is still much work to do. The country remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and faces severe infrastructure issues, including a debilitating energy crisis. In addition, corruption and bureaucracy have been major hindrances to the implementation of reforms. The elections will, therefore, be a significant turning point for the country, determining whether Egypt will continue along the path of economic reform and growth, or revert to the stagnation and instability of the past. The result of the elections is far from clear, as the country remains divided among various factions and political ideologies. Many Egyptians see el Sisi as a savior who has brought stability to the country after years of turbulence, but his critics accuse him of authoritarianism, human rights violations, and a lack of transparency. Sabahi, on the other hand, is seen as a champion of democracy and social justice, but his economic plan is not as credible as that of el Sisi. Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear: the new president of Egypt will have to work hard to revive the economy, create jobs, reduce poverty, and ensure that the country remains on a stable footing. The next few years will be crucial for Egypt, with much at stake for the country and its people. The world will be watching to see how the new leader navigates the challenges ahead.
