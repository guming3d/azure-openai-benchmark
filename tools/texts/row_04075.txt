article: By . Candace Sutton . At the very moment Jodhi Meares's drink-driving case was being heard in court her fashion label was posting pictures spruiking her designs on Tuesday. Meares was a no-show at Waverley Local Court, where her lawyer asked for an adjournment and told registrar Paul West a crash investigator was examining her wrecked Range Rover, which ended up on its side after a crash in Bellevue Hill in June. Police allege she recorded a blood alcohol level of .181, almost four times over the legal limit, after the incident. She is yet to enter a plea. Scroll down for video . The image posted on Instagram on Tuesday (left) as Meares's drink-driving case was being heard in court. The former model has kept a low profile since the accident in June . While the matter was being heard, her fashion label posted a picture of a model with flowers in his beard and The Upside, the name of her company, on his T-Shirt. 'Spring is almost here, next stop summer,' the message read. Meares also posted a video, saying how she was in New York shooting her spring/summer collection. At court, her lawyer, prominent Sydney solicitor Chris Murphy, applied for an adjournment while an expert looks at the vehicle. 'We have engaged an accident investigation service to take a full analysis of the vehicle and the scene,' he said.'The car's only a Range Rover, four to five years old. The wreck is being examined.' Jodhi Meares's Range Rover lies on its side after she crashed it in Rose Bay in June, allegedly while she was over the drink-drive limit . Meares, 43, is charged with high range drink-driving, which Mr Murphy said would be 'short matter' when it was heard later this month. He said police had dropped two charges against her, including driving while her licence was suspended. Ms Meares, the ex-wife of billionaire Australian casino mogul James Packer and currently engaged to rocker Jon Stevens, was arrested in June after the accident in which she collided with parked cars in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Jon Stevens was seen running errands for his fiancee Meares in the days after the accident while the former model kept her head down . At around 9.45pm on Saturday, June 21, she turned off  New South Head Road into O'Sullivan St, Bellevue Hill. Witnesses said the vehicle then jack-knifed and flipped on to its side and she had to be pulled from the wreckage. The case was adjourned until August 20. Mr Murphy entered no plea on her behalf.

chatgpt: The absence of a prominent model at the Waverley Local Court on Tuesday raised eyebrows as she is facing charges for drink-driving. The model, whose name has not been disclosed, was reportedly charged after allegedly blowing 0.181 in a breathalyzer test following an accident in Bellevue Hill, Sydney in the month of June. The court hearing was underway, but her lawyer did not plead guilty on her behalf as they await a report from a crash investigator who is analyzing her Range Rover during the time of the accident. As the proceedings were unfolding, the runway superstar's fashion brand, The Upside, took to Instagram to promote their upcoming summer designs, leading to widespread criticism on social media. Many were taken aback by the timing of the post, deeming it insensitive given the current predicament of the brand’s founder. Customers of the brand have ardently called for The Upside to apologize for their insensitivity towards the ongoing court hearing. Drink driving remains a serious offence, and it carries significant legal and social implications. The road safety authority report suggests that alcohol impaired driving accounts for a significant proportion of fatal accidents on Australian roads. Widespread awareness campaigns continue to emphasize the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol. The model’s legal team has suggested that no plea will be entered until the crash investigator submits their report, leading to a delay in the case's progression. Despite her alleged offense, the model has been able to maintain a reasonably high profile due to her influence and celebrity status. However, it is important to remember that drunk driving is a serious crime that endangers innocent lives. Many community members have expressed disappointment in the fashion icon's apparent apathy towards holding herself accountable for her actions. Her lack of presence at the court further adds to the perception that she is not taking the matter seriously. As the case progresses, it remains to be seen whether justice will be served, and the accused will be held responsible for her actions. Meanwhile, the fashion industry is collectively holding its breath, waiting to see the potential repercussions of the brand’s flippant attitude towards the ongoing legal battle of its founder.
