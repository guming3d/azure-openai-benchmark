article: (CNN)Technology: the solution to, and cause of, so many of life's problems. For better and for worse, we're tethered to our computers, glued to our TVs and parked in front of video games for hours. Even texting can hurt your body. But don't ditch your devices altogether. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that smartphone applications and wearable devices are actually quite accurate in tracking step counts. "Data from smartphones were only slightly different than observed step counts, but could be higher or lower," wrote the authors of the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The UPenn study recruited healthy adults who agreed to walk on a treadmill, tethered to 10 popular applications and devices by companies such as Fitbit, Jawbone and Nike, while an observer counted steps using a tally counter. They found wearable devices in general were less accurate than the smartphone apps. The most accurate devices, according to the study, were the Fitbit Flex, One and Zip. One device, the Nike FuelBand, reported step counts more than 20% lower than observed; Nike did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Despite the potential these devices have to get us up and moving, not very many of us have them, compared with mobile phones. A leading market research company says one in 10 adults in the U.S. own trackers, while nearly two-thirds of American adults own a smartphone -- and new technology has enabled these devices to easily track physical activity and other health behaviors. "Increased physical activity facilitated by these devices could lead to clinical benefits not realized by low adoption of pedometers," the authors wrote. "Our findings may help reinforce individuals' trust in using smartphone applications and wearable devices to track health behaviors, which could have important implications for strategies to improve population health." Multiple studies have shown that if you're aware of and alerted to your progress, you're more likely to keep up the good work, exercising regularly and staying active. But if you're going to keep that phone while walking around, just make sure you keep your head up and look where you're going.

chatgpt: Smartphone applications and wearable devices have been increasingly popular in monitoring daily physical activities, especially counting steps. A study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania shows that these devices are generally accurate in step-counting, but wearable devices tend to be less accurate compared to smartphone apps. The study involved tethering healthy adults to ten popular apps and devices by companies such as Fitbit, Jawbone, and Nike. Data was collected from the devices' sensors and compared to a manual step count from researchers. The results show that smartphone apps were generally more accurate in counting steps than wearable devices, with an average error rate of 6.7% versus 9.3%. According to the researchers, wearable devices tend to underestimate step counts, especially during activities that involve arm movements such as cycling or pushing a shopping cart. The placement of the wearable device on the body can also affect its accuracy, with devices worn on the wrist being more accurate than those worn on the waist or pocket. On the other hand, smartphone apps tend to overestimate step counts, especially when the phone is carried in a bag or backpack. However, they are generally more accurate when the phone is carried in a pocket or held in the hand. Despite the discrepancy in accuracy, the researchers believe that both smartphone apps and wearable devices can still be useful in encouraging individuals to engage in physical activity. "Even if the devices are not perfectly accurate, they still provide a way for people to understand their daily physical activity levels and set goals to increase them," said Meredith Case, lead author of the study. The findings of the study suggest that individuals should be aware of the limitations of their chosen device and placement when monitoring their daily physical activity. It is also important to note that step-counting is just one aspect of physical activity, and individuals should aim to engage in a variety of activities to achieve overall wellness. As technology continues to advance, the accuracy of these devices may also improve. However, in the meantime, individuals can still use smartphone apps and wearable devices as a tool to improve their daily physical activity levels and overall health.
