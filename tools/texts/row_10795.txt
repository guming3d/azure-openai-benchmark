The creators of what was one of the world's most successful social networks have unveiled their radical new plans for what they believe represents the future of social media. And it's called a bar. Michael and Xochi Birch were major players in the development of the online social networking phenomenon, but their latest project has definitely gone offline. The husband and wife team were the founders of the Bebo website, a rival to Facebook, which at its peak was the biggest social networking website in the UK and the third most popular in the world. The couple netted a staggering Â£850m when they sold the site to AOL in 2008 after which its popularity waned. Back to the future: Bebo Founder Michael Birch at his new San Fransisco members-only club The Battery . Now after various successful endeavours including Pinterest the scrapbooking site and a not-for-profit water charity website, they have turned their attention back to social networking, albiet with more than a little nod to the past. The Battery in San Fransisco was inspired by the new wave of London members' clubs founded from about 1980 onwards such as the Groucho, Soho House and The Hospital Club. The Birches believe they have stumbled on a niche market, as while San Fransisco is awash with fine restaurants there are absolutely no members clubs. They feel that by making the club members-only it will have the potential to create real-word friendships in a similar way to how social websites do online. The Birches sold Bebo to AOL for $850m . Unlike a traditional bar or pub, it will mean chance encounters between for example IT entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and other businessmen and women from across the vibrant city, are more likely to be repeated. Mr Birch told the Financial Times: 'Despite being an incredibly advanced city entrepreneuriallyand in every other way, San Fransisco is quite behind socially. 'What we want to do is have a diversity - we want tech to be the minority, not the majority. The normal topic of conversations should not start with your new app.' The Battery, which is nearing completion after almost five years in development, is a 60,000sq ft, four storey building on the edge of the city's financial district. Designers have tried to create a care-free, light-hearted space with five bars, a dining area and a spa room. Playful touches are everywhere: One of the bars has ping pong tables while the frosted floor to the glass elevator turns clear when it descends. Mr Birch added: 'Anything childish is my idea. One rule we set ourselves since selling{Bebo} is that we shouldn't do anything in life that we didn't think was going to be fun.'

chatgpt: Michael and Xochi Birch, the couple behind the successful social network Bebo, have ventured into the San Francisco club scene with the opening of a new members-only club, The Battery. The Battery, which opened its doors last week, is located in San Francisco's Jackson Square neighborhood and boasts an array of amenities including a restaurant, bar, lounge, fitness center, spa, and even hotel rooms. The club is said to be focused on community, offering members a space to connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals. With a membership fee of $2,400 a year, The Battery caters to an exclusive group of people, including entrepreneurs, investors, artists, and executives. Michael and Xochi Birch have a successful track record in the tech industry, having founded Bebo in 2005. The social network quickly rose to popularity, boasting over 40 million users at its peak. In 2008, the couple sold Bebo to AOL for a whopping $850 million. Since then, Michael and Xochi have focused on various philanthropic and entrepreneurial ventures. The couple founded the non-profit organization, the X-Prize Foundation, which aims to create innovative solutions to some of the world's greatest challenges. With The Battery, the Birches have once again turned their focus to community building, creating a space where individuals can connect and exchange ideas in a luxurious environment. The club has already attracted interest from high-profile individuals including celebrity chef Thomas Keller, and has garnered positive reviews for its exceptional service and atmosphere. The Battery is not the first members-only club to open its doors in San Francisco, with similar establishments such as the The Wing and The Battery's competitor, The Battery Club, already solidifying their place in the city's social scene. However, The Battery's unique approach to community building and focus on collaboration may set it apart from the competition. The club's impressive amenities, including a rooftop bar offering views of the San Francisco skyline, may also prove to be a draw for members seeking an upscale experience. While some may criticize The Battery's exclusivity and high membership fees, others argue that the club offers a space for individuals to connect and collaborate in a way that may not be possible elsewhere. With the success of their previous ventures and The Battery's promising start, it seems that Michael and Xochi Birch may have another hit on their hands. For San Francisco's elite, The Battery may just become the go-to spot for networking and socializing in the city.
