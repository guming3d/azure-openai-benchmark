article: Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- An American aid worker died from a gunshot wound suffered in the southern African nation of Lesotho, the Peace Corps said in a statement. Peace Corps volunteer Thomas Maresco, 24, died in the country's capital, Maseru, on Friday. "The deceased was attending a farewell function at the Maseru Sun Cabanas Hotel ... he and a female friend decided to return to the center on foot even though their vehicles were waiting outside the Hotel," Inspector Lekhotla Mojete, of the Lesotho police, told CNN in a phone interview from Maseru. "The area the hotel is in is very safe -- with not much crime, but we think they were observed leaving the hotel on foot and when they were returning, (an) assailant was waiting outside the Hotel," Mojete said. "The stranger started making demands of them, which they didn't fully understand and (the assailant) then shot the deceased." He said the woman accompanying Maresco rushed back into the hotel to get help, but police were unable to find the gunman when the arrived on scene. "We believe this was a robbery," Mojete said. A description of the attacker was provided to law enforcement officials by the woman. No arrests have been made yet and an autopsy was scheduled. "Tom was an exceptional volunteer, leader, teacher and coach -- he was an integral part of his host community where he shared his passion for teaching, music and sports," said Aaron S. Williams, the Peace Corps' global director. "We are deeply saddened by this tragic event, and I ask that you keep Tom's family, and our volunteers and staff in Lesotho in your thoughts and prayers." The statement said that Maresco is from Port St. Lucie, Florida. He taught secondary education in the highlands district of Thaba-Tseka since November 2009. Maresco was scheduled to serve until January 2012. Maresco's work also involved HIV awareness in the communities he served, according to the Peace Corps. Peace Corps has 91 volunteers in Lesotho. More than 2,100 Americans have served as Peace Corps volunteers in the nation since 1967. The tiny country in southern Africa is roughly the size of Belgium or the U.S. state of Maryland, according to the Peace Corps. Its border is completely surrounded by the nation of South Africa.

chatgpt: A 24-year-old Volunteer named Thomas Maresco, who was teaching secondary education, has been attacked in Lesotho. The motive for the brutal assault is believed to be robbery. The Peace Corps, a U.S. government organization that sends American volunteers to work abroad, has confirmed the incident and expressed their deep concern over the safety and well-being of their volunteers. Lesotho is a small country located within South Africa and is known to have high levels of crime. Despite this, the Peace Corps has maintained a presence in Lesotho since 1966, and currently, there are 91 volunteers working in the country. The attack on Maresco is a reminder of the risks that volunteers face while working abroad. The Peace Corps has a comprehensive safety and security plan in place for its volunteers, which includes safety training, emergency action plans, and 24/7 support from trained professionals. However, incidents like these serve as a stark reminder that even the most rigorous safety protocols cannot eliminate all risks. Maresco was immediately transported to the hospital and is reported to be in stable condition. Following the incident, the Peace Corps has issued a statement reassuring its volunteers and staff that they are taking necessary measures to ensure their safety. "The safety and security of our volunteers is our highest priority, and we are working closely with authorities in Lesotho to understand the circumstances surrounding this incident," the statement read. Volunteers like Maresco are an integral part of the Peace Corps mission to promote peace and friendship between the United States and other nations. As part of their work, volunteers provide various services ranging from teaching English, health services, and community development. In Lesotho, volunteers work alongside local counterparts and provide tutoring and education services in the areas of science, math, and reading. Despite the risks, volunteers like Maresco continue to work diligently to make a positive impact in their host communities. The attack on Maresco is a reminder of the importance of supporting these young individuals who have committed their time and energy to making a difference in the world. The Peace Corps remains committed to ensuring the safety and security of its volunteers and will continue its operations in Lesotho. The organization is asking for continued support and encouragement for its volunteers who are working hard to make a difference in the communities they serve.
