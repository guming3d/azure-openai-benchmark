article: Active leader: CEO Kevin Clearly revealed the practices . Like a lot of companies plugging health foods and fitness supplements, Clif Bar projects a rugged, wholesome, pro-fitness image. But, it emerged, the California-based company takes its healthy message so seriously it even pays its employees to work out. Staff members are allowed two and a half hours of company time every week - or a half-hour a day - to hit the on-site gym. The facility is complete with personal trainers, daily classes, 'nutritional counselors' - and a boulder-climbing wall. Workers are also encouraged to switch off completely after working hours - and won't get a response from their CEO via phone or email if it's after 6.30pm. The push for a balanced, active lifestyle is being led by chief executive Kevin Cleary, who revealed some of his company's  practices in an interview with ABC News. He said: 'We have a great gym... We encourage everyone to get out and exercise.' 'There's a lot of times I'll go out for a run then I'll walk back through the company and I'm going to a meeting and I'm still sweating, because I'm squeezing the workout in.' And the family man - who lives with his wife and three sons near Clif Bar's HQ in Emeryville, California -  also said he leads by example in being out of contact after hours. He said: 'I don't send out emails at night. I don't send them out on the weekend. I may do work, but I won't send out an email. Earning their paycheck: Clif Bar employees get two-and-a-half hours a week to hit the gym on company time . Wholesome: The California-based company offers other healthy incentives for its workforce . 'I don't want to set the expectation that people should be working at 7 or 8 at night. I get home at 6:30. I put the phone in my home office. I leave it there, then I'm just dedicated to my kids' The company, which is privately-held, also offers employee benefits including the chance to have every second Friday off by putting in extra hours elsewhere, subsidies for leaving the car at home, and the chance to bring their dogs into work. Employees with seven years' service are also given a paid sabbatical vacation 'for personal growth and renewal'.

chatgpt: In a recent interview, CEO Kevin Cleary opened up about his leadership style and the values that drive his company's success. Cleary revealed that he prioritizes a healthy work-life balance, insisting that he never answers calls or emails after hours or on weekends. "I believe that my team needs time to recharge and focus on their personal lives," Cleary said. "I don't want anyone to feel like they have to be on call 24/7." Cleary's commitment to a balanced lifestyle extends beyond his own habits. He leads by example, often strolling through the California office in sweatpants and sneakers, encouraging his team to embrace their own fitness goals. He has even instituted a company-wide "wellness challenge," rewarding employees for making healthy lifestyle choices. "I firmly believe that happy, healthy team members are more productive and engaged," Cleary said. Cleary's leadership philosophy also emphasizes transparency and integrity. He spoke candidly about the company's commitment to ethical business practices, saying that he believes that honesty and openness are crucial to building lasting relationships with customers and employees alike. "When we make mistakes, we own up to them and work to make things right," Cleary said. "We're not perfect, but we're always striving to do better." Cleary's comments have been well-received by industry experts, who see his approach as a refreshing departure from the cutthroat, "always-on" culture that often dominates the tech world. "Kevin Cleary is setting a great example for other leaders," said Sandra Kim, CEO of tech firm Evergreen. "He understands that a company's success depends on more than just profits and growth; it's about creating a culture that values people and treats them with respect." In the midst of a pandemic-induced shift to remote work, many companies are struggling to maintain the boundaries between work and personal life. Cleary's commitment to work-life balance and healthy practices provides a roadmap for other leaders looking to prioritize their employees' well-being. "I want my team to know that they can take care of themselves and still have a successful career," Cleary said. "It's about finding a balance that works for you."
