A man is on the run from police who say he choked and beat a woman in the street then stabbed a man who tried to help her with a screwdriver. It was the early hours of the morning when John Matthews, 34, began hitting and throttling a woman outside Play Sports Bar in Annadale, Staten Island, New York City, police said. When a passing driver who saw the attack pulled over to help the woman, Matthews is alleged to have pulled a screwdriver from his trousers. He then stabbed the man repeatedly in the back, before fleeing the scene when a bouncer from the bar ran outside. 'He saw a scuffle in the street,' a Play Sports Bar worker told silive.com. 'And he ran out immediately.' The worker, who asked not to be named said the incident was not connected to the bar. Paramedics took the 36-year-old victim to Staten Island University Hospital, where he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. The woman refused treatment at the scene. Police blocked off a road in Arrochar after reports that Matthews had barricaded himself in a home there, but it subsequently turned out that he wasn't inside. Police are now asking for help tracking down Matthews, their prime suspect in the incident, which happened at about 3.30am on Friday morning. He is described as a white male, about 5ft 11in tall and 160lbs in weight. The bouncer who chased him off said Matthews fled the scene in a burgundy Lexus G3300 saloon, with the New York plate GPZ-0111. He is known to frequent New Jersey and Arizona, and police say he may have switched the number plates on his car.
