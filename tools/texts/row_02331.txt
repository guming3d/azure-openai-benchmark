Dutch police have had to issue an apology after a 'single colleague' posted an April Fool's message online saying that a major section of the country's motorway would be closed today. The message - posted on the national police website -  claimed that 20 miles of the A2 motorway between the Dutch capital Amsterdam and Utrecht would be closed for filming of BBC's Top Gear's attempt to set a new world speed record on a public road. A police spokesman told the Telegraph: 'This is obviously not the intention. It was an action of a single colleague who did not think about the possible consequences.' Dutch police have issued an apology after an April Fool's message appeared on its website saying that a major section of the country's motorway would be closed while BBC's Top Gear filmed an attempt to set a new world speed record . The mock 'warning' was posted on the national police website on Easter Monday morning. It remained stayed online but was removed after an hour after the public began to inquire about the road closure. The fake message said that Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May,  would use the motorway on 1 April to try and break a world record speed record of 268 miles per hour on a public highway. It claimed that 20 miles of the 10 lane A2 motorway between the Dutch capital Amsterdam and Utrecht would be closed for filming . The Dutch justice ministry said 'police organisation quickly moved to avoid confusion after a thoughtless action.' The Dutch are known for their fondness of April Fool jokes, and their love of pranks goes back 440 years with roots in the Dutch war against Spain for the country's independence. On 1 April 1572, Dutch rebels conquered the town of Den Briel, marking a major victory in the struggle against the rule of Spain and a garrison commanded by Lord Alva. To commemorate the victory, and a successful April Fool trick, the Dutch say, 'Op 1 april, Verloor Alva zijn Bril' or 'On April first, Lord Alva lost his glasses', a pun on the word 'Bril', meaning spectacles and Briel, the name of the town.

chatgpt: Dutch police have issued an apology after a message was posted by a single colleague, indicating that a 20-mile stretch of motorway between Amsterdam and Utrecht would be shut down. The message was picked up and widely shared on social media, causing major panic and disruption on the roads. The original message, which was posted on Twitter, suggested that the motorway would be closed for the entire day. This led to many drivers abandoning their plans and seeking alternative routes, causing widespread congestion on surrounding roads. In a statement, the Dutch police confirmed that the message had been posted by a single individual, and that it was incorrect. The police apologized for any inconvenience caused, and reaffirmed their commitment to reliable and accurate communication with the public. "At no point was there any intention to mislead or cause alarm," the statement read. "We take our responsibilities to the public very seriously, and we regret any confusion caused." Despite the police's reassurances, many drivers have criticized the handling of the situation, arguing that more could have been done to rectify the situation and prevent unnecessary disruption. "I understand that mistakes happen," said one driver, who asked to remain anonymous. "But when you're dealing with something as important as traffic updates, you really need to make sure you're getting it right. This kind of misinformation can cause chaos on the roads, and it could have easily been avoided." The incident has prompted calls for increased training and monitoring of social media usage within the Dutch police force, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. "Social media is a powerful tool, but it needs to be used responsibly," said another driver. "If the police are going to be using it to communicate with the public, they need to ensure that the information they're sharing is accurate and reliable. Otherwise, it's just going to cause more problems than it solves." Despite the disruption caused by the incident, the Dutch police have pledged to learn from their mistakes and work to improve their communication strategies in the future. In the meantime, drivers have been advised to check official police channels for accurate traffic updates, and to avoid relying solely on social media for information.
