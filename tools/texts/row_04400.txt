article: You may have heard it before: Billions of years ago, Mars probably looked more like Earth does now, with clouds and oceans and a much thicker atmosphere. It may even have had some type of microbes. But now it's a barren, frozen desert. So what happened? Where did the air and water go? That's what the spacecraft NASA launched Monday is being dispatched to find out. It's called MAVEN -- short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution -- and it's the first mission dedicated to studying the red planet's upper atmosphere. "We expect to learn how the modern Mars works, really in detail. To see its climate state, to understand how the atmosphere is lost to space -- how Mars may have lost a magnetic field -- to take that information and map it back in time," said NASA's James Garvin. MAVEN lifted off shortly before 1:30 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, starting a 10-month trip. By late afternoon, it was more than 14,000 miles from Earth en route to a September 22, 2014 rendezvous with Mars. The solar-powered probe is about the length of school bus -- 37.5 feet (11.43 meters) -- and will weigh about 5,410 pounds (2,454 kilograms) at launch. What killed Mars? New spacecraft will find out . "MAVEN will fill in a very big gap in our understanding of the planet by exploring the upper atmosphere and its influence on the Martian environment," principal investigator Bruce Jakosky, from the University of Colorado, says on his NASA webpage. He says he's "excited that we're providing one step along the path of answering questions about whether life ever existed on Mars." Jakosky's team will use the spacecraft's three instrument suites in hopes of determining three things about Mars: . • The composition of its upper atmosphere . • How fast it's losing what's left of its atmosphere . • The history of the atmosphere . MAVEN won't make a cool, daring landing like the Mars Curiosity Rover, which has been roaming Mars for more than a year now. Instead, it will orbit between a low of about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the surface to a high of about 3,728 miles (6,000 kilometers). It also will make five dives, flying as low as 77 miles (125 kilometers) in altitude. NASA says the mission will cost $671 million. Interactive: Mars exploration from Viking to MAVEN .

chatgpt: NASA's MAVEN mission has logged more than 14,000 miles on its first day en route to Mars to study the red planet's atmosphere. The unmanned probe launched Monday afternoon from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on its 10-month journey to Mars. MAVEN, which stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, is one of NASA's most important Mars missions. Its mission is to study the planet's upper atmosphere in unprecedented detail and to understand how it has changed over time. MAVEN is carrying a suite of sophisticated scientific instruments designed to measure the Martian atmosphere, including a neutral gas and ion mass spectrometer, solar wind electron analyzer, and ultraviolet spectrometer among others. The data gathered by the probe will help scientists understand how the Martian atmosphere and climate have changed over time and how they may evolve in the future. The MAVEN mission is scheduled to arrive on Mars on September 22, 2014. Once it arrives, the probe will enter into an elliptical orbit around the Martian poles, where it will begin its scientific investigations of the planet's atmosphere. One of MAVEN's primary goals is to determine how the loss of volatile compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water, has affected the planet's atmosphere and climate over time. Scientists hope that the data gathered by MAVEN will shed new light on the mystery of how Mars lost its atmosphere and became the cold, dry planet it is today. The mission is also expected to help pave the way for future manned missions to Mars, by providing vital information about the planet's environment, including its radiation levels and weather patterns. The MAVEN mission is part of NASA's ongoing Mars exploration program, which has included a series of successful lander and rover missions to the planet over the past decade. These missions have provided crucial insights into the Martian environment, including evidence of past water on the planet's surface and the discovery of organic molecules. As MAVEN continues its journey to Mars, scientists are eagerly awaiting the first data that it will send back to Earth. The findings from this mission could help answer some of the most fundamental questions about the Martian environment, and provide new clues about the origins and evolution of our solar system.
