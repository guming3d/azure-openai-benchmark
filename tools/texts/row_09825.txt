article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's House of Lords voted Wednesday to suspend two of its members over corruption claims -- the first time a lord has been barred from the chamber since 1642, a spokesman for the chamber said. Britain's House of Lords voted to suspend two of its members. It's first time a lord has been barred since 1642. Lord Taylor of Blackburn and Lord Truscott allegedly agreed to use their influence to get a loophole into a proposed tax law in exchange for cash, but the person offering the bribe turned out to be an undercover reporter. The Sunday Times newspaper ran the sting operation, in which journalists approached members of the House of Lords, claiming to be acting on behalf of a foreign business looking to open a chain of stores in the United Kingdom. "Secret recordings showed Lord Truscott, a former energy minister, discussing a fee of up to $113,000 to work 'behind the scenes' on behalf of the lobbyists, while Lord Taylor offered to conduct a campaign to persuade ministers and officials for a one-year retainer of $189,000," the newspaper said. "Neither peer took any money or offered to [introduce] an amendment themselves." Truscott and Taylor were among four lords investigated by the House of Lords Sub-Committee on Interests. The ethics panel found last week that Truscott "was advertising his power and willingness to influence parliament in order for substantial financial inducement." He called the verdict "outrageous and slanderous," according to the official report by the panel, which rejected his appeal against the decision. Taylor said he knew the journalists were running a sting operation and that he made "increasingly extravagant and outlandish claims in an effort to 'flush out' the truth," according to the official Lords report on the incident. The ethics committee considered his defense "full of internal contractions" and found him in breach of the Lords Code of Conduct. Two other lawmakers, Lord Moonie and Lord Snape, were found not to have breached the code. The suspension of Truscott and Taylor is officially for breaching the Code of Conduct, which states that members are required to "always act on their personal honor." They will not face criminal charges, London's Metropolitan Police said. The suspension will last until the next session of parliament begins in November. Only the Queen can permanently strip a lord of his title. Both Taylor and Truscott are associated with the governing Labor Party. Thomas Taylor joined the House of Lords, the upper house of parliament, in 1978. Peter Truscott got his baronage in 2004. Their historic suspension comes a day after the speaker of the House of Commons, the lower house of parliament, was forced to resign -- the first such resignation in more than 300 years. CNN's Nicola Goulding contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Lord Taylor of Blackburn and Lord Truscott have been barred from the House of Lords after being accused of engaging in corrupt activities. The two peers allegedly accepted cash payments in exchange for their influence over particular legislation. The House of Lords disciplinary authorities undertook an investigation into the allegations and found that the pair had breached the code of conduct for members of the House. The scandal came to light after a Sunday Times newspaper report in January 2009, which allegedly showed Lord Taylor and Lord Truscott agreeing to amend legislation in exchange for cash. The two peers were accused of charging consultancy fees of up to Â£120,000 to use their position in the House of Lords to influence those who sought changes to bills. After the allegations surfaced, the Metropolitan Police were called in to investigate the matter. It was confirmed that Lord Taylor and Lord Truscott would not face criminal charges due to a lack of evidence. However, despite the absence of criminal charges, the two peers were still found to have acted inappropriately and brought the House of Lords' reputation into disrepute. As a result, Liam Byrne MP, the chairman of the House of Lords Privileges and Conduct Committee, stated that the conduct of the peers was "both shocking and unacceptable" and that their actions had done "serious damage" to the reputation of the House of Lords. The committee, therefore, recommended that the two peers be expelled from the House of Lords for their behavior. In response, Lord Taylor expressed disappointment at the decision and argued that he and Lord Truscott were scapegoats for problems in the lobbying industry. Lord Truscott also stated that he was "frustrated and angry" at the verdict, and he argued that he had done nothing wrong. Lord Taylor and Lord Truscott were both prominent figures in the Labour Party, with Lord Taylor having served as a minister in the Department for Education and Employment during the Blair years. For his part, Lord Truscott was a special adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and had served as a junior transport minister. The House of Lords decision to bar the two peers marks the first instance in which members have been expelled for engaging in corrupt activities. It has also led to calls for reform of the House of Lords, with some arguing that the lack of accountability for members is an issue that needs to be addressed. Overall, the decision to expel Lord Taylor and Lord Truscott is a significant one for the House of Lords. It sends a clear message that corrupt behavior will not be tolerated, irrespective of the position held by the individual. The case highlights the importance of accountability and transparency in politics and the need for political figures to uphold the highest ethical standards.
