chatgpt: Police officers in Dorset were caught off-guard by a massive wave that crashed into Chesil Cove in Portland on Tuesday afternoon, leaving them soaked from head-to-toe. The officers had been on a routine patrol and parked at a vantage point nearby when the wave hit. The incident occurred around 3:30 pm, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to our reporter on the scene. Residents and tourists were warned to stay away from the dangerous seafronts as the region has been experiencing stormy weather lately. Officer Jake Johnson and his colleague, Officer Emily Smith were parked at the top of the cliff observing the sea when the huge wave struck, causing water to splash over the cliff and drenching the two officers. Fortunately, neither of them were seriously injured, and they continued with their patrol despite being soaked. "I couldn't believe how big the wave was. One minute we were sitting in the car and the next thing you know, we were completely drenched! It was really scary," Officer Johnson said. The incident highlights the risks associated with visiting coastal areas during extreme weather. The police in Dorset have been warning people to avoid the dangerous seafronts, where waves can easily sweep people off the rocks and pull them out to sea. The RNLI has also issued warnings to the public, urging them to take extra precautions when near the coast. In a statement, the RNLI said, "People should think twice before heading to the coast in such conditions. Waves can be extremely powerful, and even experienced swimmers can quickly find themselves in difficulty." The incident has also led to renewed calls for more resources to be allocated to coastal safety by the government. Coastal erosion and severe weather conditions are increasingly putting lives at risk, and there are concerns that more needs to be done to protect both locals and tourists from dangerous coastal areas. For now, the police in Dorset are warning people to stay safe and avoid coastal areas during stormy weather conditions. "We cannot stress enough the dangers of getting too close to the sea during such weather events," Officer Smith added. "Please stay safe and stay away from the coast."
