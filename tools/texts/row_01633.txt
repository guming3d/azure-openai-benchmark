article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:46 AM on 13th December 2011 . U.S. jails are to charge inmates up to $142 per night to stay there in an attempt to balance their budgets. Those incarcerated in Riverside County, California, will have to pay for their bed and board under the means tested initiative, the largest so far in America. Officials have become outraged after watching wealthy celebrities like Lindsay Lohan sent to jail at taxpayers’ expense. If you do the crime, prepare to do the time... and the dime: Those incarcerated in Riverside County, California, will have to pay for their bed and board under the means tested initiative . They say the fee - which is not far off the $188 for a luxury hotel in the area - is needed to plug an $80million black hole in the county finances. Riverside prison supervisor Jeff Stone said: ‘You do the crime, you will serve the time, and now you will also pay the dime’. He estimates that some 25 per cent of the county’s prisoners could be able to to pay something and that it could earn around £4million each year. Critics have however said it is unlikely to bring in even that much as most prisoners have no cash at all. Mr Stone said that he put forward the law, which was unanimously passed by the County Board of Supervisors, due to concerns about overcrowding. Riverside, which is east of Los Angeles, has five jails and stands at 93 per cent capacity, up from 85 per cent in October. The price of crime: In the UK to house a male category C prisoner costs £28,673 per year, or £78.55 per night . The fee will reimburse the county for of clothing, health care and food. One issue of concern is that those who stay in county jails do so for an average of two years, meaning for a wealthy prisoner they could end up paying $51,885 per year, or $103,795 for their entire stay. Mr Stone said: ‘We need to be looking for revenue wherever we can for ourselves. ‘There are people who have the means and who get into trouble with the law. Why should the citizens of this county with other struggles be forced to pay for that? The Lindsay Lohans of the world can certainly pay for it themselves.’ In Britain, the cost of holding an inmate in jail can be even higher than in Riverside County. Keeping somebody in a police cell - which is done when there is no room at nearby prisons - is a staggering £459 per night. To house a male category C prisoner costs £28,673 per year, or £78.55 per night.

chatgpt: The United States government has recently implemented a new means-tested initiative to provide financial assistance to individuals who cannot afford legal representation. This new initiative is the largest of its kind in the country and aims to provide equal access to the justice system for all Americans, regardless of their financial resources. However, the initiative has recently come under scrutiny after several high-profile celebrities were granted access to the program, despite their significant wealth. The most notable example of this was Lindsay Lohan, who was recently sent to jail for violating the terms of her probation. Lohan, who is estimated to have a net worth of over $800,000, was granted access to the means-tested initiative, with taxpayers footing the bill for her legal representation. This has outraged officials and members of the public, who argue that the initiative is meant to help those who truly cannot afford legal representation, not wealthy celebrities like Lohan. Many are calling for stricter eligibility requirements to prevent individuals like her from taking advantage of the program. "The fact that someone like Lindsay Lohan was able to access this program is ridiculous," said Senator Mark Johnson. "This initiative is supposed to provide a safety net for those who cannot afford legal representation, not serve as a bailout for the rich and famous." Others have pointed out that Lohan is not the only wealthy individual to have benefited from the initiative. Several other celebrities, including Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, have also been granted access to the program, raising further concerns about its efficacy. Despite the criticism, advocates for the means-tested initiative argue that it has been successful in providing more equal access to the justice system for low-income individuals. They point out that the program has helped thousands of Americans who would otherwise have been unable to afford legal representation. "Before this initiative was implemented, many people were left without legal representation simply because they could not afford it," said James Madison, a legal advocate. "Now, with this program in place, we are beginning to see more equal access to the justice system, regardless of income level." The controversy surrounding the means-tested initiative highlights the challenges of implementing large-scale programs designed to promote equality and access to justice. While the program has helped thousands of low-income individuals, there is still a need to refine eligibility requirements to prevent wealthy individuals from taking advantage of the system. Moving forward, officials and advocates for the program must work together to ensure that it remains effective and targeted towards those who are truly in need. With the right policies in place, the means-tested initiative has the potential to help thousands more Americans access justice and achieve their rightful place in society.
