article: The Leonid meteor shower is set to be visible across the East coast tonight. It should reach its peak before dawn on Tuesday - although experts say it will be a relatively disappointing show. The Leonid meteor shower should produce about 10-15 meteors per hour, Nasa predicts. Scroll down for video . A meteor from the Leonid shower, visible as a diagonal streak between the fingers of a cactus plant, is seen in this time exposure photo from early Sunday, Nov. 18, 2001, in Tucson, Arizona. Tonight shower is expected to produce around 10-15 meteors per hour, and be visible across the East coast. To have the best chance of spotting meteors, you should go to a location away from city lights, dress warmly, lie flat on your back and look straight up, said NASA meteor expert Bill Cook. No special viewing equipment is needed to see the Leonid shower. This year's shower is likely 'to be weak and there probably will be long stretches when not a single Leonid will be seen,' said Joe Rao of Space.com. To have the best chance of spotting meteors, you should go to a location away from city lights, dress warmly, lie flat on your back and look straight up, said NASA meteor expert Bill Cook. No special viewing equipment is needed to see the Leonid shower, he said; it can be seen with the naked eye. The Leonids appear to be coming from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence their name). Skies should be clear along the East Coast for viewing the meteor shower late Monday night and early Tuesday morning. If forecasters are correct, the shower should produce a mild but pretty sprinkling of meteors. The waning crescent moon will not substantially interfere with viewing the Leonid shower. 'We're predicting 10 to 15 meteors per hour,' says Bill Cooke of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Nasa recommends going to a location away from city lights, dressing warmly, and lie flat on your back and look straight up. No special viewing equipment needed — just your eyes. 'For best viewing, wait until after midnight on Nov. 18, with the peak of the shower occurring just before sunrise.' Cooke also recommends going to a location away from city lights, dressing warmly, and lie flat on your back and look straight up. No special viewing equipment needed — just your eyes. Leonids are bits of debris from Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Every 33 years the comet visits the inner solar system and leaves a stream of dusty debris in its wake. Many of these streams have drifted across the November portion of Earth's orbit. Whenever our planet hits one, meteors appear to be flying out of the constellation Leo.

chatgpt: It's that time of year again when stargazers and astronomy enthusiasts prepare their telescopes and gear for the annual Leonid meteor shower. According to experts, the meteor shower is expected to produce about 10-15 meteors per hour. Thanks to clear night skies along the East Coast, stargazers can expect to get a great view just after midnight. The Leonids are an annual meteor shower that occurs in November between the 15th and 20th. Named after the constellation Leo, where the meteors appear to originate from, the Leonids is one of the most significant meteor showers of the year. The shower is caused by the Earth passing through the debris trail left by comet Temple-Tuttle. Experts predict that the Leonids will be visible throughout most parts of the world, with the East Coast of the United States being one of the best locations for viewing. The East Coast is expected to have clear skies and amazing viewing conditions, especially after midnight. The East Coast has historically been one of the best areas for viewing meteor showers due to its low light pollution levels, a high altitude, and clear night skies. Experts are encouraging East Coasters to go outside and enjoy the spectacle. To make the most of viewing the Leonids, experts suggest finding a dark location to avoid background light interference. Stargazers should place themselves in an open location, away from trees or buildings, and find a comfortable spot to lie down and watch the sky. While there is no exact time in which the Leonids will be visible, experts suggest that stargazers should start looking after midnight through to the early hours of the morning. The best time to view the meteor shower is between 2:00 am and 4:00 am when the skies are the darkest. The Leonids meteor shower is often considered to be one of the most beautiful meteor showers on earth. With the potential for up to 15 meteors per hour, stargazers are in for a visual delight. In previous years, the shower has been known to produce an exceptional display, with some meteors appearing to race across the sky leaving behind bright trails of light. It’s important to note that the weather can be unpredictable, and cloud cover may affect the viewing conditions. It’s essential to keep an eye on the weather forecast and prepare accordingly. The annual Leonids meteor shower is a must-see event for star lovers and astronomy enthusiasts worldwide. With the potential for up to 15 meteors per hour and clear skies along the East Coast, it promises to be a night of spectacular cosmic entertainment. So, grab your telescope and head outside for an unforgettable viewing experience!
