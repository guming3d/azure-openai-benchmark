chatgpt: Henry Wachtel, a former English teacher at the prestigious LaGuardia Performing Arts High School, has been allowed to plead not guilty by reason of mental disease in the murder of his mother, Karyn Kay, in 2012. The incident took place in Manhattan, where Wachtel allegedly attacked his mother while she was on the phone with the police, trying to get her seizing son some help. When the police arrived at the scene, they found Wachtel wild-eyed and covered in blood. Kay had suffered a fractured skull, broken ribs, and internal bleeding. She was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Wachtel's plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease was accepted on Monday, which means that he will be evaluated by psychiatric experts to determine his mental state at the time of the crime. If found to be suffering from a mental disease, Wachtel could be sentenced to a psychiatric facility instead of serving jail time. The 63-year-old Wachtel had been a revered and respected member of the LaGuardia faculty for over a decade, where he taught English to some of New York City's most talented young artists. He was known for his sharp wit, his love of literature, and his kind and patient demeanor with his students. The news of Wachtel's arrest and subsequent plea has sent shockwaves through the LaGuardia community. Students and colleagues alike are still reeling from the news that someone they knew and respected could be capable of such a heinous act. Many have expressed sympathy for Wachtel, who had reportedly been struggling with mental health issues for several years leading up to the murder. Some have even called for greater resources and support for teachers and educators who may be dealing with mental health problems. Despite the sympathy and understanding from some members of the community, others believe that justice must be served for Kay, who was an innocent victim in this tragedy. They believe that Wachtel must face consequences for his actions, regardless of his mental state at the time of the crime. As Wachtel's case moves forward and his mental state is evaluated, the LaGuardia community will no doubt continue to grapple with the aftermath of this tragedy, and what it means for the future of mental health care and the criminal justice system.
