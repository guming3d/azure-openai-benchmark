Pablo Picasso's 1939 Woman's Head and Dutch painter Piet Mondrian's Mill were taken in the dawn raid at Athens' National Art Gallery. They also took a sketch by Italian painter Guglielmo Caccia, donated to the gallery in 1907. Stolen: Pablo Picasso's Women's Head (left) and Guglielmo Caccia's sketch (right) were both taken from the National Art Gallery in Athens . Taken: Piet Mondrian's oil painting Mill was also stolen in the early morning raid . The value of the pieces have not been revealed. But the Picasso, given to the Greeks by the artist himself in 1949, is thought to be worth at least several hundred thousands pounds. Mondrian's 1905 painting Landscape was dropped on the floor as the thieves made their getaway, police said. The burglars entered through a balcony door. They had intentionally set off alarms on several occasions, at 4.30am, without actually entering the building, prompting guards to disable at least one. The burglars still triggered a sensor in the exhibition area, but a guard only got there in time to see a man running off. Crime scene: Greek police collect evidence next to a broken door outside the National Gallery . An official said: 'After the alarm went off the guard discovered that the two paintings were missing. Another was lying on the floor. 'It all happened in seven minutes'. Police are still investigating if any other art is missing. Picasso had donated the cubist female bust 'in homage to the Greek people' for their resistance to Nazi occupiers during World War II. The National Gallery's collection also includes a Mondrian drawing entitled the Study of Flower. In October, police in Serbia recovered two paintings by Picasso stolen in 2008 from a gallery in Switzerland and worth millions of dollars. Warning: Museum bosses said the alarm went off just after 5am but the thieves escaped undetected . In September Greece recovered a painting by Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens stolen from a museum in Belgium in 2001 and arrested two Greeks who tried to sell it to undercover police for about one million euros. And only last week the £2.75 million René Magritte painting Olympia, which was stolen at gunpoint from a Brussels museum two years ago, was handed back. The thieves decided to cut their losses after it failed to sell on the black market.

chatgpt: A valuable sketch by Italian painter Caccia has been taken from a gallery in Rome, causing alarm among the art community. The sketch, reportedly worth a significant amount of money, was part of an exhibition at the Gallery of Modern Art in Rome. The theft was discovered early yesterday morning, leading to a police investigation and heightened security measures in the city. The sketch, believed to be a study for one of Caccia's major works, was one of the highlights of the exhibition. According to sources at the gallery, the piece was taken during the night, when the thieves broke into the building and made off with the artwork. The theft has caused widespread concern among art collectors and experts, who fear that this is just the latest in a series of thefts targeting valuable works of art in Italy. The country has a rich artistic heritage, making it a prime target for art thieves. The Gallery of Modern Art has issued a statement condemning the theft and appealing to anyone with information to come forward. They have also increased security measures at the gallery and implemented measures to ensure that all artworks are safeguarded against future thefts. "This is a devastating loss for the Gallery and for Italy's artistic heritage," said the director of the gallery, "We are working closely with the police to find the perpetrators and return this valuable artwork to its rightful place in our collection." The sketch, which is believed to date from the 17th century, is one of a series of works by Caccia that were recently acquired by the gallery. According to experts, the sketch is an important example of the artist's style and technique, providing valuable insight into his creative process. Art thefts have become a growing problem in Italy in recent years, with a number of major heists taking place across the country. In 2019, a number of important works by Renaissance master Caravaggio were stolen from a church in Palermo, sparking an international manhunt for the thieves. The Italian government has responded to the problem by implementing a range of measures, including increased funding for security and the formation of a dedicated anti-art-theft unit within the police force. However, many experts argue that more needs to be done to protect Italy's cultural heritage from criminal elements. As the investigation into the theft continues, many are left wondering who is responsible for this latest act of theft and what motivated them to take this valuable piece of art. For now, all eyes are on the police as they work to bring those responsible to justice and recover the stolen sketch.
