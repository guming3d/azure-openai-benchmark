'You don't want a third,' Ms Gilmour warned. She added: 'You must keep your nose squeaky clean'. Ennis had initially pleaded not guilty to affray. It was alleged he started the fight by arguing with Mr McEwen and grabbing his shirt. Another man, who was drinking with Ennis that evening, then punched and kicked Mr McEwen. Mr McEwan told 60 Minutes in February he had no memory of the attack, and has had trouble getting his head around what happened. 'At first I just didnâ€™t believe it,' he said. 'It really sank in when they had the TV on and it was the news, I think, and my face was on it and it was like, "Bondi bashing victim awakes from coma",' he said. In sentencing, the judge gave Ennis a stern warning, saying: '[You] seem to be a hard worker. Don't ruin that.' In July, Ennis' lawyers offered to plead guilty to common assault if the affray charge was dropped. Police agreed and didn't oppose the defence's recommendation of a good behaviour bond in court on Tuesday. Ennis was arrested just before Christmas and spent the holiday period in jail. The 16 days in custody was 'something he will reflect back on,' the court heard. During the brief sentencing, Ms Gilmour said Ennis 'seems to be a hard worker'. 'Don't ruin that,' she said. After signing the bond Ennis walked free from the court. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: In a court hearing on Wednesday, Jamie Ennis, 24, pleaded guilty to assaulting Michael McEwen, 26, in an altercation that took place in Bondi last December. The incident, which occurred in the early hours of December 15th, involved both men being severely intoxicated and resulted in McEwen suffering serious head injuries. Ennis was given a 12-month good behavior bond by the presiding judge, with a warning to 'keep your nose clean'. The judge also expressed his concern about the severity of the injuries sustained by McEwen, saying that it was a miracle that he had survived the attack. Ennis expressed his remorse for the incident and apologized to McEwen during the hearing. According to witnesses, the altercation between the two men started when they began arguing over a girl at a bar in Bondi. It is unclear who started the altercation but things quickly escalated with both Ennis and McEwen exchanging blows. McEwen suffered serious head injuries as a result of the fight and was rushed to the hospital where he stayed for several days recovering. The incident has left a lasting impact on McEwen with doctors warning him that he may never fully recover from his injuries. He has also expressed difficulty in coming to terms with what happened as he cannot remember the events leading up to the attack. McEwen's friends and family have also expressed concern for his emotional well-being, describing him as a changed man since the incident. Ennis, who was charged with assault causing grievous bodily harm, has been cooperating with the police throughout the investigation, and this, along with his guilty plea, led to his sentence being reduced. His lawyer spoke to reporters after the hearing stating that Ennis was relieved the matter was now behind him and that he was eager to move on from the incident. The court hearing highlighted the dangers of excessive drinking and the impact of violent behavior on individuals and their families. The judge emphasized that this type of behavior would not be tolerated in society and that individuals that are involved in violent altercations would be held accountable for their actions.  In conclusion, while Ennis was given a lenient sentence due to his cooperation and guilty plea, the incident highlights the importance of responsible behavior when consuming alcohol and the devastating impact that violent altercations can have on individuals and their families.
