article: (CNN) -- Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy's decision to skip the Players Championship at Sawgrass in May has been defended by their manager Andrew Chandler. World number one Westwood and Northern Ireland's rising star McIlroy are giving the tournament, dubbed the "fifth major" a wide berth, saying it did not fit their schedules. Both have opted to take up European Tour membership in 2011, meaning they can only play three events on the PGA Tour outside of the majors. Chandler told CNN that moving the PGA Tour's flagship tournament from just before the U.S. Masters to a slot in May had prompted the decisions of his star duo. "I would think when it was played at the end of the March it was getting to be the fifth major," said Chandler. "Moving it to the middle of May has made it about the 10th most important tournament in the world. "It isn't a priority for them as they would rather win a major or a world golf championship event," he added. The absence of current world number one Westwood from the TPC has been seen as a snub to the PGA Tour, but Chandler says it is purely down to the calendar. "They cannot play every week," he said. McIlroy has also denied reports of a rift with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem for abandoning the U.S. circuit after only one year as a full-time member. He wrote on his Twitter blog: "For everyone who is interested, the reason I'm not playing TPC this year is because I've never thought the golf course has set up that well for me. "Hence, two missed cuts in two years. I have no sort of vendetta against Tim Finchem or the PGA Tour; I love playing in the U.S. and have always found the people very welcoming." South Africa's Tim Clark won last year's Players Championship, with Westwood finishing tied for fourth, four shots behind.

chatgpt: The Players Championship, one of the most prestigious golf events of the year, is set to take place in mid-May this year. However, the tournament will be missing two of the biggest names in golf, Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy. According to their manager, Andrew Chandler, the decision to skip the tournament was based on scheduling conflicts. Last year's world number one, Lee Westwood, finished in fourth place at TPC. His absence this year will surely be disappointing to his fans, as well as to tournament organizers. Westwood's performance at the TPC last year was a testament to his skill and his ability to perform under pressure, and his presence at the tournament would have been a major draw for spectators. Rory McIlroy, on the other hand, has struggled with injuries over the past few months. His decision to skip the TPC may have been influenced by his need to focus on his health and recovery. McIlroy has been working hard to regain his top form, and he may have deemed it more important to rest and recuperate than to compete in the tournament. The Players Championship has always been an important event for professional golfers, and the move from the end of March to mid-May has only made it more significant. The tournament has a history of attracting the biggest names in golf, and this year is no exception. While some players have opted to skip the event, the field is still filled with talented golfers who are looking to make their mark.

This year's tournament promises to be just as difficult, as the players compete for the prestigious title and a share of the $15 million prize money. Fans will undoubtedly be eagerly anticipating the event, hoping to see their favorite golfers take home the trophy. In the end, the decision by Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy to skip the TPC may have been disappointing for their fans, but it was undoubtedly the right decision for their own personal circumstances. Golf is a demanding sport, both physically and mentally, and it is important for players to take care of themselves in order to perform at their best. As the tournament approaches, the remaining players will be gearing up for what promises to be an exciting and challenging event.
