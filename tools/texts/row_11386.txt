article: (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration advised concerned consumers Thursday to stop taking a popular cholesterol drug that may be contaminated with specks of glass if the pills came from one of 41 recalled lots. The recall of generic Lipitor was initiated nearly three weeks ago by Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, but this is the first time the FDA -- or anyone else -- has told consumers to stop taking the drug. The FDA also announced Thursday that Ranbaxy would stop making atorvastatin while it investigates how the glass might have gotten into the drug. Even with these new guidelines, some pharmacies are still telling customers it's safe to take the drug. "Patients should continue to proceed as they normally would," said Brian Henry, vice president of corporate communications at Express Scripts, on Thursday. He added that the company would not give customers refunds for the generic Lipitor, or atorvastatin. Cholesterol drug recalled over glass concerns . Henry explained that this was a "pharmacy-level recall," meaning pharmacies must stop dispensing contaminated lots of the drug, but consumers could keep taking what they already had at home -- even though the FDA has confirmed that some of the contaminated drug may have reached consumers. Pharmacists at several CVS stores also told customers it was OK to keep taking Ranbaxy's atorvastatin but said they would replace the drug at a patient's request. "This whole thing is confusing for consumers," said Lisa Gill, editor of prescription drugs at Consumer Reports. She also expressed concern that it took the FDA nearly three weeks to issue guidance to consumers. "It's not clear why it took them so long," she said. "It's surprising." FDA spokeswoman Sarah Clark-Lynn declined to comment on the reasons behind the delay. Recall leaves glass-specked drug in hands of patients . In its statement Thursday, the FDA said that the glass particles were "similar to the size of a grain of sand" and that "the possibility of adverse events related to the recalled product appear to be low." Making matters potentially even more confusing, the FDA directed concerned consumers to call their pharmacies to see whether their pills had been recalled, as not all lots of the drug are effected. However, pharmacists say they have no way of figuring out what lot number a bottle of pills came from. "The ability to tie a specific prescription to a lot number would be very difficult," said Ronna Hauser, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the National Community Pharmacists Association. Ranbaxy, India's largest pharmaceutical company and the 12th largest generics maker in the world, has had quality problems in the past. The FDA has accused the company of "a pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct," including taking shortcuts in crucial quality tests. So widespread and grave was the misbehavior that in 2008 the FDA barred Ranbaxy from importing 30 drugs into the United States.

chatgpt: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning to consumers who are still taking generic Lipitor pills from a recalled lot. The FDA stated that people should stop taking the drug immediately if it came from the recalled batch, which was pulled from the market three weeks ago. The recall was initiated because of a potential contamination issue that may cause serious health risks. However, despite the recall, it appears that some pharmacies are still telling customers that it is safe to take pills from the recalled lot. This has prompted the FDA to take further action, with the agency stating that it is working with the pharmacies involved to ensure that the recalled pills are removed from shelves and that customers are informed of the situation. Lipitor is a medication used to lower cholesterol levels, which is why it is such a highly prescribed drug. However, the contaminated batch could potentially cause severe health complications, and consumers who have been taking pills from the recalled lot are being urged to seek medical attention immediately. While the FDA's warning pertains specifically to generic Lipitor pills from the recalled lot, it is important to note that other medications may also be affected by similar issues. This serves as a reminder that consumers should always be vigilant when it comes to their medical treatments and medications. In the case of Lipitor, patients who have been taking the drug should check the lot number on the packaging and compare it to the recalled batch numbers. If there is a match, consumers should stop taking the medication immediately and contact their healthcare provider. Furthermore, the FDA is urging pharmacies and other healthcare providers to stop dispensing the recalled pills and to inform patients of the potential risks associated with the medication. The recall of generic Lipitor pills should serve as a reminder to consumers about the importance of staying informed about their medical treatments and the potential risks associated with them. While concerns over contaminated medications are relatively rare, it is always better to err on the side of caution to avoid any potential health complications. In conclusion, if you are currently taking Lipitor, it is essential to check the lot number on the packaging to ensure that your medication is not from the recalled batch. If you have any concerns, you should contact your healthcare provider immediately. The FDA is taking action to ensure that consumers are informed about the potential risks associated with the recalled pills and that all affected medication is removed from shelves. In the meantime, consumers should take extra precautions to ensure that they are not taking any potentially contaminated medications.
