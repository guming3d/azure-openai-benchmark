chatgpt: Residents in New York City's O'Neill Building on 6th Ave were forced to evacuate their homes and abandon their Christmas dinners when cracks were spotted in a structural wall on December 25th. The discovery was made above a five-foot pile of rubble lying in the street below. The incident throws into question the safety of the building's facade, which records show had been declared safe by inspectors earlier this year in February. The exact cause of the cracks is still under investigation but it is believed that the recent snowstorms may have been a contributing factor. Residents were surprised and shaken by the sudden turn of events, with many expressing concern and confusion as they left their homes. "We were just sitting down to enjoy our Christmas dinner when the evacuation order came through,” said one resident. "It's scary to think that we could have been living in a building that wasn't safe all this time." The O'Neill Building is a luxury residential tower located in the heart of Manhattan. It is a popular location for wealthy individuals and families looking for a prime spot to call home. The building boasts numerous amenities, including a fitness center, a swimming pool, and 24/7 security.
