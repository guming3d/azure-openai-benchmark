Police said the workers at York College Day Nursery were arrested on Monday and interviewed as part of ongoing inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death of Lydia Bishop on September 17. An inquest opening on Monday heard nursery staff and paramedics tried to save Lydia with CPR after she was found unresponsive on a slide in the outdoor playground with a rope tangled around her neck, it emerged today. York coroner Donald Coverdale said a number of children went to play outside some time after 2pm and it was believed that Lydia - whose first day it was at the nursery - wanted to use the slide. 'There came a time when a nursery worker spotted Lydia unresponsive on the slide, and there was a rope which had been attached to play equipment which was around her neck,' he said, opening the inquest into Lydia's death. 'I understand that staff immediately gave what help they could, administering CPR until paramedics arrived,' he said. The coroner said resuscitation attempts continued after the paramedics had taken Lydia to York Hospital, but it proved impossible to revive her, and it was confirmed at 3.27pm that she had died. A consultant pathologist, Dr Nigel Cooper, later carried out a post mortem examination and said the provisional cause of death was 'pressure on the neck.'
