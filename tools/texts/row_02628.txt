article: By . Sudipto Ganguly, Reuters . Not playing the Indian Premier League is the reason behind England's struggles in the shorter formats, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram said, a day after England great Ian Botham called for the rich Twenty20 competition to be scrapped. England were thumped 4-1 in Australia in their one-day international series at the beginning of the year and also lost recent series at home against Sri Lanka and India. Critics have flayed England's strategy and selections for the shorter formats, with some suggesting that the team does not care about anything other than test cricket. Struggling: England's lack of involvement in the IPL is hurting them in limited overs formats, says Wasim Akram . 'England may pretend as much as they can, but they do get affected by losses in ODI cricket,' the 48-year-old Akram, one of the all-time best pace bowlers of the world, wrote in a column published in Friday's Times of India newspaper. 'They just pretend to be not interested in the 50-over format. The only reason they are not good in one-day cricket right now is because they have a limited talent pool for the format.' England are currently ranked fifth in the world in ODIs and few would back them to win next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, a trophy the country has never won. Cause: Former Pakistan captain Akram says England have a limited talent pool in the 50-over format . While former England all-rounder Botham believes the franchise-based IPL has become too powerful and could be fuelling corruption in the game, Akram thinks not playing in the tournament is hurting England. India, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka - the teams ranked above England in the ODI ranking - all have players featuring in the IPL. Meanwhile, Kevin Pietersen, who was sacked from the national set-up, was the only England international in the tournament earlier this year. Some English players made themselves unavailable to prepare for the summer's Test matches but others went unsold, being unable to commit for the full duration of the April-May tournament due to the clash with the county season. Loner: Kevin Pietersen, here in action for Surrey, was the only Englishman in the most recent IPL . Former England captain Pietersen recently said that 50-over world champions India had benefited from the tournament as their younger players were given the opportunity to play with and against the world's best. Akram, one of Pakistan's main architects during their World Cup triumph in 1992, agreed. 'Australia, India and South Africa play all year around in the shorter formats. Also all these players play IPL,' Akram added. 'That has helped their cause. 'England used to have a few players in IPL, but even that has stopped. That is the reason why they are struggling big time in the shorter formats.'

chatgpt: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has suggested that the Indian Premier League (IPL) would help England players develop their skills. England's players have to skip the Indian tournament due to scheduling conflicts with their summer cricket season. Kevin Pietersen was the sole representative from England in this year's T20 tournament. England cricketing legend Ian Botham criticized the IPL, calling for it to be scrapped altogether. In contrast, Akram expressed the opinion that the IPL would be beneficial for the English team. In an interview with Outlook India, Akram said the competition would "teach them how to handle the pressure in the big games." England have already lost the current ODI series with India 3-0. Botham believes that the poor performance is partly because England's players are missing out on the chance to play in the IPL. "We have not been competitive enough because our players miss out on the IPL," he said in an interview with Sky Sports. The Indian Premier League is a club cricket tournament that takes place annually. It involves teams from Indian cities and has attracted some of the biggest names in international cricket. The competition runs for six weeks in April and May, which clashes with England's domestic season. This year, Kevin Pietersen was the only English player selected to play in the IPL. Botham's call to end the IPL has been met with mixed reactions. Some critics believe that the competition promotes a circus-like atmosphere around cricket and is damaging to the sport's traditional values. Meanwhile, others argue that the tournament provides a unique opportunity for players to test and develop their cricketing abilities in a highly competitive environment. Many of England's players would likely jump at the chance to play in the IPL. The competition is known for its high salaries and glamorous lifestyle, and the opportunity to play alongside some of the best players in the world is seen as a major attraction. In addition to the financial benefits, the IPL can also help players develop their skills in a high-pressure environment. This is especially important in limited-overs cricket, where quick thinking and adaptability are crucial traits for success. With England's series against India already lost, critics are calling for changes to be made to the scheduling of both the IPL and the English summer cricket season. Supporters of the IPL point out that England is one of the few countries that does not allow its players to take part in the competition, and argue that this is hurting the national team's chances of success. Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has added his voice to the debate, arguing that England's players are missing out on a valuable learning experience. With the next edition of the IPL set to take place in just a few months, the debate about the competition's impact on international cricket is likely to continue for some time.
