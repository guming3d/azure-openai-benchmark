article: Maroua, Cameroon (CNN) -- Flooding in Cameroon's Far North Region has killed nearly 30 people and affected more than 26,000 others, officials said Monday. More than 4,000 people in the Logone and Shari division were displaced, and more than 22,000 people in the region of Maga, Mayo-Danay division, also have been affected. Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary described the flooding as "a calamity," and he called for urgent action to save lives, livestock and property. Dana FM, a local radio station, said the death toll will grow as bodies are collected and identified. For the past few weeks, there has been no sign of the flood easing. The floodwaters have submerged areas like Benoue, Faro, Louti and Mayo. Homes, crops and barns have been destroyed and herds of livestock killed. Heavy rainfall that has lasted nearly a month has fractured the Lagdo Dam, causing the Benoe River to flood nearby villages. Cameroon's government has dispatched a military contingent to the area to help and evacuate victims, and the government of Morocco sent food and other aid Saturday. Aid agencies like Plan International Cameroon and the United Nations Population Fund are concerned about the potential spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and malaria. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized, and tents have been erected to house victims. Demian Toh, a Red Cross official, told CNN that food supplies are running low and the tents are inadequate for the tens of thousands of displaced flood victims. Toh said there were serious concerns about malnutrition among women and children. In 2010, flooding in northern Cameroon triggered an outbreak of cholera that claimed nearly 6,000 lives, according to official estimates. In neighboring Nigeria, dozens of dead bodies have been found floating in remote areas of Adamawa state. Officials there are blaming Cameroon for not alerting them before excess water was released from the Lagdo Dam. The disaster is being called the worst flooding in Cameroon in more than 60 years. Opposition party member Paul Ayah Abine said the casualties and the insufficient aid given to the thousands of victims show clearly that the government has a fragile emergency unit that cannot predict and respond quickly to natural disasters.

chatgpt: Nearly a month of relentless rainfall has left a trail of destruction in Cameroon's Far North Region. Homes, crops and barns have been destroyed and livestock have perished as floods ravaged through the region. As the rescue efforts continue, there are fears that the death toll will rise as bodies are being found in the aftermath.  The situation escalated when a dam fracture led to the rise in water levels of a nearby river, causing it to surge through the villages, destroying everything in its path. Villagers were caught by surprise, and were unable to prepare for the sudden onslaught of water. Over time, the water levels rose so high that it became impossible to leave the village by car or on foot.  The government's response to the disaster has been heavily criticised. Aid has been slow to trickle in, and relief supplies have yet to reach many of the flood victims. As the region remains cut off from basic necessities, people are struggling to find shelter and food. Many are also forced to drink contaminated water, putting their health at risk.  According to local reports, the flooded villages are facing severe challenges. With the destruction of most of the homes and crops, food supplies have been severely disrupted. The lack of clean water and sanitation is also leading to hygiene concerns.  The humanitarian organizations and emergency services have been working tirelessly to provide aid and restore essential services. However, with the scale of the disaster, their efforts are not enough, and require government support.  As rescue efforts continue, aid agencies are calling on the government to speed up relief efforts, and provide essential support to the affected communities. They are also urging international donors to come forward and provide funding and other resources to help those impacted by the floods.  In conclusion, the devastating floods in Cameroon's Far North region have caused immense damage, loss of lives, homes, and crops, and disrupted the lives of many people. As the rescue efforts continue, the government must act swiftly and provide much-needed aid to those affected by the floods, while also making efforts to prevent future disasters.
