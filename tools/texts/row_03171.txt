article: An American teenager is eager to become a citizen of the country she was born in, but has had no luck thanks to her parents decision to never legally register her. Alecia Pennington, 19, claims that she was born at home and then never sent to school, taught instead by her mother. What's more, her parents never got her a birth certificate or a social security number she claims, which has made it impossible for her to receive any of the rights of an American citizen. However, her mother, Lisa Pennington, is telling a far different story. Scroll down for video . Alecia Pennington (above) claims that she was born at home and then never sent to school, taught instead by her mother . The 19-year-old is therefore unable to show proof of her identity, and cannot get a birth certificate . Alecia has made a video in a bid to get some support, or help, obtaining the documents she claims to need to declare herself an American citizen. 'I was homeschooled my entire life, so I had no school records,' Pennington explains. 'Also, never been to the hospital, so I have no medical records. This leaves me with nothing to prove my identity or citizenship.' Should this be true, she would be a victim of identification abuse. It seems that Alecia, who is one of nine children, left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side. Alecia is one of nine children (above with their father), and left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side . Alecia's mother Lisa (left with Alecia and her three sisters) claims her daughter is misleading people . Her mother, a popular blogger in the homeschool community, wrote about this, but has since taken the post down on her blog, The Pennington Point. Mrs. Pennington also posted a video in response to Alecia's video on YouTube, but took that down as well. Alecia does have older siblings, and it is unclear if they have licenses or any form of identification, though her mother has claimed they do. She also claims that her daughter does have a birth certificate to the best of her knowledge. It is also worth noting that after Alecia released this video and started a Help Me Prove It Facebook and Twitter page, her father bought the domain name, making it impossible for her to use. Mr. Pennington, a tax lawyer, claims that he and his wife just want to speak to their daughter, and she is free to do as she wishes.

chatgpt: Alecia Pennington, a 19-year old from Texas, has been making headlines recently after claiming that she was born at home and never received a formal education. The reason: her parents didn't send her to school and instead opted to teach her at home. However, her situation is far more complicated than just being a homeschooled student. Alecia's parents never got her a birth certificate or social security card, leaving her without any official papers to prove her existence or citizenship. As a result, Alecia cannot get a driver's license, passport, or access to many government services, including college financial aid. In essence, she is practically invisible in the eyes of the law. Alecia's predicament first gained attention when she decided to leave her family's home in September 2015 with the help of her grandparents. She had been living with them for the past few years after growing increasingly frustrated with her parents and unable to pursue a normal life without any official identification. She started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to get a birth certificate and other necessary documentation, which quickly went viral and garnered thousands of dollars in support. However, Alecia's parents dispute her claims and say she is lying. They claim she does have a birth certificate and that she could get a passport or driver's license if she wanted to. Alecia's mother, Lisa Pennington, wrote in a blog post that she had given birth to Alecia at home and that she had filed paperwork with the state of Texas to register Alecia's birth. She also claimed that Alecia had been homeschooled alongside her seven siblings and had received a great education. But Alecia says her parents are lying and that she has never seen her birth certificate or any paperwork related to her existence. In a statement to CNN, she said, "I have never personally seen any evidence of my existence or citizenship. My parents have always told me that they didn't need to register my birth or get me a social security card." This situation raises many questions about the responsibilities of parents and the rights of children when it comes to education and citizenship. While homeschooling is legal in all 50 states, parents are required to register their children for homeschooling and comply with certain regulations, such as maintaining attendance records and providing proof of academic progress. However, there are no federal laws that require parents to obtain a birth certificate or social security card for their child. Alecia's story has sparked a debate about the importance of official identification and the consequences of not having it. Without a birth certificate, a person may find it difficult, if not impossible, to access basic services such as healthcare, education, and government benefits. Alecia's struggle also highlights the need for greater transparency when it comes to homeschooling and the importance of ensuring that all children have the opportunity to receive a quality education. For Alecia, the fight for her identity and citizenship continues. She has been working with a lawyer to try to obtain her birth certificate and other necessary documentation. She also hopes her story will raise awareness of the challenges faced by those without official identification and prompt change in how birth registration is handled.
