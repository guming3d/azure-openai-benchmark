article: (CNN) -- It is 1a.m. at the Manila offices of VXi and nearly everyone is on the phone. Hundreds of employees, each wearing a headset, are answering calls from thousands of miles away, providing technical advice and sales services to customers of some of the United States' best-known companies. VXi is at the center of one of the Philippine's greatest economic success stories of the last decade: call centers. Industry experts estimate that the industry here has grown to $11 billion and employs over 600,000 workers. That's even more than in India. "You'd be hard pressed to find families that don't have one person in their families employed in the call center industry," says Eppie Titong, senior site director at VXi's Manila office. While the Philippines has struggled to grow other industries such as manufacturing or tourism, the country has found it is uniquely positioned to excel in the call center business. Thanks to historical ties to the United States, the Philippines has a large, English-speaking population, with an accent that many consider light or easy for the American ear. Most Filipinos are also familiar with American cultural exports, ranging from American Idol to Krispy Kreme donuts. This informal bond, employers say, makes it easier for them to relate to Americans over the telephone. Philippine culture is also known for its hospitality. "We are friendly," says call center supervisor Audison "Ives" Tan Dejos. "We do care. We have the empathy." On the economic front, the Philippines is an affordable place to do business. An entry-level call center employee can make about $470 a month, which is a very good salary for the Philippines but far less than their counterparts are paid in the U.S. or Europe. The influx of outsourced jobs is a major gift for a country that struggles to put its more than 90 million people to work. The official unemployment rate is around 7% and many people are forced to settle for part-time jobs. Not that the call center industry is going to fix all the country's employment problems. 600,000 is a drop in the bucket compared to the size of the population and these jobs are targeted primarily at those with a college education. "Who can provide jobs for moderately skilled workers like high school graduates or less educated workers?" asks Norio Usui, Senior Country Economist at the Asian Development Bank. "The Philippines has plenty of such workers also." For Tan Dejos, whose wife also works at VXi, the work is stressful at times but it allows them to comfortably support their three children. He doesn't mind the night shift, he says, and he likes the challenge of being in an emerging industry. Would he want his kids to work at a call center? "I would," he says without hesitation. "It's really up to them."

chatgpt: The Philippines has surpassed India in the number of call center workers, according to industry experts. This is not only a significant milestone for the country's economy, but also for the call center industry as a whole. With an estimated worth of $11 billion, the business has become a significant contributor to the Philippine economy. One of the reasons why the Philippines has become a popular destination for call center outsourcing is the soft accent and historical ties to the United States. American companies prefer this option as it helps improve customer experience, since callers can have better communication with agents who can understand them more easily. In addition, Filipino call center agents also provide excellent customer service, making them highly favored and professionals in the field. In recent years, the Philippine government has supported the growth of the call center industry, leading to a surge in employment opportunities in the country. According to the Philippine Call Center Industry, there are over 1 million full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in the industry. This is a huge leap from the 2,400 FTE workers who were employed in the country's first call center operation back in 1999.  The outsourcing boom in the Philippines started during the early 2000s when call center firms discovered the country's untapped, English-speaking talent pool. Notably, the country's low-cost environment had helped entice businesses that wanted to save on operating expenses but still provide quality customer service.  The rise of the call center industry in the Philippines has been a game-changer for the country's economy. It has contributed significantly to the creation of jobs, boosting the country's GDP, and increasing foreign investment in the economy. Moreover, the Philippines traditionally has a strong business relationship with the US, only strengthened by the outsourcing boom. Today, most of the country's call center clients are US-based corporations. The industry has enabled the Philippines to leverage its geopolitical relationships with the US and provided stability and growth to an ever-expanding global market. At present, the call center industry accounts for over 7% of the Philippines' gross domestic product (GDP) and is one of the significant drivers of the country's economy, competing with exports such as semi-conductors and remittances from overseas workers. Furthermore, the country's government's continued efforts to promote the growth of the outsourcing industry have led to the creation of more business opportunities and increased competitiveness among international firms. In conclusion, the rise of the Philippines' call center industry is a testament to the country's continuing economic growth and its ability to compete globally. With its loyal team of English-speaking agents, a low-cost operating environment, and support from the government, it has become a key player in the international outsourcing market. Undoubtedly, the industry's success is one of the best things that happened to the country and has given Filipinos the opportunity to showcase their world-class talent and skills in customer service.
