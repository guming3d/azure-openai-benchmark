Investment: Roger Penny, 73, bought the ancient monument as a pension investment . A retired businessman who owns one of Britain’s most important prehistoric monuments caused serious damage with illegal building work, a court heard. Roger Penny, 73, bought one of the four giant earthwork rings, known as Priddy Circles, as a pension investment. The rings – which date back to 3,000BC – are a Scheduled Ancient Monument built at the same time as Stonehenge. They have been described by English Heritage as ‘probable Neolithic ritual or ceremonial monuments similar to a henge’. Penny hired two contractors to ‘tidy’ and renovate the area, near the village of Priddy on Somerset’s Mendip Hills, but failed to get permission from English Heritage. One contractor used rubble to fill swallet holes, natural holes inside the ring which may be the key to its creation. Moving a gate led to agricultural machinery driving through the circle, making ruts, the court heard. Penny, from Litton, Somerset, admitted causing or permitting works to a scheduled monument without consent. He was ordered to pay £37,000  for restoration work, fined £2,500 and told to pay costs of £7,500. Prosecutor David Maunder told Taunton Crown Court: ‘These  circles are regarded as among a small group of the country’s most important prehistoric monuments, with enormous potential to inform us about the Neolithic period, and in archaeological terms are internationally significant.’ The court heard Penny bought a house and adjoining land, which included one of the rings. Monument: The Priddy Circle on Mr Penny's land. The brown areas show where the ring was damaged . He wanted to renovate and let the properties, and instructed  contractors to clear gorse and bracken, move a gate and help rebuild a wall. But he did so  without contacting English Heritage to ask for advice about how to carry out the work. He knew the circle was scheduled and told the contractors not to touch the ring, but because part  of the site is not visible to the naked eye ‘serious damage’ was caused. Charles Rowe, defending, said his client deeply regretted what had happened. Recorder Jeremy Wright told Penny: ‘Although the part you bought might not have been visually spectacular, commonsense would have told you the land inside the circle was also important.’

chatgpt: Roger Penny, a 73-year-old man from the UK, made an unusual but lucrative investment back in the 1990s when he bought Priddy Circles in Somerset. The site is an ancient monument that dates back to 3,000 BC, the same age as Stonehenge.  Initially, many people thought that Penny was crazy to invest in such an unusual asset. However, his decision has paid off handsomely. Today, the Priddy Circles is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area, drawing in thousands of visitors each year.  The Priddy Circles consists of a ring of six concentric circles, with a diameter of around 35 meters, made up of standing stones. The monument is believed to have been used for ceremonial purposes by the people who lived in the area around 5000 years ago.  Penny purchased the site back in 1998 for what was then considered a lot of money, around £32,000. Over the years, he has carried out various repairs to the monument to help preserve it for future generations. The site was even granted scheduled monument status in recognition of its historical importance. Today, the Priddy Circles has become a popular attraction for both tourists and locals alike. The site is a fascinating example of the kind of monuments that our ancient ancestors built thousands of years ago. It is also one of the few remaining examples of this kind of monument in the UK, making it a unique and valuable asset.  In addition to its historical importance, the Priddy Circles has also been used as the location for several films and TV shows, further adding to its value. In 2019, it was reported that Penny had turned down offers of up to £1 million for the monument, choosing instead to hold onto his investment for the time being. Penny’s decision to invest in the Priddy Circles may have seemed unusual at the time, but it has proven to be a wise choice. Today, the monument is a valuable asset that has helped to bring visitors to the area and promote the UK's rich history. As such, it serves as a reminder of the value of investing in our heritage and preserving it for future generations.
