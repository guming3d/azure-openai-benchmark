article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jewish students at New York University have been targeted by a pro-Palestinian group that reportedly slipped 'eviction' notices under the doors of several Jewish students in one of the university's Greenwich Village residents halls last week. 'If you do not vacate the premise by midnight on 25 April, 2014 we . reserve the right to destroy all remaining belongings. We cannot be held . responsible for property or persons remaining inside the premises,' the fake eviction slips read. The NYU student group Students for Justice in Palestine have taken credit for notices, which came with a disclaimer at the bottom stating, 'this is not an eviction notice,' and explaining that the notices were meant to draw attention to the group's claim that the Israeli government issues similar eviction notices to Palestinians living in Israel. Phony: These phony eviction notices were slid under the doors of several of NYU's Jewish students . NYU's Palladium residence hall on 14th Street in Manhattan reportedly was targeted because of its large Jewish population . The pro-Palestinian group targeted the NYU resident housing facility Palladium, on East 14th Street in Manhattan, because it is believed to house a lot of NYU's Jewish students, the Times of Israel reports - according to the paper, the building even has elevators that operate without buttons for students acknowledging the Sabbath. A spokesman for NYU says the prank crossed a line. 'It is disappointingly inconsistent with standards we expect to prevail . in a scholarly community,' spokesman John Beckman told the New York Post. 'Our Residence Life and Housing . Office will be communicating with the students in the dorm, looking . into the matter, and following up appropriately.' According to Beckman, it's unclear why the group targeted the Palladium dorms. Credit: The student group Students for Justice in Palestine have taken credit for the 'eviction' notices . 'However, were it to be the case that the fliering was done there . because it was perceived to be a dorm with a higher proportion of Jewish . students, that would be troubling, dismaying and a matter of deep . concern for our community,' Beckman said. Students for Justice for Palestine took credit for the fliers in a blog post on its NYU website. 'NYU SJP's eviction action created more dialogue than ever before,' the headline of a blog post on the site reads. Students say they we troubled by the phony eviction notices. 'Dialogue': The students seem to thing their stunt was a success and has 'created...dialogue' 'We thought we were getting evicted. We were panicking a little bit,' sophomore Gabrielle Doria, 20, told the paper. Similar pranks, the paper reports, have recently happened at other universities, including Rutgers, Michigan and Northwestern.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident at New York University's (NYU) residence hall, eviction notices were slid under the doors of Jewish students. The notices were found in Palladium Hall on the morning of March 25th, 2021. It has since been discovered that the group Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) has taken credit for the act. According to reports, the notices stated that the residents' rooms were to be "expropriated" as they belonged to "people native to the land." The notice also mentioned the Palestinian village of Lifta, which was forcefully emptied during the Nakba of 1948. The stated reason for this is that the Israeli government routinely evicts Palestinians living in Israel, and this was the SJP's way of drawing attention to the issue. The news of the eviction notices quickly spread across the campus, sparking outrage among the Jewish community. Jewish student groups and leaders immediately condemned the action, calling it an act of antisemitism. Several student groups have also called on the university administration to take immediate action and ensure the safety of Jewish students on campus. In response to the incident, Andrew Hamilton, President of NYU, issued a statement condemning the act as a violation of the university's values. Hamilton also assured the community that the university would take all necessary steps to investigate the matter and hold the perpetrators accountable. While SJP has claimed responsibility for the act, it remains unclear whether it acted alone or in coordination with any other group. Several Jewish advocacy groups have accused SJP of promoting anti-Israel and anti-Semitic views on campus. In recent years, the group's activities have been the subject of several controversies, including accusations of promoting violence and hate speech. The incident has once again highlighted the growing tensions between Israel and Palestine on college campuses in the United States. While students have the right to express their views on a range of issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such acts of intimidation are unacceptable and can create an unsafe environment for Jewish students. The University has said it is committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all students and is working to address the concerns of the Jewish community. However, this incident has left many students feeling vulnerable and afraid. The University must take swift and decisive action to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. In conclusion, the eviction notices slid under the doors of Jewish students at NYU, allegedly by the group Students for Justice in Palestine, have sparked outrage and condemnation from the Jewish community. While some may argue that freedom of expression is a fundamental right, it is equally important to ensure that all students feel safe on campus and are free from intimidation and harassment.
