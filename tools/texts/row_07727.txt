A court in Norway has banished convicted 'hate preacher' Mullah Krekar (pictured) to a remote village after ignoring his lawyer's claims he had a right to a family life . He was released from prison at the end of January after serving a two-year, 10-month sentence for making threats against Prime Minister Erna Solberg, before she came to office, and three Kurds. The police had invoked special measures to order Krekar, whose real name is Najmeddine Faraj Ahmad, to live in a refugee unit in the remote community of Kyrksaeteroera. The defence had argued that the court needed to examine the legality of the decision, which prohibits the married father of four from leaving the village and which requires him to report to local police three times a week. 'With some misgivings, the court considers that the basic national interest, at least until 31 December 2015, must take precedence over Faraj's right to a family life, freedom to move freely throughout the country and to choose his own place of residence,' read the court's decision.

Police have been given the green light to exile Iraqi Kurd Mullah Krekar to a refugee centre in a village of 2,500 people situated 300 miles from the capital Oslo (pictured) Krekar's lawyer, Brynjar Meling, appealed the decision and asked that it be suspended pending review. Krekar has been living under risk of deportation since 2003 after Norwegian authorities ordered him to be expelled, claiming he posed a threat to national security. While Norway's court system has upheld the ruling, Norwegian law bars him from being deported to Iraq, where he risks the death penalty. While Krekar acknowledges having co-founded Ansar al-Islam, he insists he has not led the group since 2002. The preacher and the group Ansar al-Islam figure on United Nations and U.S. lists of terrorist groups or individuals.

chatgpt: Mullah Krekar, the founder of a notorious radical Islamist group in Norway, has been banished to a remote village 300 miles away from Oslo, the country's capital. The 58-year-old was jailed for making threats against Norway's Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, and he was released just a few days ago after serving his sentence of two years and ten months. Following his release, a court has authorized the Norwegian police to deport Krekar to a remote refugee center. The police have stated that they are taking the necessary measures to relocate him to a secured location in the coming days. Mullah Krekar, whose real name is Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad, has been living in Norway since 1991. He founded the radical Islamist group Ansar al-Islam, which is known for its links to international Jihadist networks. The group has been involved in numerous terror attacks and has been designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including Norway. Mullah Krekar's banishment comes after years of legal battles and several failed attempts to deport him. The Norwegian authorities have accused him of promoting terrorist activities and recruiting followers to carry out Jihadist attacks in the country. The government has been under increasing pressure to take action against Krekar, with many calling for his deportation. The Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, has stated that Mullah Krekar is a threat to national security and that he should not be allowed to remain in Norway. The decision to banish Mullah Krekar has been met with mixed reactions. Some believe that he should have been deported a long time ago, while others have criticized the move, arguing that it goes against Norway's principles of freedom and democracy. Despite the controversy, the authorities have pledged to continue their efforts to combat extremism and terrorism in Norway. The country has been a target of several terror attacks in recent years, including the 2011 attacks by right-wing extremist Anders Breivik that claimed the lives of 77 people. In conclusion, the banishment of Mullah Krekar to a remote village is a significant development in Norway's fight against extremism and terrorism. While the move has been criticized by some, it is a clear message that the Norwegian authorities will take decisive action against those who pose a threat to national security.
