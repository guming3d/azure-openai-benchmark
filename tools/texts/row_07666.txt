It has been suggested that she could face up to five years in prison if charged and found guilty. But Maznah has claimed the video was filmed in 2010 and has nothing to do with insulting Islam. She said that she was simply reminding people to celebrate Eid al-Fitr - a holiday which marks the end of Ramadan and literally means ‘the festival of breaking the fast’ - with animals and humans.

chatgpt: Maznah Mohd Yusof, a 38-year old woman, found herself at the center of controversy after a video of her celebrating the Eid al-Fitr festival went viral online. The clip, which features Maznah washing her dog's legs and feeding them biscuits, has been investigated on suspicion of causing disharmony on religious grounds. Maznah was arrested last Wednesday and taken into custody before being released. The video, which has since been taken down, shows Maznah dressed in traditional Muslim attire while she tends to her pet dog. The video caused outrage among some Muslims, who felt that Maznah's actions were disrespectful to the festival and to Islam. The authorities were alerted to the video and soon launched an investigation into the matter. Police arrested Maznah on Wednesday and took her into custody for questioning. She was later released on bail and is now awaiting trial. The incident has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many people expressing their opinions on the matter. While some have defended Maznah's actions as harmless, others have accused her of disrespecting the Eid al-Fitr festival and the Muslim community as a whole. Maznah has since apologized for the incident, saying that she had no intention of causing offense or disrespect. "I love my dog and treat it like a member of my family," she said. "I was not aware that my actions could cause offense to anyone." Despite her apology, the incident has caused a great deal of anger and frustration among some members of the Muslim community. Many feel that Maznah's actions were insensitive and disrespectful, and that the incident highlights a lack of understanding and respect for religious values and traditions. The authorities have yet to release any official statement on the matter, but the incident has raised important questions about the relationship between religion and animal welfare. While many people believe that animals should be treated with kindness and respect, others argue that religious values and traditions should take precedence over animal rights. As the debate continues, many are calling for greater understanding and tolerance between different religious and cultural communities. While incidents like this may be controversial and divisive, they also offer an opportunity for people to come together and learn from one another. Only time will tell how this incident will shape the ongoing conversation on animal welfare and religious tolerance.
