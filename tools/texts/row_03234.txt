Who's a clever boy: Duggy the parrot began impersonating chickens from a children's TV show - and not cannot stop clucking . Michelle Lamond, 47, from Seafield, West Lothian, said: 'She does it all the time now. She's a chicken now from morning until night. 'I think she's hilarious. My family think the same. They just laugh at her.' The strange noises began after Ms Lamond left on the TV Â o keep Duggy amused while she was out. Hours later, she came home to find the bird clucking away. She said: 'I just came down the other day and she was going on like a chicken, I was like "Oh my God where did that come from?" 'Then I realised it came from the telly. If I go out during the day, I either put the radio or the TV on so there is always some background noise. 'I put on Baby TV and it's obviously came from that. I don't know what programme it was but I know it came from Baby TV.' Not so bird-brained: The two-year old African grey, from West Lothian, also tries to bark like a dog and likes to sing along to Colonel Bogey . The multi-talented parrot also whistles Colonel Bogey and even tries her hand at being a barking dog, according to her owners. Ms Lamond, who has owned Duggy since she was a chick, said: 'Her first couple of outbursts in the morning are loud. She likes to let you know she's awake. 'She also whistles away to the Colonel Bogey song. She really keeps us amused. She can also whine like our Dalmatian Cal and I'm sure the bark will come. 'The dog is five months and its quite fun to watch the two of them together. It's a madhouse. 'I actually came down the other day and wondered whether it was the dog or her whining, and it was her. 'She makes various noises. She'll say "I love you" and "Hello Duggy" and she sings songs here and there. She's quite a tame parrot. She'll take food out your hand. 'If you have something and she wants it, she'll fly on to the plate and try get a bit. She can fly onto you and try steal your food.' Huband Kenneth, 50, added: 'The only thing we can think of is that she picked it up from the cartoons in the morning on the television.'

chatgpt: In a bizarre turn of events, a two-year-old dog from West Lothian has transformed its behaviour after mimicking a chicken on a cartoon show. The dog, named Duggy, now spends all day clucking and has abandoned its previous patterns of barking and yelping. According to the dog's owner Michelle, 47, the change in the dog's personality has been stark. "She's a chicken now from morning until night," Michelle stated. "Her cawing has ceased entirely and she just makes clucking noises instead. It's quite amusing to watch, but I do miss her old ways." The transformation began after Duggy was exposed to a chicken character on a popular cartoon show. Michelle noticed that Duggy began to mimic the chicken's characteristic sounds, and after a few weeks, the dog's behaviour had dramatically changed. Michelle has attributed the change to a sense of playfulness in the dog's personality. "She's always been a bit of a clown, so it's not completely surprising that she's taken on this new personality," Michelle explained. "But it's quite amazing to see how quickly she's adapted to it. She even whistles along to the tune of Colonel Bogey now, and likes to imitate the whine of a Dalmatian." Some animal behaviour experts have suggested that the change in Duggy's behaviour could be the result of conditioning. They believe that the dog may have become so fixated on mimicking the chicken that it has lost its sense of its own identity. However, Michelle insists that Duggy still responds to her name and still carries out other dog-like actions, such as chasing squirrels and playing with other dogs. Despite the novelty of the situation, Michelle admits that the change in Duggy's behaviour is not without its challenges. "It can be a bit difficult when we go out for walks," Michelle said. "People are always stopping us to ask why she's clucking like a chicken. Some people even think we've trained her to do it for our entertainment." While the change in Duggy's behaviour may be amusing, Michelle is keen to ensure that her dog remains healthy and happy. She has consulted with a veterinarian, who has confirmed that Duggy is in good health and that her new personality is not harmful. For now, Duggy appears content to continue her new career as a chicken impersonator. Whether the novelty will wear off is yet to be seen, but one thing is clear: the transformation in Duggy's behaviour is a testament to the adaptable nature of dogs and their tendency to take on the traits of other animals.
