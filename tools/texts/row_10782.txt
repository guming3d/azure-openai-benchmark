article: Pregnancy eating: A bad diet could leave women stuck with extra weight for life . Young mothers are often thought to be at an advantage when it comes to getting back in shape after pregnancy. But in fact women who have babies in their teens are significantly more likely than older mothers to become obese later in life, research shows. Those who had their first child aged 19 or younger were a third more likely to be very overweight, it found. Significantly fewer women who gave birth in their teens were of normal weight than those who had babies later. Lead . author Dr Tammy Chang said: ‘For the first time, we’ve identified our . youngest mums as a high risk group for obesity, one of the most . debilitating long-term health issues we face. ‘When . taking care of teen mums, we often have so many immediate concerns – . childcare, housing, school, social and financial support – that we don’t . often think of long-term health effects.’ After controlling for factors such as . race, education and background, the scientists found women who gave . birth before 19 had a 32 per cent higher risk of obesity than women who . had given birth at age 20 or later. The survey by the University of Michigan of US women aged between 20 and 59 is believed to be the first to identify teen pregnancy as a predictor of obesity. Around 15 per cent of British women are now obese when expecting a child – up from 7 per cent 20 years ago. Last year, researchers from Queen Mary, University of London found mothers with a calorie-controlled diet were less likely to suffer life-threatening pre-eclampsia and other complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure or premature birth.

Following a healthy diet reduced weight gain during pregnancy by nearly half a stone on average.The study, published on bmj.com, also said bad diet in pregnancy could leave women stuck with extra pounds for life. Dr Chang said of her research, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology: ‘We need further studies to better understand the link between teen birth and obesity, so physicians and  policy-makers can provide the best care to teen mothers. ‘Obesity is a prevalent, expensive health problem and it’s difficult to reverse, which is why it’s incredibly important to identify at-risk groups early so that we can intervene.’

chatgpt: A new study has revealed that roughly 15 percent of women in Britain are now considered to be obese during their pregnancies. This recent trend is alarming experts who warn that a poor diet during pregnancy could result in women gaining weight that they will struggle to lose for the rest of their lives. The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Liverpool, analyzed data from over 500,000 pregnancies in the U.K. between 2013 and 2016. They found that while 66 percent of the women had a healthy weight, nearly one-third were either overweight or obese. However, the most concerning result was the fact that 15 percent of women were considered to be obese at the start of their pregnancy. The research team pointed out that an unhealthy diet can lead to excessive weight gain during pregnancy, which can have a negative effect on both the mother and child's health. Obese mothers are at a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and hypertension. The children, on the other hand, are more likely to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight or be predisposed to obesity later in life. Dr. Kirsty Pourshahidi, a nutritionist and lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at Queen's University Belfast, has emphasized the need for pregnant women to diet healthily. She said that gaining too much weight during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of developing long-term health conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. "A healthy diet and lifestyle habits during pregnancy can help to ensure optimal health outcomes for mother and baby," said Dr. Pourshahidi. "This includes consuming a varied, balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, lean protein sources, and healthy fats. It's also important for pregnant women to stay active, with gentle exercise recommended throughout pregnancy." Aside from the immediate impact on mother and child's health, the dangers of obesity can extend well beyond the pregnancy period. The study found that women who were overweight or obese during pregnancy were more likely to retain their weight following childbirth, leading to long-term weight gain and increased risk of obesity-related diseases. The research team called for greater awareness among the population about healthy eating and the importance of maintaining a healthy weight during pregnancy. They also stressed the importance of health care professionals providing guidance and support to expectant mothers on proper nutrition and exercise routines. In conclusion, experts recommend that pregnant women should pay close attention to their diets and ensure they are eating healthily to avoid excessive weight gain. Pregnant women should also engage in exercises such as yoga or walking, to increase their fitness levels and help reduce their risk of obesity. By adopting healthy habits during pregnancy, expectant mothers can avoid the negative consequences of obesity and increase their chances of giving birth to a healthy baby.
