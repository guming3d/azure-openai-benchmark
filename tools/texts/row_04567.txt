According to the report, the woman called law enforcement officials around 7 am after she saw a stranger, later identified as Sunonna Marie Hink, in her home. The caller had no idea how the woman had gained access to her house. Upon arrival, police officers noted that Hink appeared to be intoxicated and was carrying an open container of alcohol. When the homeowner approached Hink, the stranger allegedly stood up and hugged the homeowner, expressing her love for her. Despite the hug, the homeowner was understandably unnerved by the stranger's presence and immediately called the police. When officers questioned Hink, she reportedly became agitated and began vandalizing the home. As a result, she was subsequently charged with public intoxication, open container, and malicious mischief. The Springfield Police Department has not released any further details regarding this bizarre incident. However, they urge residents to remain vigilant about their home security and report any suspicious activity in their neighborhoods.
