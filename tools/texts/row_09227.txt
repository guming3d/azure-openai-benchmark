article: A sales consultant is suing real estate firm Zillow for sexual harassment after she was allegedly ranked on breast size and sent pictures of colleagues' penises. Rachel Kremer claims she was sent graphic emails and pictures, objectified by her superiors and asked to perform sexual acts repeatedly for six months. Filing a federal suit, she described the revered company's Irvine, California, branch as an 'adult frat house'. Allegations: Rachel Kremer says she felt objectified by texts sent from her colleague Gabe Schmidt at Zillow . Ms Kremer claims she endured 'sexual torture' and said she is speaking out for other 'silenced' women . Ms Kremer, who worked at Zillow between June 2012 and August 2014, said she and other female empoyees endured 'sexual torture'. The firm has hit back, citing vulgar texts between Ms Kremer and her colleague Gabe Schmidt to show she was complicit in the exchanges. Her attorney, CNN legal analyst Ben Meiselas, insists this is evidence of 'brainwashing'. 'As to the substance of their motion, what has become clear is that employees were encouraged by management to use foul language in order to maintain a paycheck at Zillow,' Meiselas told GeekWire. 'Being brainwashed by this corporate culture does not invite actual unwanted sexual advances and physical touching.' According to Ms Kremer, her action speaks for others who have been 'silenced'. 'Adult frat house': Ms Kremer likens her former colleagues' behavior to that of a college fraternity . Law suit: Her attorney is arguing that Ms Kremer played along with the jokes because she was brainwashed . The suit states: 'Ms Kremer's male supervisors ranked her according to her breast size, sent pictures of their penis to her, and demanded sexual gratification and obedience by Ms Kremer to continue her employment.' Two colleagues, including Mr Schmidt, have been fired over the incident, GeekWire reported. Zillow was named in the list of America's top 50 companies to work for this week. An employee satisfaction survey collated by Glassdoor.com pegged the firm at 33, a notch above Ford Motor Company and two below NBC Universal. Action: The company said two employees were fired over Ms Kremer's complaint before the case started . However, the sexual harassment claim comes days after another suit accuses the Irvine branch of penalizing an employee who reported unlawful behavior in his department. James Friedrich was allegedly deprived of multiple promotions after he reported that a co-worker fraudulently boosted their sales figures. The suit claims Mr Friedrich was told to 'drop it' and 'stop hanging out' with two of his friends when he brought the claim to his superiors.

chatgpt: A former employee of a California-based financial services firm has filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging a hostile work environment over the span of her employment. Rachel Kremer, who worked for the branch located in Irvine, California, alleges that she was subjected to crude and explicit behavior by her male colleagues and superiors. According to the lawsuit, Kremer was sent unsolicited pictures of male colleagues' genitals and was ranked based on her breast size. She also alleges that she was asked to perform sexual acts by her supervisors, and that the company ignored her complaints and failed to provide adequate support in addressing the issue. Kremer describes the branch as an "adult frat house" environment where sexualized behavior and derogatory comments were common. She noted that the behavior was not limited to her gender, but also to female colleagues and clients. The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, names the company and several individuals as defendants. It seeks damages for emotional distress, lost wages, and other damages. This is not the first time that the company has faced allegations of a hostile work environment. In 2018, a former male employee filed a similar lawsuit against the same branch, alleging discrimination and harassment based on his sexual orientation. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. The financial services firm has not yet publicly commented on the lawsuit, but issued a statement in 2018 regarding the previous lawsuit, stating that it "does not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment." Experts note that cases like Kremer's highlight the importance of companies taking swift action to address complaints of harassment and discrimination. Failing to do so can not only lead to legal consequences, but also damage a company's reputation and harm employee morale. Kremer's lawsuit comes amid a larger national conversation around workplace harassment and discrimination. The #MeToo movement, which gained traction in 2017, has prompted many individuals to speak out about their experiences and advocate for change in the way employers handle such issues. As for Kremer, she hopes that her lawsuit will not only hold her former employer accountable, but also raise awareness about the prevalence of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. "I want to be part of the change," she said. "It's time to take a stand and say enough is enough."
