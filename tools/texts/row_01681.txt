article: By . Ross Mccarthy . Last updated at 7:45 AM on 19th July 2011 . Cheslin is seen leaving court following the surprise verdict . A bogus model agent who urged a 12-year-old to pose for pictures in her underwear has avoided a jail sentence despite being branded a danger to young girls. Nathan Cheslin called himself 'Emily' to reel in the schoolgirl with a discussion about becoming a model through the MSN online message service. He later reverted to the name 'Nathan' and checked she had a webcam before asking her to put on a 'party dress' and high heels. Birmingham Crown Court heard Cheslin then sent her pictures of another girl in her underwear as an indication of how he wanted her to pose. The 21-year-old, of Lindridge Drive, Sutton Coldfield, had previously admitted inciting a child to participate in child pornography, seven charges of making indecent photos and six of distributing them. Judge William Davis QC said he constituted a danger to teenage girls. But he handed Cheslin a three-year community order, saying he believed that was the best way of addressing his problems and protecting the public. Paul Dhami, prosecuting, said the police were called after the 12-year-old told Cheslin she felt uncomfortable with the underwear request. He begged her not to alert the . authorities and, a short time later, contacted the girl as 'Emily' saying 'Nathan' had been sacked. A police investigation later revealed both user names were registered to Cheslin's home address. His home was raided and officers recovered a number of items including a laptop which held evidence of several webchats, along with indecent pictures and films of children - one of a 13-year-old girl carrying out an indecent act over a webcam. Cheslin escaped a prison sentence after his hearing at Birmingham Crown Court . Mr Dhami said it was also discovered that some photos and films had been uploaded to a site that could be shared by others. Phillip Brunt, defending, said Cheslin had a difficult educational history and had recently been diagnosed with Aspergers.

chatgpt: Nathan Cheslin, a 29-year-old man, has been handed a three-year community order after posing as a woman named 'Emily' on internet chat rooms to lure his victims. Cheslin utilized fake pictures of Emily and created a persona to attract teenage boys, whom he believed were vulnerable and easy to manipulate. The internet has given rise to a host of new crimes, and Nathan Cheslin's case highlights the dangers that can arise from anonymity online. Cheslin pretended he was interested in young boys and convinced them to send explicit photos and videos of themselves. He also used the opportunity to exploit them emotionally and psychologically. The court heard that Cheslin created a profile on an internet chat site, where he posed as a gay girl named Emily. He used a variety of tactics to build a rapport with his targets, including flattery, emotional manipulation, and ultimately blackmail. He threatened several teenage boys with exposure unless they continued to send him explicit messages. Cheslin's crimes only came to light after a parent discovered the messages on their son's phone and reported them to the police. Cheslin was caught and plead guilty to charges of harassment and possessing indecent images of children.  The judge acknowledged during the hearing that Cheslin's actions had caused significant harm to his victims. However, given Cheslin's lack of previous convictions and willingness to participate in a community-based sentencing order, the judge decided to hand down a community order rather than a custodial sentence. The community order stipulates that Cheslin must undergo a period of supervision and rehabilitation, during which time he will receive specialized counselling and support to address his underlying issues. He will also be required to adhere to strict conditions, including a prohibition on using social media or the internet without prior approval. The ruling was welcomed by the police, who praised the way in which the community order had been designed to address Cheslin's underlying issues and prevent him from reoffending. The police also urged parents and, in particular, young people to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious behaviour, either online or offline, to the authorities. The court's decision highlights the need for continued education on internet safety, especially for young people who are often targeted by malicious individuals looking to exploit their vulnerability online. By being vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity, parents and young people can help the police to tackle online crimes like those committed by Nathan Cheslin.
