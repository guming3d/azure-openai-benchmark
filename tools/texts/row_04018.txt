chatgpt: Bacary Sagna has completed his transfer from Arsenal to Manchester City on a free transfer, signing a lucrative three-year contract worth £150,000-a-week. The defender's move has been confirmed by both clubs, and Sagna had this to say about his new adventure: "I'm so excited to be joining Manchester City. They have a fantastic team and an impressive manager. I've always admired City from afar and I can't wait to start playing for them." Sagna had been with Arsenal since 2007, making a total of 284 appearances for the Gunners. He was a mainstay in Arsenal's defence and played a crucial role in the club's FA Cup triumph last season. However, the 31-year-old is now ready to start a new chapter in his career at Manchester City. The move will also see Sagna reunite with former Arsenal teammate Samir Nasri, who joined City in 2011. Sagna is set to compete for a starting spot among a deep roster of City defenders, including captain Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, and Gaël Clichy. Despite his recent club success, Sagna and his French team were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the World Cup at the hands of eventual winners, Germany. The experience was surely a disappointment for the veteran player, but he can now focus entirely on his new club. City manager Manuel Pellegrini praised Sagna's signing, stating that "Bacary is an experienced player and a great addition to our squad. He will provide competition for places and is the perfect fit for our attacking style of play." City finished second in the Premier League last season, but are intent on challenging champions Chelsea for the title in the upcoming season. With the addition of Sagna, they will undoubtedly have more depth in defence, which could prove crucial in their pursuit of success.
