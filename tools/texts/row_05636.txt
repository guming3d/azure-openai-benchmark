article: (CNN) -- Samoa will switch its driving from the right side to the left side of the road on Monday in a move opponents have called ill-conceived and said will lead to dozens of wrecks and fatalities. Proponents tout the change, which no other country has attempted since the 1970s, as making economic sense. Thousands of angry Samoans protested in the streets, and one group -- People Against Switching Sides (PASS) -- unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the change in the country's Supreme Court. Opponents have also aired nightly ads depicting roadsides littered with crosses and vandalized newly-erected signs warning drivers to "keep left." Bus drivers have demanded the government compensate them to change the location of passenger door and the steering wheel. The nation has declared Monday and Tuesday holidays for people to adjust to the change and banned alcohol sales for the next three days. The government said it will strictly enforce the use of seat belts and has built speed bumps to prevent wrecks. Until now, most of the cars in the Pacific island nation have been imported from the United States, where drivers travel on the right side, and Samoa's neighbor, American Samoa. The change will allow the thousands of expatriate Samoans who live in their nation's biggest neighbors, New Zealand and Australia, to send used -- and therefore, cheaper -- cars to their families back home. In both those countries, drivers travel on the left side of the road. "It narrows the bridge between the rich guys and people like us, the lower class people from the rural areas," Fa'aleaga Young Yen told CNN affiliate TVNZ in New Zealand.  Watch people speak out about the switch Â» . "Just the freight alone cost me US $3,500 from Hawaii," he said. "To send the same kind of car from New Zealand? NZ$1,400 (US$968)." About 70 percent of the world's population drive on the right side of the road. But many countries -- primarily those that were once British colonies -- remain to the left. Many have gradually switched over the years, including Sweden in 1967, Iceland in 1968, Nigeria in 1972 and Ghana in 1974. All have gone from driving on the left side to the right. Samoa's case seems to be unique because it is steering in the opposite direction.

chatgpt: The government of Samoa has declared Monday and Tuesday as holidays to allow people to adjust to a significant change in the country's road rules. Samoa has announced that it will switch the side of the road on which vehicles drive from the right side to the left. The change is scheduled to take effect on September 7 this year. Samoa's decision to change the side of the road on which cars are driven has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the change as a move that will align Samoa with its Pacific Island neighbors like New Zealand and Australia, others have criticized it as unnecessary and a waste of resources. However, the country's Supreme Court has rejected a constitutional challenge to the change, paving the way for the switch to go ahead. The court ruled that the government's decision to change the side of the road was a matter of public safety and that it was within the government's powers to make such a decision. The decision to switch the side of the road has been a long time coming. Samoa's neighbors, New Zealand and Australia, have always driven on the left side of the road, and many Samoans who have lived or traveled overseas are familiar with the practice. The move is expected to make it easier for tourists and expats to adapt to driving in Samoa. Samoa is not the first country to make this switch. In fact, over 30 countries have made a similar change in the past. Sweden, Iceland, Nigeria, and Ghana have all successfully switched their road rules from driving on the left to driving on the right side of the road. Despite the success of such changes in other countries, Samoa still faces significant challenges in implementing the switch. The country has a relatively high rate of road accidents, and there are concerns that the change will lead to confusion and more accidents on the road. The Samoan government has assured citizens that it will provide extensive education and training programs to help drivers adjust to the change. Overall, the decision to switch the side of the road is a significant one for Samoa. It is a move that has been met with both support and criticism, but ultimately, it is a decision that will impact the country's future in many ways. As Samoa prepares for this major change, it remains to be seen how successful it will be in ensuring public safety and easing the transition.
