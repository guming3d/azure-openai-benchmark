article: Coca-Cola and Pepsi retained their positions as the most respected brands in the newly released 2014 CoreBrand's survey. Every year the CoreBrand's consulting firm polls 10,000 corporate executives to find the country's leading brands. The brands are then ranked by how familiar they are, how favorably people view them, their management, and investment potential. Coca-Cola topped CoreBrand¿s 2014 list of America¿s most respected brands ahead of rival Pepsi . The Charlotte Business Journal reports that to be considered a company needs to be publicly . Most Respected: . 1. Coca-Cola . 2. PepsiCo . 3. Hershey . 4. Bayer . 5 Johnson & Johnson . 6. Harley-Davidson . 7. IBM . 8. Apple . 9. Kellog . 10. General Electric . Least Respected: . 1. Delta Airlines . 2. H&R Block . 3. Big Lots . 4. Denny’s . 5. Best Buy . 6. Rite Aid . 7. J.C. Penney . 8. Capital One Financial . 9. Family Dollar Stores . 10. Sprint Nextel . traded and tracked by CoreBrand for over five years. They must also have a corporate brand. The poll begins with 500 companies for consideration then cuts it down to the 100 brands that have the highest familiarity. Both Coke and Pepsi polled highly, though how favorably people perceive them has dipped in recent years as many now view their products as contributing to obesity, Fortune reports. Rounding out the top ten were Hershey, Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Harley-Davidson, IBM, Apple, Kellogg, and General Electric. Apple's ranking was of particular interest since CEO Tim Cook is still under pressure to see if he can match the performance of late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs. Ironically, thought Family Dollar was ranked among the least respected companies simply becoming a recognized brand is considered something of a milestone by the company itself. 'It is actually a counter-intuitive that they even show up here, as . their brand is becoming more powerful year over year,' the report notes. However it could be more recognized because of headlines last year regarding the brand's sluggish sales. Assuming they focus on their public perception, the brand should be able to remove itself from the list. Appearing for the second year in the lest respected spot was Delta Airlines. J.C. Penney was also ranked poorly, as the company's image was damaged two years ago in an attempt to reinvent themselves as a more upscale brand. They have since reverted to their prior identity in stores, but their favorability rating hovers at 60 per cent. Also on the bottom of the list were Denny's, H&R Block, Big Lots, Best Buy, Rite Aid, Capital One Financial, and Sprint Nextel.

chatgpt: Every year, the branding research firm CoreBrands conducts a survey to evaluate how well companies are known, how positively they are viewed, and their investment potential. The survey involves polling over 10,000 executives from around the world to get unbiased and expert responses regarding the companies that matter the most. The results for this year's survey are in, and it shows that some well-loved companies continue to maintain their positions at the top. The results were based on the survey's four criteria, which are the familiarity of the brand, favorability ratings, perceived management quality, and expectations for financial performance.  The top-rated company in this year's survey was none other than the snack giant Hershey, which jumped up three places from its fourth-place ranking last year. Hershey is known for its iconic chocolate products, which are enjoyed by millions around the world. Its strong brand recognition, combined with excellent management and investment potential, made it the top pick among executives. Bayer, the German multinational pharmaceutical and life sciences company, also maintained its position from last year, coming in as the second most highly rated brand in the survey. Bayer's brand, which has been around for over a century, continues to be associated with high quality and innovation, commanding respect and trust from executives. Johnson & Johnson, another established industry leader, maintained its position as the third most highly rated brand in the survey. Executives recognized the company's diversified portfolio, which includes a range of consumer healthcare, medical devices, and pharmaceutical products. Johnson & Johnson is known for having a strong focus on research and development, which likely played a role in its high marks. Finally, Harley-Davidson, the American motorcycle manufacturer, maintained its spot as the fourth highest rated brand in the survey. Harley-Davidson has a fiercely loyal following of consumers, who see the brand as a symbol of freedom and individuality. This, in turn, has helped the company to engender a highly positive image and is perceived by executives as having strong investment potential. The survey underscores the value of building a brand over time and maintaining a reputation for excellence. The highly-rated companies in this year's survey have established themselves as leaders in their respective industries, through a combination of quality products, effective management, and savvy marketing. The executives surveyed by CoreBrands recognize and appreciate these qualities, which bodes well for each of these companies and their continued success. The survey serves as a reminder to all businesses about the importance of investing in their brands and maintaining a positive image. Leading companies understand that building and maintaining a strong brand is a long-term effort, requiring a combination of investment, vision, and a focus on excellence. These factors, along with solid management and financial performance, are key ingredients for any successful business.
