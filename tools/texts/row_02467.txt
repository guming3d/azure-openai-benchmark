chatgpt: CNN anchor Don Lemon has been open about his sexuality since 2012, when he came out as gay on national television. Despite his public announcement and his long-term relationship with a male partner, it seems that some women still try to make advances towards him. In a recent interview with The Daily Beast, Lemon revealed that some of his female fans don't seem to understand that he is not interested in them romantically. He explained that some women have approached him and invited him to dinner or to accompany them to events, not realizing that he is gay and in a committed relationship. Lemon said: "A lot of women are still delusional about their chances with me. They don't understand that I'm gay and that I'm not interested in them romantically. It's funny and flattering in a way, but also a bit frustrating." Despite this minor annoyance, Lemon is optimistic about the progress being made towards LGBTQ+ acceptance in society. He pointed to the recent announcement that University of Missouri defensive end Michael Sam is gay and set to become the first openly gay player in the NFL as a sign that barriers are continuing to be broken down. He said: "It's like the civil rights movement. We're seeing people come out and be accepted in all walks of life, from sports to entertainment to politics. It's a sign that progress is being made and that the world is becoming more accepting of diversity." Lemon added that he didn't expect to become a spokesperson for the LGBTQ+ community when he first came out, but that he felt it was important to use his platform to promote understanding and acceptance. He has spoken publicly about issues such as marriage equality, workplace discrimination, and hate crimes, and has been recognized as a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. While he is proud of the strides that have been made, Lemon acknowledges that there is still work to be done, particularly in areas such as healthcare, housing, and education. He hopes that he can use his voice to continue driving progress forward. In the meantime, he has a message for any women who may be holding out hope for a romantic relationship with him: "I appreciate your interest and your support, but I'm not available in that way. I hope you can respect that and continue to support me regardless." Overall, Lemon's story is a reminder of the challenges still facing LGBTQ+ individuals, even as acceptance and visibility increases. It's also a testament to his courage and commitment to using his platform to promote equality and understanding. As he has shown, true progress requires not just breaking down barriers, but also being willing to speak out and advocate for those who are still struggling to be seen and heard.
