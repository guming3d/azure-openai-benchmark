chatgpt: The stage is set for one of the most anticipated finals in English domestic football as Tottenham and Chelsea go head-to-head in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. It promises to be a thrilling encounter, with both sides going all out to secure a crucial piece of silverware. One talking point ahead of the game is the decision of Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino over who to start in goal. Michel Vorm has been the undisputed number one for Tottenham in the competition so far, starting every game on their road to the final. However, there are strong indications that Pochettino may opt for Hugo Lloris instead, who is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. Lloris has been sidelined with a shoulder injury since December and has been working hard to regain his fitness in recent weeks. Pochettino has hinted that he may be ready to start the Frenchman, describing him as a "top, top keeper". The decision will not be an easy one, as Vorm has performed admirably in his absence and has played a crucial role in getting the team to the final. Whichever goalkeeper gets the nod, Tottenham will be hoping to rediscover their form after a disappointing run of results in the Premier League. They have not won in their last four games and their title challenge is in danger of fizzling out unless they can get back to winning ways. The Capital One Cup provides them with a chance to salvage their season and give their supporters something to cheer about. Chelsea, on the other hand, have been in fine form and are currently five points clear at the top of the Premier League table. They come into the final as clear favorites and will be determined to add another trophy to their impressive collection under Jose Mourinho. The Portuguese manager has won the competition three times before and knows how to win big games. The Capital One Cup has been an exciting competition this season, with plenty of drama and surprises along the way. Both Tottenham and Chelsea have worked hard to get to this stage and will be fully motivated to come out on top. The stage is set for a classic encounter at Wembley Stadium, and all eyes will be on the two goalkeepers as they battle for supremacy in what promises to be a thrilling final.
