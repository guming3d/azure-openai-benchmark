article: A French mayor was accused of 'racism and xenophobia' today after refusing to allow a dead Roma gipsy baby to be buried in a municipal cemetery. It follows the country's Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, infamously calling for entire Roma communities to be deported because they 'cannot integrate'. This time it is Christian Leclerc, the conservative mayor of Champlan, the Paris commuter town, who has sparked a nationwide controversy. The Roma baby was refused burial at Champlan's municipal cemetery (pictured) after the town's mayor said the few available plots were reserved for those who paid their taxes . When a Roma family living in an illegal camp said they wanted to give their two-and-a-half month old child, identified as Maria Francesca, a proper burial, he said no. Mr Leclerc insisted his local cemetery had 'very few available plots' and that 'priority is given to those who pay their taxes.' But Loic Gandais, a Roma rights campaigner, said Mr Leclerc was simply expressing a hatred of Roma which is now widespread across France. 'It's about racism, xenophobia, and stigmatisation,' said Mr Gandais, saying the baby died in hospital in Corbeil-Essonnes from sudden infant death syndrome on Boxing Day. Maria Francesca's parents are Romanians who have been living in France for eight years, sending their two other young children to local schools. Now the mother and father are hoping to see their child buried in Wissous, another town nearby, after Richard Trinquier, the local major, said it was a 'question of humanity'. Mr Trinqueir said: 'The pain of a mother who carried a child for nine months, and lost her after two and a half months must not be worsened.' Roma gipsies live on two plots without fresh water of electricity in Champlan, and there are frequent calls for their camp to be razed. The baby's mother and father are now hoping their child will be buried in the nearby town of Wissous, after its mayor Richard Trinquier (pictured) sympathized with their plight . Pictured is Wissous cemetery, where the baby will be buried after it was denied a plot in nearby Champlan . They are part of community of some 20,000 mainly Romanian and Bulgarian gipsies in France who are regularly linked with crime and anti-social behaviour. Mr Valls, the notoriously reactionary Socialist Prime Minister, is among many who want to see them deported. As Interior Minister, he regularly approved orders aimed at smashing up Roma camps and evicting entire families, saying: 'The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. We are not here to welcome these people…It's not France's job to deal with the misery of the whole world.' In August, Gilles Bourdouleix, another French mayor, was fined after saying that Adolf Hitler 'maybe did not kill enough' Roma during the Second World War.

chatgpt: A French mayor has landed in hot water after being accused of racism. Christian Leclerc, the mayor of Champlan, a Paris commuter town, reportedly refused to allow the burial of a Roma gipsy baby in the municipal cemetery, citing that municipal cemetery plots were prioritized for those who "pay taxes." The parents of the child were shocked and appalled by the mayor's decision, with the father stating that they "never imagined" they would face such discrimination. The family, who have lived in the area for over a decade, were forced to look for an alternative location to bury their child. Fortunately for them, Wissous Mayor Richard Trinquier has stepped in to offer assistance. He has pledged to find a burial site for the baby, saying that it is a "question of humanity." The situation has sparked outrage across France, with many calling on Leclerc to apologize for his racist behavior. Furthermore, activists have accused him of violating French laws that prohibit discrimination based on ethnicity or nationality. The incident has highlighted the often-overlooked issue of discrimination against the Roma community in Europe. Roma gypsies, who hail from Eastern Europe, have long been persecuted in France and other European countries. They are often subjected to discrimination, marginalization, and even violence. The issue has gained broader attention in recent years, with the European Union launching a campaign to combat discrimination against the Roma community. The campaign aims to promote equality, tolerance, and respect for human rights. The situation in Champlan has brought this issue into the spotlight once again. Many have taken to social media to express their outrage and call for justice. #RomaLivesMatter has been trending on Twitter, with thousands of users expressing their support for the Roma community and condemning racism. The European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) has also weighed in on the issue, condemning the mayor's actions and calling on the French government to take action. A spokesperson for the ERRC stated that "the discrimination and exclusion of Roma people must end, and authorities must take all necessary measures to ensure it does." As for Leclerc, he has yet to issue an apology or comment on the situation. However, the incident has sparked a broader conversation about discrimination in France and Europe as a whole. Hopefully, this will lead to greater awareness and action to combat racism and ensure justice for all.
