article: (CNN) -- Whovians, clear your calendars -- the next star of the British science-fiction series "Doctor Who" will be unveiled Sunday during a live half-hour television special on the BBC. The 12th Doctor of the long-running show, which has aired 33 seasons and nearly 800 episodes since it premiered in 1963, will be revealed in front of a studio audience set against a backdrop of a swirling vortex, Daleks, and the TARDIS, the BBC has announced. Peter Capaldi, who starred as a foul-mouthed spin doctor in the British political comedy series "The Thick of It," has been the odds-on favorite to step into the good Doctor's blue phone booth-shaped time machine after Matt Smith, the 11th Doctor, announced in June that he would be leaving the show after four years. Ben Stephenson, Controller of BBC Drama Commissioning, said: "We can't wait to unveil the next Doctor ... It's the biggest secret in showbiz, even those working with the new Doctor on other projects at the moment have no idea they are in the presence of the 12th incarnation." The show will air live simultaneously on BBC One in Britain at 6:00 p.m. GMT and on BBC America at 2:00 p.m. ET. READ MORE: "Doctor Who" to mark 50 years with biopic . The seminal British series first aired in 1963 -- when the broadcast of the premiere was delayed due to coverage of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy -- and spawned a number of spinoffs, books, stage performances and radio shows before going off the air in 1989. The show returned to television in 2005 to critical acclaim in Britain. The BBC has said it will debut the new Doctor in this year's Christmas special. Rory Kinnear, who played Bill Tanner in the James Bond films "Quantum of Solace" and "Skyfall," and Idris Elba, better known as Stringer Bell from the HBO drama "The Wire," have also been tipped as candidates to be the next incarnation of the Time Lord. As fans eagerly await the appointment of the next Doctor, the BBC will celebrate the 50th anniversary of "Doctor Who" with a biopic about the show's origins. "An Adventure in Space and Time" will premiere later this year and fictionally recounts the creation of the series while exploring the team behind its first episode. The show will also mark the highly-anticipated milestone on November 23 with a special episode starring Matt Smith, David Tennant -- Smith's predecessor -- and John Hurt as the Doctor, according to the BBC. Emily Zemler and Kevin Taverner contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The highly anticipated announcement of the next star of "Doctor Who" will take place this Sunday, and all eyes are on British actor Peter Capaldi as the odds-on favorite for the iconic role. Capaldi, known for his role in the political comedy "The Thick of It," has been a fan of the show since childhood and would be the oldest actor to take on the role in its more than half-century history. Capaldi is a seasoned performer with a range of experience on stage and screen. He has won both an Academy Award and an Emmy Award for his short film "Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life." He has also starred in a number of British television shows and films, including the popular series "Doctor Who." The announcement of the new star will mark the 50th anniversary of the show's first episode, which aired in 1963. In addition to the announcement, the anniversary will be marked by a biopic and a special episode. The biopic, entitled "An Adventure in Space and Time," will chronicle the creation of the series and its early years. The special episode, which has been shrouded in secrecy, is rumored to feature multiple Doctors from throughout the show's history. BBC executives and show producers have kept a tight lid on the identity of the new Doctor, with even those working on other projects with the actor unaware of who will be taking on the iconic role. In a statement released earlier this week, the network said, "We're keeping the identity of the next Doctor under wraps until the special live broadcast, so even we few who have been working with him have no idea what's in store. We're all intrigued to find out." "Doctor Who" has been a beloved British institution since its inception, with its innovative storytelling, imaginative worlds, and a list of notable actors who have taken on the lead role. The show has a massive global fan base and has been responsible for introducing several generations of viewers to science fiction. The announcement of the new star is a major cultural event, with fans eagerly awaiting the news of who will take on the mantle after Matt Smith's acclaimed tenure. The live broadcast of the announcement will air on Sunday evening, and speculation is running rampant as to who will be revealed as the new star. With Capaldi the favorite, many are curious to see if the actor will indeed be the one to take on the Time Lord's time-traveling adventures. For fans of the show, Sunday's announcement is an exciting and momentous occasion that will be long remembered.
