article: (CNN) -- Forget old conspiracy theories about snake bites and fatal poisons. Egyptian King Ramesses III died after a brutal throat slashing, a new study says. The study provides the latest twist in a mystery that has long perplexed researchers. Did a venomous viper take him out? Poison? An assassination plot in a reign tainted by war? And if it were the latter, who did it? Read more: King Tut statue among missing Egypt treasures, minister says . Researches say he died at the hands of a killer in a plot planned by one of his wives and a son who wanted to succeed him. Scans conducted after layers of bandages were removed revealed a deep cut in Ramesses III's throat, probably made by a sharp knife during a royal coup, according to a study published by the British Medical Journal. "Our CT analysis provides evidence that conspirators killed Ramesses III by cutting his throat," the study says. His throat, neck and arteries were brutally slashed, causing an immediate death, according to the study, which highlights his final moments.

Speculation has raged over what led to his death. Read more: The battle for Egypt's past . "Further evidence of an assassination comes from the presence of a Horus eye amulet in the wound," the study says. "The presence of the amulet deep in the soft tissue of the wound together with the homogeneous material that penetrated the wound up to the bone substantiate the supposition that the wound was already present at the time of embalming. " The study singles out one of his wives and her son as conspirators in the killing. A trial found the son, Pentawere, guilty, leading him to take his own life, it says.

The unusual mummification of unknown man E, believed to be Pentawere, points to a "nonroyal burial" that includes use of goat skin to cover his body. The procedure appears to be a punishment for conspiring against the king, according to the study. "Use of goat or sheep skins in dynastic burials was rare because these materials were regarded ritually impure," it says. A genetic study shows they had common lineage.

chatgpt: New forensic evidence has come to light in the death of King Ramesses III, ruling Egypt from 1187 until 1156 BC. Theories about his death have raged for centuries, with little concrete evidence to support any one hypothesis. However, new scans taken after layers of bandages were removed reveal a deep throat cut, indicating a brutal murder. The discovery was made as part of a recent initiative to use modern forensic methods to study ancient mummies. The effort was led by Dr. Albert Zink, an anthropologist at the European Academy of Bolzano in Italy. Dr. Zink and his colleagues used X-rays and CT scans to examine Ramesses III's body, which had been preserved with elaborate mummification techniques. At first, the scans appeared to show nothing out of the ordinary. But when the researchers removed the bandages covering the king's throat, they found a deep gash that had been concealed for millennia. The wound, which appeared to have been inflicted with a sharp blade, would have caused rapid and severe bleeding, leading to a quick death. The revelation of this brutal throat slashing has reignited the debate about the circumstances of Ramesses III's death. Previously, historians had speculated that the king had been poisoned, citing accounts from ancient court documents that described a plot by Ramesses' wives and sons to kill him. One of his wives, Queen Tiye, had allegedly conspired with a magician to carry out the assassination. However, the presence of the deep throat cut suggests that the king was killed by more direct means. It is possible that the conspiracy involved more than just poison, and that the attackers also employed a blade to mutilate the king's throat. The fact that Ramesses III was the victim of a brutal murder has shed new light on his reign and the era in which he lived. The king is known for his military campaigns and impressive building projects, including the construction of the temple of Medinet Habu. But many mysteries remain about his life and the circumstances surrounding his death. While the recent discovery offers some clues, it is unlikely to provide definitive answers to the questions about Ramesses III's fate. However, it does underscore the power of forensic science in unlocking secrets from the distant past. Such methods may continue to reveal new insights into the lives and deaths of ancient rulers and everyday people alike.
