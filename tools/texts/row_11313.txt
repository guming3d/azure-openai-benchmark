article: NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Police in India have charged 63 people with murder in the beating death of a company boss who fired them. Labor minister Oscar Fernandes was criticized for saying Chaudhary's death was warning to management. The 63 were among 137 people police had rounded up by Wednesday -- two days after a mob of fired employees attacked L.K. Chaudhary, the chief executive of an Italian car parts manufacturing company. The others were charged with disturbing the peace in the Monday incident in Noida, located in the outskirts of the capital New Delhi. More arrests are likely, said R. K. Chaturvedi, the senior superintendent of police in Noida. The former employees of Graziano Transmissioni had gone to meet with company management over their reinstatement, said Noida police Inspector Manoj Pathak. The meeting turned violent, and the mob attacked Chaudhary with iron rods, Pathak said. On Tuesday, India's labor minister, Oscar Fernandes, drew sharp criticism after he said Chaudhary's death should serve as a warning to management, according to CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN. "The workers should be dealt (with) with compassion and should not be pushed so hard that they resort to whatever that had happened in Nodia" CNN-IBN quoted Fernandes as telling reporters. The minister later apologized, telling CNN his comments had been taken out of context. He said the murder of the boss could never be justified. The Italian Embassy said the company had, for several months, been facing "violent forms of protest by self-proclaimed workers' representatives." "The situation had been repeatedly brought to the attention of the competent Indian authorities, both at central and local level," it said in a statement. Business groups condemned the killing with the Confederation of Indian Industry calling it "tragic, unwanted and gory." "Such instances of industrial violence cannot be a solution to any problem and must not be tolerated," said Salil Singh, chairman of the group that promotes industrial growth. Meanwhile, authorities sought to appease businesses that police were aggressively investigating the case. "The legal course will be followed and all culprits brought to book," Commerce Minister Kamal Nath said. "This stray tragic occurrence would not be allowed to mar India's position as an investment-friendly destination." CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Police in India have recently charged 63 individuals in connection with the fatal attack on a company boss in February. The chief executive of an Italian car parts company was violently attacked by a mob of fired employees after he dismissed them from their jobs. The incident occurred in the city of Pune, located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. The police said that the attack was a premeditated murder carried out by the employees, who had been previously terminated from their positions. The CEO, who was identified as 45-year-old Gianluca Boschetti, was beaten and pelted with stones by the angry mob before being left to die on the factory floor. Following this horrific incident, the Labor Minister of India, Mr. Santosh Gangwar, made a controversial statement, stating that the CEO's brutal murder was a "lesson" to company management. He faced heavy criticism for his insensitive comments and was later compelled to apologize for his remarks. He acknowledged that the statement was inappropriate and that he deeply regretted making it. The murder of Boschetti has brought attention to the often-tense relationship between employers and employees in India, particularly in the context of labor laws and worker rights. There have been numerous instances in the past where disgruntled workers have resorted to violence against executives and senior management personnel, frequently citing issues such as low wages, lack of job security, and poor working conditions. The legal system in India has responded by enacting various pieces of legislation aimed at protecting employee rights, but implementation and enforcement remain a challenge. There is often a discrepancy between the laws on the books and the actual working conditions and environments that employees face in practice. This disparity can lead to frustration and resentment among workers, particularly in situations where they feel their rights are being violated. The murder of Boschetti highlights the need for effective communication and cooperation between companies and their employees, particularly during times of economic uncertainty or organizational change. Ensuring that workers are treated fairly and equitably can help to prevent violent outbursts and promote a cohesive, productive work environment. In conclusion, the murder of Gianluca Boschetti is a tragic reminder of the potentially devastating consequences of conflicts between employers and employees. It is essential to address these issues proactively and collaboratively, in order to create a sustainable and positive work culture for all parties involved.
