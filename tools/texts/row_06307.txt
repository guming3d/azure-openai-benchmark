article: In the latest of our regular series on the travel tales of the rich and famous, forever-young model Twiggy tells us about suncream disasters, rain in Spain and the timeless joys of North Wales. Do you like cruising holidays? I have only been on two cruises and enjoyed both. My first was in 2012, when I was invited by Seabourn to be godmother to one of their new ships. What I like about cruising is that you get to visit lots of different countries but only have to unpack once. Twiggy: Won't make the sun-cream mistake twice . Favourite places in the UK? Portmeirion in North Wales. It was designed in the style of an Italian village and feels like entering another world. It's so colourful, with rhododendron, azalea and camellia bushes. Favourite hotel in the world? Le Touessrok in Mauritius. It was my daughter Carly's 15th birthday when we went, and we treated her to lunch on the hotel's private island. We also tried paragliding, and although I was screaming all the way, the views of the clear turquoise sea and surrounding landscape were well worth it. What's the strangest meal you've eaten? Leigh was playing Oberon in a Royal Shakespeare production of A Midsummer's Dream in Japan, and we went to a restaurant for soup which had real gold leaf floating on top. It didn't actually taste of anything, though. Worst holiday disaster? A friend once lent us her villa near Valencia. Before we arrived, the sun had been shining continuously for three months. But when we got there, it started raining and didn't stop for the next eight days. We became good at jigsaws, though. Any packing tips? Roll up your clothes in your suitcase rather than laying them flat. Apart from not creasing as much, you can pack more in. Also, never pack any liquids - a bottle of suntan oil once came open in my suitcase and ruined my favourite clothes, which I was really upset about. Where are you off to next? New York. Besides London, it's my favourite city in the world. In the early Eighties, I was in a Broadway musical called My One And Only, which ran for a couple of years. I made lots of friends, so New York is now like a second home to me. Twiggy for M&S Collection is available online at www.marksandspencer.com.

chatgpt: Iconic 1960s supermodel, Judy Carpenter, has declared her love for the luxurious Le Touessrok resort in Mauritius. In an exclusive interview, Carpenter revealed how the resort had stolen her heart from the moment she arrived. "I've had the good fortune of travelling the world throughout my career, but there's something truly special about Le Touessrok," Carpenter said. "The pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and luxurious amenities make it an absolute dream destination." However, Le Touessrok isn't the only place that holds a special place in Carpenter's heart. She also shared her deep affection for New York, where she spent much of the Eighties working as a model. "New York has a certain energy that's hard to describe," Carpenter explained. "The people, the fashion, the hustle and bustle - it's intoxicating. I'll always have a soft spot for the city that never sleeps." But Carpenter's love for unique destinations doesn't stop there. She also expressed her admiration for Portmeirion, the Welsh village that's known for its quirky architecture and colourful gardens. "Portmeirion is a hidden gem," Carpenter said. "It's like stepping into a fairytale world. The vibrant colours and unusual buildings make it an unforgettable experience." As one of the most iconic supermodels of the Sixties, Carpenter has had more than her fair share of glamour and adventure. But even after all of her travels, she remains enchanted by these three distinctive destinations. "I think what draws me to Le Touessrok, New York, and Portmeirion is their uniqueness," Carpenter said. "Each one has its own distinct personality and charm. It's like falling in love with three different people - they all have something special to offer." Whether it's the tropical paradise of Le Touessrok, the energy of New York, or the whimsy of Portmeirion, Carpenter has certainly amassed a wealth of unforgettable experiences throughout her life. And who knows where her wanderlust will take her next?
