article: London, England (CNN) -- UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has ordered a full review of security measures at UK airports following the attempted Detroit plane bombing on December 25. In a statement published Friday on the prime minister's official Web site, Brown said the UK government will be working with the U.S. to "examine a range of new techniques to enhance airport security systems beyond traditional measures, such as pat-down searches and sniffer dogs." These new measures might include using "explosive trace technology, full body scanners and advanced x-ray technology." Writing on the first day of a new decade, Brown issued a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by international terrorism. "The new decade," he said, "is starting as the last began -- with al Qaeda creating a climate of fear. These enemies of democracy and freedom... are concealing explosives in ways which are more difficult to detect." The Detroit incident highlighted an "urgent" need to tighten airport security measures, Brown said. "The UK," Brown said, "will continually explore the most sophisticated devices capable of identifying explosives, guns, knives and other such items anywhere on the body." The alleged plane bomber, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab is believed to have concealed explosives in his underwear. The 23-year-old Nigerian is thought to have linked up with an al Qaeda group based in Yemen after attending the UK's University College London. Brown said the plot was a reminder of al Qaeda's increasing influence away from "better-known homes of international terror such as Pakistan and Afghanistan." Yemen is becoming "a major new base for terrorism" which highlighted the need for "enhanced cooperation" between nations in the fight against international terrorism, he said. Brown added that the UK government is already supporting the government of Yemen's efforts to tackle terrorism and pledged further support. "By 2011 our already announced commitment to Yemen will exceed Â£100 million ($160 million), making the UK one of its leading donors," he said. It was also announced Friday that Brown had invited "key international partners" to a meeting in London at the end of January to discuss how to counter radicalization in Yemen. "We have already updated our counter-terrorism strategy to include further measures to disrupt al Qaeda's leadership and frustrate its attempts to recruit, train and direct a new generation of terrorists or to find a new haven for those leaders displaced by the efforts of our Afghan and Pakistani allies." The key to tackling terrorism was "vigilance" Brown said, but the Detroit incident was "a wake-up call...not just for security against terror but for the hearts and minds of a generation."

chatgpt: The UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has announced a full review of airport security measures after the failed Detroit plane bomb plot on Christmas Day. Speaking in a press conference, he stated that the UK will explore the use of the "most sophisticated devices", including explosive trace technology and full-body scanners, as new measures to enhance security. The announcement came after a Nigerian national, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, attempted to detonate explosives concealed in his underwear during a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The attack was thwarted by passengers and crew members who quickly subdued Abdulmutallab. The incident has raised serious concerns about airport security, and the UK government is now taking steps to address these issues. Speaking about the review, Brown stated that it will be a comprehensive examination of airport security measures, taking into account technological advances and recent terrorist threats. He also stressed that the review is necessary to prevent a similar incident from happening in the UK. One possible measure that's being explored is the use of explosive trace technology. This involves using detectors to analyze particles that are present on a passenger's clothing and belongings to detect possible explosives. This technology has been used in some airports already, but it's not widely used due to concerns over privacy and the potential for false positives. Another measure is the use of full-body scanners. These machines use X-ray technology to produce an image of the body that can reveal hidden objects. However, the use of these scanners has also been a subject of controversy due to concerns over privacy and health risks. The UK Transport Secretary, Lord Adonis, has confirmed that several full-body scanners have already been selected for use at Heathrow airport. However, he also stated that their use will be subject to a full public consultation, which will address concerns over privacy and health risks. He also assured passengers that their privacy will be protected and that images produced by the scanners will not be stored or shared. The decision to review security measures has been welcomed by air travel experts, who have raised concerns over the current screening process. However, some have also stated that the review should not focus solely on technological solutions but should also involve a review of human factors such as training and screening procedures for staff. The review is expected to take several months to complete, and the findings will be used to inform future security measures at UK airports. The government has stressed that the review is part of an ongoing effort to ensure the safety and security of passengers and crew members, and that it will continue to work closely with international partners to address global security challenges. In conclusion, the UK Prime Minister's decision to conduct a full review of airport security measures is a welcome move in light of recent terrorist threats. The use of new technology such as explosive trace detectors and full-body scanners could help enhance security measures at UK airports, but it's important that these measures are implemented with care and consideration for passengers' privacy and well-being. Human factors such as staff training and screening procedures also need to be addressed to ensure that airport security is as effective as possible. Overall, the review is an important step towards ensuring that passengers and crew members can travel safely and securely.
