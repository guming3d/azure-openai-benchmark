article: (CNN) -- Two historic cottages in Georgia -- including one that served as a home to Franklin Roosevelt before he became president -- were destroyed by fire Tuesday morning, authorities said. The cause of the fire remained unknown Tuesday, but authorities said it may have been the result of a storm and lightning in the area. The so-called McCarthy Cottage and the E.T. Curtis Cottage in Warm Springs were discovered burning around 5:30 a.m. by an employee who lives near the property, according to a news release from the Georgia Department of Labor. The McCarthy Cottage was the first home built by Roosevelt in Warm Springs, who started traveling to the area in 1924 seeking a solution for his polio, said Georgia Labor Commissioner Mark Butler . The E.T. Curtis cottage was built in 1928 and was adjacent to the McCarthy Cottage. The cottages were part of the Georgia Department of Labor's Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation. The state assumed ownership of Roosevelt's treatment center in 1974, according to state officials. Butler said the nation has experienced a great loss with the burning of McCarthy cottage. "Because President Roosevelt resided there for four years, the McCarthy cottage was the cottage of most historical value." Roosevelt lived in the cottage until 1932 when he moved to the Little White House, also in Warm Springs.

chatgpt: A fire broke out at the Roosevelt Island complex in New York City, which housed a group of abandoned cottages. Authorities suspect that lightning from a storm may have ignited the flames. The complex was once home to Franklin D. Roosevelt, a former President of the United States, and he lived in one of the cottages for four years before his presidency. The blaze was first reported at around 7 pm, with thick smoke visible from miles away. A spokesperson from the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation stated that the fire department immediately rushed to the scene to combat the fire. The team of firefighters worked tirelessly until the early hours of the morning to extinguish the fire. Reports suggest that the fire had caused significant damage to several of the cottages, with some completely destroyed. The authorities have cordoned off the area, while investigations are underway to determine the cause of the fire. So far, lightning has been identified as the most likely culprit.  The Roosevelt Island complex is known for its historic significance and the cottages housed former hospital staff members. However, in recent years, the complex has been left abandoned, and the cottages had fallen into severe disrepair. The fire has highlighted the need for the restoration and preservation of the historical site. Residents in the area expressed their sadness and concern about the incident. The memories and significance of the cottages are not only in relation to Roosevelt's occupancy but also for the many others who resided there. The Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation has promised to do all it can to restore the cottages back to their former glory.
