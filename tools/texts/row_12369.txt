'You have to see the funny side of it,' said the 2013 US Open champion, who claimed back-to-back wins for the first time in his career in the Scottish Open on Sunday. Scroll down for highlights .

VIDEO The Open: First Round highlights . 'I had three drivers in my bag after yesterday. There were a couple of drivers made up for a couple of my caddie's friends. 'Two were taken out and given to these two gentlemen and one was left in my golf bag. It just was the wrong one. 'This morning when I picked up my bag there was a driver in the wrong spot. I picked it up and realised that's not my shaft. 'That club should have been given to someone else and mine was actually given to that person and driven down to Bedford. 'Fortunately it didn't affect the game plan. Obviously when we made the call, the guy was coming straight back with it and I knew I would have it by the time I really, really needed it out there, toward the seventh and the back nine. Adjustment: Rose eventually received the driver on the third hole, and used it mainly on the back nine . Thinking time: Rose crouches over a put at the 18th as he ponders how to get back amongst the leaders . 'The way the course was playing I knew I wasn't going to require the driver for a good couple of hours into my round.' Speaking about his round, Rose added: 'Even par always feels like a waste of five hours, really. 'I felt like there was a lot of good stuff today and really felt comfortable with my game early on, but ran out of a little bit of steam on the back nine. 'The back nine was playing a little tricky and I had trouble with club selection off the tee. I tried to force the 2-iron a couple of times when I should have hit 3-wood or driver. 'I'll learn from that for tomorrow and go make a score. It's a platform for which I can build for the rest of the week.'

chatgpt: Golfer Justin Rose had a rocky start at the Farmers Insurance Open after sending away two of his golf clubs, including his driver, before realizing he had sent his actual driver. The Englishman was forced to start his round at Torrey Pines without a driver, a challenge that most golfers would find difficult to overcome. Rose realized his mistake on the morning of the tournament and immediately tried to retrieve his clubs. However, it took several holes for his driver to arrive, causing the seasoned golfer to have a difficult start to his round. Rose eventually received his driver after three holes but was left with the task of overcoming his poor start to the round. The absence of his driver did not deter Rose entirely, as the golfer showed resilience and perseverance on the course. He finished the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open with a level par score, which is a respectable effort given the circumstances of his round.  Rose, who has won the tournament twice before, is a seasoned professional and has won numerous golf tournaments throughout his career. However, Rose's experience highlights the importance of triple-checking equipment before a round to avoid any mishaps.  The importance of having the right equipment at hand in golf cannot be overstated, as even the most minor errors can have a significant impact on a golfer's performance. In Rose's case, his driver was an essential piece of equipment and a necessary tool that he needed to get through the course with confidence.  Rose's mishap is not the first time that a golfer has been left without their equipment during a tournament. It is a reminder to all golfers, regardless of their level of experience, to always double-check their gear and make sure nothing is left behind. Despite the setback, Rose remained optimistic about his chances in the tournament, expressing his excitement at the prospect of playing on the iconic golf course at Torrey Pines. The experienced golfer is no stranger to adversity and is well-equipped to handle challenging situations on the course. In golf, as in life, it is often how one responds to adversity that truly matters. Rose's ability to stay focused and perform to the best of his abilities, even in the face of a major setback, is a testament to his skill and determination as a golfer. With Rose's driver now safely in his bag, the Englishman will look to improve on his level par score in the second round of the Farmers Insurance Open. It is a reminder to all golfers that the sport is not just about technique and skill, but also about mental fortitude and adaptability.
