article: LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A previously unreleased video of Michael Jackson's hair catching fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984 was posted online by Us magazine Wednesday. Michael Jackson, shown here in the mid-'80s, was involved in a accident while filming a commercial. The onstage mishap 25 years ago, in which Jackson's scalp was burned, has been blamed for leading the entertainer to prescription pain medications. A publicist for Us magazine said the publication would not comment on how the video was obtained. The dramatic footage shows pyrotechnics exploding near Jackson and yellow flames immediately erupting on his black hair. The pop star continues to dance down stairs for about 10 seconds before stage hands rush to him to douse the fire that has covered his scalp. A bald spot is clearly seen at the top of Jackson's head as he stands up. Still wearing his trademark sequined glove, Jackson grabs his head with his hands as he is led offstage.  Watch the accident unfold Â» . Miko Brando, son of actor Marlon Brando and Jackson's close friend, was the first person seen reaching Jackson. The video -- posted at usmagazine.com -- also shows early takes of the commercial in which the fireworks were triggered several seconds after Jackson began dancing down the stairs, putting him well away from the blasts. The commercial was filmed in Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium before a live audience on January 27, 1984. It was part of Jackson's groundbreaking Pepsi sponsorship, near the height of his popularity. Jackson, in a video statement released in 1993 to address child molestation allegations, talked about how the accident led to a painkiller addiction: . "As you may already know, after my tour ended I remained outside the country undergoing treatment for a dependency on pain medication. This medication was initially prescribed for the excruciating pain that I was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on my scalp." The story in Us magazine's weekly print edition is titled "The Day His Addiction Started." Jackson appeared at the Grammy Awards just six weeks later, wearing a hairpiece, to collect eight Grammys. His Pepsi commercial also aired for the first time during that Grammy broadcast.

chatgpt: In 1984, pop icon Michael Jackson was in the midst of shooting a commercial for Pepsi. Little did he know that this shoot would result in a tragic accident that would impact his life for years to come. On the set of the commercial shoot, things were going smoothly until an unforeseen incident occurred. During a pyrotechnics stunt, a spark ignited Jackson's hair, causing it to catch fire. The fire spread quickly, and before anyone could react, Jackson was engulfed in flames. Despite the best efforts of those on set to extinguish the fire, Jackson suffered second-degree burns on his scalp and face. The incident caused significant physical and emotional distress for Jackson. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, he revealed that he had undergone multiple surgeries to repair the damage caused by the fire. He also admitted that the experience had left him with a debilitating fear of fire. However, the impact of the accident went far beyond just physical injuries. Many have speculated that Jackson's struggles with pain medication addiction and anxiety can be traced back to the trauma he experienced during the Pepsi shoot. The accident also resulted in a settlement between Jackson and Pepsi, which saw the iconic performer receiving a reported $1.5 million in compensation. While Michael Jackson may have continued to achieve legendary success in the years that followed the accident, it cannot be denied that the event had a profound impact on his life. In the wake of his untimely death in 2009, many fans have looked back on this incident as a turning point in Jackson's career and personal life. Today, the incident remains a reminder of the inherent dangers that can arise in the entertainment industry, even during seemingly routine shoots. Its legacy serves as a cautionary tale to performers and crew alike to always be vigilant and take appropriate safety measures to prevent accidents.
