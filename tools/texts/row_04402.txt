chatgpt: Firefighters in Leeds were on high alert on the evening of November 5th, as bonfire night festivities kicked off around the city. However, their efforts to extinguish a small blaze were interrupted when a firefighter was pelted with fireworks. The incident was caught on camera, thanks to a camera installed on one of the responding fire engines. The video shows firefighters working to put out the flames while numerous fireworks explode around them. Suddenly, one of the fireworks is seen exploding in front of a firefighter, hitting him and causing him to stumble before getting back up and continuing to work. A spokesperson for the fire service called the incident "completely unacceptable," and noted that it was indicative of the kind of dangerous situations faced by firefighters during the bonfire season. "Our crews put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe," they said. "To be targeted like this while carrying out their duties is outrageous." Fortunately, the injured firefighter was not seriously hurt and was able to continue working. However, the incident highlights the potential dangers faced by emergency service workers during bonfire night celebrations. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of firefighters and police officers being targeted with fireworks, eggs, and other objects during the festivities. The fire service is now calling on the public to behave responsibly during bonfire night celebrations, and to ensure that emergency workers are able to carry out their duties safely. "We understand that people want to have fun and celebrate, but it's important to remember that fireworks are dangerous and should be treated with respect," the spokesperson said. "We would ask that people think twice before using them in a reckless or dangerous manner." The incident also raises questions about the availability and sale of fireworks in the UK. While fireworks are legal to purchase and use in the UK, there has been growing concern about their misuse and potential danger. In recent years, there have been calls for tighter regulations around the sale and use of fireworks, particularly around bonfire night. For now, however, emergency service workers in Leeds and across the country will continue to face the risks associated with bonfire night celebrations. The video captured by the fire engine camera is a stark reminder of the dangers, but also serves as a reminder of the bravery and dedication of those who work to keep our communities safe.
