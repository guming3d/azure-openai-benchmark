Hundreds of homeowners will share £1million compensation from Manchester Airport after noise and fumes from a second runway slashed the value of their homes. Nearly 600 homeowners will receive £1,500 each - 11 years after the runway first opened in 2001. The payout marks the end of the long-running legal battle which has seen the airport pay out more than £9million compensation. Payout: Manchester Airport will hand over £1million compensation split between 583 homeowners at the end of an 11-year legal battle . The 583 households in Knutsford and Mobberley who lodged claims will receive the new payout. The airport will also pay the council tax precept, which is levied to fund Knutsford town council and Mobberley parish council, for one year. This will be worth £117,702 in total - and will benefit every household in the area. Six local state schools will also receive a £1,300 one-off payment after the deal was struck. Chancellor George Osborne, whose Tatton constituency covers the area, said the compensation payout was a 'good outcome' for property owners. Airport chiefs had said they would not hand out any more cash because a legal time-limit for claims had passed. Campaigners from the Manchester Airport Environment Network, led by Knutsford resident Jeff Gazzard, and Mr Osborne held talks with airport bosses to try and secure a fresh pay out to those who had not submitted claims before the 2010 deadline.

Mr Osborne said: 'Years of hard campaigning have finally paid off. I want to thank local people for their support and Jeff Gazzard for all his work - he has been a star. At last we have a fair deal for local communities.' Mr Gazzard welcomed the compensation settlement - and said it would end a decade of campaigning. 'It’s an acceptable deal,' he added. 'We were totally reliant on the airport’s good will because legal timeframes for compensation had passed so this was a fair solution. 'I don’t think it is tokenistic but some people may be a little disappointed at the amount - they probably wanted a little more. We’ve taken extreme care to get this right and this now draws a line under the second runway issue.' A spokesman for Manchester Airport said: 'The legal process for Runway 2 claims formally concluded in 2010. However, since then, George Osborne MP and Jeff Gazzard have presented us with a convincing case which showed inequity in the legal process. 'We have now agreed with them a final package of benefits as a goodwill payment. 'We hope that this demonstrates our commitment to work with our local communities as a responsible business and finally draws a line under this process.'

chatgpt: In a long-awaited decision, the residents living near London's Heathrow Airport will receive a payout of £1,500 each, due to the recent drop in house prices caused by the proposed second runway. This decision brings an end to an 11-year battle between the homeowners and the airport authorities. The breakthrough comes with the help of Chancellor George Osborne, who supported the residents' cause and lobbied for their compensation. The plan for the second runway at Heathrow was a contentious issue, with many residents opposing it. One argument raised against the runway was that it would lead to an increase in noise and air pollution as well as the destruction of homes, businesses, and green spaces. As a result of the uncertainty and anxiety faced by the residents, property prices in the surrounding areas have been affected, causing significant financial loss for many homeowners. The payout for the affected residents is a significant milestone and comes after years of negotiations with the authorities. George Osborne, who is also the local MP for the area, welcomed the compensation and stated that it was a good outcome for the homeowners. He had been working with the authorities for a long time to ensure that the residents were adequately compensated for the damages and losses they had incurred. The payout is expected to benefit a total of 583 homeowners who live near Heathrow Airport. The money will help with the renovations of their homes, which have suffered damage from the airport's expansion, as well as to cover any losses from the falling property prices. It will be a much-needed relief for many families who have been living in a state of uncertainty, fearing for the future of their homes and communities. The decision to compensate the residents can also be seen as a reflection of the changing attitudes towards the environment and public health. Many countries globally are recognizing the importance of protecting our planet and minimizing the damage caused by human activities. The impact of pollution on the population's health and the environment is one of the most significant concerns of the modern age. This payout is a step in the right direction, showing that authorities can acknowledge residents' claims and compensate them for any losses. In conclusion, the payout of £1,500 to 583 homeowners living near Heathrow Airport marks the end of a long battle that has been ongoing for 11 years. This compensation eases the stress for many families who have lived in uncertainty and fear for an extended period. The decision can also be seen as a move towards taking environmental concerns more seriously, and recognizing the impact human activity can have on the planet and the population's health. Finally, Chancellor George Osborne should be congratulated for his role in securing this much-needed compensation for the homeowners.
