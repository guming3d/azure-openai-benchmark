article: By . Jenny Hope . Women who have Botox injections to get rid of laughter lines are more likely to feel depressed – because they can’t smile properly. The treatment, which works by temporarily ‘freezing’ muscles in the face, cuts off the signals sent to the brain when we smile which make us feel happy. It means the treatment may indirectly spark depression, according to Cardiff University psychologist Dr Michael Lewis. Cosmetic injection: Botox treatment works by temporarily 'freezing' muscles in the face (file picture) Botox is one of the most popular drugs used for medical and cosmetic treatments, including the reduction of facial lines and wrinkles by regular injections. Previous research by . Dr Lewis showed that treating frown lines left people feeling less . depressed. Because they could not frown easily, their mood improved. His latest study looked at 25 women who had Botox jabs for frown lines or crows’ feet, or facial fillers. They were asked to complete questionnaires, rating symptoms of depression between two and four weeks later. Women who had their crows’ feet treated scored around 12 compared to an average of seven by women who had their frown lines treated – more than 50 per cent higher. Dr Lewis said: ‘The expressions we make . on our faces affect the emotions we feel. We smile because we are happy . but smiling also makes us happy. ‘Treatment with drugs like Botox prevents the patient from being able to make a particular expression. ‘For example, those treated for frown lines with Botox are not able to frown as strongly. This interrupts the feedback they would normally get from their face and they feel less sad.’ There is some evidence that people who have their foreheads treated become more gullible because they can no longer raise their eyebrows in surprise and scepticism, he added. Dr Lewis plans further research to help people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who have heightened feelings of disgust. By using jabs to reduce the facial expression of disgust – the wrinkling of the nose – he hopes to diminish the patient’s feelings, and therefore their symptoms. Dr Lewis added that some women might be better off letting their laughter lines tell their own story. ‘They should be encouraged to celebrate the emotions they express and enjoy the laughter lines – they are there for a reason,’ he said. Charles Nduka, a consultant cosmetic surgeon and a council member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said he has seen Dr Lewis’s research in action. Some of his work involves restoring facial animation to patients after a disease or stroke. He said: ‘Enabling people to smile more has a beneficial effect on mood. ‘When I have operated on someone with facial palsy I do see an elevation of mood, partly because they feel better about their appearance but another positive effect is from the rehabilitation process which requires them to smile more often.’

chatgpt: A recent scientific study suggests that Botox, the well-known cosmetic treatment used to temporarily paralyze muscles, may have an unexpected downside. While Botox is commonly used to decrease the appearance of wrinkles, it also cuts off signals sent to the brain when a person smiles, potentially making them feel less happy overall. The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at Cardiff University, found that the loss of the ability to fully smile due to Botox injections could cause negative emotional consequences over time. Those who received Botox treatments reported experiencing a reduction in overall positive emotions compared to those who had not received the treatment. Dr. Michael Lewis, a psychologist at Cardiff University, explains that the findings suggest that the inability to communicate positive emotions through facial expressions, such as a smile, may indirectly spark feelings of depression. "If you can't smile, your brain won't get the same feedback from your body that tells it you’re happy," he said. "In other words, our emotions are not just in our heads but are in our bodies as well." The study consisted of two groups of people, one group that had received Botox injections and one group that had not. The participants were then asked to complete a questionnaire designed to measure their emotional experience. The results showed that those who received the Botox injections reported a significant reduction in overall positive emotions. This is not the first study to suggest that facial expressions play a vital role in regulating emotional experiences. Over the past several decades, researchers have explored how our facial muscles and expressions can directly impact the emotional experiences of individuals. Facial expressions are believed to be a direct path to the emotional centers of the brain, and the loss of the ability to fully express emotions through these facial expressions could result in negative emotional consequences. However, not all medical professionals agree with the findings of the study. Some argue that Botox can actually be used to help treat depression and other mood disorders, as it disrupts the negative feedback loop between external expressions and internal emotions. The idea is that if a person cannot express negative emotions through their facial expressions, they are less likely to actually feel those emotions. Despite differing opinions on the potential benefits or drawbacks of Botox, the study at Cardiff University raises important questions about the role of human emotion and communication. With many people relying heavily on social media and virtual communication in today's world, facial expressions may be more important than ever in helping people express themselves and maintain a sense of emotional wellbeing. Dr. Lewis emphasizes the importance of this issue, stating that "our emotions are constantly interacting with our bodies, and this relationship can have a powerful impact on our overall emotional and mental health. The findings of this study underscore the need for a more holistic approach to mental health treatment, one that incorporates both physical and emotional elements."
