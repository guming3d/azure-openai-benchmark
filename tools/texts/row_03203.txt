chatgpt: Shotley Pier, a Victorian seaside landmark in Suffolk, UK, has a rich history dating back to 1894. It was originally built as a landing stage for a ferry that transported people from the village across the River Stour to Felixstowe and Harwich. Over the years, the pier has served different purposes, including being a toll pier for people to take boat trips. The pier was once owned by the Marquess of Bristol, who had it in his possession until the mid-20th century. It changed ownership several times before being acquired by the Shotley Heritage Charitable Community Benefit Society (CBS) in 2013. Since then, the CBS has been working tirelessly to restore the pier and turn it into a popular tourist attraction. One significant event that took place at Shotley Pier was the establishment of the Royal Navy's famous HMS Ganges training ship and center in 1905. The pier provided an excellent location for the navy training facility, and it served as the center for over 70 years until its closure in 1976. Today, the Shotley Pier caters to a variety of visitors' needs. It's perfect for people who want to take a leisurely stroll or go fishing from the pier. It's also a great place for families to bring their children, who can enjoy playing on the beach or in the water. Shotley Heritage CBS spokesperson, Mark Brennan, spoke about the recent developments at the pier. "We've been striving to make Shotley Pier a great place for tourists to visit. Over the years, we've put in considerable effort to ensure that it's suitable for a wide range of visitors. We've held several successful fishing competitions, and there's plenty of space for people to relax and take in the beautiful view of the River Stour." The Shotley Pier's restoration efforts have received financial support from various entities, including the National Lottery Heritage Fund, local councils and MPs. The funds received have been used to rebuild the pier's infrastructure and make it as safe and accessible as possible for visitors. Shotley Pier has been a beloved landmark on the Suffolk coast for over a century. Its historical significance and stunning views make it a must-see attraction for both locals and tourists alike. The pier continues to remain open during COVID-19 restrictions, and visitors are advised to follow safety guidelines while enjoying the beautiful surroundings.
