The couple, identified as Donald Jordan, 37, and Lisa Spirella, 49, reportedly got drunk at the nearby Seminole Hard Rock & Casino and decided to stop for a rest in the dumpster. As fate would have it, the dumpster was emptied into the back of a garbage truck that was heading for the compactor, with the couple still sound asleep inside. It was only after the truck had already picked up a few more dumpsters and traveled some distance that the couple awoken to find themselves in a perilous position. Fortunately, the couple was able to alert the truck driver who immediately stopped the truck and called for help. Rescue crews were dispatched to the scene, and in a dramatic rescue operation, they managed to extract the couple from the garbage truck.

Police believe that alcohol may have played a role in the couple's decision to sleep in the dumpster. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of people who may attempt to sleep in public dumpsters. Dumpster diving has become a popular trend among some individuals in recent years, with many seeing it as a way to save money and reduce waste. However, the dangers of sleeping in a dumpster are very real and can have serious consequences, as this incident demonstrates. It is important for individuals to be aware of the risks associated with dumpster diving, especially if they have been drinking. Authorities are advising people to avoid sleeping in dumpsters or climbing into them, as they are not designed for human habitation and can be dangerous.
