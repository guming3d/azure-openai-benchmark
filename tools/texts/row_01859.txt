article: New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Police in the northern India state of Rajasthan say they were stunned when a man showed up at a police outpost holding a bloody human head in one hand and a sword in another. The head was that of the man's daughter, chopped off because of her "indecent behavior," Umesh Ojha, deputy superintendent of the district police, told CNN. Investigators say the man, Oghad Singh, had paraded the head through the village on his way to the police station. Singh's daughter, Manju Kunwar, was in her 20s and was living with her parents after divorcing her husband two years ago. Her father accused her of acting indecently with other men. Family convicted in 'honor murders' Authorities say Kunwar's mother is a farmer who was working in the fields at the time and was too distraught to talk. Singh works in a marble quarry. The beheading happened on Tuesday in Dengar Ka Guda, a village in Rajsamand District about 400 kilometers, or 250 miles, from Jaipur in the state of Rajasthan. Kunwar's head and the rest of her body were cremated according to Hindu tradition, police said. India is filled with extremes on many levels, including how women are treated. In India women hold some of the highest positions in society, from company CEOs to the president and speaker of the House, but this case highlights another side of India, one in which women still suffer the consequences of long-held traditions that govern their behavior in Indian society. This month India topped the Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the worst place to be a woman among the top 19 economies in the world. The foundation cited abuse, killings and discrimination on a scale unparalleled in the other developed nations. Indian father accused of killing baby 'for being a girl'

chatgpt: In a gruesome incident, a man in India brought the severed head of his daughter to a police outpost on Tuesday. According to officials, the man claimed his divorced daughter had been killed for "indecent behavior.” The woman’s mother was too distraught to speak. The father, identified as Sarvesh Kumar, arrived at the police station in the Hardoi district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh with his daughter's severed head. He told the officials that his 28-year-old daughter had been beheaded by her husband, who had grown suspicious of her behavior. The police have arrested the husband, identified as Azad Singh, and his father, Shershan Singh, in connection with the murder. The father-son duo reportedly has a history of domestic violence, and the victim had been living with her parents for the past few months. The police officer-in-charge, AK Pandey, said that Kumar had brought his daughter's severed head in a bag and laid it on the counter. The officials on duty were stunned and could not believe what they were seeing. They immediately called for backup, and the father was taken into custody for questioning. According to Pandey, the woman's mother was inconsolable and was too shocked to speak to reporters. The investigation is underway, and the police are trying to understand the sequence of events that led to the murder. The incident has once again highlighted the issue of violence against women in India. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, a crime against a woman is committed every three minutes in the country. In recent years, there have been growing calls for stricter laws and better implementation of existing measures to protect women from violence. This tragic incident has shocked the nation and has once again brought attention to the plight of women in India. The government must take swift action to ensure that such horrific crimes are prevented, and women can live without the fear of violence.
