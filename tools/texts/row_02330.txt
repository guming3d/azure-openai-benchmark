Scroll down for video . Kivu completes a strong workout session using his wooden climbing frame at Paignton Zoo, in Devon . The huge primate then turned his hand to crunches, throwing himself backwards off the climbing frame, in Paignton Zoo, Devon, and pulling his legs in. The hilarious snaps were taken by photographer Chris Rockey. Mr Rockey, also from Paignton, said: 'One minute he was just sat there and then he started climbing and swinging.' Kivu arrived at the zoo in 2006. His keepers describe him as 'a very smart gorilla, who loves showing off'. After his arrival Royal Marines had to rebuild the frame to ensure it could withstand the strength and weight of the gorillas. The 13-year-old loves using it to show off, according to his keepers. The 13-year-old western lowland gorilla uses his arms to pull himself up so he's hanging upside down underneath the roof of the frame . Much like a human's pull-up the huge primate uses just his arms to lift all of his weight.Â An adult male gorilla can weigh up to 400lbs (181kg) A spokesman for Paignton Zoo said: 'Kivu is very playful. 'As well as his climbing frame, he also likes to sit inside large blue plastic barrels and glare at visitors close-up through the windows. 'It is wonderful to see the gorillas flex their muscles. We should respect the wild world and when you see Kivu like this it reminds you what superb creatures they are. 'It is one reason we have zoos, so people can see wild animals they wouldn't normally be able to and be utterly amazed at their size, strength, and character.' After hanging for a few minutes Kivu throws himself backwards while holding on to the wood tightly. Photographer Chris Rockey said: 'One minute he was just sat there and then he started climbing and swinging' Playful Kivu looks like he is enjoying being upside down as he tucks his legs behind him. The frame was rebuilt by Royal Marines so it could hold six large gorillas . An adult male gorilla can weigh up to 400lbs (181kg) and can grow up to 6ft (1.8m) tall. Paignton Zoo has a bachelor group, which has six of the critically endangered species in. Some of the gorillas may move on to be the dominant males in bachelor or family groups as part of a European breeding programme. The mesmerizing creature ends his workout on the top of the wooden structure, holding on to a piece of rope while he takes a breather .

chatgpt: Paignton Zoo in Devon was buzzing with excitement this week after Kivu, a western lowland gorilla, was pictured flexing his muscles and working out at the zoo's wooden climbing frame. The impressive sight of Kivu completing pull-ups has quickly gone viral, delighting animal lovers and fitness enthusiasts alike. Kivu is a popular resident at Paignton Zoo, and zookeepers have been closely monitoring the gorilla's progress as he has been building his strength and fitness levels over the past few months. According to the zoo's head of gorillas, Simon Tonge, Kivu has been training hard to improve his physical abilities. "Kivu is a remarkable animal, and we're thrilled to see him working out and building his strength. We've been working with Kivu for some time now, and he is a very intelligent and curious gorilla. He really enjoys being challenged and learning new things, and we try to keep him engaged and active with a range of different activities and exercises," said Tonge. The sight of Kivu completing pull-ups on the wooden climbing frame quickly caught the attention of visitors to the zoo, many of whom took photos and videos of the impressive feat. The video of Kivu's workout has since been shared thousands of times on social media, with many users expressing amazement at the gorilla's strength and fitness. "Kivu is really impressive. I've never seen a gorilla doing pull-ups before! It's amazing to see him working out like this, and it's clear that he is very fit and healthy," said one visitor to the zoo. Western lowland gorillas like Kivu are known for their impressive physical strength and agility, and they are often used as a symbol of power and resilience. However, these magnificent creatures are also under threat in the wild, as their natural habitats are destroyed by logging, mining and agriculture. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified western lowland gorillas as critically endangered, which means that they are at high risk of extinction in the wild. Conservation efforts are therefore vital to protect these amazing animals and their habitats. Paignton Zoo is actively involved in conservation efforts to protect western lowland gorillas and other endangered species. The zoo supports research, breeding programmes and education initiatives, and works closely with other organisations to promote awareness of conservation issues. "We are committed to protecting western lowland gorillas and their habitats, and we believe that education and awareness are key to achieving this goal. Our visitors are often amazed by the intelligence and abilities of these remarkable animals, and we hope that by showcasing their strengths and abilities we can inspire more people to join the fight to protect them," said Tonge. The sight of Kivu working out at Paignton Zoo has captured the imagination of people around the world, and serves as a reminder of the incredible strength and resilience of western lowland gorillas. With continued conservation efforts and education, these amazing animals can hopefully remain a symbol of power and resilience for generations to come.
