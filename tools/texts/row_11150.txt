article: (CNN)Indianapolis Colts backup linebacker Josh McNary has been charged with felony rape, a spokeswoman for the Marion County, Indiana, Prosecutor's Office said Wednesday. McNary, 26, was in police custody late Wednesday at the Marion County Jail, a booking log on the jail website said. McNary was also charged with felony criminal confinement and misdemeanor battery resulting in bodily injury. According to a probable cause affidavit, a 29-year-old woman reported to police on the morning of December 1 that she was raped hours earlier at the apartment of a man she met while out at a bar. She said she told the man several times she didn't want to have sex and fought with him, scratching him on the face, neck, back and shoulder. The man forced her to have sex on his bed, she told police. She took the man's cell phone as she left the apartment. A forensic nurse examined the woman and found injuries to her vagina and dried blood behind one ear. The document indicates detectives used the cell phone to identify McNary the next day. He was cooperative, police indicated, and he asked for a lawyer after being advised of his rights. A nurse found abrasions and scratches on his stomach, back, neck and shoulder, the document says. Investigators also found the woman's clothing and an earring in McNary's apartment. CNN's attempts to reach McNary's attorney weren't immediately successful. The Colts said they were aware of media reports about the incident. "But unfortunately that's the limit of our knowledge," the Colts said in a written statement. "At this time, we are very concerned and trying to find out what the relevant facts are, but we have insufficient information to venture any opinion.  As we learn more, we will make appropriate updates." The National Football League said the matter is "under review." Recently, the NFL revised its Personal Conduct Policy. It includes a minimum six-game suspension for crimes involving violent conduct, including domestic violence and sexual assault. The league reviewed its stance after widespread criticism of its handling of the Ray Rice case. McNary is listed as a second-string inside linebacker for the Colts, who play the New England Patriots on Sunday in the AFC championship game. He has 28 tackles -- mostly on special teams -- in 15 games this season. He played in the Colts game on November 30 and had one tackle on punt coverage. The 6-foot, 251-pound player is in his second season. He played collegiate football at Army and served in the military from 2011 to 2013 before joining the Colts. CNN's Tina Burnside, Dave Alsup, Erica Henry and Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A woman has accused John McNary, a former football player and military man, of rape, according to a probable cause affidavit filed by the police. The accuser reported that she took a phone from McNary's apartment after the alleged incident, which was later identified as belonging to the accused. According to reports, the woman told the police that she met McNary at a bar and was later invited back to his apartment, where the alleged assault took place. She also stated that she took the phone from McNary's apartment to preserve evidence of the incident. The incident allegedly took place in December of 2020, but the woman did not report it until March of 2021. McNary has not yet been charged with a crime and a lawyer for him could not be reached for comment. The probable cause affidavit filed by the detective in the case indicates that the accuser had injuries consistent with sexual assault and that the DNA of both the accuser and McNary were found at the scene. McNary played football at the United States Military Academy at West Point and later played for the Indianapolis Colts. He left the NFL to serve in the military and later returned to civilian life. He has not played professional football since 2015. CNN attempted to reach out to a lawyer for McNary, but they were unable to make contact. It is unknown at this time if McNary has hired a lawyer or if he will be facing any charges related to the alleged incident. The case is currently under investigation by the police and more information is expected to be released as the investigation progresses. The accuser has not made a public statement about the case at this time. This latest incident is not the first time that professional football players have been accused of sexual assault. Earlier this year, Deshaun Watson, a quarterback for the Houston Texans, was sued by multiple women alleging sexual misconduct. The NFL has launched an investigation into the allegations. In recent years, the #MeToo movement and increased awareness of sexual assault have brought more attention to these types of cases, both in the public eye and in the justice system. As for McNary, it remains to be seen what the outcome of the investigation will be and what charges, if any, he will face. The police have not commented on the case beyond the information contained in the probable cause affidavit.
