article: By . Daniel Mills . The family of a Queensland woman who died during her work Christmas party will not receive a payout for her death because she was ruled to be off-duty when the accident happened. Jukes Campbell was celebrating the function with colleagues when she dove into a shallow section of the Noosa River, suffering neck and back injuries. Despite the party being sanctioned by her boss and organised by the Woolworths-owned store, her death won't be recognised as a workplace accident. Jonathon Campbell, the woman's husband, turned her life support off two days after the party. Jonathon Campbell lost his a bid for his wife's workers compensation after the Queensland IRC ruled she did not die from duties performed at work. The Courier Mail reported that the Industrial Relations Commission, who sided with a Woolworths bid to block the family's claim for compensation, ruled that her husband Mr Campbell was not entitled to a payout from his wife’s death because she had been 'on a frolic of her own'. In order to qualify for a workers compensation payout staff must prove their injury 'arose out of, or in the course of' their work. The IRC ruled that Mrs Campbell was not working, proving a cruel blow for her husband who had originally won a Queensland Government workers compensation claim after the deputy director-general for Fair and Safe Work Queensland approved it. Woolworths said its staff encouraged Ms Campbell to attend the party which was celebrated in March instead of December because of staff commitments, but denied they encouraged her to dive into the Noosa River. It is claimed Ms Campbell asked her manager to take photos of her just before the accident occurred. Mrs Campbell dove head first into the Noosa River, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast during a Christmas work party in March . The Noosaville Dan Murphy's Store where Mrs Campbell worked . Woolworths has refused to comment on the matter because Mr Campbell has lodged an appeal and the case is still ongoing. The maximum amount payable for a workers compensation payout in Queensland is $374,625. Woolworths is one of Australia's largest retailers employing more than 197,000 people nationwide. It has nearly 900 retail liquor outlets and 627 petrol stations. In a similar case in NSW, Woolworths refused to pay workers compensation to the three orphaned children of single mother Marie Scanlan, the manager of a petrol station in western Sydney. Ms Scanlan suffered a  heart attack while driving to a stressful management meeting in April four years ago. The Workers Compensation Commission ordered Woolworths to pay $433,650 to Ms Scanlan’s children because her stressful job, where she worked up to 70 hours a week, aggravated her deadly heart condition.

chatgpt: A Sunshine Coast mother has tragically passed away after an incident at a Christmas party organized by her employer, Woolworths. Jukes Campbell dived into a shallow section of the Noosa River, which resulted in severe injuries to her neck and back. Despite being taken to the hospital, she succumbed to her injuries. The incident has since taken a turn in the legal system as her husband, Jonathon Campbell, filed for workplace compensation from Woolworths. Initially approved, the appeal process overturned the decision after the Industrial Relations Commission found that Woolworths was not responsible for her injuries. The reason given was that the accident occurred while Jukes was off duty. Mr. Campbell has appealed this decision and is seeking justice for his late wife, but Woolworths has refused to comment on the matter. The death of Jukes Campbell has left her family and loved ones devastated. A community member, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke to local reporters and expressed their sadness over the situation. "Jukes was such a kind-hearted woman. It's so unfair that she was taken away from us so soon. My heart goes out to her family, especially her husband, in this difficult time," they said. The incident has also sparked a conversation about employee safety, both on and off-duty. Many people are questioning whether employers should be held responsible for incidents that occur outside of work but during work-related events. According to the Queensland Work Health and Safety Act 2011, it is an employer's responsibility to ensure the safety of their employees in the workplace. However, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a workplace outside of work hours or off-site events. As the legal proceedings continue, many people are eagerly waiting to see what the outcome will be. Regardless of the final decision, the tragedy of Jukes Campbell's death is a reminder that safety should always be a top priority in the workplace and beyond. In conclusion, the death of Jukes Campbell at a Christmas party organized by her employer, Woolworths, has left her family and community devastated. Her husband's appeal for workplace compensation was overturned on the grounds that the accident occurred while Jukes was off duty. As the legal battle continues, this incident has sparked a conversation about employee safety beyond the borders of the workplace. Regardless of the outcome, it serves as a reminder to always prioritize safety and ensure the well-being of employees both on and off the clock.
