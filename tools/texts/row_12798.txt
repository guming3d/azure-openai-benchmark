article: Washington (CNN)Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan fully reversed his anti-abortion position and came out as pro-choice in an op-ed published on Tuesday. "I have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator, and I am not afraid to say that my position has evolved as my experiences have broadened, deepened and become more personal," Ryan wrote in the Akron Beacon Journal. "I have come to believe that we must trust women and families — not politicians — to make the best decision for their lives," he said. After running for Congress on a pro-life platform in 2002 and initially voting with Republicans on the issue, Ryan, who is Catholic, has shifted leftward on abortion. In recent years, he's drawn criticism from pro-life activists that once supported him for voting to protect public funding for Planned Parenthood and access to contraception. Ryan wrote in the op-ed that his shift was inspired by conversations with women during his political career, but the move also puts him in a better position politically as he contemplates a potential 2016 challenge to Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican. Ryan told Roll Call that "we're certainly looking very closely at" a Senate run. And while he's won re-election to his heavily Democratic district with comfortable margins nearly every cycle since 2002, Ryan's pro-life stance could have been an obstacle for him in a Democratic Senate primary in the swing state. Indeed, Portman himself has shifted on a key social issue since he was elected in 2010 with Tea Party support. He came out in favor of gay marriage in 2013, also in a newspaper op-ed, citing his experience with his gay son as partial inspiration for the shift.

"I realize that people can be cynical about politics and think this is something tied to a Senate aspiration," Ryan told the Plain Dealer. "The reality is, this is just where my heart is right now. I want to be clear about that. I would be abandoning my own conscience and my own judgment if I somehow led people to believe I was supporting a position I no longer thought was the appropriate position to have."

chatgpt: Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan has announced that he is now pro-choice, a significant shift from his previous stance on abortion. In an op-ed published on Tuesday, Ryan explained his decision to change his position, citing personal experiences and the need to prioritize women's health and autonomy. Ryan had previously run on an anti-abortion platform in 2002 but has since shifted leftward on the issue over the years. In his op-ed, he discussed the impact of his political positions on his personal life, noting that he "doesn't know a woman who hasn't grappled" with the decision to have an abortion. "I've had women close to me who have faced this decision," Ryan wrote. "And I've seen firsthand how it affects their lives and their families. No woman should be denied the right to make this choice for herself." Ryan's announcement comes as the Democratic party continues to grapple with issues surrounding reproductive health and access to abortion. The issue has become increasingly contentious in recent years, with Republican-controlled state legislatures passing restrictive abortion laws and conservative judges being appointed to the Supreme Court. However, Ryan dismissed speculation that his shift on abortion was motivated by a potential bid for Senate in Ohio, where incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman has announced he will not seek reelection in 2022. "While the question of whether or not to seek higher office is always present in the mind of a politician, my decision to speak out on this issue is solely based on my conscience and my commitment to doing what's right for the people I represent," he wrote. Ryan's announcement has been met with support from reproductive rights advocates and fellow Democrats, who praised his willingness to change his stance and prioritize women's reproductive health. "Thank you to Rep. Ryan for sharing his personal story and committing to fight for women's reproductive rights," tweeted Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. "We need more leaders like him who are willing to listen and evolve on this critical issue." Despite the backlash Ryan may face from more conservative constituents, his decision to come out as pro-choice underscores the ongoing debate surrounding reproductive rights and the need for politicians to prioritize the health and autonomy of women.
