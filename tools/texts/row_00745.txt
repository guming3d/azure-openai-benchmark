chatgpt: Everton Football Club has announced the signing of Cameroon international Samuel Eto'o on a free transfer. The 33-year-old, who was released by Chelsea earlier this summer, has signed a two-year deal with the Toffees. Eto'o, widely regarded as one of the greatest African footballers of all time, brings a wealth of experience to the Everton team. He has scored over 300 goals in a career spanning over 20 years, including winning three Champions League titles with Barcelona and Inter Milan. Speaking to the Everton website about his new signing, manager Roberto Martinez said, "I am delighted to welcome Samuel to Everton. His experience in European football is immense and he will bring a calmness and professionalism to our squad. He has had an incredible career and we are all looking forward to seeing him in an Everton shirt." Eto'o's signing has been met with widespread approval from Everton supporters, who have hailed his arrival as a major coup for the club. Many fans believe that his addition to the squad will help to shore up their attack and push the Toffees closer towards European qualification. Everton finished fifth in the Premier League last season, narrowly missing out on a Champions League place. Martinez has been keen to strengthen his squad over the summer, with the addition of Eto'o representing one of his most significant signings. The Cameroon striker had been linked with a move to Serie A side Sampdoria, but ultimately decided to make the switch to the Premier League. Eto'o had previously played in England for Chelsea, where he scored 12 goals in 35 appearances. Eto'o's signing adds to a growing African contingent at Everton, which already includes Ivorian forward Arouna Kone and Ghanaian midfielder Christian Atsu. The Toffees have a rich history of African players, with the likes of Joseph Yobo, Yakubu Aiyegbeni and Ayegbeni Yakubu all having represented the club in the past. The announcement of Eto'o's signing comes just days after Everton secured a hard-fought 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in their opening fixture of the new Premier League season. The Toffees will be hoping to build on that promising start and mount a serious challenge for a top-four finish this year. Eto'o's arrival is likely to provide a major boost to Everton's chances of achieving that aim. With his proven track record and experience at the highest levels of European football, the Cameroon striker could well prove to be the difference-maker that the Toffees have been searching for. On the other hand, Eto'o might also find that his pace and stamina may diminish by the season end, owing to his age.
