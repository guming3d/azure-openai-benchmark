chatgpt: Sri Lanka's new Prime Minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has declared that Australian billionaire James Packer is no longer welcome in the country after he withdrew from a major development plan. Packer had agreed to build a $350 million resort with a casino in Colombo, but the government's recent ban on new casinos and revocation of a tax concession have put a halt to the project.  The new government led by Prime Minister Rajapaksa has made clear that they are not interested in pursuing the kind of high-end tourism that Packer's proposed resort would have brought to Colombo. In fact, the government is said to be actively seeking to reduce the number of casinos in the country and has revoked a number of licenses that were previously granted to operators. The withdrawal of Packer's project has been a major blow to the government's plans for economic development. However, Prime Minister Rajapaksa has indicated that he is willing to look for alternative investors who are willing to invest in projects that align with the government's vision for the future of Sri Lanka.  The cancellation of Packer's project has caused a stir in the country, with many accusing the government of breaking its promises to the billionaire. Packer had reportedly been promised a tax concession that would have saved him over $1 billion, but the concession was revoked shortly after the new government took office.  The move to revoke the tax concession has been widely criticised, with many accusing the government of reneging on agreements made by the previous administration. However, Prime Minister Rajapaksa has defended the move, saying that the tax concession was not in the best interest of the country and that it was a decision that had to be made in the national interest.  The cancellation of Packer's project has also raised questions about the stability of Sri Lanka's investment climate.  Some investors may be deterred from investing in Sri Lanka in the future, believing that the government can easily cancel projects that it deems to be not in the national interest.  The government has sought to allay these fears, saying that it remains committed to attracting investment to the country. The government has also reiterated that it welcomes foreign investment, but it is determined to ensure that any projects align with their vision for the country.  The cancellation of Packer's project is a clear signal that the new government is serious about its plans to reduce the number of casinos in the country. It remains to be seen what kind of alternative development projects the government will seek to attract, but many believe that there is still significant potential for growth in Sri Lanka's tourism sector.  In the coming months, the government will be looking to identify potential investors who share its vision for the future of the country. It is hoped that by doing so, Sri Lanka can strengthen its position as a major player in the region and continue to attract investment from around the world.
