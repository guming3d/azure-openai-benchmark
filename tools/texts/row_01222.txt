Zhang had taken his wedding ring off to have a shower in the room, but the door handle broke, leaving him trapped inside. The incident occurred at a factory in the southeastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, where Zhang works. When his colleagues heard him shouting for help from the staff room, they immediately alerted the authorities.

However, as he was leaving the room, the door handle broke, leaving him trapped. The incident has highlighted the importance of safety measures in the workplace. Zhang's employer is now being urged to take steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. Many workers in China are concerned about safety at work, with reports of accidents and injuries on the rise.
