Bar owner Stuart Solomon said it was a mistake by a staff member who wasn't thinking properly and that the Tweet was taken out of context. 'Bottom line is, I own the bar. I will take responsibility for anything my members put out, and someone made a horrible mistake,' he told KCTV5. 'Obviously, I think we all know they did not mean for the connotation this was taken in, but they should have obviously chose their words much more wisely.' Soloman added that, from now on, he will handle all social media for the venue. Aura describes itself on its website as a 'liquor-fueled playhouse designed for the discerning club goer'.

chatgpt: Kansas City's Aura nightclub has found itself in hot water after posting a message on its Facebook and Twitter pages that was labeled offensive and "disgusting". The post, which was made in an attempt to draw more people to their New Year's Eve party, read, "AURA introduces the anti-rape program... We won't RAPE you on prices on NYE on "all inclusives" where they run out of liquor at 11pm hahaha". After seeing the post, a barrage of complaints flooded the nightclub's social media pages. Many were outraged and felt that the post was insensitive and trivialized the serious issue of rape. Some commenters accused the nightclub of using rape to sell tickets, while others vowed to boycott the establishment. The post was ultimately taken down by bar owner Stuart Soloman, who has since issued an apology. According to Soloman, the post was intended to be a lighthearted joke but was misunderstood, and the bar did not intend to make light of the issue of rape or offend anyone. However, not everyone is willing to move on from the incident. Many are still expressing their outrage and demanding that the nightclub do more to address the issue of sexual violence. Some are advocating for the implementation of better training and policies to prevent sexual assault in bars and nightclubs, while others are calling for a wider dialogue on the issue. The controversy surrounding the Aura nightclub's post serves as a reminder that even seemingly harmless jokes can have serious consequences. Sexual violence is a serious issue that affects many people, and it is important for businesses and individuals to be sensitive and aware of the impact their words and actions can have. Moving forward, it is unclear what steps the Aura nightclub will take to address the situation. However, the incident has sparked an important conversation about consent and sexual violence that will hopefully lead to a greater understanding and awareness of these issues.
