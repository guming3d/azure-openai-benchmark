chatgpt: A Wisconsin man, Neil Olson, has become known for a unique Christmas tradition that he's kept up for over 45 years. In 1974, before two of his sons went off to serve in the Vietnam War, Olson put up a Christmas tree in his Wausau home. And it's been up ever since. The eldest of those two sons was injured during the war and has been unable to return to his home. But Olson has refused to take the tree down until all six of his sons, who are scattered throughout the United States, can be together to celebrate Christmas. The tree, which is over four decades old, is decorated with tinsel and baubles, even as the needles remain intact. Olson believes that taking the tree down would be like tearing down his family's history. And while he's received criticism and even death threats from those who find his tradition odd, he remains steadfast in his decision. For Olson, the tree is more than just a decoration, it's a symbol of hope and a reminder of the importance of family during the holiday season. He's hopeful that this year, he'll be able to take the tree down for good. All of his sons are now grown and his grandkids are eager to see the tree in person. But even if this year is not the year, Olson says he'll continue to keep the tree up until his entire family can be reunited. And though he's faced backlash for his tradition, Olson's determination to keep it alive is a testament to the power of family. As the holiday season approaches, many families will gather around a decorated tree to exchange gifts and share memories. For the Olson family, their tree represents something much more profound - a symbol of love, faith, and resilience that endures despite the passing of time. And it's a reminder to us all that the true meaning of Christmas is found in the bonds we share with those we love.
