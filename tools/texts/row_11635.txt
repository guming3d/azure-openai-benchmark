Upon arrival, firefighters were faced with a blaze that had engulfed five classrooms, with four of them completely destroyed and the fifth left with severe damage. The school, located in the suburban area of the Blue Mountains, had recently undergone extensive renovations with the aim of improving its facilities. However, with the destruction caused by the fire, the future of these renovations now hangs uncertain. At the time of the incident, there were no students or staff on the premises as it was a Sunday, so no injuries were reported. However, the school's administration has expressed their grief and shock at the loss of property and the interruption of the school term. The exact cause of the fire is yet to be determined, but authorities are treating it as arson. The NSW police have started investigations into the incident and are urging anyone with information to come forward.

Our thoughts go out to the students and staff who will be affected by this disruption to their education." The fire is a stark reminder of the importance of fire safety and the dangers of arson.
