article: One in five men in Britain die from a heart attack compared to just one in seven women . By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 05:39 EST, 12 August 2011 . Around one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women . The sex hormone oestrogen protects women from heart attacks and may explain why they are far less likely to be struck down than men, claim scientists. They have discovered that this naturally-occurring chemical helps stop blood cells sticking to the walls of arteries and forming potentially fatal blockages. Researchers from Queen Mary at the University of London think their findings  may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause, when their oestrogen levels decline. Around one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women. But while very few women suffer heart attacks before their 50s, the risk suddenly increases after the menopause when they are just as likely to be struck down than men. Until recently experts have struggled to explain why younger women are less likely to develop heart disease and suffer heart attacks. Now research published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology claims that the hormone oestrogen may protect them. But experts say their findings do not necessarily mean that oestrogen could  ever be used in drugs to prevent heart disease. The hormone is known to increase the risk of certain types of cancer. Dr Suchita Nadkarni from the William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary,  University of London, who led the research, said: 'We’ve shown a clear relationship between oestrogen levels and the behaviour of these white blood cells. Researchers from Queen Mary at the University of London, pictured, think their findings may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause, when their oestrogen levels decline . 'Our results suggest that oestrogen helps maintain the delicate balance between fighting infections, and protecting arteries from damage that can lead to cardiovascular disease. 'Understanding how the body fights heart disease naturally is vital for  developing new treatments.' Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart  Foundation said: 'We know that women’s health is partly protected by oestrogen. After menopause  – when oestrogen levels drop dramatically – coronary heart disease rates rise  steeply. It’s not yet clear quite how this protection occurs. 'This study suggests that oestrogen has another role. The hormone seems to  affect women’s response to infection and injury, by preventing white blood  cells from moving out of the blood stream into tissues. This reduces  inflammation, part of the immune system’s rapid response.'

chatgpt: A recent study has found that the male sex hormone, testosterone, may play a crucial role in preventing artery blockages and reducing the likelihood of heart attacks in men. According to statistics, one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women. This makes heart disease the leading cause of death among men in the country. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, examined the role of testosterone in preventing blood cells from sticking to artery walls and forming blockages, which can lead to heart attacks. The researchers found that testosterone helps to regulate the production of a protein called PCSK9, which is known to play a key role in the buildup of plaque in the arteries. The study's lead author, Dr. Dobromir Dobrev, explained that "the findings suggest that testosterone may help to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of heart disease and heart attacks in men." The research team conducted experiments on mice that were genetically engineered to lack the Pcsk9 gene. They found that the mice had lower levels of plaque buildup in their arteries compared to normal mice. The researchers then injected the mice with testosterone and found that it further reduced plaque buildup in the arteries. Dr. Dobrev acknowledged that more research is needed to fully understand the implications of the findings. However, he expressed that the study provides new insights into the role of testosterone in cardiovascular health, especially for men who are at increased risk of heart disease. Heart disease is a major public health concern in the UK, with over 7.4 million people living with the condition. Men are more likely to develop heart disease at a younger age than women, and research has shown that testosterone levels may have a significant impact on heart health. The new findings are likely to lead to further research exploring the potential benefits of testosterone replacement therapy in men with low testosterone levels. This treatment is already used to improve symptoms of low testosterone, such as reduced sex drive, but it remains a controversial topic in terms of its effects on cardiovascular health. In conclusion, the latest research provides valuable insights into the role of testosterone in preventing artery blockages and reducing the risk of heart disease in men. While more research is needed to fully understand the implications of the findings, the study highlights the importance of testosterone regulation in cardiovascular health, especially for men who are at increased risk of heart attack. The new findings may pave the way for further research into testosterone replacement therapy, which could improve heart health outcomes in men with low testosterone levels.
