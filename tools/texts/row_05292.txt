article: It's the chum of all fears. One of the most notorious spots for shark attacks on the Australian coast just got a whole lot more dangerous. Beaches along the tourist mecca strip of the Sunshine Coast have been targeted by people removing baited hooks from drum lines and the activity is 'putting lives at risk'. Scroll down for video . Men in grey suits: Queensland's chief shark ranger warns lives are at risk after baited hooks were vandalised . Jeff Krause, boss of the Queensland government's shark control program, said 18 drum lines - designed to snare sharks and keep them away from swimmers - have been targeted off Yaroomba and Currumundi over recent weeks. 'It appears that someone, or a number of people, have purposely gone out to the drum lines with the intention of removing the hooks,' Mr Krause said. 'This is very dangerous and illegal, and compromises the effectiveness of the shark control program putting lives at risk.' Asked if conservationists were the likely suspects, Mr Krause said: 'We are unsure of who is taking the hooks so will continue to monitor the equipment.' A spokeswoman for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said it is the first time shark control devices had been tampered with in this way. Trouble in paradise: Yaroomba Beach was one of the surf spots targeted by bait snatchers . The offence carries with it an on the spot fine of $1100 and a maximum fine of $55,000. 'We have shark nets and drum lines positioned approximately 300â€“400 metres offshore at 85 popular beaches at 10 regional centres in Queensland. Installed off popular swimming beaches, drum lines consist of a floating drum (or buoy) with two lines attached. One line is anchored to the sea floor and another is fitted with a baited hook used to snare predatory sharks. They are controversial devices and many conservationists have campaigned against their use. 'While the shark control program does not provide a permanent barrier between swimmers and sharks, it is effective in reducing the overall number of sharks in the area, making it a safer place to swim.' The most recent fatal shark attack in Australia lead to the death of 63-year-old Tathra woman Christine Armstrong, who was killed by a shark off her home beach in April. However, Queensland remains by far the most attack-prone state in the country with 67 fatalities and 126 injuries in the last 100 years. New South Wales is second with 47 deaths. Australia trails only America in number of fatal unprovoked shark attacks and Great White Sharks are the species responsible for most deaths by far. People who see vandals attempting to remove bait from drum lines are encouraged to call the 24 hour 'Fishwatch Hotline' on 1800 017 116.

chatgpt: The safety of beachgoers in Queensland is being called into question, as the state's chief shark ranger warns that lives are at risk. This comes after vandals reportedly stole baited hooks from 18 drum lines off the Sunshine Coast. The devices were put in place to catch and deter sharks from swimming too close to the shore, but with the stolen bait, their effectiveness has been significantly reduced. Conservationists are the prime suspects in this latest incident, following a long-standing controversy over the use of drum lines. These devices have been criticized for their potential harm to marine life, particularly sharks. However, many argue that they are necessary to protect the safety of beachgoers, especially in areas where shark attacks have occurred in the past. The Queensland government is unsure of who's to blame for the unprecedented bait grab, but they're not ruling out any possibilities. The incident is being taken seriously, as the safety of both humans and marine life are at risk. The government has urged anyone with information about the theft to come forward. The theft of baited hooks from the drum lines is a major setback for the state's efforts to protect beachgoers from shark attacks. It's not clear how long it will take to replace the stolen bait and restore the drum lines to their full functionality. Until then, the beaches in the area will be more vulnerable to shark activity, with potential consequences for both humans and marine life. The controversy over the use of drum lines is unlikely to go away anytime soon, with conservationists and some members of the public continuing to call for their removal. However, others argue that they're necessary to protect the safety of beachgoers, as alternatives like nets and drones have proven to be less effective. It's not the first time that drum lines have been targeted by vandals in Queensland. In recent years, numerous incidents of vandalism and sabotage have been reported, with groups opposed to the devices taking matters into their own hands. However, this latest incident is particularly concerning, given the potential consequences for public safety. The Queensland government has assured the public that it's doing everything possible to investigate the theft of the baited hooks and ensure the safety of beachgoers. They've also emphasized the importance of following basic safety precautions, such as swimming between the flags and not swimming in areas where sharks have been spotted. In conclusion, the theft of baited hooks from 18 drum lines off the Sunshine Coast has raised serious concerns about the safety of beachgoers in Queensland. With the devices' effectiveness significantly reduced, the government must act quickly to restore full functionality and protect the public from potential shark attacks.
