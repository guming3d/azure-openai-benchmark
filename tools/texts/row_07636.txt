chatgpt: Spain is threatening to charge thousands of workers £43 ($56) to cross the border, as tensions between Spain and Gibraltar continue to rise. The move comes after Gibraltar authorities began building a concrete reef in the waters surrounding the British overseas territory, in a bid to bar Spanish fishing boats from the area. The dispute between Spain and Gibraltar over the fishing rights in the area has been ongoing for several years. The latest escalation in tensions began when Gibraltar authorities began to build the reef, which Spain claims is a violation of its territorial waters. In response, Spain has threatened to charge thousands of workers who cross the border between Spain and Gibraltar a fee of £43 per trip. This would have a significant impact on the workforce in Gibraltar, which relies heavily on Spanish workers. The Spanish government's move has been met with criticism from both Gibraltar and the UK. Gibraltar’s Chief Minister, Fabian Picardo, described the move as “unacceptable” and “unlawful”. He also accused Spain of trying to create a “hard border” between the two countries. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has also criticized the move. He reportedly warned Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy that Britain could sue over the issue. The UK government has also accused Spain of using the dispute as a way of exerting pressure on Gibraltar over its sovereignty. This latest escalation in tensions comes at a time when Brexit negotiations are ongoing. Gibraltar has been a point of contention in the negotiations, with Spain pushing for joint control of the territory in the event of a hard Brexit. The UK government has repeatedly stated that it will not negotiate the sovereignty of Gibraltar without the consent of its people. However, the latest moves by Spain have raised concerns about the impact that the dispute could have on the people of Gibraltar. The situation in Gibraltar is likely to continue to be a point of contention between Spain and the UK. The prospect of a hard border between Spain and Gibraltar could have serious consequences for the workforce in Gibraltar, as well as for the wider economy of the region. Both sides will need to work together to find a solution to the ongoing dispute over fishing rights. The UK government has stated that it is committed to finding a solution that is acceptable to both parties, but the situation remains deeply complicated and will likely take some time to resolve.
