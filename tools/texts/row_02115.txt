article: Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday that it had shuffled some key management jobs as it continues its review of the controversy over sleeping and inattentive controllers. It also named four members to a review panel that will evaluate the FAA's controller training programs to make sure new controllers are properly prepared. The panel will submit a report to FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt this fall. "We are continuing to do everything in our power to ensure that our nation's aviation system remains the safest in the world," Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. He called the changes "just the beginning of the process." The controversy, which grew in recent weeks to include more than a half-dozen alleged sleeping or inattentive controllers, had already claimed a top FAA official, Henry "Hank" Krakowski, who resigned his post as head of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization. It has also fired three air traffic controllers in Miami, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Seattle who were found to have slept on the job, and is continuing its review of other controllers. In the changes announced Friday, the FAA said it is repositioning three veteran FAA managers to critical roles. Walt Cochran will oversee terminal operations, where he will be responsible for FAA airport towers and regional radar facilities. Chris Metts will oversee all of the FAA's "en route" and oceanic operations. Glen Martin will become air traffic manager at the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center. The FAA said it also is assessing key mid-level management positions "to ensure that both technical and leadership expectations are being met." The members of the independent review panel are: Michael Barr, University of Southern California Aviation, Safety & Security program; Tim Brady, Embry Riddle Aeronautical University; Garth Koleszar, National Air Traffic Controllers Association; Michael New, United Airlines; and Julia Pounds, FAA. Earlier this month, the FAA changed work schedules to allow controllers more time off between shifts, and Babbitt and controller union president Paul Rinaldi toured facilities to send a message to controllers about job expectations. The FAA said it and union teams have so far visited facilities in and around 20 major U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, Sacramento and Salt Lake City. "The FAA's focus is safety. These changes ensure that we have the right people in the right places to help us carry out our mission," Babbitt said in a statement Friday. "I am confident our top-to-bottom review is making our air traffic system even safer."

chatgpt: In the midst of growing controversy surrounding air traffic controllers' performance, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has shuffled key management jobs and set up a review panel to evaluate training programs. The FAA has named four new members to the review panel, which will be tasked with evaluating the effectiveness of training programs and the overall performance of air traffic controllers. The panel is set to submit its findings to FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt in the fall. The controversy that prompted the FAA's latest management shakeup is linked to reports of more than a half-dozen alleged incidents of sleeping or inattentive controllers. Such incidents pose a serious threat to air safety, and the FAA has been under pressure to address the issue quickly and effectively. To that end, the FAA has appointed Teri Bristol, Chief Operating Officer of the Air Traffic Organization, to serve as the new Chief Operating Officer of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization. She will replace Hank Krakowski, who resigned last month, following a series of incidents of air traffic controllers falling asleep on the job. The FAA has also named David Grizzle, former Chief Counsel for the agency, to serve as the new Chief Counsel of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization. Both Bristol and Grizzle bring extensive experience in aviation and air safety to their new posts. Bristol is a certified air traffic controller, having worked in the field for over 25 years. Grizzle, meanwhile, has more than 20 years of experience in aviation law and safety. The FAA's moves come as pressure mounts to address ongoing issues in air traffic control. A recent wave of incidents involving air traffic controllers sleeping on the job has led to calls for stronger oversight and better training programs. With the appointment of the new review panel, the FAA is taking steps to address these concerns and strengthen air safety. The panel's findings will be eagerly awaited by those in the aviation industry, who are hoping for effective solutions to the challenges facing air traffic control. As FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt noted in a recent statement, "Maintaining the highest levels of service and safety in the nation's airspace is our top priority. We are committed to addressing the challenges facing our air traffic control system and ensuring that our training programs are effective and responsive to the needs of the industry." With the appointment of Bristol, Grizzle, and the new review panel, the FAA is taking proactive steps to address these critical issues and safeguard air safety for all.
