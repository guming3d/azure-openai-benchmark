chatgpt: A new report has revealed that more than two-thirds of adults and a quarter of children in Queensland are considered overweight or obese. The report, released by Queensland's chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, highlights the need for improvements in daily eating patterns. According to the report, Queensland's obesity rates have continued to rise over recent years, with poor diets and sedentary lifestyles among the key contributing factors. Dr Young has called for action to address the issue, emphasising the need for a focus on healthy eating habits and regular physical activity. "Obesity is a major public health issue, and we need to take action to address it," said Dr Young. "We need to improve daily eating patterns, encourage more physical activity and make it easier for people to make healthier choices." The report also highlighted some positive progress in the state's efforts to reduce smoking rates. In particular, there has been a reduction in smoking among young men aged 18-29. However, the state still has a long way to go, with an estimated 500,000 smokers living in Queensland. "We have made some progress in reducing smoking rates, but there is still a significant number of people who smoke," said Dr Young. "Smoking is a major cause of preventable illness and death, and we need to do more to support people to quit." Efforts to address these health issues are already underway in Queensland, with a range of initiatives designed to promote healthy eating and physical activity. These include programs aimed at schools, workplaces and communities, as well as campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles and discourage smoking. "We know that the best way to address these issues is through a coordinated, multi-faceted approach," said Dr Young. "We need to work together to promote healthy habits and support people to make positive lifestyle choices." Overall, the report highlights the need for continued action to address the challenges of obesity and smoking in Queensland. With a focus on promoting healthy habits and encouraging positive lifestyle choices, there is hope that the state can make progress in improving the health and wellbeing of its residents.
