NSW police are using advanced hacking software to spy on phones and computers during investigations . Some versions are also able to remotely capture Skype and instant-messenger conversations and access microphones and web cameras. NSW police have held nine licences for various forms of the software, including FinSpy and FinFly, during the past three years, the documents show. Five licenses remain valid.

chatgpt: WikiLeaks has released a trove of documents that contain the names of clients who use advanced spyware capable of breaking into computers and phones. The documents also reveal that the New South Wales Police (NSW) reportedly spent $2.5 million on this hacking software. The spyware in question here is called FinFisher, which has been criticized for enabling oppressive regimes to spy on their citizens. Despite the criticism, many governments and law enforcement agencies around the world have been using this software to gain access to sensitive information. According to the leaked documents, the NSW police department has been using FinFisher since at least 2017. The police department has defended its use of spyware, stating that it is necessary to fight cybercrime and terrorism. However, civil liberties groups and privacy advocates argue that the use of FinFisher violates citizens' right to privacy. The documents also reveal that FinFisher has been used by several oppressive regimes, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Ethiopia, to monitor and spy on activists and journalists. This has raised concerns about the potential misuse of the technology by governments to silence dissent and suppress free speech. The global market for spyware and surveillance technology is estimated to be worth billions of dollars. Companies like FinFisher operate in a legal gray area, with many governments and law enforcement agencies using their services without proper oversight or accountability. The release of these documents by WikiLeaks once again highlights the need for transparency and accountability in the use of spyware technology. While these tools may be necessary to fight cybercrime and terrorism, they must be subject to strict regulation to prevent their misuse by governments and other powerful entities. In conclusion, the recent WikiLeaks document dump has shed light on the use of spyware and surveillance technology by governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. The use of hacking software like FinFisher raises important questions about privacy, transparency, and accountability. As such, governments and law enforcement agencies must be held accountable for their use of such powerful tools.
