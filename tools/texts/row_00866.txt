article: By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Everton striker Arouna Kone admits he has to prove his worth next season after missing seven months of his maiden campaign through injury. The Ivory Coast international sustained a knee injury in October which prevented him from playing again, meaning he managed just six appearances without a goal after his Â£6million move from Wigan last summer. Kone is to forego a lengthy summer holiday to ensure he is back to full fitness by the time pre-season comes around. Struggle: Injuries have stopped Arouna Kone making the impact he would have liked at Everton . 'The most important thing is for me to be in the best possible shape I can be for the start of next season,' he told Evertontv. 'I have decided not to go on a big holiday, I am staying in Europe to work hard over the summer period, so I can hit the ground running when pre-season starts in July. 'This season has been pretty much a non-starter for me so next season is when it starts. 'It all about working hard so the fans can see the best of Arouna Kone. 'It is going to mean an awful lot to me to wear that shirt next season because I've not made my mark in the club's history. 'The season coming for me is where I have to prove my worth and I am ready to take on that challenge.' Boss: Kone followed Roberto Martinez in moving from Wigan to Everton last summer . Ironically Kone believes he was just starting to find his form in his fifth Premier League substitute appearance when he sustained the injury against Hull - against whom he came closest to scoring his first goal when he hit the post - on October 19. And unfortunately for him in his absence the team played the sort of football he thinks will benefit his style of play. 'I realised the fans and coaching staff were waiting to see the best of Arouna Kone and around that time I felt I was coming into a bit of form so it was an extra disappointment,' the 30-year-old added. 'As a team Everton have had a fantastic season which gives me a huge motivation to prepare for next season. 'On a personal side, it has not gone as I'd hoped. I look back with a bit of pain and regret. 'I have not played as many games as I would have liked due to this injury. It is something I never thought would have happened. 'It is painful to sit in the stands and watch. 'I would often say to myself that the style of play I was watching would suit me down to the ground. 'You turn that around and it is a positive and hopefully we can make next season more successful than this one has been.' High hopes: Kone plans to spend this summer getting fit in order to recapture his form from Wigan .

chatgpt: Everton forward Arouna Kone is planning to give his all for the upcoming Premier League season, with the Ivory Coast international hoping to return to pre-season fully fit. Kone spent seven months on the sidelines through injury, but is looking to make a comeback under the tutelage of his former boss Roberto Martinez. Martinez brought Kone to England from Levante UD in 2013 and the striker played a key role in Wigan Athletic's FA Cup triumph that year. Kone has since played under Martinez again at Everton, and the former Wigan striker believes that the Spanish manager's style of play will benefit his own game. "Roberto is a very experienced coach and he knows how to get the best out of his players," Kone said. "I have played under him before and I know his methods, so I'm looking forward to working with him again." Kone's injury troubles stretched from January to August last year and he admits it was a difficult time. "It was a frustrating period for me, but I was determined to get back to full fitness as soon as possible," Kone said. "I was working hard with the physio team and making sure I did everything that was asked of me. I'm just glad to be back out on the pitch." Kone is also optimistic about the upcoming campaign, with the hope that Everton can build on their impressive run of form in the latter stages of last season. "We had a great run towards the end of the last season and I hope we can carry that momentum forward," Kone said. "This is a great club with a fantastic set of fans and I want to do everything I can to help the team achieve success. I hope next season can be even better than this one." Martinez has been outspoken about his desire to bring a more attacking style to Everton this season, with the club looking to improve upon their ninth-placed finish in the Premier League last time out. Kone says he is ready to play a part in that new approach and believes that his attributes can help the team. "I'm a striker who likes to be involved in the build-up play, but I'm also a finisher," Kone said. "I'm confident that I can make an impact for the team and contribute to our attacking play. I just want to work hard for the team and hopefully, help us achieve success." In summary, Arouna Kone is looking to make a comeback under the guidance of Roberto Martinez at Everton, who he believes can help him improve his game. Having spent seven months on the sidelines through injury, Kone is hoping for a better campaign next time out, with Everton looking to build on their impressive run of form in the latter stages of last season. With a more attacking style set to be implemented by Martinez, Kone is hoping to play a big part in the Toffees' success.
