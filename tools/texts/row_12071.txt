Like a woman at the mechanic, apparently she is just as clueless when it comes to the big, bad world of the internet. Not knowing Google from gigabytes and an email from an envelope, womankind now have the remedy to cure a case of online ignorance in a series of self-help books made just for women. The book series - available only in French - includes titles such as Internet Pour Les Nulles, which can be translated to 'Internet For Women Dummies,' targets women because apparently they need extra help managing the tricky terrain of computer hardware, software and the internet. Not knowing Google from gigabytes: A series of self-help books in French explains the internet, Macs and PCs for 'women dummies' With a tag line which translates to ‘With the Dummettes, you will no longer have anything to be jealous of men for!’ it seems women can sleep easy knowing their computer will not swallow them whole. A translation of the publisher’s summary reads: ‘Practical tips for surfing the web, communicate using email, make purchases or payments securely online, create a blog or manage photographs.’ ‘Maybe you will ask why a book on the Mac specifically dedicated to women… we give you all the advice to start surfing with confidence, communicate with all your friends through messaging, make your purchase safely, and why not, for the most daring of you, create your blog to show your beliefs loud and clear on the web!’ Clueless on computer: The internet self-help book carries the tag line 'With the Dummettes, you will no longer have anything to be jealous of men for!' The series by Françoise Otwaschkau covers PCs, Macs and the internet. While these French self-help books might not quite find their market in the UK, self-improvement books have reached cult status in Britain. While UK book sales were down recently by 1 per cent overall, sales of self-help books for the same period soared by 25 per cent. It is estimated that the cult of self-help has earned publishers some £60 million in the past five years. Obsessed with self-help: Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones mirrors the cult status of self-help book in the UK which has earnt publishers some £60million in the past five years . In America, the self-help market is worth more than $10 billion (£6 billion) a year. It is 75 years since a man called Dale Carnegie sat down to write How to Win Friends And Influence People, widely regarded as the very first self-help book. First published in 1937, it has sold over 15 million copies, is still in print today and is the cornerstone of a billion-pound global industry that fixates on human unease and lack of confidence.
