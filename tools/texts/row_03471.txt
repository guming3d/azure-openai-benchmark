article: (CNN) -- A Singapore lawmaker was in intensive care Monday after a man set him on fire at a community event, a hospital official told CNN. Seng Han Thong of the ruling People's Action Party underwent skin graft surgery at Singapore General Hospital Monday morning and was in stable condition, said hospital spokeswoman Junaidah Hameed. Seng suffered burns to his face and chest after a man in his 70s came up behind him as he was sitting down for lunch, poured thinner on him and set him on fire, party official George Tan told reporters. An event organizer who rushed to Seng's aid and tried to douse the flames was also injured, the hospital said. Seng had gone to the community center in his parliamentary district to hand out money to residents -- a tradition among many politicians ahead of the Chinese New Year, which falls on January 26 this year. The attacker was a 70-year-old former cab driver who has been in and out of a mental clinic in recent months, the English-language daily newspaper the Straits Times reported. Tan, the party official, said the man had met Seng at several meet-and-greets and complained about "evil spirits in his house." "No matter what the reason is, and whatever condition the person is in, that is no reason to commit such a crime against anyone, not just against an MP [member of parliament]," Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng told reporters at the hospital. Two years ago, Seng was attacked at another community event by another cab driver, the newspaper said. In that incident, the cab driver punched Seng because he was upset that the lawmaker was not helping him get his revoked license reinstated. CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A violent attack on Singaporean lawmaker Seng Han Thong has sparked shock and outrage across the small Southeast Asian city-state. Thong, a member of the ruling People's Action Party, was at lunch when a man in his 70s approached him and poured a container of thinner onto his body before setting him on fire. The attacker, identified by local media as a former cab driver who has been in and out of a mental clinic, has been arrested. Thong, who suffered severe burns to his face and chest, was rushed to the hospital where he underwent skin graft surgery. He is currently in intensive care and remains in critical condition. The bizarre and gruesome attack, which took place in broad daylight in a crowded hawker center, has left many Singaporeans in shock. According to eyewitnesses, the attacker appeared calm and collected as he carried out the gruesome assault, taking his time to pour the flammable liquid on Thong before setting him alight. The motivations behind the attack remain unclear. However, local media reports suggest that the attacker may have been mentally unstable and may have had a personal vendetta against the lawmaker. In the wake of the attack, politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the attack and expressed their support to Thong and his family. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong took to social media to express his shock and anger at the attack, calling it a "senseless and cowardly act." The incident has reignited concerns over mental health in Singapore, with many calling for better mental health support and services for those in need. The government has pledged to review mental health policies and increase support for those struggling with mental health issues. As of now, the attacker remains in police custody and is being investigated for his role in the violent attack on Thong. The incident has left a deep scar on Singaporeans, who are coming to terms with the violent nature of the attack and the need for better mental health support for those in need.
