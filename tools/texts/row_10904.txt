But one San Diego firm is willing to pay you for the privilege of following you around as you browse the web, make searches and use social networks. For $100 (£60) a month, Luth Research will track your every move online before selling it to the highest bidder, typically companies looking to advertise on the web. The ZQ Intelligence scheme is run by San Diego-based Luth Research. It pays preselected participants a monthly fee to collect their data, including website visits, search entries and time spent on social networks when using a phone, tablet (stock image pictured) or PC . In February, Datacoup became the first personal data marketplace. It lets people sell their social media habits, searches and even how much they use online banking for a reward of up to $8 a month.

chatgpt: Luth Research, a San Diego based company, has started a new initiative called the "ZQ Intelligence Scheme". This program pays preselected participants a monthly fee to collect their data on behalf of the company's clients. The scheme is aimed at tracking participants' website visits, search entries, time spent on social networks, and location details. This information is then securely routed through Luth Research's servers and made available to its clients who use it for marketing, research and other purposes. Participants of the program are also asked to complete surveys about their behavior to provide additional insights into their lifestyle choices. However, the firm does not read the content of messages or social accounts, ensuring that participant privacy remains protected at all times. "We understand that privacy is a primary concern for people today which is why we have taken active measures to ensure that data collected by the ZQ Intelligence Scheme is kept confidential," said John Luth, CEO of Luth Research. The ZQ Intelligence Scheme aims to bridge the gap between consumers and businesses by giving companies access to data that helps them better understand their target audience’s needs. "Businesses today need complete transparency to understand consumer behavior, which is why the ZQ Intelligence scheme is an excellent solution for them. It allows them to stay ahead of the game by adapting to and predicting consumer behavior,” said Luth. Companies can use the data collected from the program to predict future trends, improve product design, or create customized marketing campaigns that better connect with consumers. The ZQ Intelligence Scheme is an innovative tool that helps businesses stay ahead of their competitors by providing them with valuable information straight from the source. The initiative is a win-win for both consumers and companies, where participants are compensated for their data, and businesses receive valuable insights into their target audience’s preferences and behavior. To participate in the scheme, individuals can sign up on the Luth Research website and answer a few questions relating to their demographics, interests, and lifestyle. Once selected, participants receive a monthly fee in exchange for their data, and their privacy is assured. Luth Research acknowledges that the scheme is not for everyone and encourages individuals to read and understand the program’s terms and conditions before signing up. In conclusion, the ZQ Intelligence Scheme is a groundbreaking initiative that seeks to help businesses stay up-to-date with consumer trends by collecting data securely and transparently from app users. The initiative also provides participants with a way to earn a monthly income while maintaining their privacy. The program will be an essential tool for businesses seeking to stay ahead of their competitors by gaining insights into their customer's preferences and behavior.
