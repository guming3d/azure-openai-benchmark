article: This is the first glimpse of a £475million car production line hailed as the next step in Britain's manufacturing industry. The vast tangle of metal at Ford's plant in Dagenham, east London - whose history is so famous it was turned into a film - will produce 350,000 low-carbon diesel engines a year when the conveyers start rolling in November. Made by hundreds of workers and creating 300 new jobs, the two-litre engines will be shipped off to showrooms around Britain as well as countries across the world. Once the production line is running the plant, which produced 790,000 diesel engines in 2013 and exported 85 per cent of them, will hope to produce 1million units a year. The move was announced in October after the government's Regional Growth Fund provided £8.9million of the cost. Opened in 1931, the Dagenham plant employs around 3,000 people and was made famous in 1968 when its female machinists walked out of their jobs making seats, furious that they earned less for their jobs than men. The 187 women, who brought Ford to its knees and were a key milestone in the equal pay battle, had their experiences made into the 2010 Bafta-nominated film Made in Dagenham starring Sally Hawkins and Rosamund Pike.

chatgpt: The historic Ford factory located in east London is set to receive a major transformation with the help of £8.9 million in government funding. The factory, which first opened its doors in 1931, has been a significant landmark in the area and has played an important role in the automotive industry. However, after nearly 90 years in operation, the aging plant is in desperate need of modernization. Despite its age, the Ford factory has a rich history. One of its most notable moments was in 1968 when female machinists famously went on strike to demand equal pay. This pivotal moment in the fight for equal pay became the inspiration for the acclaimed film "Made in Dagenham." Despite facing numerous challenges over the years, the plant has continued to operate, producing around 800,000 diesel engines annually, 85% of which are exported. However, with the automotive industry rapidly evolving, the plant needs to move with the times to stay competitive. The new plans for the factory will see the creation of a brand-new assembly line, set to open in November. This will not only bring much-needed jobs to the area but will also boost production, ensuring that the plant remains a key player in the automotive industry. The £8.9 million funding from the government will go towards upgrading the plant's infrastructure, including the installation of the latest technology, to help increase efficiency and maximize output. This will not only benefit the company but will also have a positive impact on the local community. The new assembly line will be focused on producing hybrid engines, which is a significant shift for the plant. This move towards hybrid technology is in line with the industry's increasing focus on sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. The transformation of the Ford factory is a symbol of progress and innovation, with the new assembly line being at the forefront of a new era of automotive technology. It is not only an exciting development for the company but also for the local community, who will benefit from the creation of new jobs and increased economic activity. With this new investment, the historic factory in east London is set to continue its legacy as a significant driver of the local economy and a key player in the automotive industry.
