Mr Bennett, 48, said: ‘We used to run a tea-shop and many dog owners would say their dogs like to have a cup of tea, but the caffeine and milk in the tea isn’t really suitable for dogs. So we came up with a range of herbal teas they can enjoy without negative effects.’ He has two rescue dogs, Billy and Angel, who have both given the product their seal of approval. He added: ‘Some dogs take to it straight . away – Billy went mad for it - and others take a few days to get used to . it, but owners have reported good feedback and lots of benefits.’ The most popular tea is Ha-pee Lawns, which is a blend of golden rod, yucca root and tomato flakes, and is said to help reduces lawn damage created by dog urine. The product was tested by 200 dogs and 80 per cent of owners said they noticed an improvement in their lawns. The herbal brew was launched last June by Mr Bennetts’s company Woof & Brew, but Steve is hoping to expand the business and export worldwide. The product can be bought on AstarPets.com, a new website dedicated to pet health products.
