article: Paris St-Germain and Brazil defender Thiago Silva has lamented his side's lack of concentration and consistency this season. Les Parisiens are third in Ligue 1, four points behind leaders Lyon, following a 4-2 win over Evian on Sunday at the Parc des Princes.

It's clearly a problem of concentration. We aren't playing as well as last season.' He added: 'We are all discussing the problem to find a solution.' PSG had been tipped to retain the Ligue 1 title comfortably this season after last year's runners-up AS Monaco sold off key players such as James Rodriguez to work within new financial constraints. Instead, they find themselves trailing Lyon and Marseille, despite having finished 28 and 29 points respectively ahead of them last term.

chatgpt: Paris Saint-Germain defender, Thiago Silva, has voiced his frustration with the team's inability to play well for the full 90 minutes. The Brazilian international highlighted this weakness following PSG's 4-2 victory over Evian on Sunday.  "We're struggling to play well for a full game at the moment," Silva stated. "We're not consistent enough and it's costing us points."  The Parisians have fallen short of expectations this season, after being tipped as favorites to win both the Ligue 1 title and the Champions League. However, their form has been patchy, with some impressive performances followed by equally disappointing ones.  Despite their struggles, PSG managed to beat Evian on Sunday thanks to goals from Lucas Moura, Adrien Rabiot, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and an own goal from Evian's Gilles Sunu. However, the victory did little to quell the concerns of Silva and the PSG faithful.  "We need to be more disciplined and focused," Silva continued. "We have the quality to win every game, but we need to show it consistently."  PSG's inconsistent form has seen them drop to third place in the Ligue 1 table, behind leaders, Lyon and second-placed Marseille. With only a few points separating the top three teams, every match is crucial if PSG wants to retain their Ligue 1 crown.  The Parisians will face several tough tests in the coming weeks, with matches against Lorient, Reims and Montpellier on the horizon. Coach, Laurent Blanc, will be hoping that his players can find some consistency and start playing to their potential on a regular basis.  In conclusion, PSG's struggles continue to worry fans and players alike, with their inability to play well for the full 90 minutes costing them valuable points. However, with quality players like Ibrahimovic, Di Maria, and Cavani at their disposal, PSG has the potential to turn their season around and claim both domestic and European honors.
