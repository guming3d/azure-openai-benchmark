chatgpt: Tavish Smith, a 45-year-old resident of Georgia, has been charged with multiple criminal offenses after being caught on camera fleeing the scene of an accident and consuming evidence. According to police reports, Smith was arrested on misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence, fleeing the scene, and possession of marijuana before officers discovered she had eaten marijuana evidence. Police officers were dispatched to the scene of an accident in the early hours of Monday morning after receiving reports of a hit and run incident. Upon arrival, officers found a damaged car and debris in the middle of the road. After reviewing the CCTV footage of the accident, officers identified Tavish Smith as the driver responsible for the accident and set about locating her. They eventually discovered Smith walking along a nearby road, appearing to show signs of intoxication. When questioned about the accident, Smith denied any involvement, despite being caught on camera leaving the scene. During a search, officers discovered marijuana in her car, leading to additional charges of drug possession. However, things took a bizarre turn when officers discovered that Smith had consumed the marijuana evidence. This led to a felony charge of tampering with physical evidence, which could result in a prison sentence of up to 5 years. The situation became even stranger when Smith was caught on camera giggling and calling the arresting officers 'handsome' while being escorted to the police car. Her behavior was described as 'disrespectful and unprofessional' by police, who have vowed to prosecute her to the fullest extent of the law. Smith is currently being held in custody pending trial, with her bail set at $25,000. The incident has caused widespread outrage in the community, with many calling for stricter penalties for those charged with driving under the influence and fleeing the scene of an accident. It remains to be seen whether Tavish Smith will be held accountable for her actions, but one thing is clear: this incident serves as a powerful reminder of the dangers of reckless driving and substance abuse.
