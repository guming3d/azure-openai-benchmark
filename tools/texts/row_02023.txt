As they searched police in Baltimore County, Maryland got a call from an anonymous tipster about a suspicious vehicle. According to wbaltv.com the call came from a passer by who spotted Ms Ripken and her attacker in the back seat of his car where he had bundled her in, tied up. The unnamed source confronted the man who said Ms Ripken was his mother and that he was taking her to hospital. But the source wasn't convinced so called the police who contacted the Aberdeen department to suggest that the car might be linked to their investigation. For a terrifying 24 hours Ms Ripken's distressed family had no clue as to her whereabouts while police desperately looked for clues. She was eventually found at around 6am on Wednesday, bound and blindfolded in her car not far from her home. Police said she appeared unharmed but will undergo medical examination and be interviewed. For now she is resting in the care of family members who are relieved to have her back. 'This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy,' said a statement released by the Ripken family.
