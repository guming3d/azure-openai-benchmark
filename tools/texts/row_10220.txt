chatgpt: Croatia will be taking on Cameroon in their fourth match of Group A in the World Cup. Unfortunately, both teams lost their opening fixtures and are in a do-or-die situation. Defeat for either team would mark the end of their World Cup journey. This encounter between Cameroon and Croatia will be the first time the two teams have ever faced each other. Cameroon has only won one out of their 13 World Cup matches against European teams. Their only victory was against Romania in 1990, where they won 2-1.
