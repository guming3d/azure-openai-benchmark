Lola and Isabella thought the tablet (left) was 'a magic pill' when they found it in their Frozen karaoke machine . Mr Wilkes Read, an airline pilot, said if he hadn't been there to see them open the gift one of the girls would have swallowed the pill and become ill. 'The girls were so excited to open the gift. 'They quickly said there was a magical pill at the bottom stuck in the sellotape and the plastic, it was a green and grey capsule and stood out quite a bit. 'I Googled what it was and it seems to be a diarrhoea tablet, probably the equivalent of Imodium or something similar. 'I assumed it has fallen in as they packed the toy away, no one has spotted it, there is no quality control. 'Because it was a Disney toy they assumed it was part of it and were asking if they could eat it. 'If they could have got at it they would have done but I took it away fairly quickly. It could have made our girls very ill.' The singalong toy was bought by Mr Wilkes Read's sister-in-law. He believes the pill must have fallen in while it was being packaged . Mr Wilkes Read said he was glad he was there when the girls opened the gift as one of them may have swallowed the pill . The Singalong Karaoke was bought by Mr Wilkes Read's sister-in-law Leanne in Target in New York. She quickly snapped it up to bring home for the girls, unaware of what lay inside. As Isabella and Lola quickly ripped into the present morning, desperate to sing along to their favourite Disney movie songs, they found the slightly bashed pill. Using the colouring and markings the girls' father discovered it was a prescription diarrhoea pill, which could seriously harm their daughters . 'I jumped on it pretty quickly and removed it before they could do anything with it," the pilot added. 'I can't believe it was in there, it is appalling really. They should really check these things, it could have made my girls really ill if we hadn't have spotted it.'

chatgpt: A father from Cambridge was left horrified after his daughters discovered a potentially dangerous pill in their toy. Samuel Wilkes Read had given the toy to his daughters, Isabella and Lola, aged six and four respectively, as a gift. The sisters were reportedly very excited to open the present, which had been bought by Mr Wilkes Read's sister-in-law from a Target store in New York. However, their excitement quickly turned to horror when they discovered a green and purple pill within the toy. It is unclear what the pill was, but Mr Wilkes Read quickly took the necessary precautions to ensure his daughters' safety. Speaking about the incident, Mr Wilkes Read expressed his shock and dismay at the discovery. "I couldn't believe it when I saw the pill," he said. "My first thought was 'what could this be?'" He added that he was grateful that his daughters had not come into contact with the pill. The incident has raised concerns over the safety of toys, and the procedures that are in place to ensure that they are fit for purpose. Target, the store from which the toy was purchased, has yet to comment on the incident. It is not the first time that potentially dangerous items have been found within toys. In 2018, a mother in the UK discovered a blade within a Hatchimals toy that her daughter had received for Christmas. The toy had been bought from a well-known UK retailer, and the incident sparked widespread concern over the safety of toys. In response to incidents like this, safety regulations for toys have become increasingly stringent in recent years. In the UK, toys must conform to the European Toy Safety Directive, which lays out strict safety standards that must be adhered to by manufacturers. However, incidents like this serve as a stark reminder that even the most stringent safety standards can sometimes fail. Parents are reminded to remain vigilant when it comes to the safety of their children's toys, and to report any concerns immediately. Mr Wilkes Read's daughters were lucky to have avoided coming into contact with the potentially dangerous pill within their toy. However, the incident serves as a timely reminder that safety should be a top priority for parents and toy manufacturers alike.
