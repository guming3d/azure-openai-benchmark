article: West Ham new-boy Diafra Sakho has made an instant impact at Upton Park, scoring three goals in four games, for the Hammers. Here Sportsmail takes a look at Upton Park's current hero. There wasn't a big song and dance about him signing was there? No, he slipped under the radar somewhat. He arrived from Metz for just Â£3.5million. If he carries on the way he'll prove one of the bargains of the season. Diafra Sakho celebrates after scoring his third goal of the season in West Ham's 3-1 win over Liverpool . What are his attributes? Certainly his pace. The forward's rapidness caused Liverpool's defence major problems on Saturday and West Ham's rivals can expect more of the same. His versatility and directness will be key for the Hammers, with the Senegal international able to play anywhere across the forward line. Did he have any other summer suitors? Newcastle, with their strong knowledge of French football, were interested in the Sakho, but Sam Allardyce beat his former club to the punch. Sakho competes with his namesake Mamadou during the Premier League clash at Upton Park . The deal nearly fell through, however, when the Hammers tried to change the structure of the deal, forcing Metz to release this strongly worded statement: . 'The English club unilaterally decided to propose a loan deal with an option to purchase instead of a permanent deal, which does not correspond to FC Metz's expectations and contradicts all the terms that had been agreed last week between the two clubs. 'FC Metz regret this clear lack of respect, which is unacceptable, from West Ham towards FC Metz and also the player. As a result, FC Metz reserve the right to approach the international sport court and assert their rights and defender their interests. Sakho's goal against Liverpool came from a beautifully floated cross-shot into the corner . 'FC Metz had released Diafra Sakho from his professional duties during matchday 1 of the Ligue 1 championship by giving him leave to take a medical in England to complete the last stage of the deal.' Three in four is a good return, what's his goal record like? Not bad, he's scored 40 goals for Metz in his previous two seasons. They were all out of the French top-flight, though.

chatgpt: West Ham secured an impressive 3-1 victory over Liverpool at Upton Park on Saturday, thanks in part to a goal from new signing Diafra Sakho. The Senegal international has quickly made an impact for the Hammers, scoring three goals in just four games. However, Sakho's arrival at West Ham was by no means a smooth process. The deal almost fell through due to complications with the player's medical, but the club were eventually able to complete the signing from French side Metz. Despite the pre-match hype surrounding Liverpool's star-studded attack, it was West Ham who took control of the game early on. Sakho's goal came in the 7th minute, as he beat Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet with a well-placed shot into the bottom corner. West Ham's other goals came from Winston Reid and Diafra Sakho's compatriot, Mohamed Diame. Liverpool managed to grab a late consolation goal through Raheem Sterling, but it wasn't enough to prevent a disappointing defeat. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce was understandably delighted with the performance of his team, particularly the contribution of new signing Sakho. Speaking after the game, he praised the striker for his work ethic and ability to find the back of the net. "We knew what we were getting with Diafra - he's a natural goalscorer and he's settled in quickly at the club," said Allardyce. "He's a hard worker and he's got a great attitude, so it's no surprise to see him scoring goals." Sakho himself was equally pleased with his performance, but emphasized the importance of the team's overall effort. "It's great to score again, but the most important thing is that we won the game," he said. "We played well as a team and everyone contributed to the victory." The result sees West Ham move up to fourth place in the Premier League table, continuing an impressive start to the season for the Hammers. With the likes of Sakho in their ranks, they will be hoping to maintain their strong form over the coming weeks and months.
