Anxiety: Stress can cause a permanent genetic change to men's sperm and even alter how their offspring's brains develop (stock image) Stress can cause permanent damage to a man's sperm and even stunt his children's brain development, a new study has found. Researchers have discovered that suffering anxiety or depression as an adult, teenager or even as a child could cause a lasting genetic change in a man's sperm. Scientists conducting a study on mice found that sperm damage caused by stress leads to offspring developing a 'blunted reaction to stress' - a trait associated with several mental disorders. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine say this is the first time a link has been found between stress-related diseases potentially being passed from a father to his children. Previous studies have concentrated on how environmental challenges - such as diet, drug abuse, and chronic stress - felt by mothers during pregnancy can affect their offspring's neurodevelopment and increase the risk of certain diseases. In this study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, male mice were exposed to six weeks of chronic stress, before breeding, either throughout puberty or only in adulthood. Examples of stress include suddenly being moved to another cage, being exposed to predator odour, noise or a foreign object in their cage. Male mice are ideal for such an experiment because they do not participate in offspring rearing, meaning any external factors outside of germ-cell formation are essentially eliminated. A team of researchers led by Professor Tracy Bale found that stress among male mice prompted a genetic change in their sperm that re-programmed a part of their offspring’s brain.

'These findings suggest one way in which paternal-stress exposure may be linked to such neuropsychiatric diseases.' But researchers also point out that a reduced physiological stress response may reflect some evolutionary benefit passed on to offspring to ensure survival in what is expected to be a more stressful environment. Professor Bale added: 'Whether such diminished stress reactivity would be detrimental or beneficial to offspring likely depends on the environment into which they were born, as well as genetic background factors.'

chatgpt: According to a recent study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, exposing male mice to stress can result in genetic sperm changes that impact the behavioral response of their offspring to stress. The study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications, sheds light on the long-lasting impact of stress and its effect on future generations.  The research team exposed male mice to mild stressors such as food and water deprivation or exposure to unfamiliar environments. They then examined the gene expression patterns of the sperm of the stressed mice and compared them to those of the control group.  The analysis revealed that the stressors caused changes in the expression of genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates the body's response to stress. Specifically, the genes involved in the production of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) were significantly altered.  When the male mice mated with females who had not been exposed to stress, their offspring displayed a blunted response to stress compared to the offspring of the control group. This suggests that the genetic changes induced by stress in male mice can be passed down to their offspring, and impact their capacity to handle stress.  The study's lead author, Tracy L. Bale, PhD, stated that the findings provide a new perspective on the impact of stress on the human population. "Stress is a prevalent experience in modern society that has been linked to many health problems, including anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular disease," she said. "Our findings suggest that the impact of stress may extend beyond the individual to the next generation."  The researchers also found that these genetic changes in sperm are not permanent and can potentially be reversed. When the male mice were removed from the stressors for four weeks, their sperm returned to normal gene expression patterns.  This finding suggests that reducing stress levels can positively impact future generations by preventing the potential transmission of genetic changes. "This research underscores the importance of addressing stress and stress management in our society," said Bale.  The study has important implications for society as a whole. With stress levels on the rise in modern society, understanding the downstream impact on future generations is crucial. By identifying the mechanisms by which stress can be passed down, scientists can work towards developing new screening and prevention methods to protect future generations from the negative effects of stress.  In conclusion, the study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine highlights the impact of stress on male mice and the transmission of the genetic changes to their offspring. The findings add new dimensions to our understanding of the relationship between stress and health, and the importance of alleviating stress in society. As the study's authors suggest, reducing stress levels may contribute to a healthier population that can better cope with the challenges of modern life.
