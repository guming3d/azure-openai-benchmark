The Army psychiatrist sentenced to death for the Fort Hood shooting rampage has been forcibly shaved, an Army spokesman said on Tuesday. Major Nidal Hasan began growing a beard in the years after the November 2009 shooting that left 13 dead and 30 wounded. The beard prompted delays to his court-martial because it violated Army grooming regulations. He was convicted of all charges last month at his court-martial at the Central Texas Army post and sentenced to death. Major Nidal Hasan, pictured before the 2009 Fort Hood shooting (left). He began growing a beard in the years after the attack. He has now been forcibly shaved, the Army said on Tuesday . Now, Hasan is an inmate at the U.S. Detention Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, home to the military death row. Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt, an Army spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday that Hasan had been shaved. He did not specify when or provide details, however. Officials at Fort Leavenworth previously had said Hasan would be subject to Army regulations. Hasan dispensed with all criminal defense counsel and represented himself during his trial. A message left with John Galligan, Hasan's first criminal defense attorney who still represents him in civil matters, was not returned. Hasan said he grew the beard because his Muslim faith required it and was not meant as a show of disrespect. However, Col. Gregory Gross, the original judge presiding over Hasan's court-martial, ordered Hasan to be clean-shaven or be forcibly shaved before his trial.

The dispute over that decision led to appeals that delayed the trial by more than three months before the appeals court ousted the judge. The appeals court ruled that Gross did not appear impartial while presiding over Hasan's case and that the command, not a judge, is responsible for enforcing military grooming standards. Col. Tara Osborn, assigned to replace Gross as the judge presiding over the case, allowed Hasan to keep the beard for the course of the trial last month. However, she warned that although she would not hold the breach of grooming regulations against the 42-year-old American-born Muslim, the military jurors might.

chatgpt: Major Nidal Hasan, the convicted perpetrator of the November 2009 Fort Hood shooting that left 13 people dead and 30 wounded, has been growing a beard in the years following the tragedy. The decision to grow facial hair, which goes against military regulations, was initially met with resistance from military officials. The issue of Hasan's beard has been a source of controversy for years, with many arguing that it is a symbol of his lack of respect for the military institution. Hasan, who is also a devout Muslim, has claimed that his decision to grow a beard is based on religious beliefs. The U.S. military has strict grooming standards that prohibit soldiers from having beards, with exceptions made for certain medical conditions or religious beliefs. In Hasan's case, military officials initially tried to force him to shave his beard, citing their interpretation of the grooming standards. However, the issue of Hasan's beard has been the subject of several court battles over the years. Hasan has argued that forcing him to shave his beard would violate his religious freedom, while military officials have argued that it would be disruptive to the military order and discipline. Ultimately, a military appeals court ruled in Hasan's favor, stating that the military had failed to demonstrate that shaving Hasan's beard was necessary to maintain military decorum and discipline. The ruling was a significant victory for Hasan, who has been fighting for years to be allowed to grow and maintain his beard. Despite the court's ruling, many people continue to view Hasan's beard as a symbol of his disrespect for the military and his lack of remorse for the Fort Hood shooting. Some have even argued that Hasan's beard is a deliberate attempt to intimidate witnesses and show defiance against the military institution. Regardless of how one views the issue of Hasan's beard, it is clear that it has become a significant point of contention and controversy. The ongoing legal battles surrounding the issue highlight the complex and often conflicting concerns of religious freedom, military order, and personal expression. For now, Hasan remains on death row for his role in the Fort Hood shooting. But his beard continues to be a symbolic reminder of the many unresolved issues and tensions surrounding the tragedy, and the ongoing efforts to balance competing interests and values in the aftermath of the horrific event.
