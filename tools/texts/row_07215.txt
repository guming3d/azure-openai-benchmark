Wildlife workers in a remote Devonshire beauty spot were horrified to discover an injured white goose had been shot with a crossbow bolt. The animal, which was found at the Sheepstor Dam in the Burrator Reservoir on Dartmoor, is not native to the area and is thought to have been dumped there. Warden Kit Hancock and RSPCA officer Simon Kite took a boat to the water to recover the distressed goose, which had been shot all the way through its body. Despicable: An injured goose is seen to by vets after an unknown person shoots them with a crossbow bolt . Mr Hancock said: '[The goose] was still swimming. We managed to net it after about ten minutes and get it aboard. it didn't put up much of a fight as by then it was so worn out. Its partner was naturally not very happy and after the injured goose was taken away by the RSPCA it kept honking, calling for its mate, for about three hours afterwards. I've been doing this job for five years and thankfully incidents like this are very rare occurrences.' Neil Reeves, countryside manager for Dartmoor, said: 'It is disgraceful behaviour to do something like this to a wild animal. I just don't understand why anyone would want to. Perhaps they wanted it for their dinner but to carry around and use a crossbow in this manner is deplorable.' The goose was taken by Mr Kite to Drakes Vets in the nearby village of Yelverton. Vet Ulrika Hoffman-Johnson who treated the animal said: 'The arrow went through its body just behind the legs and the tip came out the other side, just missing its ribcage and the vital organs. We gave it an X-ray, antibiotics and painkillers and stitched it up.' The goose was returned to the RSPCA where it is now recovering at the West Hatch Wildlife Sanctuary in Taunton, Somerset. Care: A huge arrow is removed from the goose, with experts now appealing for more information which could lead to identification of the perpetrator . Back to health: The goose was operated on and is now recovering at the RSPCA's West Hatch Wildlife Sanctuary in Taunton, Somerset . Diana Roberts, a spokesperson for the RSPCA, said that it would rest there until fully recovered and is expected to be returned to Burrator Reservoir and its mate sometime in the next week. She said: 'We would like to know if anyone in the area saw someone carrying a crossbow at the time. Some nasty person has gone out of their way to shoot a defenceless animal. She has appealed to anyone with any information to please contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018. The police have also been notified, and they are anxious for information. Contact Sgt Dave Anning at Tavistock Police Station by calling 101. Crime reference 184 02/05/13.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident on Dartmoor, Devon, a white goose was shot by an unknown person with a crossbow. The arrow narrowly missed the bird's ribcage and vital organs, but left it severely injured. Fortunately, the goose is now on the road to recovery after receiving timely medical attention. The wounded bird was found by a passerby who informed the local authorities. The animal was then taken to a nearby animal hospital where it received emergency medical treatment. The medical staff at the hospital reported that the goose had suffered serious injuries and was in a critical condition when it arrived. The arrow had pierced its side, but fortunately missed its vital organs. A team of veterinarians worked tirelessly to save the bird's life. They were able to stabilize it and remove the arrow. They treated its injuries and started it on a course of antibiotics to prevent any infections from taking hold. The bird was kept under close observation for several days. The good news is that the goose is now well on its way to recovery. The hospital staff has been caring for it around the clock, feeding and tending to its needs. The bird has responded well to the treatment and is now making steady progress. It is expected to make a full recovery and return to its natural habitat soon. However, the authorities are still searching for the person responsible for the cruel act. Shooting any kind of animal, domestic or wild, is illegal and carries heavy penalties. The use of crossbows in particular is considered barbaric and inhumane. The police are appealing to the public for any information that might lead to the arrest of the perpetrator. In the meantime, the incident has sparked outrage among animal lovers and birdwatchers on Dartmoor. They have called for stronger laws to protect wildlife and stricter enforcement of existing laws. The local community has shown tremendous support for the goose and has contributed generously towards its medical treatment. The incident has also drawn attention to the impact of human activity on the environment and the need to preserve delicate ecological systems. Dartmoor is home to a rich variety of wildlife and birdlife, and is an important ecological site. It is imperative that we take greater care to protect these ecosystems and the creatures that inhabit them. In conclusion, the shooting of the white goose on Dartmoor is a reminder of the need to protect our wildlife and to take strong action against those who violate our laws. While the bird is on the road to recovery, the search for its attacker continues. We must remain vigilant and take steps to ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future.
