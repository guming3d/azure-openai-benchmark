The as-yet unidentified smugglers sought to exploit their proximity by building a 40-metre-long underground passage and installing a rail track and wagon with a block-and-tackle system to ferry goods such as cell phones and tablet computers. The tunnel stood about 0.8 metres wide and one metre high, just big enough for an adult to crawl through.
