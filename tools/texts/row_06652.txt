article: (EW.com) -- For Broadway producers, Thanksgiving brought some extra trimmings this year. According to figures from the Broadway League, a dozen Broadway shows topped $1 million at the box office for the week ending Nov. 25 — the first time that's happened all year. Perennial musical hits led the list: "Wicked" ($2.3 million), "The Lion King" ($2.1 million), "The Book of Mormon" ($1.8 million), and "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" ($1.78 million). The fifth slot went to the just-opened revival "Annie," which took a stroll down Easy Street by selling $1.5 million in tickets, 105 percent of the show's potential gross and a house record for the Palace Theatre. (Premium ticket charges spiked the average ticket price to $116, from $89 the week before.) Two other new productions took advantage of seasonal enthusiasm: "A Christmas Story: The Musical," which opened last Monday, took in $1.1 million for the week — though it managed to sneak in an extra ninth performance to goose its box office total. The show earned a promising 70 percent of its potential gross. Another holiday-themed screen-to-stage musical, Elf, fell just short of the seven-figure mark with $997,000 over eight performances, about 60 percent of its potential gross. Filling out the million-dollar club last week: "Once" ($1.17 million), "The Phantom of the Opera" ($1.13 million), "Mary Poppins" ($1.12 million), "Newsies" ($1.11 million), "Evita" ($1.01 million), and "Jersey Boys" ($1.01 million). The Al Pacino-led revival of "Glengarry Glen Ross" earns an asterisk for the week — and not just because the high-grossing nonmusical drama is officially still in previews before its Dec. 8 premiere. "Glengarry" used the Thanksgiving holiday to scale back its schedule to five performances (instead of its usual seven). As a result, its haul last week was just $853,737, down from $1.16 million the previous week. EW Daily Poll: Who will win 'Dancing With the Stars'? Meanwhile, turkey time had a very different meaning for the producers of "Scandalous," the new musical biography of Aimee Semple McPherson with book and lyrics by Kathie Lee Gifford. In its first full week since its Nov. 15 opening, the show scraped up a thin gruel of $194,511, less than 16 percent of its potential gross, and played to houses that were less than one third full. Even a presidential pardon is unlikely to save this one. See original story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

chatgpt: New York City's Broadway theaters had much to be thankful for during the week leading up to Thanksgiving, with a dozen shows surpassing the $1 million mark at the box office. This was a significant increase from the previous week, which saw only eight shows exceeding that threshold. The perennial hit "Wicked" led the way, raking in $2.2 million in ticket sales. Close behind was "The Lion King," which took in $2.1 million, while "The Book of Mormon" earned $1.7 million. It was a strong showing for the trio of productions, which have become mainstays on the Great White Way. Other shows that enjoyed robust sales included "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" ($1.6 million), "Aladdin" ($1.5 million), and "Hamilton" ($1.4 million). The newly-opened "Network," based on the iconic film of the same name and starring Bryan Cranston, also fared well, earning $1.4 million in its second week of previews. However, not every show had reason to celebrate. "Scandalous," a musical with a book and lyrics by Kathie Lee Gifford, struggled to draw audiences, taking in just $142,000. The show had opened the previous week to mixed reviews, with some critics praising Gifford's efforts but others finding fault with the show's pacing and structure. The disparity in box office earnings underscores the challenges facing Broadway productions, even in a bustling market like New York City. While established hits can fare well year after year, newer shows face intense competition and must capture the attention of audiences and critics alike to survive. Despite these challenges, industry insiders remain optimistic about the outlook for Broadway heading into the holiday season. With iconic shows like "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Chicago" still drawing crowds, and new productions like "King Kong" and "The Cher Show" generating buzz, there is plenty of excitement and anticipation in the air. As the weather turns colder and the holiday spirit sets in, it seems that Broadway audiences are eager to take in the dazzling productions and captivating performances that have become synonymous with this iconic cultural institution. With a mix of new and old favorites, there truly is something for everyone on the Great White Way.
