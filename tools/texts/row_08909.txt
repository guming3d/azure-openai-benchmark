article: Around 650 people will attend Tuesday night's behind-closed-doors Champions League clash between CSKA Moscow and Manchester City. Although the official attendance will be given as zero, a combination of sponsors, media, delegates and centre circle boys and parents means there will at least be a crowd of some sort at the match. UEFA have banned the sale of tickets and ordered the match to be played behind closed doors as punishment for the racist behaviour of CSKA fans. An anti-racism banner lies on the pitch in the empty stadium ahead of the Champions League clash . UEFA Partners (Sponsors) - 300 . Media - 150 . Club delegates - 150 (75 each) Centre circle boys and parents - 50 . TOTAL - 650 . But City fans who are not allowed inside the stadium may feel particularly aggrieved that there will be 300 UEFA "partners" in attendance. A group of 16 travelling fans had planned to rent a flat in an apartment block overlooking the CSKA Moscow Stadium so they could watch their side in action. However, their plans have been scuppered as Russian police have stepped in to stop the fans going near the ground, according to the Manchester Evening News. Last month, Bayern Munich supporters rented a room in a tower block overlooking the Arena Khimki, giving them a bird's-eye view of proceedings. The game was played without fans as punishment for the racist chants and banners of CSKA supporters against Viktoria Plzen last December. The view from the room rented by the Bayern Munich fans overlooking CSKA Moscow's Arena Khimki, with City fans thinking of doing the same for Tuesday night's Champions League clash . Thomas Muller scores the only goal of the game last month, a penalty in front of the empty stands . Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola and his coaching staff settle in to the empty stadium before kick off . Fan troubles have plagued the Russian club in European competition. Yaya Toure complained he had been the victim of racial abuse while playing them last season and in their match against Roma last month their supporters were involved in numerous incidents with the local police. But last month Pep Guardiola's side were unperturbed by the vacant stands and have now won successive Champions League group games with a 1-0 scoreline. Thomas Muller's penalty was enough to seal the win in the Russian capital. City boss Manuel Pellegrini has described the game as a must-win after picking up just one point in their opening two games.

chatgpt: Around 650 people will attend the Champions League match that is set to take place on Tuesday. UEFA sponsors, media and delegates make up the majority of the crowd, according to sources. The Manchester City fans had rented out a flat in a nearby tower block, which was supposed to be their base for the duration of the match. However, their plans have reportedly been scuppered by Russian police, who have taken strong action against them. Reports indicate that the Russian authorities have been keeping close tabs on the activities of these fans in the days leading up to the game. The fans are alleged to have been involved in various kinds of behaviour that are not in keeping with the image of the city. It is believed that the fans were planning to set off fireworks and smoke bombs during the match, as well as engage in other disruptive activities. The Russian authorities have taken a strong stance against this kind of behaviour, which they believe would not only be harmful to public safety but would also tarnish the image of the city. As a result of these concerns, the police have taken strict action against the fans, and their plans for the nearby flat have been thwarted. It remains unclear whether they will be able to find alternative accommodation in time for the match. Meanwhile, UEFA officials have expressed their disappointment about the situation, saying that they had hoped for a peaceful and enjoyable match for all involved. The Champions League is one of the most prestigious events in the world of football, and such incidents take away from the excitement and joy of the occasion. The Manchester City team is set to take on Russian rivals Spartak Moscow, in what promises to be an intense and fiercely competitive match. The team has been performing well in recent games, and will be hoping to continue their winning streak into this match. Fans from all over the world are expected to tune in to watch the match, as well as those lucky few who will be able to attend in person. It is hoped that the match will proceed smoothly and that all those involved will be able to enjoy it to the fullest. Despite the challenges faced by the Manchester City fans in finding accommodation, it is clear that they remain committed to supporting their team. And who knows, their commitment and support may just be the thing that helps their team emerge victorious on Tuesday.
