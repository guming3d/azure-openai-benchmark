article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is writing a prequel to her best-selling series  to be auctioned for charity -- but at just 800 words, it may lack some of the magic fans of the boy wizard might be hoping for. Autographed copies of J.K. Rowling's work have fetched millions of dollars at auction. Rowling's hand-written prequel, signed by the author, will be auctioned alongside works by other famous writers to raise cash for a dyslexia charity. Despite the brevity of the piece, experts believe it could fetch big money, since other autographed works by the blockbuster author have sold for millions of dollars. "We never dreamed that J.K. Rowling would donate something so precious, and we're incredibly grateful," said Gerry Johnson, managing director of Waterstone's, the UK book chain organizing the auction. "I can't begin to guess how much it will raise at auction." A previous 93-word storycard from Rowling, which referred to the book "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," sold in 2002 for $53,000. Rowling later produced seven hand-written copies of a new work, "The Tales of Beedle the Bard," one of which sold for $3.9 million in 2007. "Given the enormous interest we have seen in recent times for autograph work by J.K. Rowling, the prospects for her storycard are good to say the least," said Philip Errington, a specialist at Sotheby's auction house, which is helping to organize the sale. The card on which the story is written -- measuring 14.6 by 20.9 centimeters (5.75 by 8.25 inches) -- is signed "JK Rowling 2008." The author signs off with the message: "From the prequel I am not working on -- but that was fun!" Alongside Rowling, 13 other authors invited to contribute to the June 10 auction include Margaret Atwood, Sebastian Faulks, Nick Hornby, and Tom Stoppard. A book featuring all 13 cards will go on sale in August. All profits from the book will benefit Dyslexia Action and English PEN, a writers' association, Waterstone's said.

chatgpt: Author J.K. Rowling, famous for her Harry Potter book series, has written an 800-word prequel to the beloved story for a charity auction benefiting dyslexia. The prequel was handwritten by Rowling and will be signed by the author. Previous autographed pieces by Rowling have raised millions of dollars for various charities. The prequel, detailing the life of a young James Potter and his friend Sirius Black, was originally written on a postcard and auctioned off for charity in 2008. At the time, it raised an impressive Â£25,000 for the English PEN and Dyslexia Action charities. The new prequel is expected to raise even more money for its chosen charity, Lumos, a foundation that works towards ending the institutionalization of children across the world. The auction will take place on June 10th at Sotheby's in London. What makes this prequel particularly unique is that it showcases Rowling's handwritten work. In a world where authors and publishers rely heavily on technology, writing by hand has become a lost art. Rowling, however, believes that handwriting is a vital part of story creation. In an interview with The Guardian, she explained that "Writing by hand is laborious, and that is why typewriters were invented. But I suspect that writing by hand remains important to authors because it personalizes the process, reminding us that a human hand, and not a machine, wrote this particular story." Rowling's passion for the written word and her dedication to philanthropy have made her a beloved figure in the literary world, even years after the release of the Harry Potter series. Her autographed pieces have become collector's items for fans around the globe, and each new donation sparks another wave of excitement and generosity. With the upcoming auction of the Harry Potter prequel, fans both new and old will have the opportunity to own a piece of Rowling's work while supporting a worthy cause. The chance to see her handwriting and read her words in a format that she believes is essential will only add to the allure of this unique auction item.
