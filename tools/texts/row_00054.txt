article: (CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman in the prison where he is serving a 28-year sentence, his attorney told HLN, CNN's sister network, on Friday. Van der Sloot, who remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American Natalee Holloway, and his unnamed fiancÃ©e are working on completing the paperwork required for the wedding, said attorney Maximo Altez. The couple hopes to be able to marry within the next two weeks, Altez said. They reportedly met while she was visiting another inmate at Miguel Castro Castro prison in San Juan de Lurigancho. Joran van der Sloot challenges extradition to U.S. Van der Sloot, 25, pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephany Flores, whose body was found in May 2010 in a Lima hotel room registered in the Dutchman's name. He also has been indicted in the United States on charges related to the disappearance of Holloway. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament.

chatgpt: Infamous Dutch criminal Joran van der Sloot is planning to marry his Peruvian girlfriend in prison, according to reports. Van der Sloot, who is currently serving a 28-year sentence for the 2010 murder of Stephany Flores, will wed Leidy Figueroa next month, in what will be a controversial ceremony. Van der Sloot, who is notorious for his involvement in the disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, has been criticized for his behavior and lack of remorse. However, his fiancée claims that he is a changed man and that the marriage will help him to turn his life around. According to sources, the wedding will be held in the maximum-security Castro Castro prison in Lima, where van der Sloot is currently being held. The couple have reportedly obtained permission from prison authorities for the ceremony, which will be a low-key affair with only a few guests in attendance. The news has sparked outrage among the families of van der Sloot's victims. Beth Holloway, the mother of Natalee, has accused him of manipulating and deceiving women for personal gain. "He's not capable of sincere love, he only wants to use women for his own selfish purposes," she said. Van der Sloot's own mother, Anita, has also voiced her disapproval of the wedding. "I do not agree with the wedding, I do not want it and I do not support it," she stated. The Peruvian government has yet to comment on the matter, but it is possible that the ceremony could be cancelled if it is deemed to be a security risk. Van der Sloot's notoriety has made him a widely disliked and feared figure in Peruvian prisons, where he is believed to have been the victim of several violent attacks. Whether or not the marriage will benefit him in any way remains to be seen.
