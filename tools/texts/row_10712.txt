article: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A member of Pakistan's paramilitary Sindh Rangers has been sentenced to death in the killing of an unarmed teenager whose fatal shooting was caught on video, a prosecutor told CNN. Five other soldiers, also members of the Sindh Rangers, and a civilian were given life sentences for their roles in the June killing of 17-year-old Sarfraz Shah, Muhammed Khan Buriro, a special public prosecutor with the Anti-Terrorism Court, said Friday. The sentences of the seven men still must be confirmed by the Pakistan's higher court, Buriro said. All seven also were ordered to restitution, ranging from $1,162 to $2,325 each to Shah's family, he said. The case prompted a public outcry after a chilling video captured by a local television cameraman showed Shah pleading for his life before being shot twice in a park in Karachi. In the video, which was broadcast across Pakistan's networks, Shah cries "I am helpless" and "please do not fire." After being shot twice, Shah then begs to be taken to a hospital before bleeding to death. The shooting death was the latest in a series of human rights incidents that has deeply eroded public confidence in security agencies. Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered transfers for the heads of the Sindh Rangers and the provincial police force after the shooting. Pakistan's Supreme Court also ordered the six soldiers and the civilian to be tried before the country's Anti-Terrorism Court,, a special court where hearings are expedited and decisions come more quickly than in the regular court system. Authorities, at the time of the shooting, said Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. They said Shah had pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones. Authorities said he was handed over to park security and then to the Rangers. Shah apparently tried to snatch the Rangers' guns, authorities said at the time. That's when the soldiers opened fire. The video shows Shah reaching for their weapons before backing away. Shah's family has repeatedly said he was innocent.

chatgpt: In a case that has garnered widespread attention and sparked outrage across Pakistan, a court has convicted six soldiers and one civilian for their role in the shooting death of Sarfraz Shah, a 19-year-old teenager. The incident occurred in Karachi in June 2011, and drew widespread condemnation after a video of the shooting went viral on social media. The convictions were announced by the prosecutorâ€™s office on Wednesday, and come after years of legal wrangling in a case that has been closely watched by human rights activists and journalists. According to the prosecutor's statement, one of the men convicted was sentenced to death, while the others were given life sentences. In addition to the prison time, the defendants were ordered to pay restitution to Shah's family. The incident began when Shah was seen wandering around in a restricted area of a park in Karachi. The soldiers, who were on duty in the park at the time, confronted him and accused him of theft. After an argument ensued, one of the soldiers, identified as Shahid Zafar, shot Shah at close range, while the others stood by and watched. The video of the incident, which was circulated widely on the internet, showed Shah pleading for his life as he bled out on the ground. The soldiers appeared to show little concern or remorse for their actions, and were seen walking away from the scene after the shooting. The case has been controversial from the start, with human rights groups accusing the military of trying to cover up the incident and protect the soldiers involved. Despite the difficulties of prosecuting soldiers in a country where the military is seen as sacred, the case eventually made its way through the courts, and the defendants were ultimately found guilty of murder. However, the sentences are not final, and must be confirmed by Pakistan's higher court before they become official. It remains to be seen whether the higher court will uphold the convictions and sentences or whether they will be reduced or overturned. Regardless of the outcome, the case has served as a reminder of the importance of accountability and justice, even in the face of powerful institutions like the military. While the convictions and sentences are a positive step forward, they are only a small part of the larger struggle to create a more just and equitable society for all.
