article: A nationwide strike in Belgium has brought rail, road and air transport to a standstill and seen protesters try to hurl eggs and fireworks at government offices. The 24 hour strike is the country's first general strike since 2005 and comes in the wake of a new government's plans to save £8.7billion in the next five years. In the Belgian capital of Brussels, police resisted striking workers who tried to throw eggs and fireworks at the offices of Flemish separatist party N-VA, one of the four parties in the Belgian government.

Most trains on the high-speed Thalys link line between Paris and Brussels were also cancelled, with local bus, tram and metro services also affected. At the port of Antwerp, one of the busiest in Europe, more than 50 ships were unable to enter or leave.

Unions called the strike a great success, but Flemish business group Voka said 77 percent of the firms it surveyed in Brussels and the northern region of Flanders had all their workers in. A siege in Ghent, which turned out to be a hoax, also meant the impact of the strike was overshadowed. Unions are opposing a decision by Prime Minister Charles Michel - Belgium's new leader - to scrap a cost-of-living wage next year. Belgian law currently mandates that wage rise at the same pace as inflation. They are also protesting against public sector cutbacks and plans to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. These reforms are part of a plan to plug the country's budget deficit, which stands at 3 per cent of GDP for 2014. The public sector movement began early last month with 100,000 people taking part in a march in Brussels that ended in clashes leaving 112 police injured. Several vehicles were set alight by protesters who also hurled stones and flares at police. About 50 people were hurt and 30 detained, officials said. Mr Michel was sworn in as prime minister in October. The 38-year-old French-speaking liberal is Belgium's youngest leader since 1841.

chatgpt: Belgium saw its first general strike in more than a decade as workers across the country observed a 24-hour shutdown on Tuesday. The strike came in response to the government's plans to cut £8.7 billion from public spending over the next five years. In a defiant show of opposition, workers in Brussels marched through the city with flares and banners, chanting slogans criticizing the government's austerity measures. Some threw eggs and fireworks at government buildings, prompting police to intervene with water cannons. Public transportation was also severely affected by the strike, with trains, buses, and trams all halted for the day. Brussels Airport, one of Europe's largest airports, also experienced cancellations and delays due to the walkout. The strike was deemed a resounding success by the unions, with an estimated 90% of public sector workers taking part. The unions argue that the government's proposed cuts will have a devastating impact on services and that it is ordinary citizens who will bear the consequences. The government, for its part, has defended the austerity measures, claiming that they are necessary to reduce the country's high public debt. Belgium currently has one of the highest public debt levels in Europe, and the government argues that the cuts are essential to maintain fiscal stability. The strike is the latest in a series of protests against the government's austerity measures, with previous demonstrations drawing tens of thousands of people onto the streets. The response from the government, however, has been largely dismissive, with officials insisting that the cuts are necessary to avoid a Greek-style financial crisis. Despite this, the unions remain determined to fight against the cuts, with further strikes and protests planned in the coming weeks. They argue that the government's measures will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable members of society, including the elderly and those on low incomes. While the strike was largely peaceful, there were reports of some sporadic violence in other parts of the country. In the city of Liege, for example, protesters smashed shop windows and set cars on fire. In Antwerp, police used tear gas to disperse a group of demonstrators who had gathered outside a government building. The strikes also caused significant disruption to businesses across the country, with shops and restaurants forced to close for the day. Some business leaders expressed frustration at the protest, claiming that it would harm the country's economic growth. Despite these concerns, the unions have vowed to continue their fight against the government's plans. They argue that the cuts will only serve to deepen the country's economic woes and that an alternative approach is needed to address Belgium's financial problems.
