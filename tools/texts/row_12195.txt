article: (Oprah.com) -- When a former police captain stumbled on spirituality, she discovered a different way to serve and protect. For Cheri Maples, enlightenment began in a chiropractor's office. It was 1991, and the Madison, Wisconsin, policewoman needed treatment for a back injury- -- she'd been hoisting a stolen moped out of a car trunk; in the waiting room, Maples flipped through a copy of Being Peace, by the Buddhist monk and activist Thich Nhat Hanh. Oprah.com: Who are you meant to be? "It was so simple, so no-nonsense," she recalls. "He described what mindfulness and meditation actually look like in day-to-day life. It gave me the desire to know more." Seventeen years later, Maples had traded her crisp police blues for earth-toned robes when Nhat Hanh ordained her as a Buddhist dharma teacher. As head of the Center for Mindfulness & Justice, founded in 2009 and based out of her Madison home, Maples travels the continent leading workshops and retreats for cops and others in the criminal justice system -- where she spent 25 years variously serving as a police captain, head of probation and assistant attorney general.

People turn to alcohol, drugs, food, gambling, infidelity anything to cope." (Maples herself has been clean and sober for 21 years.) "The workshops give cops the tools to examine their own intentions and biases -- to approach their job not with anger and cynicism but love and fierce compassion." Maples, the mother of two grown sons, has faced skepticism from what she calls "the biggest of the boys' clubs." "Some cops think I'm asking them to drink the Kool-Aid, so I use my own experience as a blueprint," she says. "At my first-ever retreat, I had a chip on my shoulder. I said, 'I can't do mindfulness training -- I'm a cop. I carry a gun!' But then a teacher asked me, 'Who better to carry a gun than someone who does so mindfully?'" To date, Maples has trained more than 1,000 criminal justice personnel in mindfulness techniques. "It's amazing to watch a guy taking off his bulletproof vest before he meditates," she says. "Police are peacemakers. And you can't bring peace anywhere unless you have it inside your own heart." Oprah.com: 25 women who've built their dream careers .

chatgpt: Cheri Maples, a former police chief, has found a new way to serve and protect her community: as a Buddhist dharma teacher. In 2008, she left law enforcement to pursue her spiritual calling and has since trained over 1,000 criminal justice personnel. Maples brings a unique perspective to her teachings, having spent over 25 years as a police officer. She offers mindfulness and compassion training to law enforcement officers and other criminal justice staff, aiming to improve their understanding of emotional regulation and reducing implicit bias. In an interview with Tricycle magazine, Maples spoke about how her own experiences as a police officer ignited her passion for social justice and reform. "I saw firsthand how criminal justice systems could become punitive and often were overly reactive," she shared. "I believed that there had to be a better way, a way that was based on rehabilitation, restoration, and redemption." Maples' training programs focus on "mindful communication" and "mindful decision-making," which involve understanding the motivations and emotions of others and developing self-awareness. In her workshops, she uses meditation and breathing exercises to help participants develop these skills, which can aid in de-escalation and reduce the use of force. Maples' work has already had a significant impact on the criminal justice system, with a number of officers and staff reporting that her training has helped them better serve their communities. One participant, a police officer from Wisconsin, praised Maples' methods, saying that they had "shown us that we can embody compassion and respect for everyone we encounter on our jobs, even when it is difficult." The benefits of mindfulness and compassion training in policing have been well-documented, with studies showing that officers who undergo such training have higher levels of job satisfaction and lower levels of burnout. This can translate into improved relations with the community, as officers who are able to empathize and communicate effectively are less likely to use excessive force. Maples' teachings have also been applied beyond the criminal justice system. She has worked with educators, healthcare providers, and corporate leaders to improve their interpersonal and leadership skills. Her approach emphasizes the importance of cultivating a sense of connection and community, which can lead to a more harmonious workplace and improved outcomes for everyone. Despite the challenges of her work, Maples remains committed to her calling. "It's been really exciting to see the seeds that we've planted," she said, "and to see how people are embracing these practices and finding them useful, not only for their jobs but for their own personal lives as well." Maples' work is a testament to the power of compassion and mindfulness in creating positive change. By offering alternative ways of thinking about law enforcement and criminal justice, she is proving that there is a better way forward for everyone.
