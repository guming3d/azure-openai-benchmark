FBI Special Agent Timothy Quinn said Tazhayakov told him that Tsarnaev had discussed martyrdom and his knowledge of bomb building during a conversation over lunch with Tazhayakov and his roommate and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev before spring break last year. 'Dzhokhar had explained that people who die in an act of martyrdom die with a smile on their face and go straight to heaven,' said Quinn, who interviewed Tazhayakov in the days after the alleged visit to Tsarnaev's room. "He also explained that during the same conversation, Dzhokhar said he knew how to build bombs," Quinn testified.

Tsarnaev was captured in the days after the bombing and is awaiting trial in November on terrorism charges. His older brother Tamerlan, also a suspect in the bombing, was killed following a shoot-out with police. FBI agent Farbod Azad had testified on Thursday that Tazhayakov told him in an interview after the bombing that he and Kadyrbayev and a third man, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, had removed the backpack and a laptop from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room. Tazhayakov's attorneys say he never touched the backpack or fireworks, and that it was Kadyrbayev who threw them out. FBI Special Agent Kenneth Benton testified on Friday he recovered the backpack at a landfill on April 26, 2013. Tazhayakov's attorneys say he never touched the backpack or fireworks, and that it was Kadyrbayev who threw them out . The backpack contained fireworks with the gunpowder removed, a spiral notebook, a jar of Vaseline and a homework assignment from an ethics class in which Tsarnaev was enrolled, he said. An FBI forensic examiner, David McCollum, testified Vaseline could be used to make an improvised explosive device. Tazhayakov could face up to 25 years in prison. Kadyrbayev faces the same charges. Phillipos is accused of the lesser charge of lying to investigators. Tsarnaev's trial is set for November, on charges that carry the death penalty if he is convicted.

chatgpt: Azamat Tazhayakov, a friend of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has become the first person in Tsarnaev's inner circle to face trial. Tazhayakov, originally from Kazakhstan, is accused of obstruction of justice for his alleged efforts to help Tsarnaev dispose of evidence related to the bombing.  During the trial, an FBI agent testified that Tsarnaev had spoken to Tazhayakov and another friend about becoming a martyr over lunch just before the April 2013 tragedy. According to the agent's testimony, Tsarnaev had stated that he believed that dying for his cause was "acceptable in the eyes of Allah."  The FBI agent also testified that during the same conversation, Tsarnaev had bragged about knowing how to build bombs. This testimony is particularly significant because Tazhayakov and his co-defendant, Dias Kadyrbayev, are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room that could have been used as evidence against him.  The prosecution has argued that by removing Tsarnaev's laptop and backpack from the dorm room, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev were trying to help their friend cover up his involvement in the bombing. However, the defense team has argued that the two young men had no knowledge of Tsarnaev's plans to carry out the attack, and had simply been trying to protect their friend from getting into trouble over unrelated drug charges.  Regardless of Tazhayakov's intentions, it is clear that Tsarnaev had been discussing his extremist beliefs with his friends before the bombing. This is consistent with evidence that has previously been presented in court, which suggests that Tsarnaev was heavily influenced by radical Islamic ideology.  During the trial, Tazhayakov's defense team attempted to shift the focus away from their client's alleged role in helping Tsarnaev cover up his involvement in the bombing, and instead portrayed him as a naive young student who had been caught up in a situation he did not fully understand. The defense also suggested that Tazhayakov had been unfairly targeted by the authorities because of his nationality and Muslim faith.  However, the prosecution argued that Tazhayakov had knowingly helped Tsarnaev dispose of evidence related to the bombing, and had even joked about Tsarnaev being a terrorist in the days after the attack. If convicted, Tazhayakov faces up to 25 years in prison.  The trial of Azamat Tazhayakov is set to continue for several more weeks, with the prosecution expected to call more witnesses to testify about the events leading up to the Boston Marathon bombing. Tsarnaev himself is currently awaiting trial and could face the death penalty if convicted. The attack, which killed three people and injured hundreds more, has been described as one of the worst acts of terrorism on American soil since the 9/11 attacks.
