article: (CNN) -- Call it the "cheese dip." A 400-foot section of the Leo Frigo Bridge -- named after a late Wisconsin cheese scion -- suddenly sagged Wednesday, forcing police to close off the span that carries Interstate 43 over the Fox River some 120 feet below. "There's a part that's sagging," a motorist told an incredulous 911 operator, according to recordings posted by CNN affiliate WLUK. "A part that's sagging?" the operator asked. "Instead of a bump, it's a dip," the driver said. How safe is that bridge you're driving over? It appears that one of the piers holding up the bridge sank about 2 feet into the ground, Gov. Scott Walker told reporters Wednesday. The bridge, which carries 40,000 cars a day, will be closed indefinitely, state officials said. "We understand the disruption this is going to cause to traffic," Wisconsin Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb told reporters Wednesday. The bridge was built in 1980 and last inspected in August 2012, declared sound and renovated shortly thereafter, said Kim Rudat, regional communications manager for the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

"It's a big hassle, because of all the construction that's going around town," he said. "The downtown bridge was closed for how long? Now this one is out? It's just like it's a never-ending problem here." It could be worse, of course. New Washington state bridge opens after collapse . State officials say the bridge is in no danger of collapsing like the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Mount Vernon, Washington, this spring. In that incident, a tractor-trailer struck a support on the bridge, which had been rated "functionally obsolete," sending several cars plunging into the river below. No one died, but three people were taken to the hospital for treatment. The Wisconsin bridge is named after Leo Frigo, who ran Frigo Cheese Corp. until his retirement in 1983. A former member of Roman Catholic religious orders, he was well-known in the area for his work with ex-convicts and for founding a Green Bay food pantry, according to his official biography on the pantry's website. He died in 2001. Spanning the globe for scary high bridges .

chatgpt: A 400-foot section of a bridge in Wisconsin unexpectedly sags, forcing state officials to close the bridge temporarily. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the incident. State officials rushed to the scene and closed the bridge soon after the incident occurred. The collapse of the section, located in the southwestern part of the state, was likely caused by a combination of factors, officials said. The bridge's age and the harsh winter weather conditions may have contributed to the sudden sag. The closure of the bridge caused significant traffic delays, as the bridge is a major transportation route in the region. Commuters had to find alternative routes to reach their destinations, leading to increased frustration and longer travel times. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation, meanwhile, assured the public that the bridge was not in danger of a complete collapse. The department said that engineers were on site to conduct assessments and that repair work would begin as soon as possible. Local residents expressed concern about the incident, with many worried that the bridge may not be safe for travel. Some even suggested that the state should consider building a new, stronger bridge to ensure the safety of commuters. The collapse of the bridge, however, highlights the urgent need for investment in infrastructure across the country. Many bridges across the United States are in poor condition, and incidents like the one in Wisconsin serve as a wake-up call to state and federal officials. In recent years, efforts have been made to improve the nation's infrastructure, but much more needs to be done. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given the country's infrastructure a grade of D+ due to its poor conditions and lack of investment. As the authorities work to repair the sagging section of the bridge in Wisconsin, local residents can only hope that the incident serves as a reminder to prioritize infrastructure investments. The safety of commuters must be a top priority, and nothing less than a commitment to rebuilding and upgrading infrastructure will suffice.
