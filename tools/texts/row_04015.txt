article: (CNN) -- Emergency officials sifted through damage and debris scattered across roadways Saturday after a line of fast-moving storms and high winds swept through northwestern Wisconsin the night before, leaving at least one person dead and 39 others injured. Three people were critically injured and a second person died, though not as a result of the storm, Burnett County spokeswoman Dawn Sargent said. The storms also contributed to "widespread power outages" in a county with a population that normally swells to more than 80,000 people during the Fourth of July weekend. Burnett County's typical population is about 17,000. "We ask nonresidents to avoid the area because of the road closures and the presence of emergency crews trying to clear debris from the roadways," Sargent added. Roughly three-quarters of the county have been affected, while its northern sections were more heavily hit. The towns of Grantsburg, Washburn, Danbury and Web Lake were among the hardest-hit areas, said Wisconsin's emergency management spokeswoman Rhonda Reynolds. "Last night we were working, and at about 7 o'clock the winds really picked up," said Carinna Coy, an employee at T-Dawgs restaurant in Grantsburg. "From what we could see today, there's a lot of trees that tipped over and a lot of roads that are closed. "Main Street is a mess," she added. A hardware store owner in neighboring Washburn described gusty winds, heavy rains and lightning that preceded power outages. "Power's been out in parts of Washburn for most of the day, though they say that hopefully it'll be back soon," Nate Swiston of Washburn Hardware said. An aerial survey of the region revealed storm damage to homes and downed trees throughout the region. Officials said Saturday that they are focused on looking for trapped residents and distributing food, water and emergency medical supplies. The American Red Cross also opened a meals station for the general public at the Grantsburg Middle School, Sargent said. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A Fourth of July weekend celebration turned into chaos in Burnett County, Wisconsin as severe thunderstorms and high winds swept across the area, leaving 39 people injured, three of them critically. According to county officials, the storms caused extensive damage across several towns in the county, with Grantsburg, Washburn, Danbury, and Web Lake bearing the brunt of the storm's impact. The county typically sees an influx of around 80,000 people during the Fourth of July weekend, which is a significant increase from its population of around 17,000 people. Many of the visitors come to enjoy the beautiful scenery and the various events that take place during this festive weekend. However, this year's celebrations were marred by the severe weather conditions that hit the area. The sudden storm caused widespread property damage as trees were uprooted and power lines were brought down. The winds were so strong that they toppled several tents and left many people stranded in their cars on roads and highways. Emergency services were quickly dispatched to the affected areas, and the injured were taken to area hospitals for treatment. While none of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening, the three people in critical condition were flown to nearby trauma centers for more advanced care. County officials have urged residents and visitors to remain vigilant as more storms are expected to hit the area over the coming days. The National Weather Service has issued a severe weather warning for the region, advising people to stay indoors and away from windows until the storm passes. The local authorities are currently working hard to clear debris from the roadways and restore power to the affected areas. They have also set up a disaster relief center for those affected by the storm, where people can seek shelter and assistance. The Fourth of July weekend is typically a time for merriment and celebration, but this year, the festivities in Burnett County have been overshadowed by the severe weather conditions that have swept through the area. As the cleanup and recovery efforts continue, the community is rallying together to support those affected and hoping for a smoother and safer Fourth of July celebration next year.
