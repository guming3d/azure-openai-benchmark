article: (CNN) -- "NCIS" fans will get a triple dose of those crime investigations on CBS this fall. The network has added four new dramas and a new sitcom to its fall lineup, and one of the dramas is the "NCIS" spinoff set in New Orleans. As CBS announced on Wednesday, "NCIS: New Orleans," starring Scott Bakula, will air on Tuesday nights following its parent program. The major shift in CBS's 2014-2015 calendar is the network's addition of "Thursday Night Football."

On October 30, CBS's more typical Thursday night lineup will resume, including a 12th and final season of "Two and a Half Men" and a new comedy, "The McCarthys."
