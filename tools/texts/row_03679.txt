article: Florida State University quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston was cited for allegedly taking seafood from a Tallahassee grocery store without paying, the Leon County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Winston, a two-sport athlete, was suspended from FSU's baseball team on Wednesday. Winston, only the second freshman to win college football's most coveted award, allegedly walked into a Publix near the FSU campus Tuesday night, ordered about $32 worth of crab legs and crawfish, and walked out of the store without paying, sheriff's Maj. Michael Wood told reporters. After deputies contacted him about three hours later, Winston told them that he forgot to pay, Wood said. "He was very cooperative," Wood said. "Seemed fairly honest in the fact that he did not pay for the items, so it was not a huge mystery to solve." Social media takes the story and runs with it . As part of the civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in the county -- Winston was not arrested but has been ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, Wood said. CNN's call to the university's athletic department was not immediately returned. "I am confident he will complete his community service obligation and the situation will be resolved soon," FSU baseball coach Mike Martin said in a news release. The school's football coach, Jimbo Fisher, said, "I fully support Coach Martin's decision and will also make sure that Jameis meets all obligations, which I know he will." Wood said Winston "most likely" will have to pay Publix the $32, noting that restitution usually is part of the citation program. A Publix employee noticed Winston left without paying but waited a while to notify a deputy, thinking Winston might have gone outside to get a cart, Wood said. Wood said civil citations, as opposed to criminal charges, can be given in similar cases at deputies' discretion, and when the store and the suspect agree to terms. Publix and Winston agreed to this citation, Wood said. He said the sheriff's office has issued 32 civil citations "for very similar crimes" since December. Winston won the Heisman in December, a month after a Florida prosecutor announced no charges would be filed over a woman's allegation that Winston raped her in 2012. The prosecutor said authorities did not even have probable cause to arrest Winston in the case. The accuser alleged  Winston had raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar; Winston maintained that the sexual activity was consensual.

chatgpt: Heisman Trophy winner and Florida State University quarterback, Jameis Winston, is once again making headlines. This time, it's not for his athletic prowess, but for allegedly walking out of a grocery store without paying for a meal of crab legs and crawfish. According to a statement from the Leon County Sheriff's Office, Winston entered a local Publix grocery store on Tuesday night and ordered the seafood from the store's deli. He then reportedly left the store without paying for the food, which had a reported value of $32.72. The alleged incident was captured on store surveillance cameras, and Winston was identified by store employees. The store manager declined to press charges, but Winston was issued a citation, which is similar to a traffic ticket. Winston's attorney, Tim Jansen, issued a statement on Wednesday stating that his client had intended to pay for the food, but had simply forgotten to do so. Jansen went on to say that Winston had cooperated fully with authorities and had already made restitution to the store for the unpaid items. Despite not being arrested, Winston is still facing disciplinary action. He has been suspended from FSU's baseball team, where he plays as a relief pitcher, for an indefinite period of time. FSU head baseball coach, Mike Martin, released a statement saying that Winston's suspension was not related to the alleged theft, but was a result of Winston's failure to comply with team rules. This latest incident is not the first time Winston has found himself in hot water off the field. In 2012, he was accused of sexual assault, but was not charged due to lack of evidence. In 2014, he was cited for shoplifting soda from a Burger King restaurant. He also faced scrutiny over a potentially problematic autograph deal with a sports memorabilia dealer. Despite these incidents, Winston remains a highly regarded athlete. In 2013, he became the youngest winner of the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual honor. He also led FSU to a national championship that same year. Winston's alleged theft has sparked a range of reactions from fans and critics alike. Some have called for harsher punishment for the star quarterback, while others have been quick to defend him. Meanwhile, social media has been abuzz with jokes and memes about the incident. As of now, it remains to be seen what further consequences Winston may face as a result of his alleged theft. However, this latest incident serves as a reminder that even the most talented athletes are not immune to scrutiny and criticism both on and off the field.
