article: Lord Coe revealed his manifesto for the presidency of athletics’ world governing body — the IAAF — and promised he would clamp down on ‘plastic Brits’ who switch nationality for financial reasons. Coe, who appears certain to face pole vault great Sergey Bubka in next August’s election, has included in his manifesto a commitment to making it more attractive for an athlete to stick with the country of their birth, after Team GB came under fire before the London 2012 Olympics for selecting several recently naturalised citizens. Lord Coe is aiming to succeed current IAAF president Lamine Diack (right) when he steps down next year . - Reforming the world athletics calendar and bringing in city centre 'street athletics' competitions. - Maximising commercial growth and focusing on youth engagement. - Increasing resources for anti-doping and creating a new IAAF ethics department. - Changes to the IAAF internal structure to give a greater voice for athletes. He said: ‘Clearly, there is an issue about transfer of allegiance, where it is based purely on a financial exchange. And it is very important that the sport has a proper discussion on this and that we act on it. I know there is significant strength of feeling in many continents that this does have to be resolved.’ The former double Olympic champion, 58, is currently chairman of the British Olympic Association, executive chairman of CSM Sports and Entertainment, a global ambassador for Nike and an adviser to PruHealth and Deutsche Bank UK, but insisted that, if appointed by the IAAF, he would avoid a conflict of interests as he did during his chairmanship of London 2012. Coe, currently a vice-president of athletics' world governing body, is standing to succeed Lamine Diack, who is stepping down in August. Coe, seen giving a speech at the closing ceremony, headed the London 2012 organising committee . Coe said: 'To many within and outside our sport, our calendar seems disjointed, lacks a narrative and the essential glue to build excitement and a loyal and passionate following. 'Many fans don't know when the athletics season starts, when it ends, why it seems to bounce around from the USA to Europe to Asia and back again. A harmonised calendar is the key to promotion, marketing, the athletes and member federation development and we must address this. 'We need to be more innovative in how we project and present our sport to the world, both in venue and on screen, give serious consideration to an 'IAAF Street Athletics' circuit to help reach new audiences, and create a new IAAF division that has the sole purpose of focussing on youth engagement, especially via social media.'

chatgpt: On Wednesday, Seb Coe launched his manifesto for the upcoming International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) presidential election. Coe, who is currently a vice-president of the governing body, laid out his vision for taking the IAAF forward amidst increasing concerns about corruption and doping in athletics. Coe's manifesto, titled 'Growing Athletics in a New Age,' emphasizes his commitment to making the sport more accessible and appealing to younger audiences. Among his proposals are new events that incorporate technology and music, as well as a focus on improving the fan experience at major athletics competitions. Speaking at a press conference in London, Coe said: "We must embrace innovation and creativity to make athletics relevant for a new generation. This is an exciting time, but also a challenging one - we must confront the issues that have damaged our sport." Coe's main challenger in the election is former pole-vaulting champion and Ukrainian Olympic gold medalist, Sergei Bubka. Bubka has promised to clean up athletics and restore its reputation following the recent doping scandal, which has seen a number of high-profile athletes banned from competition. In his manifesto, Bubka pledges to increase funding for anti-doping measures and establish an independent ethics commission to oversee the sport. He also emphasizes his commitment to expanding the sport globally, with a focus on developing nations where athletics is not yet well-established. The election, which takes place in August at the IAAF World Championships in Beijing, is viewed as crucial for the future of athletics. Following the recent scandal, which has seen allegations of widespread doping and corruption, many believe that the sport needs a strong and transparent leader to restore trust and credibility. Both Coe and Bubka have strong credentials for the role, with Coe widely credited for his successful role in organizing the London 2012 Olympic Games and Bubka known for his advocacy of clean sport and his efforts to promote athletics in developing countries. Whoever is elected will have a significant task on their hands in rebuilding athletics' reputation and ensuring that the sport is clean and fair for athletes and fans alike. The election will be a closely-watched affair, with both candidates expected to campaign vigorously in the coming months in the lead-up to the vote.
