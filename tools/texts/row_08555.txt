article: In Burlington, Vermont, there seems to be an 18 percent surcharge for speaking French. Some waiters in the New England tourist town have begun adding a mandatory tip onto the bill of foreign diners. Restaurant owners say it's their solution to an influx of French-speaking Canadians from Quebec who are extraordinarily bad tippers -- sometimes leaving just $1 or a few cents tip on $50 or $100 tabs. Discrimination? Splash at the Boathouse is one of the restaurants in Burlington, Vermont, where servers add a mandatory 18 percent tip to French-speaking diners' tabs . At least one Vermont resident, who grew up in France, says the new rules are discrimination and they might be illegal. She has been slapped with an automatic 18 percent gratuity three times because she often speaks French to her friends during dinner. Restaurant owners say there's no policy in place to include mandatory tip on diners from Canada and other countries. They claim they have left the decision up to individual waiters and waitresses. However, the practice is so common, servers refer to it as the 'Queeb tax' -- after the Quebecois who inspired it, Seven Days, a Vermont news site, reports. The Asiana Noodle Shop is one restaurant where foreigners are likely to be hit with an 18 percent gratuity included on their bill . Owner Sandy Kong told ABC News that she was tired of her waitresses getting bad tips. 'Some Canadians come in, they spend like $100 or $150 and they leave the wait staff maybe a $1 tip,' she said. 'It happens pretty often. I realize that the Canadians think it's discrimination, but on all the receipts it's printed out on bottom: "We suggest an 18 or 20 percent tip."' Visitors: The city of Burlington has been encouraging tourists from Quebec to visit Vermont and spend their money . Ms Kong, who was born in Hong Kong, said other foreigners are often lousy at leaving money for the wait staff. 'Asians do it also. But it seems that Canadians tip the worst,' she said. Anne-Marie Humbert, who lives in a nearby town in Vermont, first noticed the practice when she had dinner with her husband at Splash at the Boat House on Burlington. The two spent their dinner speaking French to each mother. Ms Humbert was born and raised in France, but has lived in the United States for 30 years. When the bill came, it looked too steep, until she realized the waitress had included an 18 percent tip on top of the total for the meal. Ms Humbert protested and the server removed the surcharge. Ms Humbert says she left a 15 percent tip. The policies are discrimination, Ms Humbert says, because waiters are targeting anyone who they assume isn't American. The problem likely arises from a cultural difference. In Canada and most countries, tipping 10 to 15 percent is customary, though many restaurants automatically include a gratuity on the bill. Waiters in Vermont make just $4.10 an hour without tips.

chatgpt: Burlington, Vermont, has become the new home of many French Canadians from Quebec in recent years. This influx of French Canadian immigrants has brought new diversity to the community and has led to dynamic cultural exchange and growth. The French Canadian community has a long history in Vermont, dating back to the late 1800s when many immigrants crossed the border seeking jobs in the lumber and textile industries. Today, a new wave of immigration is taking place as people from Quebec are drawn to Vermont's natural beauty and friendly communities. This trend has brought about a new vitality to Burlington as well as challenges for the newcomers. While many in the community have celebrated the arrival of new residents who bring diverse skills, perspectives, and cultures, others have worried about the economic impact of a greater demand for resources. Despite these challenges, the French Canadian immigrants are welcomed with open arms by many in the community. They have contributed greatly to the local economy by starting businesses and revitalizing the downtown area. Additionally, language exchange programs have been established to help French Canadians learn English and Vermonters learn French. Marie, a new resident from Quebec, shares her thoughts on the move, “I left Quebec because I was looking for more opportunities. I always loved Vermont and what I’ve received is great; I have a good job and living is affordable. At first it was difficult for me, because custom is different, the pace of life is relaxed and the weather is a challenge, but I adapted.” For some Vermonters, the influx of new residents has sparked a renewed interest in their own family histories. This interest in genealogy has brought about meaningful connections between the old and new residents, as people discover shared familial roots across the border. However, tensions are not absent in the community, as some locals feel that the French Canadians are not fully integrating into Vermont life. Others argue that it takes time for newcomers to adjust to their new surroundings, and that the community should be patient. Nevertheless, as the French Canadian population continues to grow, it is clear that the impact on Burlington and Vermont as a whole is significant. Local leaders and organizations are working to ensure that the new arrivals feel welcome and supported as they adjust to their new homes. In conclusion, the recent influx of French Canadians to Burlington has had a considerable impact on the community. While it has not been without its challenges, the new residents are contributing to the local economy, expanding cultural diversity, and enriching community life. It is hoped that the community can continue to embrace and support the French Canadians as they become an integral part of the fabric of Vermont's society.
