When it comes to incentivising weight loss and encouraging a healthy population, one apartment building in Asia thinks it has the answer. The Lady Share House B&D, an all-female residential facility in Osaka, Japan, have established a tenancy agreement whereby rent is set based on a person's fluctuating weight: the more weight you lose, the less rent you pay. And the reverse applies, too. Landlords now deduct 1,000 yen (£6.50) from rent for every 2.2lbs lost at the building's regular three-month weigh-ins... or add the same amount if the weight has been gained. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Japan living: The building in Osaka has also opened an exercise studio equipped fitness equipments in order to help renters control and lose their weight (note: picture is stock photo of Japanese apartment block) 'Since the rent is lower if you lose weight, we thought overweight people would be coming to live here. Instead, we found that people who already have a great body come here and their goal is to maintain that physique,' she said. Speaking of why the two-dozen tenants are provided with unlimited snacks and sugary soft drinks, Ms Kataoka said it was not a scam to increase rents. She said: 'By having snacks at their disposal, we hope they will become more resistant to temptation. In this share house the residents have the same goals to lose weight, so it's easier not to give up.'
