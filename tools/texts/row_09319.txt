article: By . Associated  Press Reporter . Burger King is getting rid of its lower-calorie french fries at most restaurants after less than a year. The Miami-based chain said in a statement that it gave its franchisees the option to continue selling the french fries earlier this week. Only about 2,500 of the approximately 7,400 locations in the U.S. and Canada opted to continue selling them as a permanent item. The others have started phasing them out. The french fries, called Satisfries, were a big bet for Burger King when they were announced in September. But they weren't as well received as Burger King had hoped. Scroll down for video . Burger King is getting rid of its lower-calorie french fries at most restaurants after less than a year because the more expensive healthy option hasn't proved a hit with customers . The name was mocked in some corners, with one website referring to them as Saddest Fries. There also is some confusion about their caloric superiority, with a small order still containing 270 calories. A small order of McDonald's fries, by comparison, has 230 calories because the serving weighs less. Satisfries also are pricier, costing about $1.89 for a small order, compared with a $1.59 for regular fries. And it's unclear whether customers were aware what made the fries lower in calories. Burger King said Satisfries used a different type of batter to prevent some oil from being absorbed by the potatoes during frying. The return of the Big King, which resembles a Big Mac, is another recent move since investment firm 3G Capital took Burger King public again 2012 . But the company did not have signs in restaurants explaining the difference between Satisfries and regular fries. It's just one of the gambits by Burger King since investment firm 3G Capital took it public again 2012. Other moves have included the return of the Big King, which resembles a Big Mac and a French Fry Burger, which is essentially a burger with four french fries smashed on top. The efforts haven't yet sparked any big sales gains at a time when traditional fast-food chains are struggling. In the latest quarter, sales at established restaurants in the U.S. and Canada edged up just 0.4 percent. This week, Burger King Worldwide Inc. also announced the return of Chicken Fries for a limited time. The company said it brought back the deep-fried chicken in response to demand it saw online.

chatgpt: Burger King has announced that it will discontinue the sale of its lower-calorie "Satisfries" at most of its restaurants after less than a year on the menu. The decision comes after the new product failed to meet customer expectations and generate sufficient sales. Satisfries were aimed at those looking for a healthier fast food option, offering a lower calorie count than the chain's regular fries. Initially, the product was touted as a major innovation for Burger King when it was announced in September. However, the fries were not well received by customers, and sales were below expectations. Cost may have been an issue for the less-than-popular fries. At $1.89 for a small order, Satisfries were pricier than regular fries, which cost $1.59. The price difference likely deterred some customers from trying the new product, especially given that the taste was not noticeably different from regular fries. Furthermore, it is unclear whether customers were even aware of what made the fries lower in calories. While the product was marketed as a healthier option, it seems that the message may not have been communicated effectively. This lack of consumer awareness likely contributed to the product's poor sales. Despite the failure of Satisfries, Burger King remains committed to offering healthy options on its menu. The chain has continued to expand its line of salads and other menu items that cater to those seeking healthier fare. However, the failure of Satisfries demonstrates the challenges that fast food chains face in trying to balance customer demand with health concerns. Fast food companies have been under increasing pressure to offer healthier options as consumers become more health-conscious. Many chains have responded by making changes to their menus, such as offering calorie counts and more nutritious options. However, the success of such efforts is not guaranteed, as the case of Satisfries illustrates. In the end, the discontinuation of Satisfries may be a blessing in disguise for Burger King. The chain can now focus on other menu options that have proved more successful, while continuing to offer healthier alternatives. In this way, Burger King can navigate the challenges of the fast food industry while staying true to its loyal customer base.
