article: (CNN) -- A Massachusetts pharmacy linked to a meningitis outbreak says its cleaning contractor should share blame for the apparent mishap that left dozens dead nationwide. The New England Compounding Center sent a letter to UniFirst Corp. demanding it share responsibility for a tainted steroid used to treat pain and inflammation, according to a filing this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. UniFirst Corp. acknowledged that it provided "once-a-month cleaning services," but added that the pharmacy's claims are "without merit," the filing says. Last week, the compounding center announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. The company said that it "seeks to establish a fund to compensate individuals and families affected" by the outbreak, which has been linked to 39 fatalities among the 656 cases tallied in 19 states. Patients contracted fungal meningitis -- which results in inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord -- after their spines were injected with a contaminated, preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate, health officials have said. According to health agencies, the compounding center did not follow proper sterilization procedures and distributed its products without knowing whether they had passed sterility tests.

In addition, it distributed vials containing a steroid that was contaminated with "visible black particulate matter" later identified as fungus, according to a report from the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy. The contamination problem came to light in the fall, after the first fungal meningitis cases were reported. The New England Compounding Center voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid in September. In October, the pharmacy board, which is part of the state's Department of Public Health, said it had "identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk." The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said they have identified bacterial and/or fungal contamination in unopened vials of some of the compounding center's products. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is looking into what went wrong at the company and why it was allowed to continue to function despite a history of problems.

Federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the practices at the Framingham-based company, and the state pharmacy board has voted to permanently revoke the company's license to operate as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists. Symptoms of fungal meningitis can include headache, fever, nausea, stiff neck, weakness or numbness anywhere in the body, slurred speech, pain or swelling at the injection site and sensitivity to light, according to the CDC. Treatment, which can have toxic side effects, is expected to continue for infected patients for "many months," Dr. John Jernigan told reporters last month. He leads the CDC's meningitis outbreak clinical team.

chatgpt: A meningitis outbreak that has claimed the lives of dozens of people across the United States has sparked concerns over the safety and regulation of compounding pharmacies. The latest development in the ongoing saga involves UniFirst Corp., a company that has come under scrutiny for providing cleaning services to the New England Compounding Center, the compounding pharmacy at the center of the outbreak. UniFirst Corp. has acknowledged that it provided "once-a-month cleaning services" to the New England Compounding Center, but has called the pharmacy's claims that the company played a role in the outbreak "without merit." The information was disclosed in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which requires companies to disclose any legal disputes or potential liabilities. The filing does not provide any further details on UniFirst Corp.'s relationship with the New England Compounding Center or the extent to which the company may have played a role in the outbreak. However, it does suggest that the company may face legal action from victims or their families in the future. The outbreak has been linked to contaminated steroid injections produced by the New England Compounding Center, which were distributed to health clinics and hospitals across the country. As of the latest count, there have been 172 confirmed cases of meningitis and other infections, resulting in 14 deaths. The outbreak has sparked a nationwide investigation into compounding pharmacies, which are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional drug manufacturers. Compounding pharmacies, which produce customized medications for individual patients, have been subject to minimal federal oversight since a 1997 Supreme Court ruling determined that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not have the authority to regulate their practices. Instead, compounding pharmacies are regulated primarily at the state level, leading to varying degrees of oversight and accountability. The meningitis outbreak has prompted calls for increased federal oversight of compounding pharmacies, with some lawmakers calling for the FDA to be given more authority to regulate their practices. The agency has already issued warnings to several pharmacies, including the New England Compounding Center, and has initiated a nationwide inspection campaign to ensure that compounding pharmacies are operating safely and in compliance with the law. At the same time, victims of the outbreak and their families are pursuing legal action against the New England Compounding Center and other parties involved in the distribution and oversight of the contaminated medications. Some legal experts predict that the litigation could result in significant payouts, with some estimates placing the potential liability in the hundreds of millions of dollars. As for UniFirst Corp., the company's involvement in the outbreak may still be the subject of ongoing investigations and legal proceedings. The company's filing with the SEC suggests that it recognizes the potential risks involved, and is taking steps to protect itself from any potential legal liabilities. Despite the ongoing investigations and litigation, however, the focus remains on the victims and their families, who are grappling with the devastating consequences of the meningitis outbreak. As the investigation continues, the hope is that it will lead to increased accountability and oversight of compounding pharmacies, so that tragedies like this can be prevented in the future.
