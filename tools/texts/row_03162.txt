Jailed: Bodyguard Christopher Cooknell, 54, made threats to kill his boss and his family in order to secure a pay rise . A private security guard deliberately set out to make the family that employed him fear for their lives in a desperately cruel bid to win a pay rise and promotion. Christopher Cooknell, 54, sent an anonymous letter and a number of text messages to victim Daniel Holloway, threatening to kill him and his family. The sick threats terrified the family, who as a result promoted Cooknell and increased his salary. On Tuesday at Basildon Crown Court judge David Owen-Jones sentenced Cooknell to three years in jail after he had admitted at a previeous hearing to fraud and making threats to kill. After sentencing, Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Lucy Robinson, said: ‘Christopher Cooknell is a dangerous man in that he fails to fully comprehend the implications of his actions. ‘He has caused a great deal of suffering to the victim and his family by sending distressing text messages, and his actions have also resulted in two innocent men being arrested for no reason. ‘His motivation appears to be entirely for selfish financial gain and I have no doubt that had his text messages been allowed to continue he would have become increasingly greedy and sought to demand money from Mr Holloway. ‘Thankfully it never came to this, but I hope his sentence today reflects the seriousness of his actions.’ Cooknell, from Ryde on the Isle of Wight, was part of a security team first employed to help protect Mr Holloway’s family following an aggravated burglary at their family estate in Brentwood, Essex, in June 2009. In August 2011, Cooknell sent an anonymous letter threatening a further burglary, at gunpoint, at the home. The letter also resulted in the arrest of two innocent gardeners who he had falsely implicated in the original break-in. Cooknell has since admitted his part in sending the letter, which he had hoped would result in the gardeners being sacked. No evidence was found linking the gardeners to the burglary. Cooknell then went onto to send anonymous death threats in December last year 2012 from a mobile phone that police later traced back to him. Shameless Cooknell claimed the messages had simply been a ‘prank’ but later admitted making threats to kill and fraud.

chatgpt: Christopher Cooknell, a 54-year-old security worker, has been sentenced to three years in jail for sending death threats to Essex victim, Daniel Holloway. The threats, made over a period of months, resulted in Holloway receiving a promotion and pay rise from his employers. Cooknell's threats were not the end of his malicious actions, however. He also falsely implicated two innocent gardeners in a 2009 aggravated burglary at Holloway's estate, bringing harm to their reputations and causing them significant stress and anguish. The court heard that Cooknell had become obsessed with Holloway, believing him to have been responsible for the loss of his job at Holloway's former place of employment. Cooknell's behavior towards Holloway escalated to the point where he threatened to kill him, prompting Holloway to report the threats to the police. Judge John Lodge, who presided over the case at Basildon Crown Court, described Cooknell's actions as "appalling and utterly unacceptable." He went on to say that Cooknell had caused "significant harm" to both Holloway and the two innocent gardeners, who were mistakenly implicated in the burglary. The court also heard that Cooknell had a history of sending threatening messages to other people, including his own family members. His behavior was described as "obsessive and controlling," and he was said to have shown no remorse for his actions. In sentencing Cooknell to three years in jail, Judge Lodge noted that the threat of violence had been a "constant presence" in Holloway's life for months. He also praised Holloway's fortitude in speaking out against Cooknell's actions, saying that his courage had helped to bring Cooknell to justice. In a statement read out in court, Holloway thanked the police for their support and urged others who might be experiencing similar threats to "speak out and seek help." The case serves as a reminder of the serious consequences that can result from the misuse of technology and the internet to harass and threaten others. While social media and other digital technologies have the power to bring people together, they can also be used to spread hate and cause harm. As Judge Lodge stated during the trial, "it is high time society recognized the harm that can be done by those who misuse technology in this way." It is important for individuals to recognize the power and potential consequences of their online actions and to act responsibly and with respect towards others.
