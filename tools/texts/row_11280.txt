chatgpt: Former United States Air Force Academy cadet Jamil Cooks, who was kicked out of the military for rape in 2013, has joined the Alcorn State University Braves football team. The move has caused controversy, as there are currently no rules prohibiting sex offenders from participating in NCAA sports. In 2013, Cooks was found guilty of raping a fellow cadet at the Air Force Academy. He was discharged from the military and sentenced to two years in prison. After serving his sentence, Cooks enrolled at Alcorn State University and was recruited to play on the school's football team. The NCAA has guidelines preventing athletes with criminal records from participating in college sports, but these guidelines do not specifically address sex offenders. This has caused many to question whether the NCAA should reconsider their policies. Cooks' case is not the first time that a convicted sex offender has played college sports. In 2014, Washington State football player Darren Carrington was charged with misdemeanor sexual assault, but was allowed to continue playing. Similarly, former Brown University student and football player Daniel Koppen was convicted of sexual assault in 2003, but continued to play for the school. Many are calling for the NCAA to take a stronger stance against allowing sex offenders to participate in college sports. Advocates for victim's rights argue that allowing rapists and other sex offenders to play sends a troubling message to survivors. "Every time a convicted sex offender is allowed to play college sports, it sends a loud and clear message to survivors that their experiences and trauma don't matter", said Lisa Ryan, a victim's rights advocate. Others argue that athletes who have served their time should not be punished further by being banned from playing college sports. They also point out that the NCAA does not have jurisdiction over criminal matters and that it is up to individual schools to decide whether or not to admit a convicted sex offender. Despite the controversy, Cooks is expected to play for the Alcorn State Braves in the upcoming season. The school has not yet commented on the situation, but the team's head coach expressed excitement at having Cooks join the team. "We are thrilled to have Jamil Cooks as part of our team this year", said the coach. "He is a talented player and we believe he will be an asset to our program."
