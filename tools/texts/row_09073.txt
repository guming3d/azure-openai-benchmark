article: Washington (CNN) -- A jury was seated Friday in the trial of a man charged with the 2001 murder of Chandra Levy. Prosecutors, defense attorneys and the judge picked 12 women and four men -- four of the 16 are alternates -- to serve on the panel. The trial is expected to start Monday. Levy's disappearance nine years ago received widespread publicity because of her relationship with a congressman. The revelation contributed to the political downfall of California Democrat Gary Condit, who now may be called to the witness stand. Police said Condit was never a suspect in the case, although he was questioned intensively as investigators tried to find Levy, who vanished at the end of her federal internship at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Blog: Retracing Chandra Levy's steps . The man accused of her murder, Ingmar Guandique, is a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha. Authorities believe that he attacked Levy, 24, as she jogged in a park, killing her when she began to scream. Her remains were found more than a year later in a wooded area of D.C.'s Rock Creek Park. Guandique was sentenced in 2002 for attacking two other women in the same park. Years later, officials say, he admitted to fellow inmates that he had killed Levy. Defense attorneys have questioned the police investigation and, this week, wondered about a second man named in a FBI fingerprint memo prosecutors had just disclosed to Guandique's counsel. In that memo, both Guandique and the other man were cleared of any match in fingerprints lifted from a vehicle parked near the crime scene. Guandique denies that he committed the crime, and there is no physical evidence linking him to it, leaving prosecutors to base their case largely on his alleged jailhouse admission that he killed the young intern. The judge in the case struck a number of potential jurors this week without further questioning. They provided unacceptable answers on a 55-question survey the pool filled out Monday. Others were called in to further explain certain responses that could affect their ability to render a fair verdict. The judge's instructions and opening presentations in the trial are expected to begin Monday.

chatgpt: After nearly two decades since the disappearance of Chandra Levy, the trial for her murder is finally set to start on Monday. The man accused of the crime, Ingmar Guandique, has maintained his innocence and pled not guilty to the charges. Levy was an intern at the Federal Bureau of Prisons when she disappeared in 2001. Her disappearance sparked a nationwide search, with her family and friends pleading for her safe return. Unfortunately, her remains were discovered a year later in Rock Creek Park, leaving her loved ones devastated. The trial has been a long time coming, with various delays causing frustration and disappointment for Levy's loved ones. Guandique, who was convicted and sentenced to 60 years for her murder in 2010, was granted a new trial in 2015 after his attorneys raised concerns about the credibility of a key witness. According to reports, prosecutors plan to call an inmate who served time with Guandique to testify against him. The witness alleges that Guandique confessed to the murder while they were both serving time in a California prison. Guandique's defense team, on the other hand, intends to argue that he was wrongly accused and the witness is unreliable. Despite the passage of time, the case remains shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Levy's relationship with former Congressman Gary Condit was heavily scrutinized during the initial investigation, with rumors of an affair and potential involvement in her disappearance. Condit was never charged and has denied any involvement. With the trial set to begin next week, Levy's loved ones are hopeful that justice will finally be served. "It's been a long time coming," said Susan Levy, Chandra's mother. "We just want to see someone held accountable for what they did to our daughter." As the trial unfolds, the nation will be watching closely to see if justice will be served for Chandra Levy and her family.
