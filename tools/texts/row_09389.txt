article: (CNN) -- A man accused of kidnapping and holding captive three young women in his Cleveland house for 10 years will be arraigned this week on 329 counts. Ariel Castro, 52, was indicted Friday in a case that shocked neighbors who never suspected anything out of the ordinary was going on in the house -- and prompted Castro's daughter to call him "the most evil, vile, demonic criminal." One charge accuses Castro of aggravated murder for purposely causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy, authorities said. One of the young women was allegedly impregnated five times by Castro, and another bore a child fathered by him, police have said. The indictment charges Castro with 139 counts of rape, 177 counts of kidnapping, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, three counts of felonious assault and one count of possession of criminal tools, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said in a statement. The charges cover only half of the 10 years the three young were held captive -- from August 2002, when the first of three women disappeared off a Cleveland street, to February 2007. The three women were freed last month after one shouted for help while Castro was gone from the house. The prosecutor's capital review committee will consider whether the case is appropriate for seeking the death penalty once the indictment process is complete, the prosecutor's statement said. "Today's indictments represent a first major step in the criminal justice process,'' McGinty said in a statement. "Our investigation continues, and we will present our findings to the grand jury.'' 'Please don't let me go,' kidnapping victim told officers . The indictment alleges that Castro taped the legs and mouth of one woman identified as Jane Doe 2 and also chained her to a pole in the basement with a motorcycle helmet placed on her head. Castro also allegedly used a vacuum cord around her neck during a felonious assault and chained her to inside of a van, the indictment said. Castro allegedly used chains and tape in the basement to restrain another woman identified as Jane Doe 3, the indictment said.

Jim Wooley, attorney for Berry and DeJesus, and Kathy Joseph, attorney for Michelle Knight, expressed satisfaction with the indictment. "We have a great legal system, plus confidence and faith in the prosecutor's office and its decisions. Now, we need to stand back and let the judicial process unfold," the attorneys said in a statement. Rescued Cleveland women 'happy and safe,' attorneys say .

chatgpt: The attorneys of three young women who spent a decade held captive in the home of Ariel Castro have expressed "confidence and faith" in the prosecution efforts. The case, which has shocked and horrified the nation, has now reached its climactic phase as prosecutors unveiled the 329-count indictment against the accused. The indictment lists the use of chains, tape, and vacuum cord as tools Castro used to restrain and torture the women. The charges against the 52-year-old include 139 counts of rape, 177 counts of kidnapping, and one count of aggravated murder. The prosecutorâ€™s committee will subsequently decide whether or not to seek the death penalty which is highly possible given the horrific and heinous nature of the crimes. The murder charge stems from Castro's alleged purposeful termination of one of the pregnancies conceived by one of his victims, Michelle Knight. Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus were rescued on May 6th, when Berry summoned the courage to escape and alert authorities to their presence. The women had been held captive in Castro's Cleveland home for a decade, subjected to unimaginable cruelty and abuse during their confinement. Castro has appeared in court for his arraignment on Friday, July 12th. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges in the indictment, maintaining his innocence despite the overwhelming evidence against him. Castro's defense team has spoken out about the risks of staging such a highly publicized and emotional trial, suggesting that such a rush to judgment might negatively impact their client's right to a fair trial. Despite the defense's attempts to paint the prosecution as overly zealous and underhanded, the wider public has remained overwhelmingly supportive of the efforts to bring Castro to justice. Crowds gathered outside of Castro's home and the courthouse in the aftermath of the women's rescue, chanting slogans and rallying around a sense of communal outrage. The case has forced many people to confront the reality of sexual violence and exploitation in our society, and the government's response to these problems. Advocates for victims have lauded the bravery and resilience of the women who survived such a prolonged and traumatic experience. For the attorneys of the three women, the indictment and upcoming trial represent an important milestone in their pursuit of justice. "We have confidence and faith in the process," stated attorney James Wooley, " and we rely upon the courts to provide the justice that these women deserve."  As Castro prepares to stand trial for his horrific crimes, the nation waits in bated breath to see how justice will be served.
