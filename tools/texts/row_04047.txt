In his map, A History of Residential Contruction in the USA, scientist Seth Kadish has tracked the building of houses around the country from pre-1930s to now. The maps uses shades of purple and yellow to show when the most houses were built in a given county. The map shows that vast swathes of the country's homes in the West and Southeast were built in the 1900s, and even more in the Northeast and Midwest were built in the 1930s or before. Visual statistics: In the pale yellow counties, more homes were built pre-1930s than in any other period, and the darker counties have mostly modern structures . There are only two counties in the whole country in which houses from the 1940 predominate, Anderson County, Tennessee, and Cottle County, Texas. Three counties have predominantly homes built from 2005 to 2013: Cameron Parish, Louisiana, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana and Hancock COunty, Mississippi. Plaquemines Parish was one of three Louisiana towns most heavily hit by Hurricane Katrina, which explains its plurality of new homes. Hancock County was also severely struck. Cameron Parish was similarly decimated by Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ika in 2008. Home school: This graph shows the distribution of construction in another way . Seth Kadish says that according to his map, the typical county would have mostly houses built in the 1970s, then an even distribution of pre-1940, 1980s, and 1990s houses, then an even distribution of 1950s, 1960s, and post-2000 houses, and the smallest number of houses from the 1940s. Kadish said he became interested in the distribution of construction eras after he and his wife moved to Portland Oregan into a house built in 2006. Previously, the couple had lived in a 1930s condo in Providence, Rhode Island. Kadish's blog Vizual Statistix is an outlet for his 'passion for data visualization.'
highlights: New map uses statistics to show when the most houses were built in a given county . It shows that three towns hit by hurricanes have the most new homes and many parts of the Northeast and Midwest have primarily homes built in the 1930s or before .

chatgpt: A new map that shows the timing of when houses were built in a given county is providing some interesting insights into housing trends across the United States. The map, developed using statistical analysis, provides a clear picture of how different areas were developed over time and which homes are the newest. One of the most interesting things that the map shows is that three towns hit by hurricanes currently have the most new homes. These towns are located in the South and are still rebuilding after significant storm damage. This new construction is providing a boost to the local economy and real estate market. However, many parts of the Northeast and Midwest have primarily homes built in the 1930s or before. This suggests that these areas have an aging housing stock that may need significant repairs or upgrades in the coming years. The map also highlights areas where new construction is happening at a slower pace, potentially indicating a more sluggish local economy or housing market. While the map provides a lot of interesting data, it is important to remember that it is based on a single snapshot in time. Housing trends are constantly shifting and new developments are always being built. Still, the map provides a valuable tool for those looking to understand how certain areas have evolved over time and where new development is happening now. Real estate developers and home builders can use this information to make more informed decisions about where to focus their efforts. Meanwhile, homeowners and renters can use the map to better understand the housing market in their area and plan accordingly. Overall, the new map provides an interesting look at how housing trends have evolved across the United States over time. While it is by no means a comprehensive analysis of every housing market, it does offer valuable insights that can help guide future development and investment decisions.
