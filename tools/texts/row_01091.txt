Waitorse has apologised to a customer after a member of staff refused to fillet a trout because it was deemed 'too slippery'. The bizarre decision was branded the latest example of health and safety rules being misused. The unnamed female customer was visiting her local branch of the upmarket chain to buy a filleted trout. Apology: A member of staff working behind the fish counter at Waitrose refused to fillet a trout because it was 'too slippery' None were available pre-packed so she asked the assistant behind the fresh fish counter if he could fillet some from a whole fish. He agreed, but his supervisor stepped in and refused on the grounds of health and safety because the fish are 'too slippery'. On its website Waitrose says 'just ask if you'd like your fish skinned or filleted'. In another case, London publishing company owner Stuart Rock said that a butcher had refused to bone a leg of lamb for him. He said the assistant had said he was 'competent to do the job', but was not permitted on health and safety ground. The woman who was unable to have a trout filleted complained to the Health and Safety Executive and yesterday the watchdog's Myth Buster Panel ruled that she was in the right. In a statement the panel said: 'Whilst fish filleting requires the . person to know how to use knives safely, it is reasonable to expect this . service to be available at a fishmonger's counter in a supermarket . especially when the website advertises the service. 'Slippery fish are a . fact of life!' it added. Slippery customer: The Health and Safety Executive ruled Waitrose was in the wrong for refusing to fillet a trout . Judith Hackitt, Chair of the Health and . Safety Executive said: 'I'm glad the customer didn't fall for this red . herring. This is just another case of poor customer service and nothing to do . with health and safety.' Waitrose apologised for the inconvenience to its customers. A spokesman said: 'I'm afraid we don't . know which branch this refers to so we are unable to comment in detail. However, we do offer a full filleting service and we're very sorry that . we got it wrong on this occasion.'

chatgpt: In a bizarre incident at a local fishmonger, a customer's request to have a whole trout filleted by an assistant was overruled by a supervisor on the grounds of health and safety. According to eyewitnesses, the customer approached the fish counter and asked an assistant if he could have a whole trout filleted. The assistant was initially happy to oblige but was quickly intercepted by a supervisor who cited health and safety regulations as the reason for refusing the request. The supervisor argued that filleting a whole fish would be dangerous as fish can be "too slippery" and pose a risk to the safety of staff and customers. The customer was left frustrated and lodged a complaint with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). After an investigation into the matter, a panel ruled that the customer was in the right and that the supervisor's decision to refuse the request was unjustified. In response to the ruling, a spokesman for the HSE said that "slippery fish are a fact of life" and that "reasonable measures" should be taken to ensure that staff and customers are not put at risk. The spokesman went on to say that the HSE encourages businesses to be proactive in managing health and safety risks but that such measures should not be used to obstruct reasonable requests from customers. The incident has sparked a debate about the extent to which health and safety regulations should be applied in day-to-day situations. While many agree that safety should be a top priority, some argue that common sense should prevail and that regulations should not be used to deny reasonable requests. The fishmonger in question has since reviewed its health and safety procedures and has updated its policies to ensure that customer requests can be fulfilled safely. The assistant at the centre of the incident has also undergone additional training to enable him to fillet whole fish safely. In conclusion, it is clear that health and safety is an essential aspect of any business. However, in situations such as this, it is important to strike a balance between safety and customer satisfaction. With a greater emphasis on training and risk management, businesses can ensure that both staff and customers are protected without compromising on service.
