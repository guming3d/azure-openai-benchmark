chatgpt: Liverpool's full-back Jose Enrique has finally made his long-awaited return to the starting line-up after a psychologically tough period on the sidelines. The Spaniard played only eight league games last season before suffering a knee injury that forced him to miss the remainder of the campaign. Enrique made his first appearance for the Reds since November last year during their recent clash against Tottenham Hotspur. Speaking after the game, the 30-year-old revealed how difficult the past few months had been, but that he had now put the experience behind him and was ready to fight for his place in Jurgen Klopp's team. "It was a really tough time for me psychologically, being out injured for so long," said Enrique. "But I've worked really hard to get back to full fitness and I'm just happy to be back out on the pitch with my teammates. "I've missed playing football so much and it was great to be given the opportunity to play against Tottenham. I just want to continue working hard and fighting for my place in the team." Enrique's return to the Liverpool squad comes at a crucial time for the club, as they look to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League and advance in the Europa League. The full-back's experience and defensive skills will be invaluable to Klopp, who will be hoping to see his team make a strong end to the season. Despite being out of action for the majority of the 2015/16 campaign, Enrique remains a fan favourite at Liverpool and has received an outpouring of support from the club's supporters. "I've been overwhelmed by the messages of support I've received from the fans," he said. "They've been incredible throughout my time out injured and it means a lot to me to be able to play for this amazing club again." Enrique's return to fitness is a welcome boost for Liverpool, who have struggled with a number of injury setbacks this season. With the Spaniard now back in action, Klopp will be hoping his side can continue their push for a top-four finish and success in Europe.
