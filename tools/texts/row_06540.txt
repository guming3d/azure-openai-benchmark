article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Maybe even the criminals enjoy a slower pace of life in the countryside. Because this new police vehicle, a tractor with a top speed of just 20mph, would not be much use in pursuit. Unless, that is, the chase takes place across a muddy field. With flashing blue lights and police paintwork on the bonnet, Britain’s most rural police force yesterday unveiled their new patrol vehicle. Dyfed Powys Police officers stand next to the new vehicle they'll use to chase criminals, a tractor . Dyfed Powys Police hope the machine will improve their relationshops with rural communities in Mid and West Wales. Inspector Tim Davies said: ‘We're very impressed with this new piece of kit. ‘Engagement with our rural communities is important to us, and we want people to come and discuss any concerns they may have about rural crime.’ Officers will use the vehicle to visit farmers working their land and to access more remote parts of their policing area. Manchester police are considering buying two Segways to give officers 'greater visibility and accessibility' The tractor, it is hoped, will help police fight back against criminals who target farmers for their fuel supplies, livestock and high-tech machinery. In the last year thefts of farm machinery doubled and rural crime cost the UK economy more than £40million a year. Dyfed-Powys Police have set up a centre of excellence to improve rural policing after discovering the countryside was being neglected compared to cities. The force covers the largest police area in England and Wales – but has only 1,183 officers, the third smallest in England and Wales. The New Holland tractor, on loan to the force from a farm machinery company, was unveiled at the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show in Builth Wells, Mid Wales. Schoolboy Morgan Thompson, 13, of Merthyr Tydfil, said: ‘It is awesome – it may not be fast but it would frighten anyone being chased by it. ‘It looks great when the lights are flashing.’

chatgpt: A new weapon has been deployed in the fight against rural crime in the UK - a high tech tractor fitted with flashing blue lights, police paintwork, and the ability to reach speeds of 20 mph. With rural crime costing the British economy £40 million last year, local authorities have been looking for innovative new ways to tackle the problem. The tractor was developed in response to concerns about thefts of farm machinery and supplies, which have been on the rise in recent years. The tractor's blue lights and police paintwork are intended to deter would-be thieves, while its relatively slow speed makes it easier to identify and apprehend criminals. The vehicle is also equipped with a range of other security features, including GPS tracking and remote monitoring capabilities. According to local officials, the new tractor has already had a significant impact on crime rates in the area. Farmers have reported a marked decrease in the number of thefts and burglaries, and police have been able to use its surveillance capabilities to track down and arrest suspects. "The tractor has been a real game-changer in our efforts to combat rural crime," said one official. "Not only does it act as a visual deterrent, but it allows us to keep a close eye on farms and other vulnerable locations to ensure that criminals are caught and brought to justice." The success of the tractor has also led to calls for similar vehicles to be deployed in other parts of the country. Experts say that while rural crime is a complex problem that requires a range of different solutions, innovative technologies like the tractor offer a powerful new tool in the fight against criminals. But while the tractor may be effective at reducing rural crime, some farmers have raised concerns about its impact on their daily business. The vehicle's relatively slow speed and bulky design can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and some farmers have complained that its bright lights and loud sirens can scare livestock. Despite these concerns, however, it seems likely that the tractor will continue to play an important role in efforts to combat rural crime. With its cutting-edge technology and powerful capabilities, it offers a potent weapon in the fight against criminals who seek to prey on vulnerable communities.
