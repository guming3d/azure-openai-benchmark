article: NEW YORK (CNN) -- The crown of the Statue of Liberty will re-open to tourists on July 4, the Interior Department said Friday. The Statue of Liberty welcomes visitors, immigrants, and returning Americans. The crown was closed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, for safety and security reasons. The National Park Service closed the attraction amid worries that it would be difficult for visitors to evacuate quickly in the event of an emergency. Visitors must climb a narrow 168-step double-helix spiral staircase to get to the crown. Since the closing, tourists have been able to visit other parts of the statue. iReport.com: Show us your best Statue of Liberty shots . The federal government planned to give "America a special gift" by re-opening the crown, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said. "We are once again inviting the public to celebrate our great nation and the hope and opportunity it symbolizes by climbing to Lady Liberty's crown for a unique view of New York Harbor, where the forebears of millions of American families first saw the world," he said in a statement. Access to the crown will be limited to 10 people at a time, guided by a National Park Service ranger. "We cannot eliminate all the risk of climbing to the crown, but we are taking steps to make it safer," Salazar said. The measures include raising the handrails on the spiral staircase and stationing rangers throughout the Statue to help visitors. The Statue of Liberty will be open for the next two years, then closed again for "work on a long-term solution that will improve safety and security permanently," according to the U.S. Department of the Interior. A gift from France to the United States, the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886, designated as a National Monument in 1924 and restored for its centennial on July 4, 1986. It stands just across New York Harbor from where the Twin Towers stood.

chatgpt: After almost two decades of being closed to the public, the crown of the Statue of Liberty is set to reopen to a select few visitors. The iconic landmark, which has welcomed millions of visitors since its dedication in 1886, has had limited access since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. While tourists have been able to visit other parts of the statue, such as the pedestal and the observation deck, the crown has remained off-limits due to security concerns. However, the National Park Service announced that visitors will be able to climb up to the crown again in the near future, albeit with some significant changes. According to officials, access to the crown will be limited to just 10 people at a time, and they will have to be guided by a ranger. This new policy is designed to ensure the safety of visitors and to minimize the impact on the statue's structure. Visitors will have to make a reservation to access the crown and go through a security screening process as well. The decision to reopen the crown was made in part because of the government's desire to give "America a special gift". The National Park Service hopes that this renewed access will help to showcase the statue's enduring significance as a symbol of freedom and hope. The reopening of the crown has been widely anticipated by both visitors and locals alike. Many have expressed their excitement at being able to climb up to the top once again and experience the spectacular views of New York Harbor and the surrounding area. However, some have also raised concerns about the potential impact on the statue itself. Over the years, the statue has undergone significant wear and tear, and the reopening of the crown could accelerate this process. The National Park Service has assured the public that they are taking all necessary precautions to protect the statue's structure. All in all, the reopening of the crown is a welcome development for those who have longed to experience the true majesty of the Statue of Liberty. While the experience will be more limited than in the past, the chance to climb up to the top of this iconic landmark is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
