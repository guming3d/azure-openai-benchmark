article: (CNN) -- A judge Thursday preliminarily seized Aaron Hernandez's Massachusetts home while a wrongful death lawsuit against the former NFL star is pending. Bristol Superior Court Judge Richard Moses made the ruling during a hearing on Hernandez's finances in connection with a lawsuit filed by the family of Odin Lloyd, whom the ex-New England Patriot tight end is accused of killing, according to court documents. Charles Rankin, Hernandez's attorney, did not object but asked the court to reconsider the matter. At the hearing, lawyers for the Patriots said the team would not pay Hernandez the $3.25 million that the NFL Players Association has said the player is owed. An attorney for the Patriots said that it could take several months for the matter of payment to be settled. Hernandez had an NFL contract worth nearly $40 million, but it was terminated when he was charged with the slaying and firearm offenses.

The wrongful death lawsuit, filed Monday, claims Hernandez "maliciously, willfully, wantonly, recklessly or by gross negligence" caused the death of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder in the June shooting of his friend Lloyd, 27, a Boston-area semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend. CNN's calls to Hernandez's attorney were not immediately returned. Prosecutors told CNN that Hernandez allegedly planned and carried out the slaying: Lloyd was shot five times with a semi-automatic .45-caliber handgun. A grand jury investigating allegations of gun trafficking against Hernandez is the same one that handed up the murder charge, a source told CNN in October. Who was Odin Lloyd? A witness whom sources have described as Hernandez's "muscle man" said he was with the ex-Patriot the night of a 2012 double homicide in Boston. Police have said that the homicide may be linked to Hernandez, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. That witness, Alexander Bradley, has filed a civil lawsuit accusing Hernandez of shooting him in the face during an argument after they left a Florida strip club in February. Bradley lost sight in one eye because of the shooting, according to the lawsuit. Attorneys for the Patriots and the Lloyd family did not return CNN's calls.

chatgpt: Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez's home in Massachusetts has been preliminarily seized by the state. The move comes after a judge ordered the seizure while a wrongful death lawsuit against Hernandez is pending. The seizure means that if Hernandez is found guilty of wrongdoing, his home may be used to pay his debts, including the wrongful death claim against him. Hernandez, who was a star tight end for the New England Patriots, was convicted of murder in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. He was accused of killing Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e. Hernandez had appealed his conviction, but it was dismissed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 2017. In addition to the wrongful death lawsuit, the NFL Players Association has said that Hernandez is owed $3.25 million by the New England Patriots. The Patriots have stated that they will not pay Hernandez the money, as he was released by the team in 2013, before he was arrested for Lloyd's murder. The NFL Players Association has filed a grievance over the matter, which is still pending. Hernandez's home, which is located in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, is a valuable asset that could be used to satisfy any legal judgments against him. The home is assessed at over $1 million, and features a swimming pool, home theater, and other luxurious amenities. Legal experts say that the preliminary seizure of Hernandez's home gives the state an opportunity to gain control of his assets, including any money that he may have in bank accounts or investments. This could make it easier for the plaintiffs in the wrongful death lawsuit to collect damages if they win their case. In the meantime, Hernandez remains in prison, serving a life sentence for murder. He has been able to keep in touch with his family and friends through letters and phone calls, but has had little contact with the outside world. Hernandez's story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of fame and the importance of making good choices in life.
