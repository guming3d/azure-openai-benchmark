article: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho berated the Stamford Bridge crowd in the wake of his side's narrow 2-1 victory over QPR, describing the match as 'like playing in an empty stadium'. The Blues continued their unbeaten start to the Premier League season after a second-half penalty from Eden Hazard secured the win, but Mourinho was critical of the crowd in the aftermath of the game. 'Everyone knows how much I feel connected to this club and the fans,' heÂ told talkSPORT. 'At this moment it's difficult for us to play at home though, because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium.

Charlie Austin provided a scare with his equaliser in the second half of the match . 'The team then starts playing like it's a quiet, soft game at home. It's difficult to get that strong start where the players, team and fans at Stamford Bridge [are all together]. 'I was today looking around and it was empty, but not in terms of people because it was obviously full. That's what is frustrating.' Chelsea went 1-0 up in the first half through Oscar, but were given a scare when Charlie Austin equalised for the away side in the second half. Mourinho also believes that the floodlights were not switched on as early as was necessary, leaving Stamford Bridge darker than it should have been until two minutes before Oscar's winning goal. 'I think the man responsible for the lights was in the same mood as the crowd, because everybody was sleeping,' Mourinho added. 'He took 20 minutes to understand that it was dark, but I took 30 minutes to understand that the stadium was not empty. 'When we scored was when I realised, "woah, the stadium is full. Good."'

chatgpt: Chelsea emerged victorious over their west London neighbors QPR in a closely-contested derby on Sunday. The Blues secured a hard-fought 2-1 victory in front of a packed Stamford Bridge crowd. Despite the win, Chelsea's boss, Jose Mourinho, was not entirely pleased with his team's performance. The Portuguese manager was clearly unhappy with the crowd at Stamford Bridge, and he didn't hesitate to express his frustration after the match. Mourinho berated the home fans for their lack of enthusiasm and described the match as 'like playing in an empty stadium.' He even went so far as to claim that it wasn't a true derby because the atmosphere was lacking. "Normally, we have amazing supporters, but today we had unbelievable support. In the beginning of the game, the players were waiting for a reaction. And it looked like we were playing in an empty stadium," Mourinho said. The Chelsea boss's comments are sure to raise eyebrows among the club's supporters, who are known for their passion and dedication to the team. However, Mourinho was not entirely wrong in his assessment of the Stamford Bridge crowd on Sunday. Despite Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season, there was a noticeable lack of energy in the stadium throughout the match. The team's supporters were slow to react to the action on the field, and there was a distinct lack of noise and chanting. Despite Mourinho's criticisms, Chelsea will be pleased to have secured another victory in what is turning out to be a promising season. The Blues have been in fine form so far this campaign and are currently sitting near the top of the Premier League table. QPR, on the other hand, will be disappointed to have come up short in such a closely-contested match. The west London side put in a solid performance and looked dangerous at times, but ultimately they were unable to find the back of the net when it mattered. Overall, it was a hard-fought west London derby that will no doubt be remembered by fans of both Chelsea and QPR. While Mourinho's criticisms of the home crowd may have raised a few eyebrows, there is no denying that the Blues will be delighted to have secured another valuable three points.
