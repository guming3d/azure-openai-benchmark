Autumn is set to be late this year, but when it arrives it should bring a bumper crop of fruits and berries in the countryside, wildlife experts have said. The autumn fruiting is expected to be delayed as a result of the late spring, but the recent warm weather means wild berry crops will flourish, according to early data collected by the public for the Woodland Trust’s nature’s calendar project. The promise of a bumper autumn is good news for wildlife, which suffered in the face of exceptionally poor crops of wild fruit last year when trees and shrubs were affected by the washout summer, and then were hit by this spring’s cold snap. Great expectations: Woodland Trust research shows that records for 16 species of trees and shrubs show that 14 of them, including beech (pictured) had their worst season for fruiting in the past decade, last year . Records for 16 species of trees and shrubs collected since 2001 show that 14 including beech, holly and brambles or blackberries last year saw their worst season for fruiting since the turn of the century, with many recording only meagre crops. Dr Kate Lewthwaite, the nature’s calendar project manager, said: 'Although our records suggest that autumn fruiting will be late this year due to the delayed onset of spring flowering, if the warm weather interspersed with occasional wet spells continues, this should mean the fruiting of shrubs like bramble, rowan and blackthorn is abundant. 'Wildlife species will no doubt benefit from a bumper crop, and finally fruit-eating birds and mammals will be able to enjoy an autumn feast. Bountiful: A bumper crop of blackberries and holly berries are expected this Autumn . Last year, birds and mammals suffered some of the poorest fruiting crop in years and this, coupled with the prolonged cold snap in spring, meant that many species had to endure a long period without a decent food supply.' She urged members of the public to take part in the nature’s calendar scheme to record the changing of the seasons, which helps experts understand how wildlife is adapting to the changing environment. The number of citizen recorders has been falling year on year, and the Woodland Trust wants more people to sign up to contribute to the project which has records dating back to the 17th century.

chatgpt: Autumn fruiting this year is expected to be relatively delayed due to a late spring, according to experts. In contrast, the big crop is expected because of summer’s heatwave. Farmers are observing the changes in the climate, which have been caused by global warming.  The autumn fruit season has always been eagerly anticipated by farmers, and it usually starts from August onwards. This year, however, the experts have predicted that the season may start a few weeks later. The actual dates for the start of the fruit season vary depending on where the farms are located, but the general delay is expected across the country. It is believed that this delay was caused by an unusually late spring this year, which has affected the growth cycle of various fruits.  In spite of the delay in the fruiting season due to the late spring, farmers are expecting to reap a big crop this year. This is because summer this year was hot, which has been a significant factor in the ripening of fruits, particularly for apples, raspberries, and blackberries. While, organic fruit farmers struggle when extreme weather conditions such as drought, these hot temperatures and the subsequent dry conditions have actually been beneficial to most fruit crops. It was observed that the hot weather accelerated the maturation of many of the fruits, which would have a positive impact on their quality and yield.  Despite the delay, the farmers are still optimistic about the harvest, and they are already preparing for the busy autumn. Many farmers have invested in workers, upgraded machinery, and taken steps to ensure that the fruits will be picked, packed, and shipped on time. After all, autumn fruits are a significant source of revenue, and delaying the season even further could impact the farmers' economic situation.  However, it is essential to remember that the weather conditions can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk of inclement weather that can affect the harvest. In case of an early frost or snowfall, the farmers may have to take preventive measures such as covering the fruit trees and plants with tarpaulins or moving the fruits to safety indoors. The threat of a poor harvest hangs over the farmers' heads throughout the season, and they are always prepared for the worst.  In summary, autumn fruiting this year may be delayed due to the late spring. Still, the farmers are hoping for a big crop, thanks to the hot summer. They are gearing up for a busy autumn to ensure that the fruits are harvested, packed, and shipped on time. Though there is always some risk to a harvest, the farmers are optimistic and hopeful about the coming season.
