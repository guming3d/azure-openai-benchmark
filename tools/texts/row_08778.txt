article: A stick insect measuring almost two feet long has been discovered by biologists in a remote jungle in Vietnam. Entomologists working for the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences have announced the discovery of two new species and one subspecies of Phasmatodea - the scientific name for stick insects - found during their expeditions in the country's remote forests. The giant insect has also entered the record books - it is officially the second-largest stick insect ever found. The subspecies, named Phryganistria heusii yentuensis (pictured), was found in a Vietnamese nature reserve northeast of the capital Hanoi . Entomologist Joachim Bresseel pictured with the enormous stick insect as it dangles from his hand . Measuring 32cm in length or 54cm with its legs spread, Phryganistria heusii yentuensis is closer in appearance to a small branch than a stick. It is second in size only to a stick insect found in Borneo which measures more than 56cm with its legs outstretched. The record breaking insect was found in the Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve, 150km northeast of the Vietnam capital Hanoi. Researchers found it during an expedition launched after they realised stick insects in Vietnam remain vastly understudied in scientific records. Their method in capturing the insects was also remarkably basic - they beat trees with a pole until the insects fell to the ground. Stick insects are mostly active at night and are adept at mimicking the form of sticks and leaves - even performing a rocking motion similar to that of a stick blowing in the wind. The discovery is considered a giant step towards documenting the various types located in Vietnam, where only 70 species have so far been recorded. Scientists responsible for the latest discovery alone collected hundreds during their recent expeditions, which need to be named and categorised - giving an indication as to the vast numbers yet to be discovered. The insect was found in the Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve, located in northern Vietnam (pictured) Measuring 54cm in length, the insect takes on the appearance of a small branch when in the wild .

They are herbivores that feed on leaves, but are subject to predation themselves which they combat using a number of different defence mechanisms. These include changing colours to suit their background like that of a chameleon, mimicking a branch in the wind by slowly swaying back and forth, or simply playing dead. Stick insects are also known for remarkably long periods of copulation - some species have been known to remain paired for several months.

chatgpt: A newly-discovered stick insect, measuring 54cm in length when its front legs are outstretched, has been named as the second-largest insect of its kind on the planet. The giant creature was found in a Vietnamese nature reserve located 150km northeast of the capital city Hanoi. The discovery was made by a team of international scientists led by Dr. Joachim Bresseel from Belgium's Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. The scientists were conducting a survey of the nature reserve's insect population when they stumbled upon the giant stick insect. Dr. Bresseel described the discovery as "spectacular" and said that the team was "amazed" by the creature's size. The previous record holder for the world's second-largest stick insect was a species found in Borneo, which measures 32cm in length. The newly-discovered stick insect has been named Phryganistria tamdaoensis, after the Tam Dao mountain range where it was found. The insect's long, slender body is colored in shades of green and brown, allowing it to blend in seamlessly with the forest environment. Stick insects, also known as phasmids, are insects of the order Phasmatodea. They are characterized by their elongated bodies and legs that resemble sticks or twigs, allowing them to camouflage themselves against predators. Stick insects are found in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world and are a common sight in rainforests. Dr. Bresseel said that the discovery of P. tamdaoensis highlights the importance of preserving the natural habitats of these insects. "We are still discovering new species of stick insects, which shows that there is still much we don't know about these remarkable creatures," he said. The Vietnamese government has already taken steps to protect the Tam Dao nature reserve, which is home to a wealth of unique and endangered species. However, the reserve is increasingly threatened by deforestation, wildlife trafficking and other human activities. Conservation efforts are needed to ensure that creatures like P. tamdaoensis continue to thrive in their natural habitats. The discovery of P. tamdaoensis has generated widespread excitement among the scientific community and nature enthusiasts alike. The giant stick insect is a testament to the incredible diversity of life on this planet, and a reminder of the need to protect and preserve the natural world for future generations.
