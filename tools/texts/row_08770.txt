chatgpt: Identical twin brothers Mohammed and Aftab Asghar, 22, have been charged with rape, according to police sources. The alleged incident reportedly took place in the early hours of the morning on a quiet residential street in a suburb of Birmingham, UK. The brothers were arrested after DNA evidence was linked to the alleged crime, which suggests that one or both of them was involved. The alleged victim, whose identity has not been released by police, is said to be in her late teens. According to a statement by police, the victim was attacked by one of the brothers, while the other one looked on. They both then fled the scene in a car, which was later found abandoned several kilometres away. The investigation is ongoing, and police are appealing for witnesses to come forward. The Asghar brothers were remanded in custody, and their next court appearance is scheduled for next month. News of the charges has shocked their local community, which has known the twins since they were born. They are said to be well-liked, and many of their friends and relatives have spoken out in defence of their characters. However, there has been widespread condemnation of their alleged actions, with many people expressing outrage at the thought of two brothers working together to commit such a heinous crime. Some experts on criminal behaviour have commented that identical twins may be more susceptible to committing crimes together due to their close bond and shared experiences. However, this remains a hotly debated topic within the scientific community. In response to the charges, a spokesperson for the UK's Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology unit commented that "while it is true that identical twins may have some genetic predisposition towards certain types of behaviour, the vast majority of twins lead happy and law-abiding lives." Whatever the outcome of the ongoing investigation, this case is likely to ignite further discussion around the relationship between genetics, behaviour, and criminal activity.
