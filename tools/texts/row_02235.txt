This abnormality made the boys' lives difficult from the beginning, as they faced several challenges due to their condition. However, at just two months old, the twins underwent a successful surgery at a hospital in D.C. that separated the two, giving them a newfound sense of independence. The procedure was a delicate one, lasting several hours, but ultimately proved to be a resounding success.
