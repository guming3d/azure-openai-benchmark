article: By . Emma Innes . Long-term use of commonly prescribed heartburn drugs increases the likelihood B vitamin deficiency . Long-term use of commonly prescribed heartburn drugs increases the likelihood B vitamin deficiency, a study has shown. Lack of vitamin B12 can increase the risk of dementia, nerve damage, anaemia and other conditions, some of which may be irreversible. Scientists who studied a large population of U.S. patients found an association between taking some antacid medications and diagnosis vitamin B12 deficiency. Stomach acids are known to aid vitamin B12 absorption. Suppressing the acids, to combat heartburn and acid reflux, or treat ulcers, may lead to a health-threatening lack of the vitamin in the body, the researchers believe. The study is the first large population-based investigation linking vitamin B12 deficiency to antacid drugs known as protein pump inhibitors (PPIs). Examples of these medications include esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole. Researchers from Kaiser Permanente, a leading U.S. health provider, compared data on almost 26,000 patients diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency in northern California with more than 184,000 ‘control’ patients who were not B12 deficient. ‘Patients who took PPI medications for more than two years had a 65 per cent increase in their risk of B12 deficiency,’ said study leader Dr Douglas Corley, a gastroenterologist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research. ‘Higher doses also were associated with an increased risk, compared with lower doses. ‘Kaiser Permanente's electronic health records allowed us to look at what happens in the real world for these commonly used medications.’ Among the vitamin deficient patients, 12 per cent had used antacids for at least two years. A related class of antacid drugs called histamine-2-receptor agonists (H2RAs) were also associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, but to a lesser extent. Lack of vitamin B12 can increase the risk of dementia, nerve damage, anaemia and other conditions, some of which may be irreversible . The findings are reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr Corley added: ‘This research raises the question of whether people who are taking acid-depressing medications long term should be screened for vitamin B12 deficiency. ‘It's a relatively simple blood test, and vitamin supplements are an effective way of managing the vitamin deficiency, if it is found.’

chatgpt: Antacids are a common medication taken by millions of people worldwide to combat heartburn and other digestive issues. However, a recent study has shown that their long-term use can lead to serious vitamin B12 deficiencies, which in turn can increase the risk of dementia, nerve damage, and anaemia. The study, conducted by researchers from the Kaiser Permanente Institute in California, found that antacid drugs such as esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and omeprazole suppress stomach acids that are crucial for the absorption of vitamin B12. This vitamin is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system and the production of red blood cells. The research shows that people who take these drugs for more than two years have a 65% increased risk of B12 deficiency. This is a worrying statistic, considering that heartburn is a common issue that often requires long-term treatment. Dr. Douglas Corley, one of the authors of the study, warns that "people who have been taking acid-suppressing medications for a long time should talk to their doctor about checking their vitamin B12 levels. Even a slightly low vitamin B12 level can cause problems with cognition and memory." The symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can range from mild to severe and can include fatigue, weakness, numbness, tingling, memory loss, and difficulty concentrating. If left untreated, it can lead to irreversible nerve damage and even dementia. The researchers analyzed the medical records of over 200,000 patients who were prescribed antacid drugs between 1997 and 2011. They found that those who took the drugs for two or more years were more likely to develop B12 deficiency than those who took them for shorter periods. The study highlights the importance of monitoring vitamin B12 levels in patients who take antacids for prolonged periods. Doctors may need to consider supplementing their patients with B12, especially if they are elderly or have a history of neurological disorders. In conclusion, antacids may provide relief from heartburn and other digestive issues, but their long-term use can have serious consequences. The risk of B12 deficiency should not be overlooked, as it can lead to irreversible damage to the nervous system and cognitive decline. Patients should talk to their doctors about the risks and benefits of these medications and consider alternative solutions if possible.
