chatgpt: A 17-year-old girl from Kentucky has been charged with poisoning her grandmother and a family friend, according to court documents filed on Thursday. Tyt'ana Lisa-Nicole Johnson will be tried as an adult on two counts of attempted murder. Authorities believe that Johnson mixed medication into glasses of juice that her grandmother, Gaylon Moody, and a family friend drank. Both individuals became ill and were hospitalized, but they have since been released. According to court documents, Johnson told police that she was angry with her grandmother for taking away her cellphone as a punishment. She allegedly wanted to get back at Moody and a family friend for not believing her when she said that she had lost the phone, and she thought that poisoning them would be an effective way to do so. Johnson was arrested on Tuesday, and a juvenile court judge subsequently ordered that the case be transferred to adult court. She is being held at a juvenile detention center without bond. Johnson's family members have expressed shock over the incident, describing her as a kind and loving young woman who had never been in trouble with the law before. They said that they are struggling to understand why she would do something like this. Moody, Johnson's grandmother, said that she was grateful to be alive and that she had never expected her granddaughter to do something like this. She said that she hopes Johnson receives the help that she needs to turn her life around. The case has raised questions about the handling of juvenile crimes and whether minors should be tried as adults in certain cases. Some advocates argue that children and adolescents should not be subject to the same criminal justice system as adults, and that they need specialized services and support to address underlying issues such as trauma, mental health problems, and substance abuse. Others contend that crimes like Johnson's warrant more severe punishment and that juvenile court systems are not equipped to handle such cases effectively. They point to research showing that violent crime committed by juveniles is relatively rare but can have devastating consequences for victims and communities. Johnson's trial is expected to take place later this year, and she could face decades in prison if convicted of attempted murder.
