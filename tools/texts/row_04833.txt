Wen Kao, 29, was walking home when his umbrella was struck by a bolt of lightning, setting his clothes on fire. Despite being left with burns across his body, medics say he will live. The incident occurred during the height of the storm, when the winds were roaring and the sky was filled with thunder and lightning.

Fortunately, some people nearby rushed to his aid, using their own clothing and water to put out the flames. Kao was then taken to the hospital for treatment. Doctors say he suffered burns across his body, including his face, arms, and torso. But he is expected to recover fully and won't have any permanent damage.
