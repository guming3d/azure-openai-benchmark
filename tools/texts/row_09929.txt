chatgpt: Germany has been hit by severe storms causing destruction and fatalities across the country. In Duesseldorf, three people, two men, and a woman, were killed when a large tree toppled onto them. The tragedy occurred as strong winds buffeted the city, bringing down several trees and causing widespread power outages. Meanwhile, in Cologne and Krefeld, two bicyclists lost their lives after being struck by falling tree branches in separate incidents.

Additionally, in Essen, a man died while clearing debris from a street near midnight. The man, whose identity has not been disclosed, is believed to have suffered a heart attack triggered by the stress and exertion of the clean-up operation. The storm front that caused the fatalities has now moved further northeast, prompting weather warnings in regions including Hanover and Bremen. The German Weather Service has issued alerts, warning of strong gusts of up to 70 kilometers per hour and heavy rainfall. The warning advises residents to keep away from exposed areas and to stay indoors as much as possible. The severe weather has also caused significant disruption to travel, with many flights and train services delayed or canceled.

The authorities have urged festival-goers to be vigilant and to follow all safety advice to avoid accidents during the festivities. In conclusion, the recent spate of severe weather has highlighted the dangers of extreme weather conditions and the importance of staying safe during storms.
