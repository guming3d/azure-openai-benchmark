article: (CNN) -- The latest chapter in British retail has grocery giant Tesco betting on e-books: it's buying Mobcast, a company that brings books to wireless devices. The deal, worth about $7.15 million (Â£4.5 million), is small for Tesco, which is one of the biggest food retailers in the world. But it's still significant: it marks the next page in Britain's digital transformation. When he co-founded Mobcast five years ago, Tony Lynch, the company's CEO, says books weren't represented on wireless devices beyond offerings from online retailer Amazon.com. "It was a very valuable hole in the market," he says. Now, with Mobcast's more than 100,000 titles and counting, Tesco will allow consumers to buy and read books on an array of devices, from smartphones to e-readers. And it also marks another avenue for the retailer to find out more about its customers - information Tesco can use to fine tune its targeted ads and, ultimately, sell more products. "Arguably, Tesco has the best data in the world on its customers," says Michael Comish, CEO of Tesco Digital Entertainment. He points to a robust retail loyalty program that helps the company keep track of customers' shopping habits. "They (Tesco) have extensive data about purchase behavior and information about the customers." Experts say that expanding its digital portfolio will allow Tesco to enhance that consumer data for years to come. "Getting into the electronic purchase cycle of a family, whether it's for books or something else, gets you in much more regular touch with them than if they were just buying a physical product," says Sree Sreenivasan, Chief Digital Officer of Columbia University. "This makes sense to have a whole digital portfolio." Comish came to Tesco by way of Blinkbox, another digital player in the Tesco empire. The retailer bought the video-on-demand provider last year. "Part of Tesco's strategy is to acquire talent," he says. Tesco also bought the Internet radio service radio service WE7 earlier this year.

chatgpt: British supermarket giant Tesco has just made a major move to strengthen its position in the digital sphere, with the acquisition of the e-book company Mobcast. The deal, worth just over $7 million, will give Tesco the opportunity to offer its customers access to a wide range of digital books, to be read on a variety of devices. According to a statement from Tesco, the company plans to integrate Mobcast’s digital book platform into its existing range of digital services, which includes cinema streaming, music downloads, and online shopping. The company sees the move as a way to further improve its competitiveness in the online consumer market, by offering value-added services that customers increasingly expect from their retailers. Experts are predicting that the acquisition of Mobcast will also be a significant boost to Tesco’s capacity for collecting consumer data. This data can provide valuable insight into customer behavior and preferences, which can be used to inform decisions around pricing, promotions, and product development. By expanding its digital portfolio, Tesco is positioning itself to be able to gather more and better data on its customers than ever before. The acquisition of Mobcast is also an opportunity for Tesco to tap into the growing market for digital books. As e-readers and tablets become increasingly common, many people are turning to digital books as a more convenient and affordable alternative to traditional hard copies. By offering a range of digital books alongside its other digital services, Tesco is hoping to attract new customers and retain existing ones. The move has been met with a positive response from industry experts, who see it as a savvy strategic move for Tesco. “By acquiring Mobcast, Tesco is broadening the range of digital services it offers to customers, and also gaining access to valuable consumer data,” commented one analyst. “It’s a smart move that should help Tesco remain competitive in the online marketplace.” For the time being, Tesco has not announced any specific plans for how it will integrate Mobcast into its operations, or what types of digital books it will offer. However, with the acquisition now complete, customers can expect to see a wider range of digital products and services from Tesco in the near future.
