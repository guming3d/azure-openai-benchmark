article: London (CNN) -- They've long been man's best friend, but now dogs with one British police force can hound criminals in a new way thanks to "FidoCam," a digital video camera that straps to the canine's head. Staffordshire Police says it is the first force in the country to use the new technology with its dogs. The hi-tech digital camera will send back pictures to a color monitor watched by the dog's handlers. "This bit of kit is fantastic -- it attaches to the dog's head and we can get a live view of what they are seeing," said Insp. Chris Dawson, of Staffordshire Police's Dog Support Unit.

The cameras will be particularly useful when canine crimefighters are sent into places where it's unsafe or difficult for their human counterparts to go. "For example, when searching for a dangerous person we can send the dog into a building with the camera to search for them, when they indicate a find by barking we will be able to see exactly what or who they have found," said Dawson. "It will also be extremely useful when searching difficult or inaccessible areas for missing people -- a dog can make its way through dense woodland and undergrowth very quickly. While the handler will maintain verbal contact with the dog this camera will allow them to search vast areas a lot faster." Blog: Canines crimefighters -- when a dog isn't a dog . Fleeing suspects who are pursued by a police dog may also find their efforts to escape are caught on film. Police dogs have previously been equipped with analogue cameras with a limited range but the new technology will mean they can send back a much clearer image from further away, police said. The footage can be recorded and used as evidence in court, police said. CNN's Alexander Felton contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Police in Staffordshire have found a new way to search dangerous and difficult locations with the help of their furry four-legged friends. A digital video camera is being strapped to the heads of specially trained police dogs so that officers can watch footage of their searches live via a monitor. The innovative new technology is proving to be a game-changer when it comes to rapid response and efficient searching. The Staffordshire police have already tested the technology and have been amazed by the results. The police dogs successfully sent back high-quality images from areas where it was too dangerous or difficult for human officers to go. The dogs can be used to search vast areas quickly, and with the new camera technology, they are set to become even more efficient when it comes to their duties. "This camera will allow them to search vast areas a lot faster," said a police dog handler. "It gives them the freedom to move around without the need for a handler right next to them. We can monitor their movements and see what they see in real-time." The clarity of the video footage from the dogâ€™s camera has proven to be an unexpected bonus to the police force. It is now possible to see things that were previously impossible to view. This is particularly useful in cases where a suspect has fled on foot, and the search area is expansive. The dogs are now able to cover the larger area speedily, and the footage can be monitored back at the station in real-time.  "As soon as we know it's too dangerous to go in, due to the potential threat of explosion or collapse, then the dogs can go in with the camera," said a spokesperson for Staffordshire police. "They are a real asset to our team and make our work a lot safer." The police dogs with the new digital video technology have already been deployed in a number of emergency situations, and it is expected that their popularity among the force will continue to grow. The use of special digital camera harnesses for animals is relatively new, but with the successes described by the Staffordshire police, it is possible this innovative idea could begin to spread to other police forces across the country.
