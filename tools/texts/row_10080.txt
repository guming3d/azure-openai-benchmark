A benefits cheat was jailed after investigators discovered he was a property developer who owned land in the South of France.

A court heard Kemp-Philp and his wife Christine, 60, had nine different bank accounts in the UK and one in France. But the businessman only declared one of the accounts and kept his land in France a secret from the authorities. Prosecutor Christian Jowell said: 'Kemp-Philp received incapacity benefit and submitted applications for housing, council tax and pension credit benefits. 'However he was not entitled to the benefits because he had owned land in France since the early 2000s which he had not declared. 'When he sold the land he did not declare the income.' Cardiff Crown Court heard Kemp-Philp also failed to declare taking out a £25,000 loan from Lloyds TSB and gaining £13,000 from the sale of a property. Kemp-Philp, of Newport, south Wales, initially claimed he used the money from the sale to pay back debts and thought the land in France was 'worthless'.

chatgpt: Gwyn Kemp-Philp, a 69-year-old man from the UK, has been sentenced to four months in jail after being found guilty of 10 charges of false representation. Mr. Kemp-Philp failed to declare nine bank accounts and a property in the south of France to authorities, while falsely claiming £41,000 in state benefits. Prosecutors argued that Gwyn Kemp-Philp was "systematically dishonest." They claimed that he was aware of his legal obligation to declare all assets and sources of income, but he chose to withhold information from the authorities. The prosecution also showed that Mr. Kemp-Philp had used his false claims to purchase various luxury items, including a gold bracelet and a Rolex watch. The court heard that in 2015, Mr. Kemp-Philp had applied for state benefits, claiming that he had no substantial savings, property or investments. However, an investigation by the authorities revealed that the man had nine undisclosed bank accounts, one of which had over £153,000 in savings. Furthermore, Mr. Kemp-Philp is also said to have owned a property in the south of France worth approximately £200,000, which he also failed to declare. The prosecution stated that his actions were a "breach of trust" and had "caused harm to the public purse." After a lengthy trial, Mr. Kemp-Philp was found guilty of 10 charges of false representation, including failure to declare bank accounts and property. He has been sentenced to four months in prison and will have to pay back the £41,000 he falsely claimed in state benefits. The judge who sentenced Mr. Kemp-Philp described him as a "dishonest and manipulative" individual who had "betrayed the system of public support." The judge also stated that the sentence was necessary to deter others from committing similar crimes. In conclusion, Gwyn Kemp-Philp's case demonstrates the seriousness of fraud and false representation. His actions not only caused harm to the public purse but also undermined the trust that society places in the welfare system. His punishment serves as a stark reminder to others that such crimes will not go unpunished.
