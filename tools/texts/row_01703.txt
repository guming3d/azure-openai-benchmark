Police took the school employees into custody in the town of Rostaq, district administrator Moelam Hussein said. Local health officials blamed the act on extremists opposed to women's education. A total of 171 women and girls were hospitalized Tuesday, and four remained semi-conscious in the hospital Wednesday, Dr. Hafizullah Safi said. Some 25 women and girls returned to the hospital Wednesday morning, complaining of more stomach pains, fever and vomiting. They were given medication and released, said Safi, the provincial health department director. A sample of the water from the school was taken and had been sent to Kabul for testing, but it will take several days for the results. The victims range in age from 14 to 30 and were taken to a hospital in Afghanistan's northeastern Takhar province after their school's water tank was contaminated, according to Safi. No deaths were reported, but more than half the victims partially lost consciousness, while others suffered dizziness and vomiting. "Looking at the health condition of these girls, I can definitely say that their water was contaminated by some sort of poison," Safi said. "But we don't know yet what was the water exactly contaminated with." Taliban say they trained attackers . "It is the work of those who are against girls' education and peace and stability in Afghanistan," district administrator Hussain said. In 2010, more than 100 schoolgirls and teachers were sickened in a series of similar poisonings. During the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001, many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school, though the schools began reopening after the regime was toppled by the U.S.-led invasion.

In January 2011, Afghan Education Minister Dr. Farooq Wardak told the Education World Forum in London that the Taliban had abandoned their opposition to girls' education.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, at least 171 Afghan girls and female teachers were admitted to a local hospital in the northern province of Takhar on Wednesday. According to health officials, they had consumed poisoned water. The incident has been attributed to extremist elements opposed to women's education. The perpetrators allegedly poured toxic chemicals, possibly rat poison, into the water tank that supplied water to the school. The affected students and teachers were rushed to the hospital after they started experiencing nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Some of them even lost consciousness, and their condition was deemed critical by hospital authorities. While the authorities are investigating the incident, the Taliban has denied involvement. The Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said, "We condemn this act, and whoever has done this, we will punish them." However, the Afghan government has accused the Taliban of supporting such attacks. Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, expressed his outrage over the incident in a tweet and called on the international community to take a stand against those who oppose education. This is not the first time that such an incident has taken place in Afghanistan. In 2010, more than 100 schoolgirls and teachers were sickened in similar poisonings, believed to be orchestrated by the Taliban. The incident sparked international outrage and led to calls for greater security measures to protect women's education. The attack has been widely condemned by human rights groups, including Amnesty International. In a statement, the organization said, "This horrific act is a disturbing reminder of the growing dangers that Afghan girls face in accessing education. The Afghan authorities must take urgent steps to protect schools and ensure that girls can study without fear of violence or intimidation." The incident has once again highlighted the challenges faced by Afghan girls in accessing education. Despite progress made in recent years, Afghanistan remains one of the worst countries in the world for gender equality, with many girls unable to attend school due to poverty or cultural barriers. In conclusion, the poisoning of the students and teachers at the Takhar school is a vile act that highlights the ongoing struggle for women's rights in Afghanistan. It is hoped that the authorities will take all necessary measures to bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure that schools are protected from such attacks in the future.
