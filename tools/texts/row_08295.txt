article: On the run: Darren Burdfield has convictions for robbery, assault and Class A drug possession . A violent robber has become the third inmate in a week to go on the run from just one open prison. Darren Burdfield was allowed on  leave from Ford Open Prison, West Sussex, despite being jailed for five years last February for robbery, attempted robbery, criminal damage, assault, possession of an offensive weapon, Class A drug possession and various public order offences. The 32-year-old was recalled to jail on Saturday after a 'domestic incident' at the accommodation where he was staying for the weekend, but he did not return. He is now walking the streets and police have appealed for his return. Burdfield has become the 83rd inmate missing from Ford, which has been branded a laughing stock by campaigners with more than a dozen inmates missing since the 1990s. The record piles fresh embarrassment on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who has vowed to get to grips with lax security at Britain’s open prisons. He vanished just a day after Lucas Lamb walked out of Ford less than two years into a seven-year sentence for causing grievous bodily harm with intent. And on Monday, 27-year-old convicted burglar Greg Disbrey fled HMP Ford midway through a three-and-a-half year sentence he received in August 2012. The Category D prison holds 521 inmates, meaning the total who have absconded and not returned over the years are equal to almost a sixth of its capacity. Sussex Police said  Burdfield was allowed out of HMP Ford on Friday, but was recalled to prison less than 24 hours later following a 'domestic incident' in Worthing, West Sussex. The offender is 5ft 10ins tall with black hair and  tattoos of swallows on each side of his neck. Chief Inspector Pip Taylor, who is leading the manhunt, said: 'Burdfield has a large number of friends and associates across Sussex so it is possible that he is in the county still. Laughing stock:  83 inmates are  missing from HMP Ford in Arundel, West Sussex, including three this week . Missing: Violent criminal Lucas Lamb (left) and burglar Greg Disbrey (right) have both left Ford in the last week . 'We need to speak to anyone who may have seen him or may know where he is. 'There is nothing to suggest he poses a risk to the general public but he has not served his sentence so we need to arrest him and return him to custody as quickly as possible.” Sussex Police has set up a dedicated team to track down Ford absconders, one of whom has been missing since the early 1960s. Those missing include two murderers, a kidnapper and five other violent criminals. About half have been missing for at least four years, and 18 escaped in the 1990s.

chatgpt: Sussex Police are currently on the lookout for Darren Burdfield, who was recalled to jail after committing a domestic incident while on weekend leave. Burdfield, who has a history of convictions for robbery, assault, and Class A drugs, is the third inmate in a week to abscond from Ford Prison in West Sussex. According to reports, Burdfield was given permission to leave the prison as part of the temporary release scheme commonly known as "ROTL" (Release On Temporary Licence). This scheme is designed to aid in the rehabilitation of prisoners by allowing them to gain practical experience in work, education, and other areas that could help them reintegrate back into society. However, Burdfield failed to return to the prison after committing a domestic incident. As a result, he was immediately considered to be unlawfully at large, and Sussex Police were notified of his situation. The police are now strictly monitoring the local area and asking anyone with information about Burdfield's whereabouts to come forward. This news has caused concern among the local residents, who fear the escaped convict could pose a threat to their safety. They have urged the authorities to do everything possible to locate and apprehend Burdfield before he can cause any harm. Any sightings or information about the escaped inmate should be reported to the police without delay, they say. The incident is another blow to the rehabilitation programmes offered by the criminal justice system. Despite the intended benefits of such schemes, there have been many cases where prisoners have gone missing, causing fear and concern for local communities. This latest incident highlights the potential dangers of releasing high-risk and violent offenders without proper oversight and monitoring. The justice system had already come under scrutiny for its handling of temporary release schemes following the escape of two other prisoners in the same week. The recent spike in absconding incidents has led to calls for the government to review the effectiveness of these programmes and the allocation of resources to monitor participants. There is also growing pressure to take stronger measures to ensure that violent and high-risk offenders are not granted early release. In summary, the recent escape of Darren Burdfield from Ford Prison has led to heightened concerns about the effectiveness of temporary release programmes and the risks associated with releasing high-risk offenders. The authorities are urgently investigating the matter, and Sussex Police are encouraging anyone with information about Burdfield's whereabouts to come forward without delay. The incident has also sparked calls for a review of the temporary release scheme and increased measures to ensure public safety.
