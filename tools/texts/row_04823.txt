article: Arrested: Ashley Zehnder, 24, allegedly had a months-long relationship with a male student . A high school teacher accused of having sex with a 17-year-old male cheerleader has not committed a crime, her lawyer has said. Biology teacher and cheerleading coach Ashley Zehnder, 24, allegedly had a months-long relationship with the teen, who was a member of the cheerleading squad at Pasadena High School, Texas. The age of consent in Texas is 17. 'We believe she's innocent,' attorney Nicole DeBorde told the Houston Chronicle. 'We don't think any crime has been committed. They're saying [the alleged behavior] is inappropriate solely because of the teacher-student relationship.' Zehnder, who is in a long term relationship, was arrested on Friday on a charge of having an improper relationship with a male student. She is out on $10,000 bond. The student said their relationship, which started in May and lasted throughout the summer, began when he lost his cellphone and used Zehnder's to call it, police said. Afterwards he saved her number to his phone and they began texting and started a relationship, court records said. The relationship reportedly came to light after Zehnder sent the teenager naked photos on Snapchat, which he saved and reportedly showed to other students.

chatgpt: Ashley Zehnder, a biology teacher and assistant cheer coach at Hightower High School in Missouri City, Texas, has been accused of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student on the cheer squad. The relationship came to light after Zehnder sent a naked photo of herself to the student on Snapchat, and he subsequently shared it with other students at the school. After being confronted with the image, Zehnder admitted to having a months-long sexual relationship with the student. She has since been charged with having an improper relationship with a student, a second-degree felony in the state of Texas. If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison. However, Zehnder's lawyer has argued that she did not commit a crime because the age of consent in Texas is 17. The lawyer, Dan Cogdell, has stated that "Ashley Zehnder is innocent, and we look forward to presenting her case in court." The situation has caused uproar among students, parents, and faculty at Hightower High School. Some have criticized the school administration for not taking action sooner, as rumors of the inappropriate relationship had been circulating prior to the Snapchat incident. In response to the allegations, the Fort Bend Independent School District, which oversees Hightower High School, has stated that they are "deeply concerned" about the situation and are cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation. The district has also taken steps to ensure the safety and well-being of the students involved. The student who received the Snapchat from Zehnder was immediately removed from the cheer squad, and counseling services have been made available to all students. This is not the first time that a teacher at Hightower High School has been accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a student. In 2012, a former English teacher, Rachel Respess, was arrested for having a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student. The incident involving Zehnder highlights the ongoing issue of inappropriate relationships between teachers and students in schools across the country. While some argue that the age of consent laws should be reevaluated, others believe that teachers should never engage in romantic or sexual relationships with their students, regardless of the age of consent. As the case against Ashley Zehnder unfolds, many are left wondering how such a situation could have occurred at Hightower High School, and what steps can be taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
