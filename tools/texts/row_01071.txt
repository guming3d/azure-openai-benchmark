article: Muhammad Ali's personal doctor has revealed he cannot be sure that boxing contributed to the former heavyweight world champion's Parkinson's Disease. Ali, considered by many to be the greatest boxer of all time, has suffered with the neurological syndrome since the mid-1980s and it has often been presumed that blows to the head during his 21-year professional career were a contributing factor to his condition. But Dr Abraham Lieberman, who is the Medical Director of the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Centre, admits that it is not possible to be entirely sure what caused Ali to suffer from Parkinson's. Former heavyweight championÂ Muhammad Ali has had Parkinson's Disease since 1980s . 'It's only over the last 10 years that he's had a lot of trouble walking, with falls,' he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. 'So his course has been more that of typical Parkinson's Disease. If you look at the MRI of his brain it looks pretty good but it's very difficult to factor in what sort of role did boxing play. 'People ask me about this and I tell them: look at George Foreman. He boxed longer than Muhammad did, took many more blows to the head and he's on television selling his cookware. 'I think that he (Ali) has typical Parkinson's Disease. Did the boxing contribute? I don't know. It may have.' Ali's personal doctor said that George Foreman received many more blows to the head and is now fine . Dr Lieberman gave the impression of a happy retirement for Ali - who was known as Cassius Clay before joining the Nation of Islam and changing his name - and stressed that, despite some reports, there is no reason to fear for his health. He said: 'He's had Parkinson's since about 1984, that's almost 30 years, that's a long time in Parkinson's. 'He's in good spirits, he has some trouble walking but overall for having had Parkinson's for 30 years, he's doing okay.' He added: 'Muhammad is now 72 so you can have a heart attack or you can have a stroke. Ali, seen here in Zaire, is in good condition considering he's had Parkinson's for 30 years, says his doctor . 'I don't know that he's more or less at risk than anyone else but anything can happen to you. 'How do people with Parkinson's Disease die? They don't die of Parkinson's Disease, they develop trouble swallowing and they develop pneumonia and he doesn't have trouble swallowing. 'They fall, they bang their head - his family takes extraordinary care of him. 'I could have a heart attack or a stroke and die but I don't see anything immediately that leads me to think he's gong to die in six months or die in a year. I can't say that.'

chatgpt: Muhammad Ali, the legendary boxer, was first diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the 1980s, and it's been long believed that his boxing career and repeated head injuries were the probable cause of his illness. However, Ali's personal physician has recently played down that link. Dr Abraham Lieberman, the neurologist who had been treating Muhammad Ali since 1982, commented on the matter in a recent interview. He said that while boxing injuries probably played a role in the development of Parkinson's in Ali, it's impossible to determine what the exact cause was. Dr Lieberman explained that Parkinson's is a complex disease that is caused by multiple factors, including genetics, environmental factors, and a history of head injury, including boxing. However, the exact role of boxing in causing Parkinson's can't be accurately determined.  Dr Lieberman also talked about Ali's personal struggle with Parkinson's disease. He recalled how Ali was initially hesitant to reveal his diagnosis and didn't want to talk about it publicly. However, over the years, Ali became a prominent advocate for Parkinson's disease awareness, and his celebrity status helped to raise awareness and funds for research related to the disease. Ali's advocacy work contributed significantly to the improved understanding of the disease and the development of effective treatments. Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement, balance, and coordination. The disease occurs when the neurons that control movement die or become damaged. Parkinson's disease affects one in every 100 people above 60 years old, and there are no known cures for this disease. The long-term effects of boxing on the brain have been studied extensively over the years. Repeated head injuries in boxing have been linked to a range of neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease. The physical trauma of boxing can cause the brain to experience chronic inflammation and cellular damage, which can eventually lead to the development of Parkinson's disease. Muhammad Ali is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, and his contribution to the sport is unparalleled. He won several world titles and defeated some of the most celebrated boxers of his era. However, his achievements in boxing came at a cost, as he developed Parkinson's disease later in life. In conclusion, while the precise cause of Muhammad Ali's Parkinson's disease cannot be determined with certainty, it is clear that his career in boxing likely played a role in its development. Ali's personal physician, Dr Abraham Lieberman, has confirmed that while boxing may have been a factor, there are many other potential causes. Parkinson's disease is a debilitating and progressive disorder that can affect anyone, regardless of their profession, and it continues to be a major public health issue worldwide. The legacy of Muhammad Ali will continue to inspire people worldwide, both as a boxing champion and as an advocate for Parkinson's disease awareness.
