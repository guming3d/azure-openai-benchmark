article: (CNN) -- Europe regained the Solheim Cup with a 15-13 victory over the United States at Killeen Castle in Ireland Sunday. With the scores tied 8-8 going into the concluding 12 singles matches, a close finish always looked likely and the outcome boiled down to the last three matches on course. Norway's Suzann Pettersen led the European fight back as she came down from one down with three to play to beat Michelle Wie by one hole. At the culmination of a superb match, Pettersen holed an eight-foot birdie putt on the final green to tip the match in Europe's favor. In the second last singles, Caroline Hedwall, two down with two to play against Ryann O'Toole, won the last two holes for a vital half point, which effectively sealed the European triumph, their players running onto the 18th green to celebrate. With Azahara Munoz one up with one to play against Angela Stanford, it meant Europe had an unassailable one-point lead. After the green cleared, Stanford played a superb approach to within a few feet, but both putts were conceded to hand Munoz a 1up victory. The United States, who had won the last three editions of the biennial team competition, suffered an early blow when Cristie Kerr was forced to withdraw from her final singles match against Karen Stupples with an injured wrist. Kerr was left in tears at the concession of a point which was to prove crucial. Catriona Matthew gave Europe early impetus with a 6 and 5 victory over Paula Creamer in the top singles and Sophie Gustafson added a second point for the home side with a final green win over Stacy Lewis. Brittany Lang and Morgan Pressel, with her fourth win in four, put the United States back on to the front foot and the match between veterans Juli Inkster and Laura Davies ended all square. Christina Kim of the United States beat fellow rookie Maria Hjorth, while American Vicky Hurst beat Melissa Reid by two holes and Europe's Christel Boeljon overcame Brittany Lincicome by the same margin to set up the exciting finale with the scores then tied 12 1/2 - 12 1/2. Europe captain Alison Nicholas was leading her team to the fourth victory in 12 contests and they will defend the trophy at Colorado Golf Club in 2013. "My team played with such heart and passion. The rookies were fantastic and the experienced players have done so well. They are all champions," Nicholas told Sky Sports.

chatgpt: Europe has won the Solheim Cup with a 15-13 win over the United States after an intense weekend of competition at Killeen Castle in Ireland. The host team took control of the game in the final round, winning in the last three singles matches. Suzann Pettersen, the Norwegian golfer, led the way as she beat Michelle Wie on the final hole after trailing with just three holes remaining. Her match turned the tide of the game in Europe's favor, and her teammates rallied behind her to seal the victory. Pettersen's match was one of the closest of the day, as she birdied the last hole to secure the win. Killeen Castle proved to be a challenging course for both teams, with unpredictable conditions and tricky shots testing the golfers' abilities. However, the European team overcame these challenges to secure their first win since 2011, much to the delight of their fans. The final day's play was not without its controversies, however. Cristie Kerr, one of the United States' most experienced players, suffered an injury early in her match against Karen Stupples of Europe. Unable to continue, she was forced to concede the match, handing Europe another crucial point. The Solheim Cup is the women's equivalent of the Ryder Cup, and the victory was a significant achievement for Europe. The team's captain, Carin Koch, was delighted with the result, saying, "it's been an amazing week, and we're just thrilled to have won the Solheim Cup back." The United States team, led by captain Meg Mallon, put up a valiant effort and came close to pulling off a victory. However, in the end, it was Europe's day, and their players showed great skill, determination, and sportsmanship throughout the weekend. The Solheim Cup is held every two years, with the venue alternating between the United States and Europe. The event is a highlight of the women's golfing calendar, and this year's competition did not disappoint. With Europe now holding the cup, the United States will be looking to win it back when the two teams meet again in two years' time.
