Busted: Germaine Gardea was charged with bigamy after his second wife found he had been married to another woman . Hell may hath no fury like a woman scorned, but what about two of them? Germaine Gardea, 38, was arrested and charged with bigamy a week ago after his second wife discovered he had been married to another woman without her knowledge. Gardea has reportedly lived with both wives in two separate Texas towns since 2009 - with neither of the women knowing of the other’s existence. The second wife, Leslie Gardea, was also unaware that her husband was married because he showed her documentation that he and the first wife divorced on October 16, 2009 - the same day they were married. Gardea had filed for divorce, but the case was dropped because he did not show up at a court hearing, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. He was reportedly found out after Leslie Gardea discovered that her husband had been writing checks to another woman. Leslie Gardea then called the first wife, who helped her unravel Germaine Gardea’s alleged web of lies. Fort Worth police spokesman Sgt Pedro Criado told the Star-Telegram: 'The first wife knew nothing of the second wife until she made contact with her.' He added: '[Gardea] has a job in which he travels extensively so I suppose the extended time away from either wife was easily explained until the bills were located.' It was the first wife who reported Gardea’s alleged misdeeds to the police. Work: With his second wife Leslie, Gardea owns the Aviator Air Centers in Grand Prairie, Texas, a rental and pilot training facility . He was booked on October 11 on a charge of bigamy and later released from jail after posting $2,000 bond. Germaine and Leslie Gardea own a flight training school together called Aviator Air Centers located near the Grand Prairie Municipal Airport. The Star-Telegram reported that that the first wife claims that she did not know of any divorce document and contends that Mr Gardea may have forged her signature. Germaine and Leslie Gardea did not return calls by the Star-Telegram for comment. Robert Hoover, the divorce attorney for the first wife, told the paper that his client would not be speaking about the case.

chatgpt: A man from San Antonio, Texas, has been charged with bigamy after his two wives found out about each other. Germaine Gardea, 38, reportedly lived with both women at the same time, and was able to do it because his job required him to travel often. The first wife of Gardea, who he married in 2013, claims that he forged her signature on a divorce document. She says she had no idea that Gardea was remarried until the second wife contacted her. The second wife, who Gardea married in 2016, says she was also unaware that he was still married to his first wife. According to court documents, Gardea met his second wife online while still married to his first wife. They hit it off and he ended up proposing to her within a few months. The couple got married at a courthouse in San Antonio in 2016. Gardea allegedly told his second wife that he had been divorced from his first wife for two years. It wasn't until early 2019 that the second wife found out about the first wife. She contacted her on Facebook and explained the situation. The two women met up and discussed their marriages to Gardea. They then went to the police and reported him for bigamy. When questioned by police, Gardea allegedly admitted that he was still married to his first wife when he married his second. He said he was planning to divorce his first wife, but hadn't gotten around to it yet. Gardea was charged with bigamy and appeared in court on Tuesday. Bigamy is a felony offense in Texas and carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Gardea's first wife has also filed a separate lawsuit against him for forging her signature on the divorce document. She is seeking damages for emotional distress and other expenses related to the divorce. The case has shocked many in San Antonio, especially those who know Gardea. He is said to be a well-respected member of the community and has no prior criminal record. Some are questioning why he would commit such a crime and risk his reputation and freedom. Gardea's lawyer declined to comment on the case, but it's expected that he will plead not guilty to the charges. The case will now proceed through the court system, and Gardea could face a lengthy prison sentence if convicted.
