chatgpt: The search for the missing Chibok girls continues in Nigeria, but a top military official has stated that a rescue operation cannot be attempted. The safety of the girls is the top priority, according to the official. "We can't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back," the top official stated. The decision not to attempt a rescue operation comes after years of effort to locate and bring back the 276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram from their school in Chibok in 2014. Pressure is growing on the Nigerian government to bring the girls home safely. The Chibok girls' abduction sparked international outrage and the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, which became a global movement. While some of the girls have been rescued since then, 112 of them are still missing. Nigerians have taken to social media to express their frustration and disappointment with the government's failure to locate and bring back the girls. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls is once again making the rounds on social media, with many Nigerians calling for action. Many Nigerians are questioning the government's commitment to ending the Boko Haram insurgency and securing the release of the missing girls. The Nigerian military has been criticized for its handling of the insurgency, with some alleging that officials may be profiteering from the deplorable security situation. Nigeria's Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi, has come under fire for his controversial comments on the Chibok girls. Magashi, who recently visited the Chibok community, urged the people to "forgive" and forget the abduction. His comments were not well received by Nigerians, many of whom have accused the government of neglecting the victims of the insurgency. Activists have called on the government to do more to locate and bring back the missing girls. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to continue the fight against Boko Haram and to secure the release of the Chibok girls. However, his administration has been criticized for its slow response to the insurgency. The situation in Nigeria remains precarious, with Boko Haram continuing to operate in the region. The international community has expressed concern about the deteriorating security situation in the country. The search for the missing Chibok girls is ongoing, and international pressure is mounting on the Nigerian government to take decisive action to locate and bring them back safely. The safety of these girls remains a top priority, and it is the responsibility of the Nigerian government to ensure that they are returned to their families.
