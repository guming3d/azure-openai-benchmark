chatgpt: In a daring escape that could have been taken straight from a Hollywood blockbuster, Yves Denis, Denis Lefebvre, and Serge Pomerleau escaped from a prison in Quebec, Canada earlier this year. The brazen escape led to an international manhunt and caused three other prisons to announce no-fly zones as a precaution. The escape was carried out in June, when a helicopter landed in the yard of the Orsainville Detention Centre. The clip of the helicopter landing was widely circulated on social media and the daring escape gained national attention. The three men escaped while the helicopter hovered above the prison yard. In the weeks that followed, law enforcement agencies across Quebec, and even beyond, initiated an intense manhunt for the fugitives. As a precaution, three other prisons in the province announced no-fly zones, as there was concerning that another escape attempt might be made. Fortunately, the search for the escaped convicts came to an end when a SWAT team captured them in a fancy condo in Montreal. The SWAT team acted swiftly and efficiently, apprehending Denis, Lefebvre, and Pomerleau without any loss of life or injury. The three fugitives were taken into custody and put on trial for their escape attempt. They were found guilty and sentenced to additional jail time for their escape attempt. The fact that the three convicts managed to escape the highly secure prison was a major embarrassment for the authorities, and they were determined to ensure that justice was served. The Quebec government has ordered a review of its prison system to prevent any similar incidents from happening in the future.

It showed the lengths that people will go to escape from custody and the determination of law enforcement agencies to bring them to justice.
