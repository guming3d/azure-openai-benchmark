article: The taxpayers' bill for ferrying prisoners around in taxis leapt by almost 10 per cent last year, it emerged tonight. The Ministry of Justice admitted that in 2013-14 it spent £3.4million on taxis for inmates, up from £3.1million a year earlier, but insisted it was an 'economical mode of transport'. The revelation is especially embarrassing after a Treasury minister last year said the bill was a 'scandal'. The bill for taxis for prisoners last year hit £3.4million, the highest since the first year of the coalition . Ministers insisted using taxis was an 'economical' way of transporting criminals, instead of buying dedicated prison vehicles. According to figures released in response to a parliamentary question, the bill for taxis for prisoners came to £3,417,595, up from £3,133,614 last year. It is the highest the bill has been since the first year of the coalition. When last year's sum was revealed, Tory MP Priti Patel called it a 'scandal'. She is now a minister at the Treasury, which has demanded a tighter grip on spending. The figure is for the cost of transporting prisoners for public sector prisons in England and Wales. Tonight Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money is already paid to private companies to ferry around prisoners, and so the public will be confused why an additional £3million had to be shelled out last year for taxis for prisoners. 'Many people are struggling to pay their bills on a day to day basis, and taking a taxi for them is a rare luxury. 'They will look at offenders being shuttled around in taxis and question what has gone wrong with the world. 'We need competent Ministers who know what they are doing rather than this shower. 'This is yet more evidence of the shambles at the Ministry of Justice. David Cameron's government really do need to get a grip before any more of the hard pressed British public’s money is wasted.' Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan  said for most normal people a taxi is a 'luxury' The Prisoner Escort Custody Service (PECS) is responsible for moving prisoners around the country, between prisons, police stations and courts and their care and security while in court custody. It runs contracts for secure escorts for all inmates, apart from Category A prisoners. But sometimes taxis are hired to drive them around instead of standard prison vans. Prisons minister Andrew Selous said: 'There are occasions when the prison service may make use of taxis to provide prisons with a cost-effective, flexible way of fulfilling transport requirements for prisoners where there is a strong operational justification for doing so. 'This is an economical mode of transport (particularly in comparison with using cellular vehicles or purchasing cars). It reduces potential overhead costs for prisons, such as maintenance and cleaning, which have an impact on staff time. 'Prisons are able to access this form of transport at short notice, in response to urgent requirements.'

chatgpt: According to exclusive reports, spending on hired transport and taxis among government officials reached a staggering £3.4million in the previous year. This information has caused many to question the expenses of government officials and their choices of transportation. Prisons Minister Andrew Selous has defended the expenses of hired transport and taxis, stating that it has been an "economical mode of transport." He claims that they have been using it to attend meetings and official functions. However, Selous has declined to provide details on how much of the total expenses he personally incurred. The expenses have also been criticized by Sadiq Khan, the Labour party's mayoral candidate in London. Khan believes that taxis and hired transport should be considered a luxury, and not a necessity for government officials. He argues that the average person does not have enough disposable income to afford such expenses, and it is not appropriate for the government to be making these kinds of expenditures. Khan's sentiments have been echoed by many, especially considering the current state of the economy. While government officials may need to travel from one location to another, there are cheaper alternatives to taxis and hired transport that could be used. Many believe that they should lead by example and prioritize cutting costs where possible. This latest revelation is not the first time that government expenses have come under scrutiny. In recent years, there have been incidents where government officials have been accused of spending taxpayer money on luxurious travel expenses. The public has called for greater scrutinization of government spending and a significant reduction of expenses. The expenses of government officials have become a major issue, especially with the ongoing pandemic, and many individuals are struggling financially. The public is concerned that their taxes are being misused on unnecessary expenses, rather than being used to help those who need it most. In response to the controversy, some officials have promised to review their transport expenses to ensure that they are in line with the public's expectations. It is crucial that government officials take a hard look at their expenses and make necessary changes to restore the public's trust in the government. Overall, the expenditure of £3.4million on hired transport and taxis last year has caused uproar among the public. With the great financial struggle faced by many individuals, it is important that government officials consider the public's opinions regarding their expenses. It is time for government officials to lead by example and cut down on unnecessary expenses.
