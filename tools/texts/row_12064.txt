article: (CNN) -- Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance on Friday, just over two months after his arrest, a prosecutor said. The misdemeanor charges filed Friday are pending in Hamilton County, Indiana, Superior Court, Prosecuting Attorney D. Lee Buckingham's office said in a press release. The drug was identified in a court filing as oxycodone and/or hydrocordone. Irsay's initial hearing on both counts is scheduled for June 19. The Colts owner and CEO's legal team, in a statement after the charges were announced, thanked the Hamilton County prosecutor's office "for its professionalism in its investigation." The statement pointed out that authorities determined that "the facts in this matter did not warrant the filing of felony charges relative to Mr. Irsay's prescription medications. "Mr. Irsay will deal with the remaining misdemeanor charges through the judicial process," the statement added. Police in Carmel had earlier said that Irsay was stopped at 11:41 p.m. on March 16 for driving slowly, stopping in a roadway and failing to use his turn signal. The probable cause affidavit indicates that the Colts owner's speech was "slow and slurred," his eyes were "red and glassy" and his balance was "very unsteady." He failed a number of field sobriety tests, had trouble reciting the alphabet and told an officer "that he was having a hard time finding his house." In addition, a search of his vehicle found prescription drugs in bottles, police said in a press release. The drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles in the vehicle, according to police. The next day, Irsay "voluntary checked into a highly respected health care facility," according to the Colts. "(He) is committed committed to undergoing the treatment and care necessary to help him meet his challenges head-on," added the team. Irsay is the first National Football League owner to face criminal charges since Eddie DeBartolo of the San Francisco 49ers was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1997. In that time, the league -- including its current commissioner, Roger Goodell -- have frequently punished players for off-the-field indiscretions that landed them in court. It remains to be seen what will happen, then, to the 54-year-old Irsay, who has largely stayed out of the public spotlight -- except for regular tweets -- since his arrest. In a brief statement Friday, the league said, "The NFL's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all league personnel and holds all of us accountable. We are reviewing the matter and will take appropriate action in accordance with the policy. The Colts owner -- whose father, Robert Irsay, owned the team before him -- has spoken publicly about his struggles with substance abuse as well as his efforts to stay sober. In a tweet last December, Jim Irsay said that he didn't drink: "(S)orry to ruin your theories ... but I don't drink ... at all," he posted on his official account.

chatgpt: Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has been charged with driving while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance. The NFL announced that its policies regarding illegal substances apply “to all league personnel,” and vowed to take “appropriate action.” The charges against Irsay stem from a March 16 incident in which he was pulled over for driving erratically in suburban Carmel, Indiana. According to police, officers observed Irsay driving at a slow speed, stopping in the roadway for no apparent reason, and failing to signal turns. Irsay was found to be in possession of several prescription medications, which he did not have a valid prescription for, and a large amount of cash. Irsay voluntarily checked into a treatment facility a day after the incident. His legal team says that the prosecutor’s office has declined to press felony charges, citing insufficient evidence. The NFL’s personal conduct policy applies to all league personnel, including owners, coaches, players, and other employees. The policy states that those found guilty of a felony, or found to have engaged in conduct that undermines the integrity of the league or public confidence in it, are subject to discipline. The league has not yet announced what action it will take regarding Irsay’s charges. However, the NFL has previously suspended players and coaches for drug-related offenses, including a four-game suspension of former Colts receiver LaVon Brazill last year. Irsay, who has owned the Colts since 1997, is widely respected in the NFL for his contributions to the league and his support of charitable causes. However, he has also been open about his struggles with addiction and has previously received treatment for substance abuse. The charges against Irsay come at a time when the NFL is facing increased scrutiny over its handling of player conduct issues, particularly incidents involving domestic violence. The league has recently revised its policies regarding such actions, including increased penalties for players found guilty of domestic violence and the appointment of an independent adviser to oversee the handling of such cases. The NFL has also faced criticism for its handling of player safety issues, particularly regarding the long-term effects of head injuries. The league has established a $1 billion settlement fund for players who suffer from conditions related to repeated head trauma. Irsay’s charges serve as a reminder that the NFL’s policies regarding illegal substances apply to all league personnel, and that the league will take action when those policies are violated. It remains to be seen what action the league will take regarding Irsay’s charges, but it is clear that the league is committed to upholding its policies and maintaining public trust in the integrity of the sport.
