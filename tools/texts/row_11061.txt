chatgpt: Amy Poehler's Smart Girls campaign has been making waves on social media with its inspiring hashtag trend. The actress and comedian launched the campaign in 2008, with an aim to empower young women and promote positivity. The campaign started with a series of web videos and community-driven content aimed at helping girls find their voice and pursue their passions. Recently, the initiative has been focusing on promoting a new hashtag trend on social media - #AskHerMore. The hashtag is aimed at urging the media to go beyond just the outfit and ask women about their accomplishments, beliefs and opinions on pressing issues. The hashtag became popular on the red carpet when celebrities, tired of being asked solely about their attire by interviewers, took to Twitter and Instagram to express their support for the movement. The trend caught fire, with hundreds of tweets and posts from celebrities and ordinary people alike. The movement was so successful that even E! decided to jump on the bandwagon and join the conversation by launching its own Red Carpet Challenge. The challenge was aimed at encouraging E! viewers to engage with celebrities and ask them questions about their work and passions, rather than just their fashion choices. The challenge was met with overwhelming response from the media and the public at large. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Poehler explained the motivation behind the #AskHerMore campaign: "We want to encourage girls to be their best selves, to empower them and in turn, empower each other. We want to create a community of strong, confident and smart girls who can compete with and support each other." The campaign has been a success in achieving its goal of promoting positive messages for girls and women. Apart from the hashtag trend, the campaign continues to produce content aimed at inspiring girls to take action and follow their dreams. It has become a platform for girls to share their stories and encourage each other to be confident and smart. In a world where young girls are often bombarded with unrealistic beauty standards and limited role models, Poehler's Smart Girls campaign and its #AskHerMore movement serve as a refreshing change. It encourages not only girls, but also the media and society at large, to shift their focus from superficial characteristics to more substantial qualities - talent, intelligence, and character.
