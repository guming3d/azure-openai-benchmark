article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A weekend incident with racial overtones at a high school for deaf students could result in criminal charges with "enhanced penalties for a hate crime," Metro Police Chief Cathy Lanier said Wednesday. A black student was held against his will and then released with "KKK" and swastikas drawn on him in marker at the Model Secondary School for the Deaf on Sunday, she said. No charges have been filed, and no names have been released, Lanier said. The incident began when a group of black students and a group of white students were in a dorm. "My understanding is the two groups engaged in friendly horseplay," she said. But, she said, the groups got "angry with each other." The two groups separated, she said, but later, six white students and one black student -- all between the ages of 15 and 19 -- took one of the black students into a dorm room and "held him there against his will." "They used markers to write 'KKK' and draw swastikas on the student," Lanier said. The student was released after about 45 minutes. He notified dorm and school authorities, who called police. Lanier said police have identified and interviewed the students involved and the "investigation is ongoing." "The support we've received from the campus and from the school employees has been tremendous," Lanier said. "And I think they're supporting us in making a very strong statement that this investigation may lead to charges that could have enhanced penalties for a hate crime." The school is a residential high school on the campus of Gallaudet University, a higher education facility for deaf and hard of hearing people. The high school is administered as a division of the university's Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center. Dean of Clerc Center Katherine A. Jankowski said the seven students who participated in the incident were sent home. Gallaudet provost Stephen Weiner said the school does "not tolerate any action, behavior of this type." "We are taking action," he said. "We are looking at programs to help students understand we are a school with a diverse population." "This incident is intolerable," he said. "That's why the Metro police are involved. That's how serious we are about this incident." Jankowski said the school has also hired a consultant to work with the school and its students on diversity issues. On Monday, teachers and staff hosted a school-wide assembly with students related to the incident, said Jankowski. Individual and group counseling services were also available to students, teachers and staff. "We are committed to ensuring MSSD is a safe and supportive learning environment," she said.

chatgpt: Tensions ran high on the campus of Gallaudet University, a private university for the deaf and hard of hearing, as groups of white and black students engaged in heated arguments. The disagreements culminated in a violent altercation that left one black student assaulted by white students and one black student, according to police. The incident occurred on Monday, just after classes had ended for the day. Witnesses reported that groups of white and black students had been arguing for several hours when the situation turned violent. "It was like a powder keg ready to explode," said one witness, who wished to remain anonymous. "You could feel the tension in the air." As the situation escalated, a group of white students and one black student allegedly attacked a black student, leaving him with bruises and cuts. Campus security quickly intervened and broke up the fight, and police were called to the scene. The victim was taken to a local hospital for treatment. The police have not yet charged anyone in connection with the incident, but they have indicated that the teenagers involved could be facing criminal charges, including hate crimes. "We are taking this incident very seriously," said Chief Lester Holt of the Gallaudet University Police Department. "We will not tolerate any kind of violence or discrimination on our campus." The university has also issued a statement condemning the violence and promising to take action to ensure that such incidents do not occur again. "We are deeply troubled by this incident and are working closely with the police to investigate it fully," the statement read. "We are committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students, and we will not tolerate any form of discrimination or violence." The incident has sparked outrage and concern among the Gallaudet community, particularly among black students who feel targeted by the violence. "It's just scary to think that something like this could happen on our campus," said one black student. "We should be able to feel safe here." Others, however, have expressed frustration and anger about the ongoing racial tensions on campus. "It's not just this incident, it's been going on for a long time," said another student. "There's a lot of anger and resentment on both sides, and it's not getting any better." As the investigation continues, many are hoping for a swift resolution to the incident and a renewed commitment from the university to address the underlying issues. "We need to have a serious conversation about race and discrimination on this campus," said one student. "We can't just sweep this under the rug and pretend everything is okay."
