article: A woman has launched a campaign for U.S. airlines to allow hedgehogs to travel in airplane cabins, after learning that her prickly friend could not travel with her by air. Zoe Herman was shocked to discover that Heloise the hedgehog could only board a flight if she was stowed in the airplane's cargo hold - something she says is just not safe for the delicate little animal. So now Zoe, from Portland, Oregon, is going up against some of America's biggest airlines with a petition to allow the prickly creatures to travel  in the cabin, just like small cats and dogs. Heloise the hedgehog, from Portland, is not allowed to travel inside airplane cabins aongside her owner . Zoe first discovered that airplane cabin's were a no-go for hedgehogs when she booked a flight across the States to visit her family for the holidays. She quickly learned that most, if not all U.S. airlines, refuse to allow hedgehogs to travel in airplanes, and only a handful allow the prickly animals in cargo-holds. 'They all said they were a danger of chewing out of their cages, which if you know anything about hedgehogs, they can't do that,' Zoe told KATU News. 'They don't have teeth that chew. They just kind of tear apart meat, that's it.' Zoe Herman (pictured) is going up against some of America's biggest airlines with a petition to allow her companion hedgehog Heloise to travel in the cabin, just like small cats and dogs. Zoe's petition is directed at American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which she says harbor numerous misconceptions about hedgehogs. On her campaign page, Zoe writes: 'Hedgehogs are very clean animals, and because they do not have fur, they have little to no dander. Unlike cats and dogs, it is uncommon to be allergic to a hedgehog.' She also points out that hedgehogs do not make any noise, 'other than the occasional sneeze or itch'. Zoe says Heloise is clean and quiet, so traveling with her in an airplane cabin should not be a problem at all . 'They do not bark, meow, whine, growl, hiss, or scratch at their cages, as cats and dogs may do, Zoe adds. 'In fact, hedgehogs sleep most of the time, meaning that traveling with a hedgehog is essentially like traveling with a very small, spiny stuffed animal.' Hedgehogs, affectionately known as 'hedgies' by their fans, are an increasingly popular pet in the United States. However, they are actually illegal in some cities and states, including New York City, California, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, and Maine.

chatgpt: Zoe Herman, a devoted hedgehog owner, was left disappointed after discovering that her tiny companion Heloise would not be able to fly in the cabin during an upcoming flight. According to many airline policies, hedgehogs and other small pets are required to travel in the cargo-hold rather than with their owners in the passenger cabin. Zoe has expressed her concerns about the safety and well-being of small animals during airline travel, especially when placed in the cargo-hold rather than the cabin. Hedgehogs are extremely sensitive and delicate creatures that require special care and attention during travel. Zoe is not the only one who has faced challenges when trying to travel with a small pet. Many pet owners are forced to leave their furry friends behind due to airline policies and regulations. Some airlines refuse to transport animals in extreme weather conditions, while others have stringent rules about the size and weight of animals allowed on board. Despite the challenges, pet owners are fighting for better regulations and accommodations when traveling with their animals. They argue that pets are members of their family and deserve to be treated with the same level of care and respect as human passengers. Zoe has made it her mission to raise awareness about the importance of safe and comfortable travel for small animals, such as hedgehogs. She insists that her furry companion Heloise is clean, quiet, and well-behaved, and stresses that she will not chew on her cage or disturb other passengers during the flight. Zoe's advocacy has caught the attention of many animal lovers and advocates, who are now calling on airlines to review their pet policies and make necessary adjustments to better accommodate small and delicate creatures. The debate on pet travel policies and regulations is ongoing, with many different opinions and perspectives on the matter. While some airlines are now offering more pet-friendly options and accommodations for their furry passengers, many still have a long way to go in terms of providing safe and comfortable travel for all animals. As for Zoe and Heloise, they are still working on finding a safe and comfortable way to travel together during their next trip. For now, they continue to raise awareness about the challenges that pet owners face when trying to travel with their beloved furry companions.
