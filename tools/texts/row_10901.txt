A North Texas woman has been handcuffed, strip-searched and booked into jail - because of an overdue driving ticket. Sarah Boaz was issued a ticket in Richland Hills after an officer saw her drive through a stop sign in August. Boaz lost the ticket and imagined that the worst consequence would be a late fee. Instead, she was arrested outside her home as she left for work Wednesday morning. Jailed for a ticket: Sarah Boaz never made it to work Wednesday morning after she was arrested outside her home for an unpaid ticket . A Richland Hills city marshal was waiting for her as she walked out her front door. 'No one puts out a bench warrant after 60 days,' she told CBS 11. 'Why would you do that?' Boaz was handcuffed and taken to the jail. She listened in disbelief as a female officer instructed her to undress. Disbelief: It wasn't until a female officer instructed Boaz to strip that she realized she was going to prison . Richland Hills is a small town that has only one marshal, meaning warrants for unpaid tickets get processed more quickly than they would in a larger city. However, Attorney Jason Smith told CBS 11, there’s nothing requiring the city to put people in jail. 'The constitution doesn’t keep the government or government officials from using common sense,' he said. 'Unfortunately, some police officers, some governments get overly aggressive because they want that ticket revenue.' Overzealous: Richland Hills officials insist Boaz was sent notices in the mail about her unpaid fine . Boaz was in jail only a short time before her family came to bail her out. She told CBS 11 she expected to at least receive a notice in the mail before such extreme action. Richland Municipal Court officials said notices had been sent to Boaz. CBS 11 reports that shortly after Boaz was freed from prison, her husband received a ticket - for rolling through a stop sign.

chatgpt: A routine day for Sarah Boaz turned into a nightmare on Wednesday as she was arrested outside her home for an unpaid traffic fine. The fine, which was issued back in August, had gone unpaid causing the local authorities to take harsher action. Boaz, who had lost the ticket, expected to pay a late fee at the most. Little did she know that her neglect would land her in a cell for hours. A strip-search ensued after her arrest, leaving her humiliated and emotionally scarred. The authorities, however, seem to think that they have only done their job. According to reports, the outstanding fine was approximately $100. The authorities claim to have sent out multiple reminders to Boaz to settle the fine. When no action was taken on her part, they decided to arrest her. This incident has sparked an outrage on social media where people are calling for more lenient treatment towards small infractions like traffic fines. Many argue that arresting someone for an unpaid fine only adds to the burden of the taxpayers as they foot the bill for the person's incarceration. Activists believe that the measures taken by the authorities were not in proportion to the offence committed. They argue that a late fee or community service would have been sufficient to remind Boaz of her obligations. Some believe that the incident has larger implications for the criminal justice system as a whole. It is argued that the overcriminalization of minor infractions has contributed to the mass-incarceration crisis in the country. Despite the widespread condemnation, the authorities maintain that they acted within the ambit of the law. Boaz has since been released on bail and is awaiting trial. The incident, however, has left her with emotional scars that may take a long time to heal. The case has brought to light the need for a more balanced approach towards minor infractions. The criminal justice system needs to revisit its approach towards misdemeanors and adopt proportionate measures to address them.
