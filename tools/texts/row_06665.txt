article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has moved the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon, Pentagon officials said Thursday.

The deployment comes amid a political standoff over Lebanon's presidency, but the Navy would not say whether the events are linked. "It's a group of ships that will operate in the vicinity for a while and as the ships in our Navy do, the presence is important," Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday. "It isn't meant to send any stronger signal than that," he said. "But it does signal that we're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity, and that's a very important part of the world." The Cole was badly damaged by an al Qaeda bombing during a port call in Yemen in 2000, killing 17 sailors. It returned to service in 2002. The destroyer and two support ships are close to Lebanon but out of visual range of the coast, Pentagon officials said. Another six vessels, led by the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau, are close to Italy and steaming toward the other three, the officials said. Mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming Lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president, which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week. But he said the vote was "important," and Washington was waiting for it to take place. And a Bush administration official told CNN the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboringSyria that "the U.S. is concerned about the situation in Lebanon, and we want to see the situation resolved." "We are sending a clear message for the need for stability," said the official, who was not authorized to speak for publication. The ships "should be there a while," the official added. Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament and the pro-Syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years. The country has been without a president since November, when pro-Syrian leader Emile Lahoud's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement. Despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief Gen. Michel Suleiman, disagreements over how to share power in a future Cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote. Parliament speaker Nabih Berri's office announced Tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to March 11. Berri's office said the Arab League needed more time to break the deadlock. Lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose supporters blamed Damascus for his killing. The resulting outcry eventually drove Syrian forces out of Lebanon, where they had been stationed since the 1970s. E-mail to a friend . CNN Correspondent Zain Verjee contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a move aimed at bolstering regional stability in the face of political unrest in Lebanon, the United States Navy has deployed a sizeable force to the eastern Mediterranean. The decision to increase the US military presence in the region comes amid an ongoing standoff between the pro-Western majority in the Lebanese parliament and a pro-Syrian opposition. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, emphasized the importance of the US Navy's presence in the region, stating that it sends a clear message that the United States is committed to supporting peace and stability in the region. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Milley stated that "the presence is important," adding that the deployment was necessary to ensure that American interests in the region are protected. The decision to deploy additional naval resources to the eastern Mediterranean comes at a time of heightened tensions in Lebanon, where political instability has been rampant in recent years. The country has been without a president since 2014, and the political stalemate between the pro-Western and pro-Syrian factions has only worsened in recent months. The pro-Western majority in parliament has been calling for the election of a new president, and has accused the pro-Syrian opposition of trying to block the process. Last week, the parliament failed for the 54th time to elect a new president, despite strong international pressure to find a solution to the ongoing crisis. The crisis in Lebanon has been exacerbated by regional developments, including the ongoing conflict in Syria and the involvement of foreign powers in the region. The United States has been increasingly concerned about the growing influence of Iran, which has been providing support to the Syrian government and to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group. The deployment of the US Navy to the eastern Mediterranean is intended to reassure US allies in the region and to send a message to Iran that the United States is committed to protecting its interests in the Middle East. The move follows a similar deployment of naval resources to the Persian Gulf, where tensions with Iran have been on the rise in recent months. The deployment of the US Navy to the eastern Mediterranean was welcomed by Lebanese officials, who have expressed concern about the growing instability in their country. Michel Aoun, the leader of the pro-Syrian Free Patriotic Movement, stated that he hoped the US deployment would help to calm tensions in the country and pave the way for a resolution to the political crisis. The decision to increase the US military presence in the region has been criticized by some experts, who argue that it could further inflame tensions in the Middle East. They argue that the United States needs to adopt a more nuanced approach to resolving the crisis in Lebanon, and should work to promote dialogue between the pro-Western and pro-Syrian factions. Despite these concerns, the deployment of the US Navy to the eastern Mediterranean is seen as an important step towards promoting stability in the region. With the crisis in Lebanon showing no signs of abating, the United States is likely to continue to play a key role in efforts to address the political stalemate and to promote peace and stability in the region.
