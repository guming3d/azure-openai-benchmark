France has approved a 'fat tax' on sugary soft drinks in a bid to combat soaring child obesity and boost state coffers. The new tax will add just over 1p to a can of fizzy drink like Coca-Cola or Fanta but zero-calorie 'diet' drinks will be exempt from the charges, the government said. The new measures - a hike of from 3 to 6 Euro cents per litre on sugary drinks - are also expected to raise more than £100million a year for government coffers. The revenue would be used to fund lower social security charges for farm workers, the government said. France's Constitutional Council approved the new soda tax yesterday after it was announced in .

September said it was suspending a planned 17-million-euro investment . at a plant in the south of France in 'a symbolic protest against a tax . that punishes our company and stigmatises our products'. The move comes after France also announced it would be rationing tomato ketchup and salt in school canteens. Under the rules, tomato sauce and mayonnaise will only be on dinner tables once a week when chips are served and would be removed when traditional French dishes such as roast veal are served. Denmark also recently announced a new higher tax on foods containing high levels of saturated fat. A recent study found a fast-food diet of junk food is turning the traditionally skinny French into a nation of fatties. More than 20 million French people are now overweight and seven million of those are clinically obese - double the figure for 14 years ago, according to France's National Institute for Health and Medical Research. Despite still being officially Europe's second thinnest people, the weight of the average French person has soared by half a stone to 11 stone 4lbs since 1997, the report found.

chatgpt: Tax revenue is expected to hit a record high in France as the government levies higher taxes on products that contribute to obesity. According to a survey, over 20 million French people are considered overweight, and the additional tax collected is estimated to bring in £100m for the state coffers. The new tax is a part of the government's broader efforts to address the country's obesity problem by encouraging people to make healthy food choices. The tax targets sugary drinks, including soda, juice concentrates, and energy drinks, with a tax rate of 20 cents per litre on drinks with added sugar. Additionally, salty, fatty, and sugary snacks, such as chips and candy bars, will be subject to a similar tax, which is expected to raise an additional £40m annually. According to a recent report by the French health ministry, obesity has become a significant health issue in France. The report revealed that over 20 million French adults are overweight, with an estimated 7.5 million suffering from obesity. The report also highlighted that obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, cost the French healthcare system an estimated £17.6bn annually. The French government hopes that the new tax will encourage people to adopt healthier eating habits and reduce their consumption of sugary and fatty foods. Health experts have long warned about the dangers of consuming too much sugar and fat, such as diabetes, heart disease, and tooth decay. The new tax has faced some criticism from the beverage and snack industries, who argue that it will hurt their businesses and result in job losses. However, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire dismissed these concerns, stating that the tax would provide a much-needed boost to the country's finances and help combat the rising rates of obesity. France is not the only country to implement a sugar tax; many other nations, including Mexico, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, have also introduced similar measures to discourage people from consuming sugary and fatty drinks and snacks. The UK, for example, introduced a sugar tax on soft drinks in 2018, which has led to a significant reduction in the consumption of sugary drinks. In conclusion, the French government's efforts to combat obesity have taken a new turn with the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks and snacks. The tax is expected to raise significant revenue for the state coffers, while also encouraging healthier eating habits. With obesity rates on the rise globally, such measures are vital to improving public health and reducing healthcare costs. The industry may not be happy with the new tax, but the greater good is often served by challenging the status quo. Only time will tell if the new tax will have the desired effect of reducing obesity rates in France, but it is a step in the right direction.
