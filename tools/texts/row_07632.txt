Suspended from the trees and accessible via a narrow wooden staircase hidden among the forest, this eco-orb suspended in the heart of the Cornish forest is every nature lover's ultimate hang out. The bauble-like tent - thought to be Britain's first ball-shaped hotel - is held 10ft in the air by two giant cables and is strong enough to sleep two people. Guests climb up to their bedroom via a narrow wooden staircase and have their own woodburner to keep their giant ball warm. The strange spherical structure, named the Lost Meadow Tree Tent, is based on early designs for airships and Zeppelins. However, some locals in Bodmin, Cornwall, have said that it looks more like a wrecking ball, a Christmas tree bauble - or even former Soviet satellite Sputnik 1. 'Glamping' firm Sawday's Canopy & Stars say the hanging retreat, surrounded by a thick thermal skin that can be peeled back in the morning for panoramic views off the forest and a river, is both lightweight and strong and was built to minimise the environmental impact on the surrounding woodland. Guests pay £95 per night and sleep in two single beds, as well as enjoying an open outdoor kitchen, sun deck living room and 20 acres of unspoiled countryside to roam around in.
