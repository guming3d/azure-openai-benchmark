Fans from across the globe are eagerly waiting for their favorite players to take the court and compete for the coveted trophy. And among them is none other than the world No. 1, Novak Djokovic. Djokovic, who has had a phenomenal run in the last couple of years, hasn't had the best start to his new season.

But, the good news for his fans is that he has recovered and is ready to take on the competition in Melbourne. In a recent interview, Djokovic confirmed that he has overcome his flu and other health issues and is feeling fit to play. He said, "I'm feeling good, I'm feeling fit, I'm feeling healthy. I'm ready to go out there and perform at my best." Djokovic also mentioned that he had been working hard during his recovery period and has been putting in extra hours of practice to make up for lost time. Djokovic is known for his tenacity on the court and his never-say-die attitude. He is a six-time Australian Open champion, and his record at the tournament speaks volumes about his ability to dominate his opponents. Djokovic has been drawn to face Slovenian qualifier Aljaz Bedene in the first round of the tournament, and he is expected to sail through with ease. However, Djokovic is not taking anything for granted, and he knows that this is just the beginning of a long and grueling tournament. He said, "I'm taking it one match at a time, and I'm not underestimating anyone. The Australian Open is a tough tournament, and anything can happen." With Djokovic feeling fit and confident, his fans will be hoping that he can continue his winning streak at the Australian Open and clinch the title for the seventh time. The tennis world is eagerly awaiting the start of the tournament, and all eyes will be on Djokovic as he takes the court on Monday.
