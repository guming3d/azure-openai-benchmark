article: NEW YORK (CNN) -- The regional airline involved in a fatal February plane crash outside Buffalo, New York, contested a report Monday alleging the pilot did not have the training to handle the emergency that brought the plane down, and that he might have been fatigued on the night of the crash. Debris is cleared from the scene of Flight 3407's crash near Buffalo, New York, in February. Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, on the night of February 12, killing all 49 on board as well as one man in the house. In a story Monday, The Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow's incorrect response to the plane's precarious drop in speed: He overrode an emergency system known as a "stick pusher," which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall. The Journal's report said Colgan had not provided Renslow with hands-on flight-simulator training for a stick-pusher emergency. Colgan, in rebuttal, issued a statement saying Renslow had received classroom instruction for such an emergency.  Watch a Colgan official respond to questions Â» . The company also emphasized that the Federal Aviation Administration does not require pilots to receive a stick-pusher demonstration in a flight simulator. "The FAA generally trains to standards of routine line operations. They don't focus on the edges of the envelope," stall recovery expert Doug Moss told CNN. Colgan further admitted that during his career, Renslow failed five "check rides" -- occasional tests of pilot proficiency -- including two that Colgan said he did not disclose on his application with the airline. His most recent failed check ride occurred 16 months before the crash. "In the cases while with Colgan, he received additional training and successfully passed the check rides," the airline said. Colgan stressed that despite his performance on check rides, Renslow nonetheless ultimately passed his pilot exams and had "all the training and experience to safely operate the Q400," the airplane involved in the crash. Colgan further insisted that pilot fatigue was not a factor in the crash, noting that Renslow had "nearly 22 consecutive hours of time off before he reported for duty on the day of the accident." In its statement, Colgan did not specifically address potential illness-related fatigue in 24-year-old co-pilot Rebecca Shaw, who, according to The Wall Street Journal report, said before takeoff that she probably should have called in sick. The National Transportation Safety Board begins a three-day hearing on the crash on Tuesday. Renslow's history as well as pilot training broadly will be examined.

chatgpt: In February of 2009, Continental Connection Flight 3407 tragically crashed just outside of Buffalo, New York. The accident claimed the lives of all 50 passengers on board. Now, a new report by the Wall Street Journal has shed light on potential shortcomings in the training of the pilot, Marvin Renslow. According to the report, Renslow did not have hands-on experience with a flight simulator prior to the crash. This type of training is considered standard practice for pilots, as it allows them to simulate real-life situations and practice emergency procedures. However, Colgan Air, the operator of Flight 3407, maintains that Renslow did receive the required classroom instruction in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. Despite the lack of hands-on simulator training, Colgan Air insists that fatigue was not a contributing factor in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had previously identified fatigue as a potential factor, pointing to the fact that the pilots had commuted to the airport from out of state and had been awake for more than 12 hours. The NTSB's investigation into the crash also found that Renslow had made critical errors in his handling of the aircraft before it went down. He had allowed the plane to slow down significantly, and then responded incorrectly when a stall warning sounded. The captain of the flight, Rebecca Shaw, had attempted to alert Renslow to the impending stall, but her efforts were too late. The families of the victims of Flight 3407 have been vocal in their criticism of Colgan Air and the FAA, calling for stricter regulations and oversight of airline safety practices. They have urged lawmakers to pass the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act, which includes provisions for pilot training and regulation of pilot fatigue. The tragedy of Flight 3407 has prompted significant changes in the airline industry, including increased scrutiny of pilot training and regulations surrounding pilot fatigue. The FAA has since implemented new rules requiring more rest for pilots and greater oversight of airline safety practices. The legacy of those who lost their lives on Flight 3407 lives on as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety in the aviation industry. As the investigation into the crash continues, authorities and the airline industry must continue to work together to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.
