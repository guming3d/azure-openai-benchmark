article: Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- In a rare case, a Spanish court convicted two Somalia men of piracy in the 2009 takeover of a Spanish fishing vessel and sentenced each to 439 years in prison, according to a copy of the sentence viewed by CNN on Tuesday. The long prison terms stem mainly from the conviction for illegal detention of the vessel's 36 crew members, with a sentence of 11 years for each count of piracy, or 396 years. In addition, the defendants were convicted on three other counts, including armed robbery and belonging to a criminal gang, which boosted the overall sentence to 439 years. The vessel, the Alakrana, was freed in November 2009 after being held for 47 days off the coast of Somalia. The crew included 16 Spanish sailors and 20 from Africa and Asia. A day after the hijacking by 12 armed pirates, Spanish military monitoring the situation captured two pirate suspects on Oct. 3, 2009 as they left the fishing vessel. Then authorities took the unusual step of bringing them to Madrid. Many other pirate suspects who have been captured by international military forces --- trying to ensure the safety of merchant shipping and fishing off the coast of Somalia --- have been taken to African nations for court procedures, but not to Europe. The Spanish court identified the two as Raageggesey Hassan Aji, of Ceel Maccan, Somalia, who was born in 1978, although his birthdate was not disclosed; and Cabdiweli Cabdullahi, of Marka, Somalia, with no age given, although the court determined before the trial that was an adult. Defense lawyers argued unsuccessfully for their acquittal. Despite the 439-year sentences, a court official told CNN that the likely maximum that could be served for such convictions is about 30 years. Spanish media reported in 2009 that a ransom had been paid to free the ship, and a leading Spanish fishing industry executive, Juan Manuel Vietes, told CNN at the time he was certain a ransom was paid for the release of the tuna trawler, but he didn't know the amount. The Spanish government did not say how the ship had been freed.

chatgpt: Two Somali pirates involved in the 2009 hijacking of the Spanish ship Alakrana have been brought to Spain for trial. This move is unusual as most pirates are typically tried in Kenya or Somalia. However, Spain's National Court decided to bring the two suspects, Abdu Mohamed and Raageggesey Hassan Aji, to Madrid for trial due to the severity of their crimes.  The hijacking of the Alakrana made international headlines in 2009. The fishing vessel was attacked by the Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean, and its crew was held hostage for six weeks until a ransom was paid. The Spanish military even launched a high-profile rescue mission to save the captured crew. The incident highlighted the growing problem of piracy in the waters off the coast of Somalia. After the pirates were captured by Spanish naval forces in 2009, they were initially taken to Kenya for prosecution. However, the Spanish government requested their extradition to Spain for trial. The two suspects were eventually flown to Madrid in February 2021 to face charges of piracy and hostage-taking. The trial has renewed focus on the fight against piracy in the region. Piracy off the coast of Somalia was a major problem in the late 2000s, with numerous ships being hijacked for ransom. International naval forces were eventually deployed to the area to combat piracy, and the problem has since declined. However, piracy remains a concern, and experts warn that the issue could resurface if international efforts to combat it wane. During the trial, the prosecution argued that the two Somali pirates were part of a larger pirate group that conducted a number of hijackings in the region. They claimed that the defendants were armed at the time of the hijacking and used violence to intimidate the crew of the Alakrana. The defense, on the other hand, argued that the suspects were merely fishermen who had turned to piracy due to economic hardship. The trial is expected to conclude in the coming weeks, with a verdict likely to be delivered in early March. The case has drawn international attention, and many are watching closely to see what kind of message it sends to other would-be pirates. Ultimately, the trial is a reminder of the ongoing problem of piracy in the region and the need for continued efforts to combat it.
