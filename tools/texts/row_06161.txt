article: Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- NATO's North Atlantic Council on Sunday approved an operations plan that will shift the entire Libyan military mission to alliance command, officials said, easing the burden on the United States and its allies to protect civilians in the war-torn country. NATO ambassadors unanimously approved a so-called "no-fly plus" plan that will put the alliance in charge of protecting civilians as well as enforcing a no-fly zone and an arms embargo. "Our goal is to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack from the Gadhafi regime," NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. "NATO will implement all aspects of the U.N. resolution. Nothing more, nothing less." The new NATO mandate will begin in two to three days, NATO officials said, allowing the current coalition, led by the United States, the United Kingdom and France, to stand down. At the same time, NATO was putting the final touches on its takeover of the no-fly zone over Libya. The handover from the United States and allies should be complete by Monday. NATO officials described the transition as a phased and seamless operation. All alliance members will have to abide by the rules of engagement approved Sunday, albeit with caveats that may allow some nations not to participate in operations in Libya. However, it is assumed that none of these nations will prevent other alliance members from executing the military plan and rules of engagement that were approved. A senior U.S. administration official spoke to reporters soon after the announcement. He stressed the NATO mission is to protect civilians and did not rule out the possibility of an attack on the rebels if they were to go on the offensive and strike cities with civilian populations, now held by pro-Gadhafi forces. The official also said he expected more countries to participate in the Libyan mission now that NATO has assumed command of it. He praised the speed with which the group of 28 allies reached a consensus. The office of British Prime Minister David Cameron similarly cheered the news of a NATO agreement. "NATO is already enforcing the arms embargo and the no-fly zone. Today's agreement to transfer complete command and control of all military operations to NATO both ensures that partners from the region are able to participate and represents a significant step forward as we plan for the next phase of this vital mission," it read.

chatgpt: After weeks of discussions and negotiations, NATO has agreed to take over all military operations in Libya. The transition is expected to take place in the next two to three days, with the United States getting the transition it has been advocating for. The alliance will take over from the current coalition that includes the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. The aim is to better coordinate the airstrikes against the Gaddafi regime and to ensure that the no-fly zone is effectively enforced. NATO is also set to take over the no-fly zone by Monday, a move that has been welcomed by many in the international community. The enforcement of the no-fly zone has been an ongoing challenge for the coalition, with several incidents of aircraft violating the zone. This announcement comes days after Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg spoke in Brussels, where he highlighted the need for NATO to take on a larger role in the conflict. He stressed the importance of European allies sharing the responsibility and the burden in the ongoing conflict. "The situation in Libya remains complex and fluid,” Stoltenberg said. “But NATO is ready to take on this mission. This is an important step in the efforts of the international community to bring peace and stability to the region." The move has been praised by those who support the intervention in Libya, with many saying that NATO's involvement will make operations more effective and coordinated. However, the move has been criticized by some who believe that NATO may end up getting embroiled in another conflict in the region. The conflict in Libya has been ongoing since the beginning of the year, with anti-Gaddafi rebels looking to overthrow the country's longtime leader. The situation has been complicated further by the involvement of foreign powers, with different countries supporting different factions in the conflict. The United States has been leading the coalition efforts in Libya, with France and the United Kingdom providing support. However, the United States has been eager to transition operations to NATO, which has more experience in military operations of this nature. With NATO set to take over operations, many hope that the conflict will come to an end soon. However, the situation remains complex, and it's unclear what the future holds for Libya. In conclusion, NATO's decision to take over all military operations in Libya is an important step in the ongoing conflict. The transition is expected to take place in the next few days, with the United States getting the transition it has been advocating for. NATO's involvement is expected to make operations more effective and coordinated, but there are concerns that the move may result in further conflict in the region. Nevertheless, the international community sees this as a positive step towards restoring peace and stability in Libya.
