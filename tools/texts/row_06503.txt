article: (CNN) -- Some 5,000 residents in eastern Pennsylvania were allowed to return to their homes Saturday afternoon, some 12 hours after they were evacuated when a tractor-trailer carrying 33,000 pounds of toxic hydrofluoric acid overturned after the driver tried to avoid a deer, authorities said. Traffic is backed up Saturday after a truck spilled hydrofluoric acid in eastern Pennsylvania. State police identified the driver as Raymond Leblanc, 54, of Harrow, Ontario, Canada. Leblanc, who initially was trapped in the truck, was taken to a hospital where he was treated and released. Police said a passenger in the truck was unhurt. No other injuries were reported. The truck flipped over on its side and slid along northbound State Road 33, which was closed in both directions from Belfast to Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, from the time of the early-morning accident until about 6 p.m. Saturday. Most of the acid in the tank was in the form of pressurized gas, but there also was some water, said Northampton County spokesman John Conklin. State and federal hazardous materials experts stopped the leak by noon. The wreck occurred at 3:30 a.m. near Wind Gap. Conklin said many evacuees -- those living within a mile of the accident site in Plainfield Township -- went to a shelter set up at nearby Pen Argyl High School in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania. A dispatcher with the Northhampton County Division of Emergency Management said residents were allowed to begin returning to their homes about 3:45 p.m. Saturday. Hydrogen fluoride is a hazardous chemical compound used mainly for industrial purposes such as etching glass, and is extremely corrosive. It also is an ingredient in high-octane gasoline, refrigerants, aluminum and light bulbs. Contact with concentrated solutions can cause severe burns, according to medical authorities. Inhaling the gas causes respiratory irritation, severe eye damage and pulmonary edema.

chatgpt: Thousands of evacuees were allowed to return home just 12 hours after being evacuated due to a potentially hazardous acid spill. The incident occurred on a roadside in Alberta, Canada, when a tractor-trailer carrying hydrofluoric acid overturned after the driver attempted to avoid hitting a deer. The leak from the highly corrosive acid was promptly stopped, and emergency responders worked tirelessly to ensure the safety of people in the surrounding area. Police, firefighters, and environmental officials all responded to the scene where the accident took place. They were able to quickly contain the situation and prevent the acid from spreading or contaminating any nearby water sources. Around 5,000 people were evacuated from their homes and businesses as a precautionary measure. However, thanks to the quick and efficient work of the emergency services, these evacuees were able to return home just 12 hours later after the acid spill was brought under control. The authorities were praised for their rapid response, which ensured the safety of residents in the area. Hydrofluoric acid is commonly used in industries such as nuclear power, refining, and electronics. It is extremely dangerous and can cause severe burns, respiratory problems, and even death. As such, handling it requires the utmost caution and expertise. While accidents involving hazardous materials such as hydrofluoric acid can be extremely dangerous, they also serve as a reminder of the vital role emergency responders play in keeping their communities safe. In this case, the response was swift and effective, allowing residents to quickly return to their homes and businesses without incident. However, it also highlights the importance of proper training and preparation for such emergencies. First responders must remain vigilant and ready to act at a moment's notice to protect the community from harm. When they do, as they did in this case, they deserve our gratitude and thanks.
