article: President Barack Obama has thrown his acting IRS commissioner overboard, making Steven Miller the highest-ranking political casualty thus far in a series of scandals that have swept his administration in recent weeks. In a hastily called press conference in the East Room of the White House, Obama told reporters that he had asked Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to find out who was responsible for a program that targeted tea party groups and other conservative organizations for a special level of intrusive questioning after they applied for tax-exempt charitable statuses. 'Lew took the first step by requesting and accepting the resignation of the acting director of the IRS,' Obama said. 'It’s important,' he added, 'to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward.' But in an email to IRS employees, Miller claimed he would only be leaving next month because his assignment would be over. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Steven Miller is shown in a CBS report.

chatgpt: In a dramatic turn of events, Steven Miller, the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), announced his departure from the agency in a face-saving email sent out to his staff. Miller's exit comes in the wake of a scandal involving the targeting of right-wing organizations by the IRS while allowing left-wing groups to slide through with minimal scrutiny. According to reports, the IRS allegedly targeted nearly 300 conservative groups in the years leading up to the 2012 elections. The agency, tasked with enforcing tax laws, subjected these groups to heightened levels of scrutiny, including long and intrusive questionnaires and lengthy delays in the processing of their applications for tax-exempt status. The controversy, which has rocked the IRS and the Obama administration, has led to widespread calls for accountability and the resignation of those involved. In a statement released on Tuesday, President Obama said that the IRS's conduct was "inexcusable," and that "Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it." Obama's remarks came as the Treasury Department announced that Jacob Lew, the president's trusted Treasury Secretary and former chief of staff, had given Miller his walking papers. In a statement, Lew said that "the IRS deserves an acting commissioner who can ensure that the agency is fulfilling its mission to enforce the nation's tax laws fairly and impartially." Miller, who took over as acting commissioner in November 2012, wrote in his email that his "assignment ends in early June," and that he would be stepping down to avoid being a "distraction" as the IRS faces intense scrutiny over its handling of tax-exempt applications. The email, which was obtained by several news outlets, was written in a conciliatory tone, with Miller thanking his colleagues for their dedication and hard work. He also acknowledged the "difficulties and mistakes in the IRS's handling of tax-exempt applications," but maintained that they were "in no way the result of any political or partisan motivation." Despite Miller's attempts to put a positive spin on his departure, the controversy shows no signs of abating. Congressional committees have launched inquiries into the matter, and the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the allegations of misconduct. Critics of the Obama administration have seized on the scandal as evidence of political bias and abuse of power in the IRS, with some calling for a complete overhaul of the agency. Others, however, have cautioned against jumping to conclusions and have called for a thorough investigation into the matter. The IRS, meanwhile, has pledged to cooperate fully with any inquiries and to take steps to ensure that its operations are transparent and free from bias. As the controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what impact it will have on the IRS and the Obama administration's broader agenda. But one thing is clear: the fallout from this scandal will be felt for some time to come.
