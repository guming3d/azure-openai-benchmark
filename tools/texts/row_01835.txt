TransPac issued a statement Friday afternoon that said two of its instructors died in the crash. The business said it wasn't immediately releasing the names of the two men or any personal information about them 'out of respect for the families during this time of sadness and grieving.' The plane that burned reportedly was registered to an aircraft leasing company that has an office at Deer Valley Airport. Several bystanders reported seeing the Cessna and Piper collide but the flight directions of the planes before the crash or other details weren't immediately available, authorities said. 'Both of them collided. We don't know how or what,' said Phoenix Fire Department Capt. Larry Nunez. 'The skies are clear.' An initial report said three people were killed and two people were injured.

chatgpt: Four adults were killed in a plane crash that occurred at 10 a.m. north of Phoenix, according to officials. Among the victims were two flight instructors, who were in the small plane with two other adults.  The cause of the crash has not yet been determined and an investigation is underway by the National Transportation Safety Board. The names of the victims have not been released by officials, as they are waiting to notify their family members. The small plane crashed in a remote area, making it difficult for rescue crews to reach the scene. The crash site is located near Daisy Mountain, which is a popular hiking destination for locals and tourists alike. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the small plane flying low before it vanished from sight. The witnesses tried to locate the aircraft and found the wreckage after a 90-minute search. The crash resulted in a post-impact fire, and the plane was destroyed. The Federal Aviation Administration also launched an investigation into the crash, which will focus on the aircraft's mechanics and pilot error, if any. Officials from the FAA inspected the crash site and reviewed the aircraft's maintenance paperwork and flight training records. The news of the crash has shocked the community, especially those who knew the flight instructors who were among the victims. The two instructors were experienced pilots with years of experience in teaching new pilots on how to fly small planes.  The aviation community has expressed sorrow over the loss of the experienced instructors. They were well-known and respected members of the aviation community, and their loss has left a void in the industry.  The crash is a reminder of the dangers that come with flying small planes, especially in remote areas. Proper maintenance and training, along with adherence to safety protocols, are crucial to ensuring the safety of passengers and crew. As the investigation continues, officials will work to determine the cause of the crash and try to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Until then, the community will mourn the loss of the flight instructors and the other victims who lost their lives in the tragic accident.
