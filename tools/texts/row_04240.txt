chatgpt: Legendary rock band The Who is ready to kick off their 50th-anniversary tour, but frontman Roger Daltrey has some concerns about today's concertgoers. Daltrey, who is now seventy years old, revealed in a recent interview that he "feels sorry" for the people who attend gigs and get lost in their phones instead of being fully present at the show. Daltrey's opinion is shared by guitarist Pete Townshend, who admitted that he always embraces new technologies but finds it difficult to come to terms with mobile phone viewers. According to Townshend, having people hold up phones to video-record or take photos throughout the concert creates a distracting atmosphere and hinders the live experience. The Who members are no strangers to pushing technological boundaries. From their early days with power amplifiers and feedback sounds to their later use of synthesizers and studio effects, the band has always played with new sounds and ideas. However, seeing phone screens shining back from a sea of concertgoers is an unfortunate development. Townshend believes that young people should be mindful that live performances are a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and they should not miss the chance to immerse themselves in the moment. Daltrey echoed this sentiment, pointing out that it is essential for the audience to appreciate the atmosphere of the concert, the lighting, the music, and each other. For The Who, their 50th-anniversary tour is a celebration of their career so far, and they want their fans to be a part of it fully. They have promised a vibrant and exciting show, complete with old hits and new songs from an upcoming album. Fans can expect a high-energy, explosive performance, and if they can put down their phones for a few hours, they might just have an unforgettable experience.  In conclusion, while technology has made many things better and more convenient, it has also had some unforeseen drawbacks. Keep your phones down and enjoy the music when you see The Who on tour.
