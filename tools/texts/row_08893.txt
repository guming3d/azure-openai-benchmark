article: (CNN) -- New Zealand woke up to a giant collective hangover Monday as the rugby-mad nation savored its triumph in the World Cup final in Auckland. No matter the 8-7 final win over France was more notable for perspiration than inspiration, the All Blacks had finally laid a 24-year-old hoodoo since their victory in the first-ever World Cup in New Zealand in 1987. Despite being the No.1 ranked international team for most of the intervening years, success on the ultimate stage eluded successive All Blacks teams. The nadir perhaps was the failure of the 2007 team, who fell victim to an inspired French team in Cardiff in the quarterfinals. But also long in the memory were defeats in the 1995 final to South Africa and semifinal defeats in 1999 and 2003. But Graham Henry's men, badly missing the influence and the accurate boot of injured fly-half Dan Carter, held on for a one-point win in the lowest scoring final in the tournament's history.

For four million New Zealanders, the manner of the victory mattered not a jot, a welcome diversion in a year which began with the Christchurch earthquake disaster and continued with a mining disaster and nasty oil spill in the Bay of Plenty. After the final at Eden Park, New Zealand were named team of the year in the International Rugby Board annual awards and Henry was coach of the year. Player of the year was the French captain Thierry Dusautoir, who did his best to spoil the All Blacks' party with his second half try. On Monday, captain Richie McCaw his team paraded the William Webb Ellis Trophy through the streets of Auckland on an open top bus with an estimated crowd of 200,0000 in attendance. Similar celebrations are planned for Christchurch and Wellington on Tuesday and Wednesday.

chatgpt: Thousands of jubilant fans lined the streets of Auckland on Monday to celebrate the All Blacks' Rugby World Cup win. The victory capped a long, intense campaign for the national team, and brought joy to fans across the country.  New Zealand defeated France 8-7 on Sunday at Auckland's Eden Park, clinching their first title since 1987. The win was all the more impressive given the well-documented injury problems that plagued the team in the lead-up to the tournament.  As the players made their way through Auckland in open-top buses, fans waved flags and cheered them on. The mood was electric, with many fans expressing their delight at being a part of history. "It's amazing to be here and see the team and the cup," said one fan. "New Zealand has waited a long time for this."  The celebrations in Auckland were just the beginning. Similar events are planned for Christchurch and Wellington in the coming days, with fans keen to show their support for the national team. The All Blacks have become a symbol of resilience and determination for many people in New Zealand, and their success has brought the country together.  Graham Henry, coach of the All Blacks, was named coach of the year by the International Rugby Board (IRB). The accolade was no doubt well-deserved given the team's success over the past few months. The All Blacks also won IRB Team of the Year.  "Being World Cup champions is a moment to savour and it has been fantastic to see the joy and excitement that it has brought to New Zealanders," said IRB Chairman Bernard Lapasset. "The All Blacks have been supreme and thoroughly deserve their status as the best team on the planet."  For many fans, the celebrations were a much-needed distraction from the ongoing recovery efforts following the devastating earthquake in Christchurch earlier this year.
