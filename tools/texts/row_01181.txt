article: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two blasts went off Wednesday as the governor of Helmand province was headed to Kandahar to take part in the funeral for President Hamid Karzai's half-brother. The remotely-detonated mine explosions in Kandahar's Maivand district wounded two soldiers but the Helmand governor,  Mohammad Gulab Mangal, was unhurt, his office said. Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Kandahar provincial council chief, was killed Tuesday by a guard during a gathering at his house a day earlier. He was laid to rest Wednesday, with the president in attendance, said Hashim Watanwal, a Kandahar lawmaker. Saidkhan Khakrezwal, a member of the Kandahar provincial council, told CNN he and others were with Karzai when a guard named Sardar Mohammad came into the room and asked to talk to him. The guard then "takes Wali to another room and shoots him with a pistol that he had in his hand," Khakrezwal said. The shooter was shot dead by other guards. Sardar Mohammad was a trusted man who had worked as a guard for Karzai for eight years, Khakrezwal said. He was also a commander for a police post where there were about 30 policemen. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying that the guard accused of shooting him was working for them. Karzai suffered bullet wounds to his head and chest, said Mohammad Dawood Farhad, the head of Kandahar Hospital. "My brother Ahmad Wali Karzai was killed today," said the Afghan president in a previously scheduled news conference with visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy. "The Afghanistan people have suffered a lot. Every Afghan family has suffered. I hope one day these sufferings end." Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been dogged by drug dealing and corruption accusations, had been the subject of WikiLeaks cables leaked last year. Without being prompted, he discussed the accusations with a senior U.S. diplomat, according to one of the cables. He said that the claims are part of a campaign to discredit him and offered suggestions on how to stop drug dealing. "He is willing to take a polygraph anytime, anywhere to prove his innocence," the cable said. "He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin, which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation." A U.S. official who authored another cable wrote that even though he must be engaged as head of Kandahar's provincial council, "he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker." He said Karzai's "reputation for shady dealings" should be considered when he recommends "costly infrastructure projects. The official said dealing with people like Ahmed Wali Karzai represents a major challenge in Afghanistan: Fighting corruption and building support for government when government officials are corrupt themselves. Karzai "appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities, and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign, particularly relating to his influence over the police," the author of the first cable said. Journalist Reshad Fazel contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Kandahar, Afghanistan - The president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, attended the funeral of his brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, on Wednesday. The ceremony was held in Kandahar, where Ahmed was shot and killed on Tuesday. Reports indicate that a trusted guard of Ahmed's was responsible for the attack. The Helmand governor, Naim Baloch, was also present at the funeral but escaped unharmed. Two soldiers, however, were injured in the blast. It is believed that the shooter was a trusted member of Ahmed's security detail, according to a provincial council member. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack and said that the guard was working for them. Ahmed Wali Karzai was a prominent figure in south Afghanistan and a half-brother of President Ghani. He was assassinated by the shooter who was wearing a suicide vest at his home on Tuesday. The attack has sparked concerns about the security situation throughout Afghanistan, particularly as the country prepares for presidential elections later this year. The funeral was attended by a large number of people, including tribal elders, government officials, and members of the security forces. President Ghani and other politicians spoke at the event and stressed the need to continue the fight against insurgent groups such as the Taliban. "This tragic event has shaken us all, but it gives us more resolve to fight against terrorism and bring peace to our country," President Ghani said in his address to the mourners. The Afghan government has been struggling to maintain security in the country, particularly in areas where the Taliban and other extremist groups are active. The situation has been further complicated by a rift between the Afghan government and the United States over peace talks with the Taliban. The US has been engaged in negotiations with the Taliban in an effort to end the 18-year-long war in Afghanistan. The Afghan government, however, has been left out of the talks and has expressed concerns that any agreement could undermine the country's security. In the wake of the attack on Ahmed Wali Karzai, security has been stepped up throughout Kandahar, and additional measures have been put in place to protect high-profile government officials. The Afghan security forces have also launched a massive search operation to identify and apprehend those responsible for the attack. There are fears that the violence could escalate in the coming weeks and months, particularly as the country gears up for the presidential elections. The Taliban has vowed to disrupt the polls and has carried out several high-profile attacks in recent months. The attack on Ahmed Wali Karzai has once again highlighted the fragility of security in Afghanistan and the challenges faced by the government in maintaining stability in the country. The situation is expected to remain tense in the coming weeks as the search for the shooter continues, and the government grapples with the question of how to deal with the ongoing insurgency.
