article: A woman who admitted she lured a University of New Hampshire student to her apartment as a sex offering for her domineering boyfriend and then helped dispose of the woman's body after he killed and raped her has been denied parole today. Parole was denied on Thursday for 21-year-old Kathryn McDonough who was sentenced in July 2013 to 18 months to three years in prison for lying to police. She was sentenced after her boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia strangled and raped 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott, of Westborough, Massachusetts, at the couple's Dover apartment in October 2012. McDonough told jurors that Mazzaglia, 32, was angry at her when she left him home for two nearly weeks without a sex partner and demanded that she bring him another woman to join in their sexual escapades, which included bondage and discipline.

'I also have a lot of sympathy for the situation she was in and what she was put through by that person we just sent to jail.'

chatgpt: Kathryn McDonough, the woman who was sentenced to 18 months to three years in prison for lying to police about the murder of Elizabeth Marriott, was denied parole on Thursday. McDonough had been involved in the murder of Elizabeth Marriott along with her boyfriend, Seth Mazzaglia.  Mazzaglia was convicted of first-degree murder in 2014 and is currently serving a life sentence without parole. McDonough, on the other hand, had entered into a plea deal with prosecutors in exchange for her testimony against Mazzaglia. Her plea deal reduced her sentence to 18 months to three years in prison for her involvement in the murder. During the trial, McDonough testified that Mazzaglia had strangled Marriott to death after attempting to initiate sexual contact with her. She also confessed to helping Mazzaglia dispose of Marriott's body. McDonough's testimony was crucial in the conviction of Mazzaglia.  At the parole hearing, McDonough requested that she be granted parole, arguing that she had since completed all the necessary programs and demonstrated good behavior while in prison. However, the New Hampshire parole board denied her request, stating that McDonough had not shown enough remorse for her role in the murder.  The parole board also expressed concerns that if McDonough were to be released, she could pose a risk to society. The board cited several reasons, including her prior lack of willingness to accept responsibility for her actions, her delay in coming forward to law enforcement, and her participation in the disposal of Marriott's body.  McDonough's attorney argued that his client had provided crucial testimony that helped convict Mazzaglia, and that she had accepted responsibility for her actions. He also stated that McDonough had expressed remorse and had taken steps to better herself while in prison.  Despite these arguments, the parole board ultimately decided that McDonough's release would not be appropriate at this time, in light of the seriousness of her crime and the potential risk to public safety. McDonough will remain in prison, and her next opportunity for parole will be in 2021. The case of Elizabeth Marriott's murder was a shocking and tragic event that left many people reeling. McDonough's involvement in the crime and subsequent testimony against Mazzaglia have been the subject of much controversy and debate. While some argue that McDonough's cooperation with law enforcement was crucial in securing a conviction, others believe that her actions were unforgivable and that she deserves to remain in prison for the duration of her sentence.  As the years continue to pass, the memory of Elizabeth Marriott and the events surrounding her murder will continue to weigh heavily on those who were affected by this terrible crime. The decision to deny Kathryn McDonough's parole only serves as a reminder of the gravity of her actions and the impact they had on the lives of those involved.
