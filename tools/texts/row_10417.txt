article: By . Richard Spillett . A driver pulled over when he saw title of Adele's song 'Fire' flash up on his dashboard and panicked . A worried driver pulled onto the hard shoulder of a motorway after seeing the word 'fire' flash up on a dashboard display - only to discover it was the title of the song playing on his car stereo. The mix-up, caused by the title of the hit song by Adele, is one of number of incidents highlighted in a safety campaign to stop people needlessly causing a hazard on Britain's roads. The Highways Agency, which is in charge of the UK's motorways, has revealed some of the most bizarre excuses for pulling over in a bid to remind people that it is illegal to stop on the hard shoulder unless in an emergency. On one occasion, traffic officers found two cars on the hard shoulder, with one driver halfway through his vehicle to the other. On another occasion, a couple were asked if they had broken down but replied that they were taking pictures of their newborn grandchild in their open-top sports car because it was 'a lovely day'. Other instances have included: . :: A motorist who parked up and fell asleep on the M6. :: A group of motorcyclists who parked on the hard shoulder on the M1 to review their route and have a drink. :: A mobile phone user who stopped at regular intervals to carry out signal tests on the hard shoulder. The agency said that between July and September 2013, a total of 2,062 drivers broke the law by stopping on the hard shoulder when there was no emergency.. It is also illegal to drive under a red X sign which is displayed when the lane ahead is closed. Highways Agency national enforcement co-ordinator Jamie Hassall said: 'Every day, millions of people use our motorways. 'Most of them use the hard shoulder correctly and don't ignore red Xs, but we are appealing to the few who put themselves, other road users and those working on motorways at risk. 'Where the hard shoulder is used as an additional traffic lane at peak times, you can only drive on it if there is a speed limit over it. When a red X is displayed over any lane, it's simple - don't drive on it.' Drivers are being reminded that stopping on hard shoulders is illegal unless done in an emergency. File photo .

chatgpt: The Highways Agency has urged motorists to heed the rules of the road after a number of hilarious motoring gaffes were revealed. One driver was so panicked that he thought his car was on fire after seeing a song title on his dashboard. The title, “Light My Fire” by The Doors, led him to jump out of his car and call the emergency services.  Other blunders included drivers mistaking an airport runway for a motorway, and a man who tried to retrieve his hat from a busy highway by running after it. The Highways Agency has expressed concern that drivers are becoming increasingly oblivious to the rules of the road, putting themselves and other road users in danger. A spokesperson for the agency said, “We understand that driving can be stressful and confusing, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the roads. However, it is vital that all drivers understand their responsibilities when using UK motorways. We recommend that drivers take the time to familiarize themselves with the Highway Code and follow the rules to ensure a safe journey.” The Highway Code is a comprehensive guide to road safety in the UK, covering everything from traffic signs to speed limits. It is essential reading for anyone using the roads in the country and can be accessed online or in print. The Highways Agency has released a series of tips for drivers, including staying in the left-hand lane unless overtaking, keeping a safe distance from the car in front, and never stopping on the hard shoulder unless it is an emergency.  “We want everyone to have a safe and enjoyable journey,” said the spokesperson. “By following the rules of the road, drivers can avoid accidents and ensure that they arrive at their destination safely.” Despite the warnings, many drivers continue to make dangerous mistakes on the roads. Last year, there were over 1,500 fatalities in road accidents in the UK, with many of these accidents caused by driver error. The Highways Agency is urging drivers to take responsibility for their safety and the safety of others on the roads. By following the rules of the road and remaining vigilant at all times, drivers can help to reduce the number of accidents on UK motorways. In conclusion, it is crucial that all drivers understand their responsibilities when using UK motorways. The Highways Agency has urged motorists to take the time to familiarize themselves with the Highway Code and follow the rules to ensure a safe journey. By doing so, drivers can help to reduce the number of accidents on the roads and ensure that everyone arrives at their destination safely.
