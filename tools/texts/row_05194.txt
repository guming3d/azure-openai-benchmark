Earlier this week, at least 19 people were killed by Syrian rebel fire on government-controlled parts of Aleppo. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the dead included at least five children, three of whom were killed with their mother when a rocket hit the car they were in. The Britain-based group said at least 32 people were also wounded in Thursday night's rocket attack in the western part of the city. And on Friday, three people including a pregnant woman were killed by a ground-to-ground missile fired by government forces at a rebel district in eastern Aleppo, the Observatory said. Aleppo was once Syria's economic hub, but the city has been ravaged by fighting that began in middle of 2012. The city is divided with government forces controlling the western part and rebels controlling the east. However, government forces have advanced steadily around the eastern outskirts of the city, threatening to besiege opposition-held districts. More than 200,000 people have reportedly been killed in Syria since the beginning of the conflict in March 2011. Responsible for providing aid and security, the group, controlled by the Free Syrian Army, carry weapons as they walk the streets of Aleppo .

chatgpt: An all-female battalion in Syria called the Mother Aisha group is providing much-needed aid and security in the war-torn city of Aleppo. The group, armed and in camouflage, patrols the streets and manages two field hospitals and a police station for female detainees. The Mother Aisha group was formed to support the Free Syrian Army in their fight against President Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria's civil war. The group is composed of women from different walks of life who took up arms to defend their homes and loved ones. According to Captain Farah, the leader of the Mother Aisha group, the decision to join the fight was not an easy one. "We were forced to take up arms because we had no other choice. We had to protect our families and our communities," she said. The Mother Aisha group has become a symbol of hope and strength for the people of Aleppo. They have taken it upon themselves to provide aid and security for their fellow citizens, particularly women and children. The group manages two field hospitals that provide medical care to those injured in the ongoing conflict. They also run a police station for female detainees that is staffed entirely by women. This provides a safer environment for female prisoners, who are often vulnerable to abuse and violence. Captain Farah is proud of the work that the Mother Aisha group has accomplished so far. "We have been able to make a difference in the lives of our people. We are grateful for the support we have received from our community and from the Free Syrian Army," she said. Despite the dangers they face every day, the members of the Mother Aisha group remain committed to their cause. They have become role models for young girls and women in Syria who are inspired by their bravery and determination. The Mother Aisha group has not only provided aid and security to the people of Aleppo, but they have also challenged traditional gender roles in a society that often marginalizes women. By taking up arms and assuming leadership roles, they have shown that women can be powerful agents of change in their communities. As the conflict in Syria continues, the Mother Aisha group will remain a vital source of aid and security for the people of Aleppo. Their work serves as a reminder of the resilience and determination of the Syrian people, who continue to fight for a better future despite the challenges they face.
