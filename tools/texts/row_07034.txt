article: Moeen Ali struck twice in three balls to put England in a promising position in the first match of their World Cup winter but failed to capitalise as Sri Lanka responded from a slow start. Moeen, who learned the previous day that he will replace Alex Hales in this fixture as Alastair Cook's new opening partner, made his mark on proceedings with the ball by taking the wickets of Niroshan Dickwella and then Dinesh Chandimal for a second-ball duck. On a stodgy pitch after a rain-delayed start which reduced the match to 43 overs per side, the hosts - a line-up containing nine international players - won the toss and moved to 66 for three after 15.

Ali is congratulated by Eoin Morgan having taken three early wickets to put England on top in Sri Lanka . Steven Finn provided England's early breakthrough, with a very good delivery which had Kaushal Silva edging behind on the front-foot defence. The accurate Chris Woakes had a stifling effect with a first spell of 4-1-3-0. It remained hard going for the batsmen as England turned to off-spin at both ends - and even after opener Kusal Perera lofted Moeen over long-on for six off the final ball of the 10th over, the total was still only 28 for one. Opener Kusal Perera hit a half century to put Sri Lanka in control but fell to Steven Finn for 56 .

Dickwella helped Perera add 44 for the second wicket, before a sweep at Moeen resulted in a tumbling catch for James Tredwell at short fine-leg. Then Moeen made short work of former Sri Lanka one-day international captain Chandimal, who pushed forward and edged straight to Cook at leg-slip. Chris Jordan made a poor start at the other end, though, conceding 11 in his first over and then 14 in his second - including three wides, a no-ball and Perera's free-hit for six over long-on. Sri Lanka responded thanks to the efforts of Jeevan Mendis, 40 not out, and Ramith Rambukwella reaching 30 as the hosts finished on 198 having been in a precarious position at 122 for six.

chatgpt: In their warm-up match against Sri Lanka A, England edged out the hosts by four wickets. Off-spinner Moeen Ali put on a strong performance, taking three wickets including Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal. Ali and pacer Steven Finn helped restrict Sri Lanka to a mere 122-6 in their innings. However, Sri Lanka launched a strong response through the middle order, scoring an impressive 76 runs unanswered. England found themselves chasing a revised target of 198 after Sri Lanka A's innings was reduced to 43 overs. Opening for England were captain Alastair Cook and Ali. The pair started off slowly, scoring just five runs in their first three overs. But with the pitch settling down, they picked up the pace and put on 52 runs for the first wicket. Cook was finally dismissed for 38, caught by Kusal Mendis off the bowling of left-arm spinner Chaturanga de Silva. Ali, on the other hand, kept going and finished with a match-winning innings of 72 off just 71 deliveries. His knock included eight boundaries and a six. Ali shared another important partnership with Joe Root, who made 27. Their 65-run stand helped England get closer to victory before Root was dismissed with the score at 129-2. Sri Lanka's bowlers then took three quick wickets, but England held their nerve and sealed the win with four wickets and 11 balls to spare. Earlier, it was Ali and Finn who did most of the damage for England with the ball. Finn, who missed the Sri Lanka Test series due to injury, made a strong comeback by taking two wickets in his first over. Ali then picked up the wickets of Chandimal and Seekkuge Prasanna to leave the hosts reeling.  However, Sri Lanka fought back with a strong partnership between Kusal Perera and Mahela Udawatte. Perera made 39 runs off just 22 deliveries, hitting five boundaries and a six. Meanwhile, Udawatte made a patient 34 off 49 balls, and together they took the score to 98-3 in the 15th over. When Perera was dismissed, Sri Lanka's middle order crumbled as they lost three wickets for just six runs. But tail-ender Isuru Udana hit a quick-fire 27 off just 15 deliveries to help Sri Lanka reach a competitive total of 198-9 in their 43 overs. Overall, it was a good match for England as they got crucial match practice ahead of the ODI series against Sri Lanka. Ali's all-round performance was the highlight of the match, and he will be one of England's key players in the upcoming series. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will be disappointed with their batting collapse in the middle overs, and will need to work on their consistency ahead of the ODI series.
