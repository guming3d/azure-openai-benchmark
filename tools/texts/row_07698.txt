Sales of traditional British apples are being pipped to the post by a crisp, sweet interloper from the other side of the world. As homegrown favourites such as Cox’s Orange Pippin and Granny Smith decline in popularity,  shoppers cannot get enough of Jazz apples from New Zealand, whose sales are growing faster than any other variety. Demand for the Jazz, which was first grown commercially in 2004, has risen 89 per cent in four years, from 5,449 tons in 2009 to 10,320 in the past 12 months. Sales: Demand for the Jazz has risen 89 per cent in four years, while sales of traditional favourites have fallen . In contrast, sales of Cox’s Orange Pippin, which was created in Buckinghamshire in 1825, have fallen by more than 30 per cent in four years, from 43,420 tons to 30,031. The fall of the Granny Smith has been even greater, with sales down 40 per cent since 2009, falling 24,500 tons to 35,069. In fact, the Jazz – a cross between the biggest sellers, the Royal Gala and the Braeburn – is becoming such a fruitbowl favourite that it is grown in orchards across Britain. The Cox’s demise will be hard for traditionalists to swallow. The sweet-smelling, juicy, orange-red apples have been enjoyed for generations, but they are difficult to grow and susceptible to disease, which makes them less profitable than modern varieties. The New Zealand growers behind the Jazz carefully control who is allowed to grow the trees. In Britain, the growing licence is held by Worldwide Fruit, which began the world’s largest single apple plantation programme in this country in 2006. Fall: The rise of the Jazz comes despite the fact that apple consumption in Britain has fallen for the first time in four years (file picture) The £5million project means there are now 21 British Jazz growers. Some 340,000 trees have been planted, with another 275,000 to follow by 2018. The rise of the Jazz comes despite the fact that apple consumption in Britain has fallen for the first time in four years, following a 15 per cent rise in prices. Total sales in the year to the end of June 2013 were 491,000 tons, down by 32,000 in a year. Favourites: Sales of traditional British apples, such as Granny Smith (left) and Bramley (centre) are being pipped to the post by the Jazz apple (right) Gary Harrison, of Worldwide Fruit, said: ‘Consumer demand for apples is changing, moving away from traditional varieties. ‘Jazz offers the consumer a superior, consistently excellent eating experience, shelf life of over four weeks and an ability to purchase all year round if they wish to do so. ‘From a grower’s point of view, the returns per hectare exceed pretty much any other apple.’

chatgpt: According to recent data, the demand for the Jazz apple variety has increased by a staggering 89% over the past four years. This comes as welcome news to orchards that have been struggling to keep up with demand for the crisp and juicy fruit. The Jazz apple, a cross between the Gala and Braeburn varieties, has become a firm favorite among consumers due to its sweet and tangy taste, and its versatility in the kitchen. It can be eaten on its own, used in cooking, or juiced for a healthy beverage. In contrast, sales of the Cox's Orange Pippin variety have decreased by more than 30% over the same period. This news will be a disappointment to growers of this classic apple, which has been popular for over 150 years. The Cox's Orange Pippin is known for its rich, sweet flavor and has been a staple in fruit baskets and pies for many generations. Another once-popular variety that has seen a dramatic fall in sales is the Granny Smith apple. Since 2009, sales of this tart and crunchy fruit have plummeted by 40%, leaving growers searching for new ways to revive interest in this classic variety. Experts point to several reasons for the differing fortunes of these apple types. One factor is changing consumer tastes, with many people seeking out newer, more exotic fruit varieties. The availability of imported fruits from around the world has also increased, meaning that consumers have a wider range of options than ever before. In addition, some growers have struggled with sustainability issues, such as the impact of monoculture farming on soil health, and the need for pesticides to keep pests at bay. These concerns have prompted some consumers to seek out locally-grown produce, which may be more expensive but is seen as more environmentally-friendly. Despite the challenges, some orchards have found ways to thrive in the changing marketplace. By emphasizing the unique characteristics and flavors of their fruit, they have built a loyal customer base that values quality and authenticity over quantity. For example, apple grower Tom Brown has been producing organic apples for over 20 years. He believes that consumers are increasingly interested in the provenance of their food, and are willing to pay a premium for produce that is grown sustainably and with care. His orchard has seen a steady increase in demand for his apples, including the Cox's Orange Pippin, which he says has a unique flavor that cannot be replicated by newer varieties. Overall, the changing tastes of consumers and the challenges faced by growers mean that the apple market will continue to evolve in the years to come. However, with careful management, and an emphasis on quality and sustainability, there are opportunities for orchards to thrive in this competitive environment.
