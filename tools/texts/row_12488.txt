article: NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A landmark ruling that legalized gay sex between consenting partners in India was challenged Thursday in the country's high court, lawyers said. Activists protest against the ruling to decriminalize gay sex in New Delhi on Sunday. The supreme court issued a notice to the nonprofit Naz Foundation that had won a lower-court verdict after a seven-year legal fight to decriminalize gay sex. Notices also were issued to the federal government and the New Delhi high court, which ruled last week that consensual sex between partners of the same gender was legal. An astrologer filed a petition challenging the ruling. The petitioner argued that no constitutional right is violated by the Indian penal code's Section 377, which had outlawed gay sex, said his lawyer Praveen Agrawal. The petition also cited Indian culture and health as grounds for seeking a stay on last week's ruling, he said. The supreme court posted the next hearing for July 20. Last week's ruling meant the law -- Indian penal code section 377, which had previously criminalized consensual homosexual acts between adults -- was partly struck down but remains in place as far as forced homosexual acts are concerned. The verdict affects law enforcement all around India because it deals with a law enacted by the federal parliament. India's Ministry of Home Affairs opposed changes to the law on grounds that decriminalizing homosexual conduct would "open the floodgates of delinquent behavior."

UNAIDS, the joint United Nations program on AIDS, also applauded the ruling, saying it restored dignity and human rights. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling would eventually lead to legalization of gay marriages in the country. "This, I think, will be the next level of demand from the gay community," Jaisingh said. Jaisingh said she had fought for legalization of homosexuality for seven years on behalf of the Naz Foundation. The group says its "primary aim is to improve the sexual health and human rights of marginalized males who have sex with males, their partners and families in South Asia and elsewhere." Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh leaders had warned that they will oppose moves to decriminalize homosexuality.

chatgpt: India's historic ruling last year partially legalizing consensual gay sex has been challenged in the country's high court. The ruling had struck down part of a law that had criminalized homosexual acts. However, leaders of major religions in India, including Christian, Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, are opposing the decriminalization of homosexuality. In September 2018, India's Supreme Court had deemed the section 377 of the country's penal code unconstitutional. The section had imposed a penalty of up to 10 years in prison for any sexual acts deemed "against the order of nature". The ruling was celebrated by the LGBTQIA+ community across India, who had long campaigned for their rights. However, a group of individuals, including some religious leaders, have filed a petition in the high court in January this year, seeking to re-criminalize homosexual acts. The group, which includes representatives of some of India's major religions, argued that homosexuality was "unnatural" and against "the cultural and traditional values of India." They also claimed that decriminalizing homosexuality would encourage "immoral behavior" in society. The petition has sparked a debate in India, with many questioning the role of religion in shaping the country's laws. Some argue that LGBTQIA+ rights are a matter of personal choice and freedom, while others believe that homosexuality goes against traditional Indian values. The Indian government has not yet taken a stand on the issue. However, the ruling party, Bharatiya Janata Party, has been criticized for its lack of support for LGBTQIA+ rights. The party has previously opposed the 2018 ruling, arguing that it was a matter for parliament, not the judiciary, to decide. The LGBTQIA+ community in India has expressed concern over the challenge to the 2018 ruling. They fear that if homosexuality is recriminalized, they will once again face persecution and discrimination. Activists have called for widespread support for their cause, and have urged the government to take a stand in favor of decriminalizing homosexuality. The high court is expected to hear arguments from both sides before making a decision on the matter. It remains to be seen whether the court will uphold the 2018 ruling or re-criminalize homosexual acts. In a country that prides itself on its diverse and multicultural heritage, the challenge to the decriminalization of homosexuality has once again brought to light the clash between traditional values and modern freedoms. It is now up to the courts and the government to decide the fate of the LGBTQIA+ community in India.
