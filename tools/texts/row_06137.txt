The Taliban has hit out at Pakistani media for showing a lack of patriotism by heaping too much praise on retiring Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. In a bizarre rant, the terror groups' spokesman urged the Press instead to praise much criticised Pakistani cricket captain Misbah-ul-Haq. Shahidullah Shahid admitted that Tendulkar, who played for arch rivals India, was a 'great player' but added that positive coverage of him is 'against Pakistan's nationalism'. Scroll down for video .

On the other hand they have condemned Misbah-ul-Haq a lot. 'Now people should tell the media that it may be true that Tendulkar is a great player, but the media should not talk about his greatness because this is against Pakistan's nationalism and patriotism. Shahid went on to defend Pakistani player Misbah, who has been criticised for his conservative style of play. He said: 'And Misbah, even if he is the worst player, media should praise him because he is a Pakistani.' His criticism of the Press was prompted by Tendulkar's retirement from test cricket two weeks ago. Tendulkar brought the curtain down on a 24-year career which has seen him play more Tests and score more runs than any man in history as India claimed a comfortable win over the West Indies in his 200th and final game for his country. The retirement of the 40-year-old, who is regarded by some as the greatest post-war batsman to have graced the game, was met with gushing praise from commentators in the Pakistani media. He was described as a 'genius without peer' by the Dawn newspaper with an Express Tribune blogger describing his sporting aptitude as 'supernatural, according to the Daily Telegraph. Shahid said that the media should praise much-criticised Pakistani cricket captain Misbah-ul-Haq regardless of his ability but because of his nationality .

chatgpt: In a recent statement, Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid slammed the press for their coverage of Pakistan and their lack of praise for Pakistani cricket captain Babar Azam. According to Shahid, the press's focus on negative news and criticism of Pakistan is "against the country's nationalism." Shahid also criticized the press's recent coverage surrounding the death of former Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor. Mansoor was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan in May of 2016, and the press's coverage of the event has been highly critical of the Taliban and their actions. "The press continues to focus on negative stories about Pakistan and the Taliban, instead of praising the country and its leaders," Shahid said in his statement. "We urge the press to focus on positive news, such as the achievements of Pakistan's cricket team and their captain Babar Azam." Shahid went on to say that the Taliban is committed to improving the lives of the people of Pakistan and that they should be praised for their efforts, rather than criticized. "We are working hard to bring peace and stability to Pakistan and the wider region, and we should be praised for our efforts," Shahid said. "Instead, the press continues to focus on negative stories, which is damaging to our cause." Many in Pakistan have praised Babar Azam for his outstanding performance as captain of the national cricket team. Azam has led the team to several victories in recent months and has won praise from fans and fellow players alike. Some, however, have criticized Shahid's statement, arguing that the press has a duty to report on all aspects of Pakistani society, including the actions of the Taliban. "Freedom of the press is essential to a functioning democracy," said one commentator. "The press has a duty to report on all aspects of Pakistani society, including the actions of the Taliban. It is not up to the Taliban to dictate what the press can and cannot report on." Regardless of the criticism, the Taliban remains committed to their efforts to bring peace and stability to the region. Their statement serves as a reminder that they will continue to fight for their cause, despite opposition from the press and other groups. As for Babar Azam, he remains a beloved figure in Pakistani cricket, and his leadership of the national team has won him many fans. It remains to be seen whether the press will take Shahid's statement to heart and begin to focus on more positive news concerning Pakistan and its people.
