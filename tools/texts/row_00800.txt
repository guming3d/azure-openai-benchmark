David Cameron last night warned Iran is a ‘threat to the world’ and Britain will not ‘learn to live’ with the regime getting nuclear arms.

Prime Minister: David Cameron speaks at the annual United Jewish Israel Appeal dinner in London last night . Mr Cameron spoke out at an influential dinner for the Jewish community in London as the European Union imposed new sanctions on Tehran. These will see a crackdown on banking, energy and trade links. In his toughest attack on the government in Tehran to date, Mr Cameron told the annual dinner of the United Jewish Israel Appeal that the regime’s ‘claim that its nuclear programme is intended purely for civilian purposes is not remotely credible’. He added: ‘Iran is not just a threat to Israel. It is a threat to the world. ‘Now there are some who say nothing will work – and that we have to learn to live with a nuclear-armed Iran. I say we don’t and we shouldn’t. But at the same time I also refuse to give in to those who say that the current policy is fatally flawed, and that we have no choice but military action.’ Discussion: The Prime Minsiter said he told Israeli premier Binyamin Netanyahu (pictured yesterday in Jerusalem) now is not the time to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities . With sources in Israel warning that it is gearing up for a military strike, Mr Cameron added: ‘We need the courage to give these sanctions time to work.’ 'In the long term, if Iran makes the wrong choice, nothing is off the table' Prime Minister David Cameron . But in a sign that he might be prepared to sanction military action in future, he added: ‘Let me also say this. In the long term, if Iran makes the wrong choice, nothing is off the table.’ Mr Cameron said sanctions are biting to such a degree that some Iranians are now ‘beginning to question the regime’s strategy’ with ‘even pro-regime groups protesting at the actions of the Government’. Foreign ministers in Brussels have also agreed to ban the export of naval equipment and raw materials such as graphite to Iran in an attempt to make it harder for the regime to develop a nuclear arsenal. Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘The EU’s message today is clear: Iran should not underestimate our resolve.’

chatgpt: British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke at a well-attended dinner hosted by the Jewish community in London last night, where he addressed the ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel. His most notable statement was directed towards Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, where he advised him to hold off on any immediate plans to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities. Cameron stated that the current situation does not warrant any immediate military action, and emphasized the importance of diplomatic negotiations between the two nations. He expressed optimism for the future, stating that there could be a chance for air strikes if Iran does not come to the negotiating table. Tensions between Israel and Iran have been high for years, with both nations accusing each other of pursuing nuclear weapons, which they deny. Israel has previously launched airstrikes on Iranian facilities in Syria, and has been contemplating a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities for some time. The United States has been urging restraint from both sides, and has pushed for a diplomatic solution to the issue. Cameron's statement is crucial as Britain is one of the closest allies of the United States and Israel, and has been a partner in imposing sanctions on Iran. Cameron's statement comes at a time when Iran has resumed its nuclear enrichment program, in violation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The JCPOA was signed in 2015 by Iran and the P5+1, which included the US, UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany. The plan was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions. However, in May 2018, the US pulled out of the deal, and tensions have been escalating ever since. Iran has since been violating the terms of the agreement, and has resumed enriching uranium beyond the limits set by the JCPOA. This has sparked increasing concerns from Israel and the US, who fear that Iran could be on the brink of developing nuclear weapons. Cameron's statement comes at a time when Israel is contemplating a military strike against Iran's nuclear sites, and tensions are at an all-time high. His advice to Netanyahu to hold off on any immediate military action and focus on diplomatic negotiations could ease the tensions between the two nations. The Prime Minister's statement has been well-received by the Jewish community, who have been vocal in their support for Israel in the past. It remains to be seen how this will impact Israel's decision-making regarding a possible military strike, but Cameron's words could have a significant impact on the situation. In conclusion, David Cameron's words have been seen as a ray of hope in the ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel. His advice to Netanyahu to hold off on any military action and focus on diplomatic negotiations could be a game-changer in the coming weeks. The stakes are high, but as Cameron emphasized, there is still hope for a diplomatic solution to the issue.
