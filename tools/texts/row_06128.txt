article: The Premier League is set to unveil a new European cup competition which will see English Under-21 teams take on continental opposition this season. Sportsmail can exclusively reveal that the top eight clubs from the U21 Premier League — including Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea — and eight including Celtic from other countries will make up the 16-team tournament. The initiative is all part of the Elite Player Performance Plan introduced in 2011 to improve the standard of young players the top English clubs are producing.

England: Chelsea, Fulham, Leicester City, Man City, Man Utd, Southampton, Sunderland, West Ham. Europe: Celtic, Athletic Bilbao, Benfica, Borussia Monchengladbach, Schalke, FC Porto, PSV Eindhoven, Villarreal . Liverpool, who finished runners-up in last season’s Under 21 development league, have not taken up the opportunity, giving West Ham, who finished ninth, the chance to step in. The competition will run parallel to the revamped domestic Under 21 league. That now carries the added interest of promotion and relegation and will see both Sky Sports and BT Sport televise 10 matches live. The organisers are hopeful matches will attract good crowds and it is expected clubs will field their best young players just below first-team level. Schalke academy director Oliver Ruhnert helped produce four of Germany’s World Cup winning squad and is one of Europe’s most respected authorities on youth football. He jumped at the chance to enter his Under 21 side. ‘This is a fantastic new initiative and the Premier League have been very good in setting it up,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘You need to expose your players to different types of football and different countries in front of foreign crowds.’ Opportunity: It will provide a chance for England's best youngsters to test themselves in Europe . Triumph: Chelsea youngster Lewis Baker celebrates the winner in the final against Manchester United in May . Teams will be allowed to field three players over the age of 21. The format comprises four groups of four with the winners and runners-up advancing to the quarter-finals. All knockout games will be played over two legs and it is hoped the clubs’ main stadiums will be used for matches. The competition is designed to expose prospects to foreign opposition and take them away from the staid, behind-closed-doors environment of domestic youth football which has been criticised in recent years. There will, however, be no commercial opportunities during the inaugural season of the Premier League's new European cup and they are keen for it to be seen as a development opportunity; no prize money will be awarded to the winners, for example. Meanwhile, the name of the competition is yet to be decided, as is the venue for the final.

chatgpt: The Premier League is set to introduce a brand-new cup competition this season, which will see England's Under-21 teams fight it out against European opposition. The tournament, which is yet to be named, will include some of the biggest sides in the country, including Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea. Fans across the country are eagerly anticipating the new event, which will provide an exciting opportunity for young English players to gain valuable experience against some of the continent's top teams. The competition is part of the Premier League's wider strategy to offer more opportunities for young players to develop and compete on an international stage. The format of the tournament is set to be a group stage, followed by knockout rounds, with matches to be played across the UK and Europe. The exact schedule is yet to be confirmed, but it's expected to take place during the international breaks throughout the season. The inclusion of some of the Premier League's biggest clubs means that the competition is likely to attract huge crowds and generate significant interest from football fans. Manchester United, in particular, are expected to field a strong side in the tournament, with a number of their exciting young players looking to make their mark on the European stage. Manchester City and Chelsea are also expected to be strong contenders, with both clubs focusing heavily on youth development in recent years. It's likely that the tournament will provide an opportunity for some of their brightest young stars to demonstrate their talents and catch the eye of potential suitors from around the continent. The Premier League's new competition could also have wider implications for European football, as the format provides an alternative to the existing UEFA Youth League. While the UEFA tournament provides opportunities for young players to compete against their peers from across Europe, the Premier League's new cup is likely to offer a more challenging experience against more established and experienced opposition. The Premier League's determination to create more opportunities for young players has been widely welcomed across the game, with many seeing the new tournament as a positive step towards developing the next generation of English footballers. The success of the tournament could provide a blueprint for other leagues across Europe, as they look to introduce more opportunities for their own young players to develop and compete. Overall, the introduction of the Premier League's new cup competition promises to be an exciting development for English football. With some of the country's biggest clubs, as well as a host of talented young players, set to be involved, the tournament is sure to provide plenty of excitement and entertainment for fans across the continent.
