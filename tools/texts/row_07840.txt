chatgpt: Former swimming coach Greg Hodge has been accused of inappropriate conduct with two teenagers back in the 1980s. The women made the allegations against Mr. Hodge, claiming that the incidents occurred at Sutherland swim club where he used to work. The accused was a coach at the Aquadot Swim Club located in Sydney's southern suburbs, where he allegedly made advances towards the two girls. The NSW police have confirmed that they are investigating the allegations made against Mr. Hodge. According to the victims, both of them were underage when Mr. Hodge allegedly touched them inappropriately. They said that they first met him when they were training at the Aquadot Swim Club. They have also stated that Mr. Hodge was their coach at the time of the alleged incidents. Both women have shared their stories with ABC News, where they talked about the impact these incidents have had on their lives. They explained how it has affected them emotionally and how it has taken years for them to gather the courage to come forward about the allegations. The Aquadot Swim Club where Mr. Hodge was a coach at the time, issued a statement expressing their shock over the allegations made against him. The club has pledged to fully support the police in their investigation. Meanwhile, Mr. Hodge's lawyer has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing on his client's part. The lawyer stated that Mr. Hodge "adamantly denies all of these baseless allegations" and that he would defend himself against the allegations made against him. This isn't the first time that allegations of this nature have been made against an Australian swimming coach. In 2019, another swimming coach, Kyle Daniels, was found guilty of having sexually assaulted a teenage girl who he had been coaching. He received a six-year jail sentence for his actions. The swimming community has yet again been rocked by this latest scandal involving a former coach. While the investigation continues, the victims are hopeful that justice will be served and that their allegations will be taken seriously.
