article: (CNN) -- An international football player has been found guilty of making a homophobic gesture during a league game by an English court. Colin Kazim-Richards, who represented Turkey at the 2008 European Championship finals, was convicted following the incident while he was playing for English second division team Blackburn, the UK Press Association reported on Wednesday. It took place during a Championship game away to Brighton on February 12, 2013. The 27-year-old, who now lives in Turkey and plays for Bursaspor, heard prosecutor Simon Allen contend that he had mimicked pulling down his shorts, putting his left arm behind his backside before making a homophobic gesture at Brighton fans. He was fined £750 ($1,256), ordered to pay £620 ($1,039) court costs and a £75 ($125.60) victim surcharge, PA reported. Brighton, a city on the south coast of England around 50 miles from London, has a large gay population and its players and supporters have often been subjected to homophobic abuse. On Tuesday, Sussex Police reported that three people were arrested for homophobic chanting during Brighton's game at Leicester. Kazim-Richards, who had previously played for Brighton between 2005-2006, made the gesture after being taunted by home supporters who claimed he was overweight. Darren Hastings, a witness in the trial, said he noticed Kazim-Richards make the gesture four or five times during the match. "It was utterly disgusting," Hastings told the court, PA reported. "I understand that football players receive a number of gestures or comments from the crowd but I certainly did not expect to see a football player perform that gesture on the pitch." A second witness, Daryl Cannon, who was at the stadium working at the game on the day, also voiced his disgust at the gesture, PA reported. He was particularly surprised given Kazim-Richards' work with Kick it Out -- an anti-discriminatory body which aims to eradicate racism and homophobia within football. "I perceived it as a very wrong thing to do, particularly for someone who's involved with the Kick It Out Campaign," Cannon told the court. "Racism and homophobia are on the same level."

chatgpt: Former Turkey international Colin Kazim-Richards has been found guilty of making a homophobic gesture during a match earlier this year. The striker, who currently plays for Derby County, has been ordered to pay a fine and costs following the incident. Kazim-Richards was accused of making the derogatory gesture during a game against fierce rivals Nottingham Forest in March. The incident was caught on camera and quickly went viral on social media, sparking widespread condemnation. The footballer had denied the charge, but a court heard evidence from a witness who claimed the gesture was clearly intended to be insulting. The witness, who was present at the match, told the court that Kazim-Richards had made the gesture towards Forest fans in response to repeated homophobic chants. The judge in the case, who described the gesture as "unacceptably offensive", said he had no doubt that Kazim-Richards had intended to cause offence. He also noted that the player had a previous conviction for making a racist gesture during a match in Turkey in 2013. Kazim-Richards, who has also played for clubs including Blackburn Rovers, Galatasaray and Feyenoord, was fined £750 and ordered to pay £1,000 in costs. The player, who has 41 caps for Turkey, is currently playing for Derby County in the English Championship. In a statement following the verdict, Kazim-Richards expressed regret for his actions and apologized to anyone who had been offended. He said he had reacted to the homophobic chants in a moment of anger and had not meant to cause offence. "I understand that my actions were unacceptable and that I have let myself and my club down," Kazim-Richards said. "I would like to apologize to anyone who was offended by my gesture and assure them that it will never happen again." The incident has reignited the debate about homophobia in football, with campaigners calling for tougher sanctions against players who engage in discriminatory behavior. Some have also criticized the Football Association for not doing enough to address the issue.
