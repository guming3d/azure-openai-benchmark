Neighbours raised the alarm after spotting them using bins to climb up on to the balcony of the home in Ipswich, Suffolk. Caught in the act: Slowik, left, and Majewski, right, were each jailed for a year for pretending to be asleep when police raided a house they were burgling . When police arrived they found a trail of destruction throughout the property which led them to the bedroom. Inside, the two Polish men were pretending to be asleep in bed. Officers also found a torch under a cot. Slowik and Majewski, a carpenter, were each jailed for a year by Judge Rupert Overbury at Ipswich Crown Court. Det Insp Eamonn Bridger, of Suffolk Police, said: 'Officers arrived to find a messy search had been carried out at the address with items of property tipped from drawers and cupboards gone through. 'In a child's bedroom the two men were found on a bed, pretending to be asleep. 'A torch was located under a cot in the same room and the two were arrested on suspicion of burglary.' Jailed: The two dozy burglars were each jailed for a year at Ipswich Crown Court, pictured, after they were caught pretending to be asleep in the home they ransacked . He added: 'Both were taken into custody where they were interviewed in connection with the incident and, while both gave "no comment" interviews, both were subsequently charged and remanded in custody.' Slowik, of Ipswich, and Majewski, of no fixed address, admitted burglary with intent to steal on August 11. Jailing them, Judge Overbury said luckily the family was not at home at the time of the raid. The judge told the hapless pair: 'This was a premeditated burglary. 'Fortunately upstanding members of the community saw what you were doing and contacted the police. 'You were caught in the flat and you lied about your reason for being there.' Michael Warren, defending Majewski, said his benefits had been stopped a fortnight before the break-in, leaving him in financial trouble. Mr Warren said the crook had downed a 'considerable' amount of alcohol on the night of the raid. Paul Donegan, for Slowik, said he had worked at a factory but now faced the sack.

chatgpt: Two men have been jailed for a year following a burglary in Ipswich, Suffolk. The incident occurred when Krzysztof Slowik, 24, and drunk Andrzej Majewski, 34, broke into a family home in the town. Neighbours raised the alarm after seeing the two men break in using wheelie bins. Police found a trail of destruction leading to a child's bedroom in the house. The pair were found pretending to be asleep in the room and were subsequently arrested. Slowik and Majewski were charged with burglary and criminal damage. During their trial at Ipswich Crown Court, the prosecution presented evidence that the two men had been heavily intoxicated at the time of the incident. The defence argued that Slowik and Majewski had not intended to cause any harm, but their actions had been the result of their inebriation. The jury ultimately found Slowik and Majewski guilty of burglary, and they were sentenced to a year in prison. The judge in the case described their actions as "despicable and reprehensible", and warned others against committing similar crimes. Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Inspector Dan Connick of Suffolk police said: "This was a frightening experience for the family involved, and we are pleased with the outcome of the trial. We urge anyone who sees suspicious activity in their neighbourhood to contact us immediately." The case highlights the dangers of excessive drinking and the importance of community vigilance in preventing crime. While many people enjoy a drink in moderation, excessive alcohol consumption can impair judgement and lead to dangerous behaviour. In recent years, there have been numerous campaigns to promote responsible drinking and to raise awareness of the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption. These campaigns have highlighted the link between alcohol and crime, and emphasised the need for individuals to take responsibility for their actions. Despite these efforts, incidents of alcohol-fuelled crime continue to occur, and the case of Krzysztof Slowik and Andrzej Majewski serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of excessive drinking. The two men will now serve a year in prison for their actions, while the family whose home they ransacked will be left to pick up the pieces.
