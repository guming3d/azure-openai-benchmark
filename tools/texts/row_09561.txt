article: Ground breaking: Male model Andrej Pejic lands his first Elle cover . He is the wildly successful male model that even Kate Moss has described as ‘beautiful.’ Now Andrej Pejic can add Elle cover ‘girl’ to his vast list of achievements as he graces the cover of Serbian Elle’s January issue. The controversial model, who has hit the catwalk dressed as both sexes, is the first transgender model ever to be on the cover of Elle. Dressed entirely in Jean Paul Gautier, the shoot features Andrej as both a man and a woman. Perhaps in a symbolic representation of his real life gender struggle, ‘female’ Andrej, dressed in black lacy lingerie and suspenders, wrestles with ‘male’ Andrej who wears a variety of dark suits. Andrej, who has appeared in other high fashion magazines including French Vogue, is a muse of Jean Paul Gautier who provided all the clothing for the ground-breaking shoot. Significantly the magazine is for Andrej’s home country of Serbia. Pejic fled to Australia as a political refugee when he was eight following the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia. Responding to controversy over his feminine looks in the past he told New York magazine: ‘My gender is open to artistic interpretation. 'I don’t really have that sort of strong gender identity - I identify as what I am. The fact that people are using it for creative or marketing purposes, it’s just kind of like having a skill and using it to earn money.' Andrej Pejic admits keeping up with his female colleagues is tough in terms of physique, but he manages to maintain his 25 inch waist through strict diet . The constant controversy surrounding him has done nothing to slow down his career. The 21-year-old is in high demand and was even chosen to model for a lingerie campaign last year. Andrej's lack of cleavage did nothing to hinder his appeal: in the poster, for Dutch department store Hema, the model advertised a push-up bra.

He has also hit the catwalk to model wedding dresses for Rosa Clara, looking every inch the feminine bride. An 'industry term' has even been invented after him: The 'Andrej Pejic effect' refers to male models who use make-up or have androgynous appeal. Andrej Pejic has graced other magazine covers previously and was crowned 'model of the moment'' by Canadian 'Fashion' magazine last year . But it's not all fun and games for Pejic, who admits he has to work hard to maintain a woman's figure. He told Grazia magazine: 'To do womenswear I have to be disciplined. My waist has gone from 29 to 25 inches, my hips are 35 inches.' Behind the scenes at the Elle photo shoot: .

chatgpt: Andrej Pejic, the 21-year-old model who has been taking the fashion world by storm with his androgynous look, has made history by becoming the first male model to feature on the cover of Elle magazine. The Serbian-born model graces the cover of Elle's Serbian edition, which is published in his home country. In the accompanying feature story, Andrej speaks candidly about his unique appearance and the challenges he has faced in the fashion industry. "I've always had an ambiguous androgynous look, even when I was a child," Andrej said in the interview. "But it wasn't until I started modelling that I realized just how unusual my appearance was." Despite the challenges he has faced as a result of his appearance, Andrej has remained determined to break down barriers and challenge traditional gender norms. "My gender is open to artistic interpretation," he said. "And I think that's something that's really exciting and liberating." Over the course of his career, Andrej has modelled for a number of high-profile brands, including Marc Jacobs, Jean-Paul Gaultier, and DKNY. He has also graced the runway at numerous Fashion Week shows, and has been featured in a number of editorial spreads in major magazines. Despite his success, Andrej has not been immune to criticism. Many have accused him of promoting unhealthy and unrealistic body standards, while others have criticized his appearances in women's lingerie and wedding gowns. But Andrej has remained steadfast in his confidence and determination to challenge traditional gender norms. "I don't really pay attention to the critics," he said. "I'm just focused on being true to myself and expressing myself in the most authentic way possible." And it's that authenticity that has made Andrej a beloved figure in the fashion industry and beyond. He has become a role model for others who are defying traditional expectations and stereotypes, and has inspired countless people to embrace their own unique identities. As more and more people push back against traditional gender norms, it's clear that Andrej Pejic is leading the charge. And with his continued success and groundbreaking achievements, he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
