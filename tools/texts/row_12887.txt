chatgpt: Michael Kelly Boyer, a security guard at a Washington-based medical facility has reportedly been fired after he was caught purchasing marijuana on live television. The incident occurred during a news segment that covered the opening of the first cannabis dispensary in Spokane, Washington. Boyer was among the individuals shown on the news segment queuing up outside the store to make a purchase. Unfortunately for him, his employers were watching the same broadcast and immediately recognized him. Following the discovery, the medical facility management asked Boyer to take a drug test and pass it within 24 hours. Boyer complied with the request, but unfortunately, his test showed trace amounts of marijuana, leading to his immediate termination. Despite the unfortunate circumstances of his job loss, Boyer appears to be taking his situation in stride. Within days of his firing, he posted his resume on Craigslist, with a headline that declared the reason for his sudden availability. In the description, he notes that "I failed a drug test for THC and weed after buying legal pot on duty, on TV. That's it." The post has since gone viral, attracting over 1000 views. But while Boyer's open honesty found amusement among many social media users, his actions have sparked a debate online regarding the use of marijuana by employees. Some users have pointed out that the drug is legal in Washington and yet Boyer was punished for using it outside of work hours. Others argue that despite the legality of marijuana, employees working in sensitive roles such as law enforcement and security should undergo regular drug tests to ensure they are clear-headed while on the job. At the same time, Boyer's firing is likely to cast a shadow of future media coverage of the cannabis industry. The implications of this story are clear: if security guards and other employees working in sensitive roles can be fired for using legally-obtained cannabis during their off time, then the legal cannabis industry risks becoming a magnet for negative news stories. In the end, Boyer may have to pay a high price for his decision to purchase marijuana on his break. His short-lived fame as a headline featuring a sacked security guard is hardly the type of attention he'd prefer. However, it would seem that the likelihood of more such stories in the future is extremely high. As state legalization of marijuana continues, so will the debate over whether employees working in sensitive positions should be allowed to use it.
