The Marquess of Bath has sparked fears amongst residents on his estate that he is planning to mine under their homes by invoking an ancient right. The colourful aristocrat claims he has the right to the minerals under vast swathes of west Wiltshire, which he argues dates back to when the title included a much larger area of land. Much of the land has since been built on or sold off but Lord Bath is claiming his Longleat Estate, which boasts Longleat Zoo, held on to the mineral rights for whatever is underneath the ground. 'Controversial' aristocrat: The Marquess of Bath has raised fears he is planning to frack on his estate after invoking an ancient right. He argues that the rights to the minerals under a vast area of west Wiltshire date back centuries . Council officials have responded by informing worried villagers how to contest the claim and tried to reassure them that fracking or mining is not an immediate concern. Heather Abernethie, town clerk in Warminster, Wiltshire, said fracking had been raised as a concern because the area is close to the Mendips which has been mooted for possible test drilling. However, she added that Lord Bath's application is a legal technicality and he would need to be granted a licence to extract gas. Longleat House (pictured) is on Lord Bath's 9,000 acre estate along with Longleat Zoo. But the aristocrat has applied for mineral rights to a larger area of land they argue was 'vested in the land owner centuries ago'. 'Residents have expressed worries that following recent publicity these letters have been sent out in order for the rights owner to have access to the mineral rights for the purposes of fracking. 'The Land Registry makes it clear that any oil or gas belongs to the Crown, not to the owners of the land, and they would have to grant licences to extract them.' She explained that until 2002, interests in mines and mineral rights existed but did not need to be recorded on the Land Register. 'However, following the Land Registration Act, the interests needed to be recorded by October 12, 2013, in order to be protected,' she said. 'Longleat believes the interest in the mineral rights has been in the ownership of the family for hundreds of years and has registered this interest accordingly.' Residents on the Longleat estate (pictured) are worried that Lord Bath plans to begin fracking as the area is close to the Mendips which has been mooted for possible test drilling. Council officials are advising them on how to respond . She continued: 'They are not seeking to create any new rights, but to protect existing ones,â€ .

chatgpt: Residents in Wiltshire are concerned about potential mining on vast swathes of land around Warminster, following an application from Lord Bath before Christmas. The aristocrat has applied to assert his right to the land, sparking concerns among locals about his intentions. Lord Bath's application has raised alarm bells among residents, with fears the land will be mined for valuable resources. The council, however, is seeking to reassure locals that the application is merely a legal technicality, intended to confirm Lord Bath's right to the land. The application, which was submitted to the Wiltshire Council, is currently undergoing review. The council officials, who are examining the application, have stressed that it is not a proposal for mining activities. They have pointed out that the legal technicality is related to an ancient right to ownership of land. The right, known as manorial rights, allows Baronet of Longleat Lord Bath to claim ownership of the land around Warminster. Despite the reassurances from the council officials, many residents remain concerned about the potential for mining activities. Some have suggested that Lord Bath's application could pave the way for extraction of valuable minerals and resources from beneath the ground. The fears of the residents are not unfounded. In recent years, Britain has seen a surge in mining and drilling operations, sparked by rising demand for minerals such as lithium and cobalt, which are used in batteries for electric vehicles. However, the council officials have reiterated that the application from Lord Bath is not related to mining activities. They have urged residents to remain calm and wait for the review process to be completed. Meanwhile, Lord Bath has remained tight-lipped about his intentions for the land. The Baronet of Longleat has made no public comment on the concerns of the residents, nor has he given any indication about his plans for the land. The potential for mining activities on the land has also raised concerns about the impact on the environment. Local environmental groups have warned that extraction of minerals could result in extensive damage to the natural surroundings, including the destruction of habitats and water pollution. Despite the concerns, the council officials have said that they will rigorously examine the application from Lord Bath, which will be subject to all relevant legislation and regulations. The review process is expected to take several months, during which time the residents will have an opportunity to voice their concerns and opinions about the application. In the meantime, the council officials have urged the residents to remain patient and refrain from making any assumptions until the review is completed. Lord Bath's application has sparked fears among residents in Warminster about the potential for mining activities on the land around the town. However, the Wiltshire Council officials have stated that the application is only a legal technicality and not related to mining activities. The review process is currently underway, and the council is urging residents to remain calm and wait for the outcome of the review.
