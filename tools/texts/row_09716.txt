article: Oops: Shawn Robinson of Alexandria, Virginia is charged with impersonating an officer after he tried to pull over an off-duty cop on Thursday . A Virginia man was jailed Thursday after authorities say he impersonated a police offer when pulled over an off-duty cop. Shawn Michael Robinson, 27, was driving a Crown Victoria on Thursday morning when he pulled up to the actual cop and shined a spotlight attached to the car inside the cop's vehicle, police say. The real cop informed Robinson of his day job leading the Alexandria man, and his passenger, to then flee, authorities told WUSA. When the off-duty officer pursued the car, Robinson allegedly then fled on foot with the passenger. Robinson would later turn himself in to police after learning a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He's now being held without bond and is due to appear in court March 4. Robinson's wasn't the only such arrest made last week. Two days later, a Florida teen was collared for impersonating a Palm Beach County Sherrif's deputy in full uniform after an officer pulled him over for running a red light. He was also driving with a suspended learner's permit. The boy's grandmother said the boy took her car without her knowledge, but she called the situation a misunderstanding, according to WPBF.com. She said the teen 'wasn't trying to impersonate anybody' and was wearing a shirt given to him by his mentors, who she said are police with the sheriff's office. The boy was heading out to meet with them when the incident occurred, she said. The grandmother said the teen, who wants to enlist in the Marines and eventually become a police officer, was in his high school's Navy Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program and was a member of the North Palm Beach police explorers.

Robinson was driving his Crown Victoria when he approached the officer, who was not in uniform at the time. However, what started as a simple encounter quickly turned into something much more serious. According to reports, Robinson pulled up to the officer and rolled down his window. The two allegedly had a brief exchange of words, at which point the officer identified himself as law enforcement. Robinson reportedly did not respond well to this news, and instead pulled out a gun and fired several shots at the officer's car. Thankfully, the officer was not injured in the altercation. However, Robinson quickly fled the scene and was able to evade police for several hours. Eventually, law enforcement caught up with him and he was taken into custody.
