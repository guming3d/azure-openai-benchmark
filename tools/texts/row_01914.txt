The striker has since gone on to have an impressive career, winning multiple domestic titles across Europe.

The outspoken Swede is no stranger to pressure, and he will undoubtedly relish the opportunity to prove doubters wrong once again. With the experienced striker in top form, PSG fans will be confident going into their opening match against Ajax. In conclusion, Andy van der Meyde's praise of Zlatan Ibrahimovic as being on the same level as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo is definitely high praise for the PSG captain. Whether or not the Swedish striker can help PSG lift the Champions League trophy remains to be seen, but fans of the club will undoubtedly be looking towards Ibrahimovic to help them achieve greatness.
