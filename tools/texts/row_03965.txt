chatgpt: Former West Ham midfielder Jack Collison came through a goalless draw unscathed as he tries to prove his fitness to QPR manager Harry Redknapp. The Hoops failed to trouble League Two side Exeter City in a pre-season friendly at St James' Park, with the game ending in a stalemate. Collison, who retired from playing at the age of 28 due to persistent knee injuries, was given a chance to impress by Redknapp. The Welshman was part of a much-changed QPR side, with Redknapp opting to give some of his fringe players a run-out. Despite the result, Redknapp will have been pleased with the fitness of his players, particularly Collison. The midfielder played the full 90 minutes and showed glimpses of the quality that made him a fans' favourite at West Ham. QPR struggled to create clear-cut chances against their lower-league opponents, and were limited to a handful of half-chances throughout the game. Exeter, on the other hand, will have been encouraged by their performance against higher-level opposition. Collison, who was released by West Ham at the end of last season after making just 121 appearances in nine injury-ravaged years at the club, has been training with QPR in a bid to earn a contract. Redknapp has been impressed by the midfielder's attitude and work-rate, but has yet to decide whether to offer him a deal. The 26-year-old may have to prove his fitness in a few more pre-season fixtures before Redknapp makes a decision on his future. QPR have several high-profile midfielders in their squad, such as Joey Barton and Sandro, and Collison would face stiff competition for a place in the starting XI. However, if he can stay injury-free and continue to impress in training and in matches, Collison could yet earn himself a deal at Loftus Road. Redknapp has shown a willingness to give players a chance, and Collison could be the latest to benefit from the QPR boss's faith in his ability. Overall, QPR's goalless draw with Exeter may not have been the result Redknapp was hoping for, but the fitness of Collison and his teammates will have been the main positive to take from the game. The Hoops will look to build on this performance in their next pre-season fixture, against Atalanta on 6 August.
