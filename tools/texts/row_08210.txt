article: Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri exhorted his fighters to find out who killed his chief representative in war-torn Syria, where militants have had a strong presence and strong rivalries amid the country's civil war. Two suicide bombers in Aleppo killed Khaled al-Suri in February when they blew themselves up inside a compound used as a headquarters. Al-Zawahiri, in a recorded message posted on a militant website and uploaded on YouTube, deplored the action and called it "sedition." "All Muslims should not help those who blow up the headquarters of the holy fighters or those who send them car bombs and human bombs, and to stop supporting it in any way," the speaker said. CNN could not independently confirm that al-Zawahiri made the remarks. But his comments in the past have shown up on the same militant website. Syria, now in its fourth year of civil warfare, has been the site of what many have called a deadly proxy war between Shiite and Sunni militants. Iran has backed Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group, has fought in support of the government. Sunni governments, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have supported rebels. Islamic militants, such as al Qaeda-linked groups, have taken up arms in the country. Rivalry and fighting have emerged between extremist groups in Syria, such al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. As a result, al-Zawahiri urged all Muslims and mujahedeen to refrain from infighting. "Whoever commits such sins should remember that he is fulfilling for the enemies of Islam what they were unable to achieve on their own with all their resources," al-Zawahiri said. Well over 100,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in the civil war, the United Nations says. READ: Opinion: Forget Ukraine, Syria is now the world's biggest threat .

chatgpt: Syria has been in the grip of fierce civil war since March 2011 that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and forced millions to flee their homes. This conflict has pitted the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against a loose alliance of rebel groups, ranging from moderate factions to hard-line Islamist organizations. However, some experts see the conflict as a proxy war between the Sunni and Shiite branches of Islam. The situation in Syria has become increasingly complex due to the involvement of a plethora of non-state actors, including militias and foreign powers. One of the most prominent groups operating in Syria is al-Qaeda, the notorious Islamist extremist organization responsible for the 9/11 attacks in the United States. Al-Qaeda has historically had an antagonistic relationship with the Shiite branch of Islam, which it considers heretical. However, in a surprising move, the leader of al-Qaeda appeared to deplore the killing of one of his top representatives in Syria. This event is significant as it suggests that the group may be shifting its focus away from its traditional anti-Shiite stance and towards a more pragmatic approach to the conflict in Syria. The killing of the al-Qaeda representative in Syria is part of a wave of violence that has swept the country in recent years. The conflict is now primarily fought between the regime forces and various rebel groups, often with the support of regional and international powers. Sectarianism has also played a significant role in the war, with the regime drawing support from the country's Alawite minority, while the rebels draw from the Sunni majority. As the war continues to rage, it remains to be seen whether the various non-state actors involved will be able to come to a resolution. The conflict has already had a devastating toll on the Syrian people, and continued violence threatens to lead to even more loss of life and displacement. The international community has largely failed to address the crisis, with various factions pursuing their own interests in the region. Without a concerted effort towards reconciliation, the situation in Syria is unlikely to improve in the near future.
