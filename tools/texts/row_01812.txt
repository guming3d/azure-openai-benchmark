article: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has urged India to scale back troop deployments along the countries' shared border in order to ease regional tensions following last month's massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai.

Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in a statement made to state television Tuesday that India should withdraw its security forces to peacetime positions and deactivate air bases near the border. In return, Pakistan would pull back its troops as well, Qureshi added. But India's External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee took issue, saying New Delhi hadn't done anything to escalate the situation between the nuclear-armed neighbors. "We have not escalated any tension between India and Pakistan, so where is the question of de-escalating it?" Mukherjee told reporters. An Indian army spokesman denied Saturday that any troop mobilization was taking place but told CNN that the army was watching the situation closely. But Pakistani authorities insist they have information to show Indian troop movements along the border. Reports on Friday that Pakistan had redeployed military resources on its eastern border with India raised concerns last week. An official in Pakistan's Foreign Office said Pakistani troop movements were in response to Indian troop movements and any scale back would follow the right signals from India. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said a Pakistani official told him 20,000 soldiers had been moved from the Afghanistan border toward the Indian border. That amount, he said, was not significant, as Pakistan has a very large army. Singh said no communication had been received from Pakistan about troop movements, but added that the Indian army was always on alert. India accuses Pakistan of harboring militant organizations and claims 10 attackers involved in last month's Mumbai attacks trained at a terrorist camp in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. Militants launched a coordinated strike against luxury hotels, a Jewish center and other targets in Mumbai beginning November 26, killing 160 people. India has criticized Islamabad for not doing enough to counter terrorism, and it has accused elements within the Pakistan government and military of complicity in fueling terrorism in the region. Since the division of the subcontinent in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, including two over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- now wracked by an 18-year, bloody separatist campaign that authorities say has left at least 43,000 dead. There also was a limited border conflict in 1999 between the countries in Kashmir. CNN's Zein Basravi contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Pakistan has asked India to withdraw its troops from the border amidst growing tensions between the two nations. However, India has denied mobilizing its troops and has said that it is closely monitoring the situation. The tensions between India and Pakistan have been escalating in recent weeks, with both nations accusing each other of incursions and aggressive maneuvers. Pakistan has alleged that India has moved 20,000 soldiers from the Afghan border to the Indian border, a charge that India has vehemently denied. A Pakistan official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they had information to show Indian troop movements along the border. "We have credible information that India has mobilized troops and heavy equipment along the border," the official said. The official added that the troop movements had taken place without any prior warning or explanation. "This is a clear violation of the internationally recognized borders and could escalate the situation further," he added. India has denied the charges of troop mobilization and has said that it is keeping a close watch on developments along the border. "We have not mobilized our troops along the border with Pakistan," a spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of Defense said. "We are monitoring the situation and will take appropriate action in case of any provocation." The spokesperson added that India remains committed to peace along the border and that it expects Pakistan to reciprocate. "We urge Pakistan to maintain peace and stability along the border and refrain from any provocative actions," the spokesperson said. The tensions between India and Pakistan have always been a cause of concern for the international community. The two nations have fought several wars over the past few decades, and the situation along the border remains tense. Both India and Pakistan have nuclear capabilities, and any escalation of tensions could have serious consequences for the entire region. The international community has urged both nations to exercise restraint and seek peaceful solutions to the current crisis. As of now, the situation along the border remains tense, and both nations are closely monitoring developments. In the interest of regional stability and peace, it is hoped that both India and Pakistan will make efforts to de-escalate tensions and avoid any further provocations.
