article: A teenager tackled by a vice principal refused to drop the knives he'd used to stab 21 at his Pittsburgh-area high school, saying, "My work is not done, I have more people to kill," according to a criminal complaint released Friday. While some underwent surgery, none of the 20 fellow students and one adult stabbed died. Two victims -- one in critical but stable condition, the other in fair condition -- were still at Forbes Regional Hospital in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, on Friday, hospital spokesman Jesse Miller said. Their alleged attacker -- 16-year-old Alex Hribal -- was eventually disarmed, handcuffed and taken into custody. On Friday, Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck told CNN that Hribal is charged with 21 counts of attempted homicide, in addition to 21 counts of aggravated assault and having a weapon on school property. Hribal was denied bond after the new charges were filed, Murrysville police Sgt. Charles Tappe said. Hribal remains in Westmoreland County's juvenile detention center, even though he has been charged as an adult. The teenager stands accused of rampaging through the halls of Franklin Regional Senior High School early on the morning of April 9, using a pair of 8-inch kitchen knives  to slash those in his path. His parents and classmates insisted afterward that they didn't see the horror coming, with lawyer Patrick Thomassey describing him as a well-liked and "typical young kid" who had "never been been in trouble." Who is Alex Hribal? Authorities looking through his locker found "a document" -- dated April 6, three days before the mass stabbing -- signaling Hribal's intentions to kill, according to the criminal complaint. One part of it read: "I can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks on the faces of the students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realize their previous lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that isn't a plebeian." Franklin Regional Senior High indeed has a strong academic reputation. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, its students' average SAT scores for 2013 was 1603. The school is located in the middle-class enclave of Murrysville, a community of about 20,000 people located roughly 20 miles east of Pittsburgh. In less than five minutes, the scene at the school transformed from a regular morning to sheer terror, as students bled, screamed and -- in a few notable cases -- rallied to help one another. The rampage ended when Assistant Principal Sam King spotted the suspect holding the knives, as well as as a security guard, Sgt. John Resetar, bleeding nearby. Assistant principal who tackled suspect hailed as 'great man' According to the criminal complaint citing the school administrator, Hribal was "facing Resetar (when King) grabbed the accused from behind and took him to the floor."

chatgpt: Alex Hribal, the 16-year-old accused of carrying out a stabbing spree at a Pittsburgh-area high school earlier this month, has been denied bond. Hribal has been held in custody since the incident in which he reportedly stabbed 20 fellow students and one adult at the school. The decision to deny bond came after a court hearing in which Hribal's defense team argued that he should be released from custody pending his trial. The defense team claimed that Hribal has no prior criminal history and should be allowed to return home with his parents while he awaits trial. However, the prosecution argued that Hribal poses a significant danger to the community and should continue to be held in custody. Police Sergeant Daniel Connelly testified that after Hribal was tackled by a school resource officer during the incident, he refused to let go of the knives he was holding. Connelly also revealed that authorities later found writing in Hribal's locker indicating his aim to kill fellow students. The decision to deny Hribal bond means that he will remain in custody until his trial. Speaking after the hearing, District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. said that Hribal's actions were "premeditated" and that he had "a plan to kill a lot of people." Hribal has been charged with 21 counts of attempted homicide, as well as aggravated assault and possessing a weapon on school property. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The incident took place on April 9 at Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville, about 20 miles east of Pittsburgh. According to witnesses, Hribal launched his attack in a crowded hallway just before the start of classes. Students and teachers used chairs and fire extinguishers to try to subdue Hribal before police arrived on the scene. In the aftermath of the incident, the community has rallied around the victims and their families. Several fundraising campaigns have been launched to help cover medical expenses and other costs. The school held a "Day of Hope" event earlier this week to help the community heal from the traumatic incident. However, the incident has also sparked a debate about school safety and the prevalence of violence in American society. Advocates for stricter gun control laws have pointed to the incident as evidence of the need for tighter regulations, while opponents have argued that the issue is one of mental health rather than access to firearms. The trial is expected to begin in the coming months. Hribal faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted on all charges.
