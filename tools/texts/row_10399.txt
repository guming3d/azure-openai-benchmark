A 71-year-old woman who was stung and completely covered by a swarm of thousands of bees in Palm Desert this week is expected to recover . The attack occurred on Thursday after a Verizon employee stumbled across 75,000 to 80,000 Africanized honey bees in an underground on Lucerne Drive, inside a gated community.

The victim is said to have been visiting relatives from out of state and walking from a car about 4.40pm. She was unable to move quickly enough to escape the swarm. Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mark Williams said family members threw a blanket over the woman and rushed her inside. Lance Davis, owner of Lance Davis Killer Bee Live Removal in Palm Desert, said the victim was lucky to be alive. 'You couldn’t see her,' Davis said of the amount of bees. 'They’re quick to anger, and they are relentless in their attack.' 'If it takes the whole hive to protect against an intruder, or someone perceived to be an intruder, they will do it.' Five firefighters- three who assisted the woman and two who tried to keep others away from the scene — were also hospitalized after being stung.

The woman is believed to have suffered 1,000 stings. Davis said the bees were likely attracted to the underground vault because they were unlikely to be disturbed and because it was cool. Bees also like attics and walls for those reasons, Davis said. He removed the bees first by blowing smoke into the hive. The smoke confuses the pheromones, a secreted chemical that sends a signal to other bees to attack en masse. Davis was then able to vacuum up the bees. He them took them to his hive in Thermal and later gave them to farmers for crop pollination. Davis said anyone dealing with a similar situation should never try to kill or remove the bees themselves and to call in experts.

chatgpt: Residents of Desert Springs, California were left shaken after a swarm of thousands of bees attacked a woman and a Verizon employee inside a gated community on Thursday. The incident occurred around 4:40 pm when the two individuals opened an underground vault containing a Verizon facility. The pair were immediately set upon by the bees which had been nesting inside the vault. The attack was swift and relentless, leaving the woman with an estimated 1,000 stings. She was rushed to hospital in a critical condition whilst the Verizon employee was treated for several stings before being released. Unfortunately, the situation only escalated from there when the emergency services were called to the scene. Despite wearing protective bee suits, five firefighters who attended the incident were also overwhelmed by the swarm and suffered numerous bee stings. They were taken to hospital for treatment and are said to be in a stable condition. The attack took place within a gated community, meaning that residents were initially unaware of the situation. However, once word spread, many were left fearful and confused about what had happened. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's scary to think that something like this could happen on our doorstep. We really need to understand why the bees were there and how to prevent something like this from happening again." It is not yet known how the bees came to be in the underground vault or why they acted so aggressively towards the individuals who opened it. However, this is not the first time a swarm of bees has caused chaos in California. The state's warm climate is ideal for beekeeping, but it also means that bees can thrive in the wild, often causing problems when they come into contact with humans. The situation has also raised questions about the safety guidelines that should be followed when dealing with bees. Experts say that it is important to avoid disturbing a bee's nest or hive as this can cause them to become aggressive. They also suggest employing professional beekeepers to handle any issues with bees, rather than attempting to deal with them alone. As the investigation into the incident continues, communities across California have been reminded of the dangers of these often-unpredictable creatures. Although rare, bee attacks can be deadly, making it crucial to take precautions and stay safe around bees and other wildlife.
