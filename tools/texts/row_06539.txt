article: Sir Bruce Keogh's Government report has called for tighter laws surrounding cosmetic surgery including the introduction of insurance . The British Association of Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) is to start offering insurance to patients who undergo plastic surgery with accredited surgeons. Until now, no insurance policy for cosmetic surgery and the associated complications existed in the UK. The move comes after a Government enquiry into cosmetic surgery were published last month. Medical director Sir Bruce Keogh called for new laws to overhaul the £2.3billion sector. Two of the key demands cited in the report was for insurance to be provided by clinics and information for patients about the success rates of their surgeons. BAAPS represents the vast majority of NHS practitioners and is the only plastic surgery society to conduct a yearly audit of the procedures performed by its members. It worked with specialist insurers Lloyd’s of London to create a policy that would safeguard all patients of surgeons who are part of the association. Because all BAAPS surgeons are covered by the insurance, patients do not need to take the insurance out themselves. The price of cover will be included in their quote for the surgery. The new ‘Aesthetic Surgery Commitment’ or ‘ASC’ policy covers corrective treatment of all the most common complications of surgery, such as infection or bleeding, but also – a world first – capsular contracture, an abnormal reaction of the body to breast implants. Up to one in ten women who undergo breast enhancement may develop this condition, but historically would have had to pay for corrective surgery themselves. Sir Bruce Keogh's Government report has called for tighter laws surrounding cosmetic surgery including the introduction of insurance . BAAPS President Rajiv Grover said: ‘In line with Sir Bruce Keogh’s recommendations for more safeguards in the aesthetic surgery sector, we are [launching] a truly innovative insurance package that will further protect our patients. ‘No procedure is risk-free and ASC covers all common complications, so people undergoing surgery with BAAPS members can enjoy peace of mind that they will be looked after, in the unlikely event of any problems.’ The most popular surgical procedures are included in the policy including tummy tucks, eyelid surgery, arm lifts, breast augmentation, ‘moob’ reduction (gynaecomastia), liposuction, facelifts, pinning back ears and fat grafting. Common complications such as infection, haematoma (bleeding), seroma (build-up of fluid), nerve injury and others are also covered. Many conditions can develop a month or longer after the procedure is undertaken – and in the case of capsular contracture, it could be several months - so the policy automatically activates on the twenty-ninth day after the op and remains live for two years, as during that initial period hospitals would cover any complications.

chatgpt: The British Association of Plastic Surgeons has announced that it will offer a world-first insurance policy to patients undergoing cosmetic surgery. The move comes in response to a recent government enquiry led by Sir Bruce Keogh, which highlighted flaws in the £2.3 billion cosmetic surgery industry. The new insurance policy will cover patients against a specific complication known as capsular contracture, which can occur after breast implant surgery. Capsular contracture is an abnormal reaction of the body's immune system to the breast implant, causing a build-up of scar tissue around the implant. This can lead to painful and disfiguring breast deformities, impairing both physical and emotional wellbeing. The insurance policy will provide patients with financial compensation to help pay for any treatment required to rectify the problem. The policy has been welcomed by many leading plastic surgeons, who have called it a "game-changer" for the industry. Dr. Simon Withey, President of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons, stated that the policy was a significant step forward in protecting the interests of patients. He also expressed his hope that the policy would encourage other insurance companies to follow suit. The policy marks a significant shift in the attitudes of the cosmetic surgery industry towards patient care. The industry has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with concerns raised over the safety and efficacy of many of the procedures offered. The government enquiry led by Sir Bruce Keogh highlighted a number of areas in which the industry needed improvement, including better regulation, tighter controls on advertising, and more rigorous training for surgeons. The announcement of the new insurance policy has been welcomed by patient groups and campaigners, who have long called for greater protection for those undergoing cosmetic procedures. However, some have criticised the policy for not going far enough in addressing the broader issues facing the industry. Critics argue that the insurance policy is only a partial solution to the problems facing the industry and that more needs to be done to ensure patient safety and wellbeing. Some have called for stricter regulation of the industry, including tighter controls on advertising and better training for surgeons. Despite these concerns, many within the industry feel that the policy is a step in the right direction. They believe that it will help to protect patients from potentially devastating complications and encourage a greater focus on patient care across the industry. Overall, the announcement of the world-first insurance policy by the British Association of Plastic Surgeons marks an important development in the industry's efforts to improve patient care and safety. While there are still many challenges facing the industry, the policy represents a significant step forward in protecting the interests of patients undergoing cosmetic surgery.
