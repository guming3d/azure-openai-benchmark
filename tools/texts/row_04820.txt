article: A study found that nut-consumers demonstrated a lower body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference . Dieters often dismiss them because of their high fat content, but research suggests that snacking on nuts can help keep you slim. A study found that those who consumed varieties such as almonds, cashews and pistachios demonstrated a lower body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference compared to non-consumers. They were also at lower risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Experts are now recommending a daily intake of 1.5 ounces, or three tablespoons of nuts as part of a healthy diet. Lead researcher Carol O'Neil, from Louisiana State University, said: 'One of the more interesting . findings was the fact that tree nut consumers had lower body weight, as . well as lower body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference compared to non-consumers. 'The mean weight, BMI, and waist circumference were 4.19 . pounds, 0.9kg/m2 and 0.83 inches lower in consumers than non-consumers, . respectively.' In the study, published in the Journal of . the American College of Nutrition, researchers compared risk factors . for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome of nut . consumers versus those who did not consume nuts. They used data from 13,292 men and women . participating in the 1999-2004 National Health and . Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nut consumers were defined as those who ate more than one quarter of an . ounce a day. Tree nut - almonds, Brazil nuts, . cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and . walnuts - consumption specifically, was associated with higher levels of good cholesterol and lower risk of chronic diseases including heart disease. In addition, it was also linked to a lower prevalence of four risk factors for metabolic syndrome: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels and low good cholesterol levels. Dr O'Neil adds: 'Tree nuts should be an integral part of a healthy diet and encouraged by health professionalsâ€”especially registered dietitians.' Maureen Ternus, executive director of the International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research & Education Foundation (INC NREF), also congratulated the recent data. She said: 'In light of these new data and the fact that the FDA has issued a qualified health claim for nuts and heart disease with a recommended intake of 1.5 ounces of nuts per day, we need to educate people about the importance of including tree nuts in the diet.'

chatgpt: According to a new study, nut consumers consistently demonstrate a lower body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference than those who don't consume nuts regularly. The study, conducted by researchers at Louisiana State University, emphasizes the importance of incorporating tree nuts into a healthy diet. "There is a lot of evidence that nuts have numerous health benefits, and this study adds to that evidence," says lead researcher Dr. Carol O'Neil. "We found that people who consume nuts on a regular basis have a lower risk of obesity and other chronic diseases." The study analyzed data from over 13,000 adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The researchers found that those who consumed nuts had a significantly lower BMI and waist circumference than those who didn't consume nuts regularly. They also had a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Dr. O'Neil explains that tree nuts, such as almonds, cashews, and pistachios, are packed with healthy fats, protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients can help regulate blood sugar, lower cholesterol levels, and reduce inflammation in the body. "Tree nuts should be an integral part of a healthy diet," says Dr. O'Neil. "They can be a convenient and tasty snack, added to a wide variety of dishes, and incorporated into many different cuisines." The researchers suggest that incorporating nuts into meals and snacks can have a positive impact on health outcomes. They recommend replacing less healthy snack options, such as chips or candy, with a handful of nuts. They also suggest adding nuts to salads, oatmeal, yogurt, or smoothies for an extra boost of nutrition. Interestingly, the study found that nut consumers didn't necessarily consume fewer calories than those who didn't consume nuts. In fact, some nut consumers actually had a higher calorie intake. However, the researchers speculate that the nutrient density of nuts may help to better regulate appetite and prevent overeating. Overall, the study provides further evidence that incorporating nuts into a healthy diet can have numerous health benefits. From regulating blood sugar to reducing inflammation, the nutrients in tree nuts can have a positive impact on numerous health outcomes. So next time you're looking for a snack, consider reaching for a handful of nuts instead of something less nutritious.
