Bait and switch: Jacqueline Goldberg, 87, leaves the federal building in Chicago after testifying in a lawsuit alleging that Donald Trump cheated her in a bait-and-switch scheme . A defiant, often agitated Trump testified for two days last week and took verbal swipes at Goldberg in comments to reporters outside the courtroom in Chicago. He asserted that he, not Goldberg, is the victim, saying, "She's trying to rip me off."On the stand Monday, Goldberg said Trump wooed her into buying two condos for about $1 million apiece in the mid-2000s by dangling a promise to share profits in the 92-story building – only to snatch that offer away after she committed to buy.

"I felt like I have been conned," she told jurors. When she learned in 2008 that the profit-sharing was no longer part of the overall deal she thought she had bought into, Goldberg said she was dismayed.

During her first day on the stand Friday, Goldberg told jurors it was Trump's star power and perceived business acumen that initially drew her toward investing with him. But it was the profit-sharing proposal that, for her, sealed the deal, she said.In his testimony, though, Trump balked at the idea Goldberg didn't know what she had gotten into. He told jurors a provision in a purchasing contract she signed gave Trump the right to cancel the profit-sharing offer and that she bought the condos anyway."And then she sued me," he boomed, raising his arms. "It's unbelievable!"Testimony at the week-old trial was expected to wrap up Tuesday, after which lawyers would deliver their closings before jurors began deliberations.

chatgpt: Jacqueline Goldberg, an 87-year-old investor, has accused US President Donald Trump of removing a profit-sharing clause from a contract they signed in 2005 regarding a hotel and tower project in Chicago. The project was named Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago and Trump had promised to share profits with Goldberg, who invested millions of dollars in the project. According to Goldberg, she was promised a percentage of the profits and authorised architects to begin work on the plans for the tower. However, in 2008 she discovered that the profit-sharing clause had been removed from the contract without her knowledge. She is now seeking $6 million in damages from the president. In a deposition video from 2011, Goldberg stated: "I felt like I had been conned." She added that she had trusted Trump to fulfil his promises, but "he had no intention of sharing any profits with anyone except himself." Trump has responded to the lawsuit by branding Goldberg a "sophisticated investor" who should have known better. In a court filing, his lawyers allege that Goldberg "got what she bargained for" and that she is simply trying to "scam" Trump out of money. The president has denied any wrongdoing and is seeking to have the lawsuit thrown out. This is not the first time that Trump has faced legal action over his business dealings. In 2016, he settled a lawsuit with former students of Trump University, who claimed they had been misled and defrauded. The president has also faced criticism for refusing to release his tax returns, which many believe could reveal conflicts of interest and ties to foreign governments. Goldberg's case against Trump is likely to be closely watched, given the president's history of legal disputes and controversial business practices. The outcome of the case could have implications for future deals involving the president and his businesses, as well as for investors who may be considering doing business with him in the future. Investors who are considering working with Trump should carefully review their contracts and seek independent legal advice to ensure that they are fully protected. While Trump may be a powerful figure with a long history of business success, it is important to remember that even the most successful entrepreneurs can make mistakes and fail to deliver on their promises. It is up to investors to protect themselves and their interests by seeking out the best possible advice and legal representation.
