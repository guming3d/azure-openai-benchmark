'To be honest I was astonished when I heard it was being done, wherever it had gone I would have been delighted, but obviously it is very appropriate.' Dr Shephard was also Chamberlain at the Minster and was awarded the MBE for his service. He was kept in the dark about the carving but admitted he spotted the resemblance to himself as stonemason Matt Hodgkinson worked on it. He added: 'Having oneself immortalised on the Minster as a grotesque may not be to everyone's taste. 'But I am flattered and honoured that this piece of sculpture has been incorporated into the cathedral that has played such a large part of my life for many years.'

Rebecca Thompson, superintendent of works for York Minster, said: 'When we discovered that one of our decayed grotesques overlooking the Minster school needed replacement, incorporating a permanent tribute to Richard seemed like too good an opportunity to miss.'

chatgpt: The Minster School in York has been under the leadership of Dr Richard Shephard for an impressive 19 years. And, yesterday, a unique tribute to the outgoing headmaster was unveiled on the historic building's east face in the form of a stone caricature. The gargoyle-like figure was installed as part of renovations to the Minster, and it is certainly turning heads.  The figure is perhaps the most unusual addition to the building's exterior in recent memory. It features a doctorate hat and holds its hand as if conducting music. The tribute is a reflection of Dr Shephard's lifelong passion for music, and his time at the Minster School, where he used music as a means of engaging students in their studies.  The school community and visitors alike have been drawn to the stone figure, marveling at its intricate details and the touching tribute it represents. The stone artist, who created the caricature, worked tirelessly to ensure that it captured Dr Shephard's likeness, with its lifelike features and facial expressions.  Dr Shephard, who is set to leave the school at the end of the year, was filled with emotion as he witnessed the unveiling of the stone figure. He expressed his gratitude for the beautiful tribute, which he said was a testament to the school's commitment to the arts and to the importance of music education.  The carving of the tribute was not without controversy, however. Some members of the public expressed their dismay at the addition of a caricature to the historic building, citing concerns that it detracted from the Minster's architectural integrity. Others felt that the figure was a fitting tribute to a man who had given so much of himself to the school and to the community.  The Minster School, which serves as a beacon of academic excellence in the region, has a storied history dating back to the 7th century. Its location in the heart of the city, coupled with its unique Gothic architecture, has made it a popular tourist attraction in recent years.  The addition of the stone caricature is likely to draw even more visitors to the historic site, and it has already generated significant buzz in the media. Dr Shephard's tenure at the Minster School is coming to a close, but he will forever be remembered in stone, as a passionate educator who used the power of music to inspire generations of students.
