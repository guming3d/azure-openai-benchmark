article: PESHAWAR, Pakistan (CNN) -- As a little girl, Maria Toor Pakay would beat up boys. Maria Toor Pakay has overcome unusual adversity to rank among the world's top 100 squash players. Now, she dispenses of anyone who takes her on within the walls of a squash court. Pakay, 18, is Pakistan's No. 1-ranked women's squash player. But what makes her story remarkable is that she hails from the country's tribal region of South Waziristan. The region, along the border with Afghanistan, is home to the Taliban. There, suicide attacks are a way of life. And the militants, bent on imposing a strict form of Islamic law, punish girls who attend school -- let alone play sports. "They have no future," Pakay said. "They spend their entire lives in four walls in their home. Their ability is destroyed." But Pakay wasn't like most girls growing up. She sported a buzz cut and mixed with the boys. "If someone argued with me, I used to beat them up," she said. "I wanted them to obey me all the time." Her father, Shams-ul-Qayum Wazir, knew early on that his daughter was different. "I didn't want her talent to go to waste," he said. "If I would've kept her in the village, all she could do was housekeeping."  Watch Pakay talk about her life's mission Â» . So, Wazir packed up the family and moved to Peshawar, the capital of the North West Frontier Province. Here, Pakay picked up the racquet and swatted down the competition with ease -- first winning the Under-13 championship, then the Under-15, then the Under-17. In squash, players take turns hitting a ball to the front wall of a court, until one misses. Pakay, it turned out, rarely did. "I thought nobody could beat me," she said. "From the beginning when I played squash, I thought I could be a world champion." Today, despite the lack of a sponsor and few resources, Pakay has gone pro -- and is ranked 91st in the world. Her father's sacrifice, she said, made her success possible. "I think I have a great father -- so broad-minded," she said. For his part, Wazir -- a teacher -- was more circumspect. "I sacrificed because I want to promote a message of peace," he said. "If the tribal people pick up a racquet instead of a gun, there would be peace."

chatgpt: Maria Toor Pakay, the 18-year-old squash player from Pakistan, has been making waves in the world of professional sports. Despite coming from the troubled tribal region of South Waziristan, where the Taliban and other militant groups have imposed strict Islamic law and denied girls basic education and health care, Pakay has not let these obstacles deter her. Growing up, Pakay loved playing squash, but her dreams of becoming a professional player seemed impossible in her remote hometown. In 2007, she and her family were forced to flee to Peshawar, the capital city of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. There, she continued her training and met her coach, Jonathan Power, a former world champion squash player from Canada. Despite her talent, Pakay struggled to find a sponsor in Pakistan, and her family could not afford to support her training and travel costs. But she persisted, and in 2009, at just 16 years old, she turned pro. Today, Pakay is Pakistan's No. 1-ranked women's squash player and ranked 91st in the world, according to the Professional Squash Association. Pakay's success has not come without risks. In conservative parts of Pakistan, women who participate in sports face threats and discrimination. Pakay has received death threats from Taliban militants who oppose her playing against Western female players, whom they deem to be morally corrupt. But Pakay remains undeterred. She has become a symbol of hope for women in Pakistan who want to break free from gender barriers and pursue their passions. She has also inspired others to support women's sports in the country. In a recent interview, Pakay said, "I want to see more girls in Pakistan playing squash and other sports. I want them to know that they can dream big, that nothing is impossible." Pakay's perseverance and dedication have earned her the respect and admiration of many in Pakistan and around the world. Despite the challenges she has faced, she continues to inspire others to pursue their goals and passions, no matter the obstacles. With her talent and determination, Pakay is sure to continue making strides in women's squash and beyond.
