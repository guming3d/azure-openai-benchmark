article: Swine flu may be inspiring fear worldwide, but for Stephan Zielinski of San Francisco, California, it inspired a song. The genes underlying swine flu inspired one amateur musician to compose music based on it. The virus has the classification H1N1 because it includes two key viral proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Zielinski took the genetic sequence of a variant of hemagglutinin and created a computer algorithm to turn it into music. Zielinski, 41, is not a biochemist or a professional musician -- he's a writer, photographer, computer programmer, and blogger who creates music in his spare time. But he's fascinated that, even though biologists can map the genome of the virus and predict what the hemagglutinin protein looks like, the human body still cannot distinguish it as the "bad guy" -- at least, not until there's a vaccine. Listen to the song . "Although the map is there and you can even make a song out of it, we can't explain it to these itty bitty little cells in body," he said. Using computer programs he created himself, as well as a commercial product, Zielinski composed his song by assigning instruments and musical notes to various properties of the protein. Zielinski took the various categories of amino acids, the building blocks of the protein, and assigned each a different instrument -- piano, organ, low synthesizer, percussion. The melody was created by assigning notes to specific amino acids. Each beat of the song also corresponds to one of numerous amino acids. The work was done entirely with a computer and took about six hours Tuesday, he said.  Learn more about swine flu Â» . He first learned of the sequence through an immunologist friend at the Mayo Clinic, he said. Zielinski saw it as a form of highly organized information that a human did not design. "The only way I could look at that and make sense of it, since I'm not a biochemist, was, well, I could try translating it into another very organized form of information that people do, and then see if I could hear anything. And the answer, of course, turned out to be no." But even if the mystery of the virus did not reveal itself in musical form, the result is a curiously melodic, innovative, somewhat soothing work. Dr. Jay Steinberg, infectious disease specialist at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, called it "nice ambient music" that's reminiscent of Brian Eno. Less methodical swine flu songs are also emerging on YouTube. User "CelicaAaron" parodies the Jonas Brothers' song "Lovebug," crooning, "I can't get your snout out of my mouth / I'm sick to my stomach all the time." A short spoken-word effort by user "Micfri" warns, "You know who has swine flu? Pigs!"

chatgpt: In a unique intersection of music and science, Stephan Zielinski has composed a song that is based on the swine flu gene. The song not only takes inspiration from the virus but also uses an algorithm that assigns instruments and notes to specific amino acids. The result is a hauntingly beautiful piece of music that captivates listeners. Zielinski is a composer who has always had an interest in genetics. In an interview with a local newspaper, he said that he was fascinated by how genes work and how they influence our lives. He believes that music is also a form of genetics, where notes and melodies come together to create a unique expression. Inspired by his curiosity, Zielinski decided to create a song that is based on the swine flu gene. He used an algorithm that assigned musical notes and instruments to specific amino acids. The result was a mesmerizing melody that took inspiration from the virus but was also unique in its own way. The song has garnered a lot of attention on social media, with many YouTube users posting swine flu songs that they have created. Some have even created remixes of Zielinski's song, adding their own twist to the melody. The popularity of these songs has sparked a renewed interest in the swine flu virus and its impact on society. Many doctors and scientists have also expressed their appreciation for Zielinski's work, stating that it has helped to shed light on the importance of genetics and its role in our lives. They believe that this unique approach to science and music has the potential to inspire others to explore the intersections between different fields of study. Zielinski's composition has also raised questions about the role of music in science and how it can contribute to our understanding of complex scientific concepts. Some believe that music can be a powerful tool for communicating complex ideas to a wider audience, while others argue that it can oversimplify scientific concepts and lead to misunderstandings. Despite the debate, Zielinski's work has opened up a new avenue for exploration and collaboration between different fields of study. It has also inspired many musicians and scientists to think outside the box and experiment with new ideas and approaches. In conclusion, Stephan Zielinski's song based on the swine flu gene is an innovative and thought-provoking piece of music that has captured the attention of many. Its unique approach to science and music has opened up new avenues for exploration and collaboration between different fields of study. As the popularity of swine flu songs continues to grow, it is clear that this intersection between science and music has the potential to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.
