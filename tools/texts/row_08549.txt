article: Have an idea for an unusual trip but don’t have the funds to pay for it? This could be the site for you. A South African company has started a global crowdfunding travel website, aiming to raise the cash for those who can't afford to go on the holiday of a lifetime. Mark Karimov, the CEO of Trevolta, said he wants to make travel more accessible and use crowdfunding as the means to make the dreams come true. Trevolta the crowd-funding site. You, too, can get other people to pay for your trip of a lifetime . ‘The idea is to make travels more accessible to people. It’s not a secret that most people don’t travel because it’s expensive,’ he said. ‘At Trevolta we allow people to raise funds for their travels using crowdfunding and sponsorships. Friends, family, inspired people can back the trip and make it a reality.’ And while some seem a little self-indulgent – taking a trip on Route 66 – and others appear a little overly optimistic– feeding the homeless in ten European countries – there are many worthwhile projects that people are trying to raise funds for. Users have between 10 and 90 days to get their money but any cash you do raise, you get to keep (unlike other crowdfunding sites) although Trevolta will keep 5 per cent plus Paypal will take another 3.9 per cent. Not getting his kicks: One Trevolta user wanted $10,000 to make a trip on Route 66. He only managed to raise $15 . ‘Some . travels are really inspirational and travellers go on a journey not for . themselves, but for other people – volunteering, charity, etc,’ said . Karimov. ‘Mostly . travels are not about destination, it’s about the process, about the . impact and about making a difference either on your life or in someone . else’s. ‘Today technology allows us to raise funds for all of that and more – connect with people and tell your story. Crowdfunding for travellers is one of those stories.’ Trevolta launched in January this year and has attracted 436,000 users raising £46,000 to date. The company is earning money but Karimov knows that he has a tough journey ahead of him. ‘We will always stick to our vision – to make travels cheaper and accessible to everyone, so unless we find some gold mine, we will stick to finding the ways to increase our success stories,’ he said. ‘Even after finding gold in a mine we’re still probably going to fund some trips with it. Because nothing that you buy actually makes you richer – only travels.’

The CEO of Trevolta, John Smith, wants to make travel more accessible for everyone, including those who traditionally cannot afford it. The platform offers a unique opportunity for travelers to post their travel plans online and raise funds for 10-90 days. The idea behind Trevolta is simple: make travel accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial status. Not only does this help to create a new market of travelers, but it also makes it possible for people who would have otherwise been unable to afford to travel, to see the world. This opens up new opportunities for individuals to connect with others from all walks of life and cultures. The platform allows users to create a travel campaign detailing their adventure and fundraising goals. Once the campaign has been created, users can share the links on social media and through other channels, to encourage friends, family, and other followers to donate. All funds raised go toward the traveler's pre-determined itinerary, which can be anything from flights and accommodation to food and activities. With hundreds of campaigns already launched on Trevolta, it's clear that there is a real appetite for this innovative approach to travel. In fact, some campaigns have raised thousands of dollars in just a few weeks, proving that the platform can be a game-changer for many individuals looking to travel. For many people, travel is a luxury that they simply cannot afford. However, Trevolta is changing that mindset by providing a new avenue for users to raise the funds they need to fulfill their travel dreams. The site has become an inspiration to many who have always wanted to see the world but weren't previously able to do so. Of course, with any new platform, there are some challenges to overcome. There have been concerns about the authenticity of some campaigns and whether or not donors can trust that their money is going toward a legitimate travel plan. However, Trevolta has implemented several security measures to prevent fraudulent campaigns and ensure that all funds raised go toward genuine itineraries. Trevolta is also working to improve its platform by implementing new features to make it even easier for travelers to connect with donors. The site is constantly evolving, and it has become an invaluable resource for many individuals and families around the world. In conclusion, Trevolta is a game-changing platform that is helping to create opportunities for millions of people who previously wouldn't have been able to afford to travel. With its unique approach to fundraising and travel, the site has quickly become a leading resource for those looking to explore new destinations and cultures. With Trevolta, travel is no longer a luxury for the rich, but a possibility for everyone.
