article: Cinnamon could be a secret weapon in the battle against Parkinson’s disease. Scientists have found that the spice is the source of a chemical that can protect the brain. Our liver converts cinnamon into sodium benzoate, an approved drug used in the treatment for neural disorders. In a study of mice at Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, a team of researchers found that the chemical then enters the brain, stops the loss of proteins that help protect cells, protects neurons and improves motor functions. Billy Connelly (left) and Michael J Fox (right) have both been diagnosed with Parkinson's. The study shows that cinnamon could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in patients . Lead researcher Professor Kalipada Pahan told the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology: ‘Cinnamon has been used widely as a spice throughout the world for centuries. 'This could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in Parkinson’s patients.’ Professor Pahan said tests had shown that Ceylon cinnamon is better at halting Parkinson's as it is more pure. He said the next step is testing cinnamon on patients with the disease. The study found that after being eaten, ground cinnamon is converted into the chemical sodium benzoate, which then enters the brain, stops the loss of Parkin and DJ-1, protects neurons, normalises neurotransmitter levels, and improves motor functions in mice with Parkinson's disease. Professor Pahan said: 'Understanding how the disease works is important to developing effective drugs that protect the brain and stop the progression of Parkinson's.' Scientists have found that the spice is the source of a chemical that can protect the brain. Our liver converts cinnamon into sodium benzoate, an approved drug used in the treatment for neural disorders . Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive disease that affects a small area of cells within the mid-brain known as the substantia nigra. Gradual degeneration of these cells causes a reduction in a vital chemical neurotransmitter, dopamine. The decrease in dopamine results in one or more of the classic signs of Parkinson's disease that includes: resting tremor on one side of the body; slowness of movement; stiffness of limbs; and gait or balance problems. The cause of the disease is unknown, but both environmental and genetic causes have been speculated by experts. While one in six patients are diagnosed before age 50, it is generally considered a disease that targets older adults, affecting one of every 100 persons over the age of 60.

chatgpt: A new study has revealed that the liver has the ability to convert certain spices into a chemical compound called sodium benzoate, which could be used to treat neural disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, found that this chemical enters the brain and can protect neurons while also improving motor functions. Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. As these neurons die off, it becomes more difficult for the brain to control movement, leading to symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and difficulty walking. There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, and current treatments mainly focus on managing its symptoms. However, the discovery of sodium benzoate as a potential treatment could be a game-changer for those suffering from this disorder. While there are other medications that can also protect neurons and improve motor functions, they can have serious side effects. The researchers discovered that the liver converts a compound called cinnamic acid – found in spices such as cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg – into sodium benzoate. Once it enters the brain, sodium benzoate can help protect neurons by blocking a specific enzyme that damages them. In addition, it also increases the levels of glutathione, an antioxidant that is crucial for protecting brain cells. "We were surprised to find that the liver can convert a common spice into a neuroprotective compound that can have therapeutic effects on the brain," said one of the researchers involved in the study. "This could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt Parkinson's disease progression." The study was conducted on mice, and while the results are promising, more research will need to be done to see if it can be applied to humans. However, the fact that a common spice could hold the key to treating a debilitating disease is truly remarkable. One of the most exciting aspects of this discovery is that it could lead to the development of new and safer treatments for Parkinson's disease. The current medications used to manage its symptoms can have serious side effects, including hallucinations, confusion, and even an increased risk of death. If sodium benzoate proves to be effective in human trials, it could offer a much-needed alternative. In conclusion, the discovery that the liver can convert a common spice into a compound that could potentially treat Parkinson's disease is a significant breakthrough. While more research is needed to see if it can be applied to humans, this study opens up a new avenue of exploration for scientists and offers hope to those suffering from this debilitating disorder.
