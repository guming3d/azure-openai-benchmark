article: Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- An Iranian court has delayed the final verdict of a 43-year-old woman sentenced to death by stoning, a human rights group said Sunday, two days after the country announced she will not be executed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The International Committee Against Stoning did not say how it got its information on the postponement of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's final verdict, which had previously been scheduled to come down last Thursday. The group said in a statement that the final verdict in Ashtiani's case is now expected on August 21, the date of her lawyer's next court appearance. Iranian state TV broadcast a program about Ashtiani on Friday in which it said that she will not be executed during Ramadan, which began last week, the International Committee Against Stoning said Sunday. The mother of two faces a death sentence for adultery. Last month, Iran's top human rights official said the Islamic regime is reviewing her sentence. The International Committee against Stoning said Sunday that it and Ashtiani's family are "extremely concerned" about her fate. The group said that Iran has executed 73 people in recent days, including some on Friday. In an interview with Iranian state-run TV last week, Ashtiani denounced her lawyer and said she knew about a plot to kill her husband, but human rights groups alleged that the statements were coerced. "Televised 'confessions' have repeatedly been used by the authorities to incriminate individuals in custody," Amnesty International said Thursday, a day after Ashtiani's interview ran on state-run TV. "Many have later retracted these 'confessions,' stating that they were coerced to make them, sometimes under torture or other ill-treatment. One of the condemned woman's lawyers, Mohammad Mostafaei, said his client made those comments "to save her life" and noted that the death sentence for murder charges related to her husband's death had been commuted. Brazil has offered to give asylum to Ashtiani but Iran has rejected the proposal. In an interview with the state-owned Agencia Brasil news outlet, however, Iranian Ambassador Mohsen Shaterzadeh said Brazil had not made a formal offer to the Iranian government for asylum. But Agencia Brasil said Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, had reiterated on Wednesday the government's offer to have Ashtiani sent to the South American nation. "I think there is no need to create some trouble for President Lula (Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva) and to take her to Brazil," Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the country's state-run Press TV in an interview. "We are keen to export our technology to Brazil rather than such people." Ahmadinejad said he had spoken with the head of the judiciary "and the judiciary does not also agree with such a thing."

chatgpt: Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a 43-year-old Iranian woman, has been facing a death sentence for adultery in Iran. For years, she has been locked up in prison, awaiting her execution by stoning. However, there now appears to be a glimmer of hope for Ashtiani, as her case is currently being reviewed by the Iranian authorities. Ashtiani's story is a tragic one. In 2006, her husband was murdered, and she was accused of being involved in the crime. Although she was acquitted of the murder charge, she was found guilty of committing adultery with two men. As a result, she was sentenced to be stoned to death. The prospect of being put to death by stoning is a harrowing thought to most, and it is no different for Ashtiani. She has been living in a state of constant fear and uncertainty for the past few years, as she awaits her fate. However, there now appears to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Last month, an Iranian official announced that Ashtiani's case was being reviewed, which raised hopes of a reprieve for her. The Iranian authorities are currently conducting an investigation into the case, and a decision on her fate is expected on August 21st. The news that Ashtiani's case is being reviewed was met with joy and relief by human rights groups across the world. They have been campaigning for her release for years, and now it appears that their hard work may finally be paying off. Amnesty International, one of the largest human rights organizations in the world, has been campaigning for Ashtiani's release for years. In a statement, Amnesty International said: "The Iranian authorities must urgently overturn the stoning sentence against Mrs. Ashtiani and release her immediately and unconditionally. The use of stoning as a method of execution is cruel and inhumane and has no place in a civilized society." Ashtiani's case has also gained widespread attention in the media, with articles about her appearing in newspapers and on news websites across the world. The case has become a symbol of the struggle for human rights in Iran, and of the brutality of the Iranian legal system. Ashtiani's plight has also attracted the support of many celebrities and public figures, who have spoken out on her behalf. Among those who have campaigned for Ashtiani's release are actress Emma Thompson, musician Sting, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani has captured the attention of the world and has become emblematic of the fight for human rights in Iran. As the world waits with bated breath for the decision of the Iranian authorities, Ashtiani's plight serves as a reminder of the importance of fighting for justice and for the dignity of every human being.
