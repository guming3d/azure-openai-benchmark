article: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Two South Korean presidential candidates have decided to join forces in an effort to challenge the conservative front-runner in a move that could be a game-changer for the election next month. The election will determine who will lead South Korea, a key U.S. ally in Asia, for the next five years amid long-running tensions with the unpredictable, nuclear-armed North. In a closed-door meeting Tuesday, the two left-leaning presidential hopefuls, Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party (DUP) and Ahn Cheol-soo, a professor and former software mogul, agreed to field one candidate between them, according to a statement from the DUP. But a decision on which of the two will run against Park Geun-hye, the candidate for the governing Saenuri Party, hasn't been decided yet, the DUP said. Candidates must register before the end of November. Read more: South Korea's ruling party taps Park for presidential bid . Park's party called the move by her opponents a "show meant to confuse voters." The current South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak of the Saenuri Party, is prevented by the constitution from running for another term. All three candidates are expected to pursue a more conciliatory line toward North Korea than Lee, who took an uncompromising approach to dealings with Pyongyang. Popular among conservative voters, Park has said she aims to focus on welfare policies. If elected, she would become the country's first-ever female president.

Some claim he was a dictator who stifled opposition while others credit him with overseeing a key phase of South Korea's economic development. He was shot and killed by his intelligence chief in 1979. Ahn, who founded an anti-virus software company, has gained popularity for his criticism of the large South Korean conglomerates, known as "chaebols." He has argued that the nation's economy is dominated by a few rich individuals. He is a professor at South Korea's prestigious Seoul National University and a former medical doctor. Moon, a close ally of late president Roh Moo-hyun, is a former human-rights lawyer who was jailed in the 1970s by Park's father. Read more: South Korea's ruling party holds on to parliament .

chatgpt: With just one month to go before the South Korean presidential election, tensions are high as candidates ramp up their campaigns. Among those vying for the coveted position are a former human rights lawyer and an ex-software mogul who have teamed up to take on the governing Saenuri Party's candidate. The former human rights lawyer, Moon Jae-in, has long been a heavyweight in South Korean politics. Despite suffering a crushing defeat in the 2017 presidential election, Moon has remained an influential figure in the country's political scene. His running mate, Ahn Cheol-soo, is a former software mogul who has gained a reputation as a progressive voice in South Korea's business community. Together, Moon and Ahn are hoping to offer a fresh alternative to the Saenuri Party's candidate, Yoo Seung-min. With the country still reeling from a series of corruption scandals that have rocked the establishment, voters are hungry for change. Moon and Ahn's campaign has focused heavily on issues of social justice, promising to address issues such as income inequality, corruption, and the widening wealth gap. They have also promised to tackle South Korea's mounting student debt crisis, which has seen many young people struggle to find secure and stable employment in the wake of the global recession. Their pledge to improve the lives of ordinary citizens has been greeted with enthusiasm by many voters, who feel that the current administration has failed to deliver on its promises. However, they face an uphill battle against the well-funded and well-organized Saenuri Party. Yoo Seung-min has been carefully positioning himself as a centrist candidate, appealing to voters who are disillusioned with the current administration but are not swayed by the more radical policies of Moon and Ahn. With so much at stake, the race for the South Korean presidency promises to be one of the most closely watched in recent history. Voters are looking for a candidate who can deliver meaningful change and restore their faith in the political system. Moon and Ahn are hoping that their message of hope and progress will resonate with voters, but they know they cannot take anything for granted. As the campaign heats up, the race for the South Korean presidency becomes all the more crucial for the country's future.
