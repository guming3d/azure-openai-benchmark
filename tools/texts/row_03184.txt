article: (CNN) -- Planned Parenthood defended a Virginia clinic and one of its employees Thursday against the latest attempt at an undercover video "sting" by conservative activists, telling reporters its clinic worker acted properly. The anti-abortion group Live Action has sent operatives posing as a pimp and prostitute to Planned Parenthood clinics in several states, trying to persuade clinic workers to help them discreetly obtain abortions for minors supposedly in the sex trade. Planned Parenthood said the woman in the latest clip Live Action released "reacted professionally to a highly unusual person posing as a patient." "After the encounter, the staff member immediately notified her supervisor, who subsequently notified members of Planned Parenthood's national security team, who are working with the FBI, which is investigating these visits," the organization said. Live Action and its founder, California anti-abortion activist Lila Rose, have accused Planned Parenthood workers of covering up the sexual abuse of minors. The reproductive health organization vehemently denies the allegation -- but it fired a clinic worker in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, earlier this week after the woman was caught on video in another of Live Action's stings. The New Jersey worker appears to advise the fake pimp and prostitute how to avoid mandatory reporting laws for abortion and how to find another provider in case an underage girl needs an abortion. Planned Parenthood spokesman Stuart Schear called the remarks "repugnant" and "completely inconsistent with Planned Parenthood's guidelines." In a statement issued Thursday, Rose said her group shot the latest footage in a clinic in Richmond and argues it shows the counselor "coaching a pimp about how girls as young as 14-15 could circumvent parental consent laws for secret abortions." The clinic worker depicted in the video describes Virginia's law, including a provision that authorizes a judge to waive the parental notification provision. Planned Parenthood says it reported the visits by the undercover "pimps" and "prostitutes" to federal authorities in January, while raising the possibility that they could have been hoaxes. It says the FBI is investigating the matter. Planned Parenthood called on Live Action to release the raw footage of the visit. Rose said Live Action has shared the full footage with Virginia authorities and has asked state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli -- an outspoken abortion opponent -- to investigate.

chatgpt: Planned Parenthood has come out in defense of a Virginia clinic worker who was featured in a recent video released by the anti-abortion group Live Action. According to Planned Parenthood, the employee acted within the bounds of medical ethics and provided appropriate medical advice during the encounter with an undercover Live Action activist. This is the second video released by Live Action this week, aimed at exposing illegal activities in Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. Earlier this week, the group released a video allegedly showing a New Jersey clinic worker offering advice on sex-selection abortions. Planned Parenthood responded by firing the employee and condemning the action. However, in the latest video targeting a Virginia clinic, Planned Parenthood maintains that the employee acted properly and that Live Action is attempting to mischaracterize her actions. "The video released by Live Action is edited and taken out of context to support their own political agenda," said Tammy Hagensen, a representative for Planned Parenthood. The video shows a clinic worker informing the Live Action activist about the possibility of obtaining an abortion for a minor, without notifying the minor's parents or obtaining a judicial bypass, which is required under Virginia law. Live Action claims that this is a violation of state law, but Planned Parenthood argues that the employee was only providing information and not actively facilitating the procedure. Planned Parenthood has long been a target of anti-abortion groups, who have accused the organization of promoting abortion and engaging in unethical practices. The recent videos have reignited the controversy and put pressure on Planned Parenthood to defend its operations. In response to the criticism, Planned Parenthood has emphasized that the organization provides critical healthcare services to millions of women and men, including cancer screenings, birth control, and STI testing. The group also argues that the undercover videos are part of a larger political strategy to undermine reproductive rights and access to healthcare. "We stand by our commitment to providing high-quality, compassionate care to our patients, regardless of their background, income, or politics," said Hagensen. "We will continue to fight for the health and rights of all people, and we will not be deterred by these attacks."  Overall, the controversy surrounding Planned Parenthood and the recent videos released by Live Action highlight the ongoing debate over reproductive rights and the role of healthcare providers in the United States. As the debate continues, both sides are likely to remain deeply divided, and Planned Parenthood and other organizations will continue to face scrutiny over their operations.
