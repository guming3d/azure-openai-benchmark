article: English Heritage buildings are normally well known for their grandeur or historic importance - but one house has gained notoriety because it resembles TV comic Alan Carr. The 'Whitefriars Gatehouse', in Coventry, was recently being used as a  toy museum but closed in 2008 after the owner died and is now being sold by the city council. The Grade-II listed property, which dates back to the middle-ages and was once the gatehouse to a monastery, was ruined by a fire in 2009, but has since been renovated and was put up for sale  in 2010. This historic house in Coventry may date back to the middle-ages, but it has gained new fame - as a dead ringer for Chatty Man comedian Alan Carr . Despite its historical roots, it is best-know these days for its resemblance to Chatty Man host Carr, with the window frames resembling his glasses, and the black and white beam over the arch mimicking his toothy grin. The lookalike was first spotted by local resident Karl Abbott, 31, a computer engineer. He said: 'I was just passing it and out the corner of my eye I saw this building that looked familiar. 'I pulled over got out out the car and I thought - "that looks just Alan Carr". 'I took a picture and emailed it to my friends and work colleagues and everyone thought the same. 'He’s from not too far away from here in Northampton - I wonder if he’d be interested in buying it.' Another resident Jack Tailor, 53, added: 'It really has that big jolly and goofy look about it. I’ve heard of the houses that look Hitler but I’ve never seen one like Alan Carr before. 'Some say it looks more like Esther Rantzen, Luis Surarez or Ken Dodd - but I think it’s a dead ringer for the chatty man.' The property has also been likened to Esther Rantzen, Luis Surarez or Ken Dodd. Residents say the windows look like Carr's glasses, while the black and white beam over the arch resembles his toothy grin . The property was added to the English Heritage’s 'At Risk Register' earlier this month, which identifies vulnerable historic properties. The original gatehouse began as an entrance to Whitefriars monastery in the early 15th century when the new town wall blocked the original access. It was modified into a house in the middle of the 16th century after the monastery was dissolved and converted into a private house. Politician John Hales purchased the Whitefriars for £83 after it was dissolved and confiscated by Henry VIII. It is likely that he converted the stone screen into a gatehouse by erecting another sandstone wall at the rear and roofing over. Later additions were built in the 18th and 19th centuries and the wing that was almost totally destroyed by fire in June 2009 dates from this period. This house in Swansea became notorious three years ago after one resident noticed its similarity to German ruler Adolf Hitler .

chatgpt: A Grade II listed building dating back to the middle ages is causing a stir in the town of Coventry, where it is known for having a striking resemblance to comedian Alan Carr. The building, which was once used as a gatehouse for the Whitefriars monastery, has now found new fame as a beloved landmark in the area. However, not all of the building's admirers are pleased with the comparison to the famous comic. Some residents have commented that the building instead resembles Luis Suarez with his distinctive teeth or comedian Ken Dodd with his bizarre mop of hair. Regardless of these differing opinions, there is no denying that the gatehouse has captured the attention and affection of the public. The Whitefriars Monastery dates back to the 13th century, and the gatehouse served as a landmark for the monks who used it to enter and exit the monastery. Over the years, the building has undergone numerous changes and transformations. One notable transformation was in the early 2000s when the gatehouse became a toy museum until the owner passed away in 2008. The building remained unoccupied and fell into disrepair until it was purchased by a local businessman who saw its potential as a unique piece of property. After extensive refurbishments, the gatehouse has been put up for sale, and the current owner is hopeful that it will find a buyer who will appreciate its historic and aesthetic value. The building's unique blend of medieval architecture and modern amenities make it a desirable property for those seeking a one-of-a-kind living space. The exterior of the building is adorned with ornate stonework and a low-lying stone archway. The interior features exposed wooden beams and an open floor plan that allows for customization and flexibility. The gatehouse's rich history and architectural beauty make it a timeless piece of real estate that is sure to impress anyone who sees it. While it may bear a resemblance to Alan Carr, Luis Suarez, or Ken Dodd, the building's true identity lies in its rich history and unique character. Its story spans generations, from its origins as a gatehouse to its recent transformation into a sought-after piece of real estate. As the gatehouse enters a new chapter in its illustrious history, one thing is certain: its value as a piece of local heritage will continue to enthrall and inspire those who admire it.
