Criminal activity: Police receive 250 calls a week about scams on Gumtree, it has been revealed (file picture) But there are concerns that eBay-owned Gumtree does not require users to register or provide their name and address, allowing fraudsters to remain anonymous while preying on innocent victims. It was revealed in Saturday’s Daily Mail that a 20-year-old woman had tried to sell her son on Gumtree for £150,000. But growing evidence from court cases and police reports shows criminals use the site to: . How the fraudsters target victims . The company reports such crimes to the National Fraud Authority, which generates a crime reference number. But Gumtree then uses the Data Protection Act to refuse to provide the victim with any details. In theory, the National Fraud Authority vets the reports and passes details to police for investigation. But three in four victims never hear from the police. Shocking: Saturday's Daily Mail revealed a woman had tried to sell her son on Gumtree for £150,000 . The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau said there were 19,530 reports of fraud and cyber-crime in October alone. More than one in 20, 997, had a link to Gumtree – 249 a week or 32 a day. The more widely used eBay had a connection to 1,483 cases – almost 50 a day. But eBay guarantees customers will get their goods or money back when there is a fraud. There is no such protection for Gumtree users. Citizens Advice called for Gumtree to require all users to set up accounts with verifiable names and addresses to combat the crimewave. Gillian Guy, of the charity, said: ‘It’s not enough for these websites to say “it wasn’t me” when things go wrong. Online marketplaces need to take more responsibility for what goes on in their name, by being more transparent and strengthening protections for consumers.’ Gumtree said the safety of its users is a ‘top priority’, but a spokesman added: ‘As with any form of classifieds listing... it is impossible to prevent crime completely.’ The firm claimed the number of fraud cases is less than half the 249 a week suggested by police figures.

chatgpt: The popular online marketplace, Gumtree, has recently come under fire as reports have emerged about criminals using the site to target unsuspecting consumers. What makes this situation even more troubling is the fact that Gumtree does not require users to register or provide their name and address, providing a breeding ground for fraudsters to remain anonymous while preying on victims. This issue has been brought to the forefront after a young mother attempted to sell her four-month-old baby on the site. While this case may be extreme, it highlights the many ways in which criminals are using Gumtree to carry out illegal activities. One way that criminals are using the site is by using it to turn stolen items into cash. By advertising stolen goods on Gumtree, criminals are able to make a quick profit without raising suspicion. Additionally, they are also targeting people who are selling high-value items, such as electronics or jewelry, and then robbing them when they meet up in person to complete the transaction. Another common tactic used by criminals on Gumtree is to trick people into paying via bank transfer for items that they do not actually have. Once payment is received, the criminal disappears, leaving the victim without their money or their item. Similarly, some criminals are tricking individuals into paying rent deposits on flats that do not actually belong to them, leaving the victim with nowhere to live and out of their deposit money. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this issue is that some criminals are using Gumtree as a way to find vulnerable women to sexually assault. By posing as buyers or sellers, these individuals are able to lure unsuspecting victims to a location where they can carry out their heinous actions. While Gumtree itself may not be at fault for these criminal activities, the fact that the site does not require users to register or provide identifying information makes it an attractive target for criminals. As a result, many are calling for stricter regulations on these types of online marketplaces to help protect consumers from these types of crimes. In the meantime, it is important for individuals to remain vigilant while using Gumtree or any other online marketplace. Always meet in a public place when conducting transactions in person, never pay for items or services via bank transfer without first verifying that the seller is reputable, and never give out personal information to someone you do not know and trust. By taking these precautions, individuals can help protect themselves from falling victim to criminals using Gumtree for their illegal activities.
