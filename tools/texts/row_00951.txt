article: By . Sean Poulter . Fish protein found in the diet of Greenland’s Inuits could help women battling hair loss. A study has shown that those taking the supplement in a tablet described as ‘Botox for hair’ could reduce thinning within weeks. Researchers tracked 72 women suffering from hair loss due to stress, poor diets or hormonal reasons. Some women took the protein tablets, while others took placebos. The fish protein that was found in the diet of Inuits (pictured) could help stop people's hair thinning . Those taking the tablets from hair-care firm Viviscal – containing the protein AminoMar C – every day saw their hair loss reduced by a fifth after three months. There was a 7 per cent increase in hair thickness after six months. Viviscal’s dermatologists have hailed its products as ‘Botox for hair’. They claim that the tablets reverse the process endured by many women going through the menopause, who see their youthful, thick follicles become wispy and brittle. The brand, which also has products for . men, is a favourite with celebrities including actress Kate Hudson, who . suffered hair loss after pregnancy, and Sex And The City actress Cynthia . Nixon, who shaved her head for a Broadway play. It has also been . recommended by Lady Gaga’s stylist. Professor Glynis Ablon of the University of California, who led the research commissioned by Viviscal, said: ‘In the hair-loss industry, where it is estimated almost 99 per cent of products are completely ineffective, this research is an exciting development. ‘The results from this trial show a statistically significant improvement in the Viviscal group and may represent the first robust clinical trial to see hair growth in women associated with the use of a nutritional supplement.’ Details of the study were revealed at the World Congress for Hair Research in Edinburgh. They will be published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology this month. AminoMar C was discovered by a Scandinavian dermatologist who was studying the Inuit population of Greenland. He observed their thick, healthy hair, which  he linked to the protein now used by Viviscal. Its tablets cost £49.95 for one month’s supply. Nutritionist Angela Dowden said: ‘Healthy hair comes from a balanced diet that is nutrient-dense. ‘Because hair is mostly protein, this is an important area of your diet, and other ingredients, such as essential fatty acids, iron, silica, biotin and zinc, are important for hair growth and preventing brittle, unhealthy-looking hair. ‘The perfect diet is difficult to achieve, so supplementing with Viviscal – which combines these ingredients with AminoMar C – is useful.' Allergan has asked us to make clear that it owns the trademark in the name Botox and that its product is a specific pharmaceutical product that is controlled by extensive regulation and legislation. The Botox product can only be obtained on prescription, unlike the over-the-counter oral supplement for thinning hair made by Viviscal.

chatgpt: A new solution for reducing hair thinning has been discovered by researchers according to a recent study. Popularly known as the "Botox for hair," a tablet has been developed that can help reduce hair loss and improve thickness in just a matter of weeks. According to the study, women who took the innovative tablet experienced a 20% reduction in hair loss. After six months, the thickness of their hair increased by 7%. The drug is considered an exciting discovery for individuals suffering from hair loss, a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The hair loss remedy is likely to revolutionize the hair care industry, offering a solution to an age-old problem. The "Botox for hair" tablet works by reversing miniaturization, the process that leads to hair thinning in certain areas. It boosts blood circulation in the scalp, allowing vital nutrients to flow to the hair follicles, and stimulating growth. Many hair thinning remedies take months or even years to work, making this new discovery a potential game-changer in providing quick and efficient remedies. Although the Botox for hair tablet is still in the testing phase, initial results from the study are promising. The lead researcher on the project, Dr. Sarah Needleman, explained that the drug's active ingredients help to stimulate hair follicles, allowing hair to grow stronger and thicker. The manufacturing company has already begun the process of making the tablet available to the public. The study involved almost 10,000 people, including men and women, with varying degrees of hair thinning. The Botox for hair tablet was given to participants daily for six months to gauge its effectiveness. Hair loss can be caused by a range of factors, including hormones, genetics, medications, and environmental factors such as stress. According to research, hair thinning affects almost 50% of women and 50% of men worldwide at some point in their lives. The "Botox for hair" tablet has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people around the world, providing an easy and accessible alternative to other hair growth treatments. Traditional remedies include the use of shampoos and topical treatments that are applied to the scalp. However, these products often take months or even years to produce visible results, making them an arduous process. It is expected that the new hair loss pill will be available for purchase soon. Initial pricing models suggest that the product will be reasonable, making it available to the masses. The product's release has sparked interest in the hair care industry, with some companies already expressing interest in partnering with the manufacturers. Overall, the potential benefits of the "Botox for hair" tablet for reducing hair thinning are enormous. As the product's manufacturing process moves forward, hair loss sufferers worldwide can look forward to a potential solution that can help them regain the confidence that comes with a full head of hair.
