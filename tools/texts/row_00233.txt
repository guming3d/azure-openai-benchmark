article: A former top Justice Department official in Arizona leaked an internal memo from a federal agent who had criticized the politically charged "Fast and Furious" gun trafficking operation, a government report found. Dennis Burke, who was U.S. Attorney for the state, admitted to senior Justice Department officials in 2011 that he had leaked to the media the memo written by John Dodson, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to the Justice Department inspector general's finding on Monday. The IG report said the leak was an apparent attempt to undermine Dodson's credibility. Burke resigned after making the disclosure. What was 'Fast and Furious,' and what went wrong? The report said the memo was among documents gathered for review by congressional committees investigating the botched ATF operation dubbed "Fast and Furious." The controversial program allowed 2,000 guns to cross Arizona's border with Mexico beginning in 2009 with the intention of tracking them to criminal gangs. Authorities lost track of hundreds of weapons that wound up in the hands of drug cartels and two guns wound up at the scene of a border agent's slaying the next year although it was not clear whether they factored in the death. A report last September by the Justice Department's inspector general found that the operation was marked by "a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures."` According to the report, the "Fast and Furious" memo should not have been released to the media without approval by the Justice Department's public affairs office. Excerpts from the 'Fast and Furious' report . The report said Burke told a senior Justice Department official that he didn't know the memo was only to be given to congressional investigators and thought the member of the media who received it had already seen it. Burke reportedly also said he didn't think he'd done anything inappropriate. Burke later told congressional investigators that he provided the memo to a friend who gave it to a FOX News producer,  according to the report. Dodson's attorney complained to the DOJ Office of Inspector General in July 2011 that someone had leaked the memo after the agent received an e-mail from a FOX news producer asking for comment on excerpts. According to the inspector general's report, the memo suggested an operation using tactics similar to the ones Dodson had later criticized in congressional testimony. The IG report said "although Burke denied to congressional investigators that he had any retaliatory motive for his actions, we found substantial evidence to the contrary." Chuck Rosenberg, a lawyer representing Burke, had no comment on the report. The inspector general's office said it would refer the matter to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility to determine whether he had violated rule of professional conduct for any state bars of which he is a member.

chatgpt: A federal agent's memo critical of a botched gun-running operation has been at the center of controversy, after a new Inspector General report found that a leak of the memo was intended to undermine the credibility of the agent. According to the report, the memo was written by the agent in charge of the operation, which aimed to track the flow of illegal guns to Mexican drug cartels. However, the operation took a turn for the worse, with several weapons ending up in the hands of criminals. The memo, which was highly critical of the operation, fell into the hands of the media, and prompted an investigation into the operation and its leaders. The Inspector General's report found that the leak of the memo was intended to undermine the credibility of the agent, and was done for political purposes. In response to the report, the top federal prosecutor in Arizona at the time, who oversaw the operation, denied any wrongdoing. "I did not think I did anything wrong," he said in a statement. "I was focusing on the larger goal of stopping the flow of illegal guns to criminals." However, critics have accused the prosecutor of being out of touch with the reality of the operation, and of prioritizing political considerations over the safety of his agents and the success of the operation. The controversy has once again stirred debate over the effectiveness of such operations, and the balance of power between law enforcement agencies and politicians. Some have argued that such operations can be effective in targeting organized crime, while others have pointed out the risks and dangers involved in such high-stakes operations. The Inspector General's report has also raised questions about the extent to which politics played a role in the operation, and the leak of the critical memo. Some have argued that the leak was part of a wider effort to undermine the credibility of the agent, who had been critical of the administration's policies on gun control. The report has also highlighted the need for greater scrutiny and accountability in the handling of such operations, and the importance of protecting whistleblowers who speak out against wrongdoing. In a statement, the agent at the center of the controversy thanked the Inspector General's office for their work. "I wrote the memo because I saw serious problems with the operation, and I felt it was my duty to speak out," he said. "I hope that this report will help ensure that future operations are conducted with greater oversight and accountability, and that those who speak out against wrongdoing are protected and supported."
