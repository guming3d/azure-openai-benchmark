chatgpt: New research has revealed that Heathrow Airport has by far the highest parking charges of any major airport in the world. A study by airport comparisons website CompareAirportParking.co.uk found that parking at Heathrow costs more than double that of New York's JFK airport. The research found that a two-hour stay at Heathrow would cost an average of £24.80, while the same amount of time at JFK would cost just £12.10. This means that parking at Heathrow is more than twice as expensive as at JFK – a shocking finding given that New York is one of the most expensive cities in the world. However, Heathrow is not the only UK airport with high parking charges – Luton and Gatwick airports also push up the average price for parking in the UK. According to the research, the average price for two hours of parking at Luton is £11, while the same amount of time at Gatwick is £10. This news is sure to infuriate British holidaymakers and business travellers who are already paying a premium for flights from UK airports. With airport charges and taxes on the increase, these high parking fees will only add to the expense of travel for UK citizens. While British airports might be expensive, there are other options available for travellers looking to save money on parking. The research found that Athens airport has the world's cheapest airport parking, at just £5.40 for a two-hour stay. This is great news for those travelling to Greece, who will no doubt appreciate the cut-price parking costs. However, it is clear from the research that Athens is an anomaly in the world of airport parking – most airports charge significantly more. A spokesperson for CompareAirportParking.co.uk said: "Our research shows just how expensive airport parking can be, particularly in the UK. Heathrow's charges are eye-wateringly high, and it's clear that travellers are being taken advantage of. While it's encouraging to see that Athens is offering low prices, this is not the case for most airports. "For travellers, it's all about doing their research and making sure they get the best deal possible. With prices varying so widely from airport to airport, it's worth spending a little time finding the lowest prices." The study also revealed that parking charges are rising across the board, with many airports increasing their fees in recent years. This is a worrying trend for travellers, who are already facing high costs for flights and accommodation. Overall, the research highlights the need for greater transparency in airport parking fees, and for airports to do more to keep costs down. With more and more people travelling by air each year, it's clear that airport parking is likely to remain a hot topic for some time to come.
