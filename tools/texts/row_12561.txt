A miracle moggy has baffled vets after surviving for TWO YEARS as a stray - with metal wire tearing at its belly. Annie, who is at least two years old, first became trapped in the wire when she was just a kitten, medics believe. She has grown with the wire wrapped around her, leaving her with an abnormally skinny waist - and painful wounds where the metal cut into her skin. Agony: X-ray showing wire wrapped entangled around Annie's stomach and under her skin . Amazingly, the feline was entangled for such a long time that her body absorbed the wire as her skin healed over it. Annie's horrific injuries only came to light after she was spotted by a concerned member of the public who saw the wire sticking out of her skin. RSPCA officers were called to catch Annie on Thursday May 3 and immediately took her for treatment. It is believed the cat was living wild but had previously been a private pet, in Hucknall, Nottingham. RSPCA inspector Gary Eastwood said: 'The wire had actually cut slowly into the cat's abdomen and was mostly under the skin, and the skin had subsequently healed over it. On the mend: Annie after the operation to remove wire from her stomach . 'The likelihood is that this wire has been around the cat for a very long period of time, possibly from when she was a kitten. 'I am actually amazed she managed to survive for so long, and had she had got an infection she almost certainly would have died. 'I do not believe this wire was put on her deliberately, the likelihood is she got caught in it and couldn't get free. 'But this does act to as a timely reminder to people that they should keep any loose wire or hazards out of reach, as sadly, cats, small animals and wildlife can get caught in them, and it can cause a tremendous amount of pain and injury if this happens.' Annie will now be transferred to the RSPCA Radcliffe on Trent Animal Centre, Nottingham. The RSPCA are also appealing to anyone who may recognise Annie or who may know who her owner is to come forward.

chatgpt: A heartwarming story of survival has emerged from a veterinary clinic in a small town in the American Midwest. A seven-year-old cat named Annie has beaten the odds and lived a full life despite a traumatic incident as a kitten. According to vets who treated her, Annie had become tangled in a wire fence as a kitten. She was unable to free herself and was left hanging by the fence for several hours before being discovered by a kind passerby who heard her mewing in distress. The vets say that Annie's wounds from the wire healed over, but she had developed a severe obstruction in her stomach from ingesting bits of the wire. The blockage could easily have caused fatal damage, but miraculously, Annie managed to survive without the need for surgery. Despite the odds stacked against her, Annie thrived and became a beloved member of her family. However, as she grew older, her owners noticed that she was in discomfort and seemed unwell. A visit to the vet revealed that the wire obstruction had never fully cleared, and Annie would need a complex surgery to remove it. Thanks to the skill and dedication of the veterinary team, Annie underwent a successful operation and is now recovering well. Her owners are thrilled to see their beloved pet back to her old self, and it is clear that Annie's never-say-die spirit has overcome all of the obstacles she has faced. The story of Annie's bravery and perseverance has captured the hearts of people around the world. Many have shared their own stories of pets overcoming adversity, and some have even donated to the clinic where Annie was treated as a way of showing support. In a world where so much news is negative and depressing, stories like Annie's serve as a reminder that there is still hope and joy to be found. Despite the seemingly insurmountable challenges that life can throw our way, it is always possible to make it through and thrive. Annie's story is a testament to the resilience and strength of the animal spirit, and we can all learn a lesson from her unflagging determination to keep going no matter what. We wish her a speedy recovery and many happy years of health and happiness to come.
