article: (CNN) -- Somali pirates have released two vessels they've held for several months, apparently after ransoms were paid, officials and news agencies reported Saturday. On June 28, pirates hijacked the MV Golden Blessing, with 19 Chinese sailors onboard. They took control of the vessel, which flew under the Singapore flag, about 60 nautical miles off the northern coast of Somalia. The 14,445-ton tanker, carrying a load of glycol ethylene, was released Saturday, according to the European Union Naval Force Somalia (EUNAVFOR). The vessel had been en route from Saudi Arabia to India. EUNAVFOR provided no other details. There were conflicting numbers on the paid ransom, but Andrew Mwangura, programs coordinator of the Kenya-based Seafarers Assistance Programme, said it was less than $7 million. China's transport agency, however, said on its website that the Golden Blessing had been "rescued." Meanwhile, a South Korean oil tanker and its 24 crew members seized April 4 also were released Saturday, according to Yonhap, the South Korean state news agency. The pirates said they had been paid $9.5 million, Mwangura said. Somali pirates captured the Samho Dream about 600 nautical miles (690 miles, 1,111 km) north of the Somali coast -- 300 nautical miles (345 miles, 556 km) outside the area in which EUNAVFOR operates. The Combined Maritime Forces -- a cooperative effort by several countries to patrol international waters -- has warned that pirates in the Somali Basin and Gulf of Aden are venturing further from their home waters, "revealing their desperation to find easier commercial targets." The 300,000-ton Samho Dream was seized in the Indian Ocean while en route to the United States from Iraq. The ship was carrying five South Korean and 19 Philippine crew members along with about $170 million worth of oil. The freed vessel is now en route to Louisiana, Mwangura said.

chatgpt: Two vessels, previously held captive by Somali pirates, have been released by their captors. The release comes after reportedly paying ransoms in the millions of dollars. The vessels were transporting oil and chemicals, and had been held hostage for nearly five months. This incident has been a reminder that the threat of piracy is still very real and active. Following the incident, various countries have issued warnings that pirates are expanding their reach and venturing farther from their home waters. The international community has reiterated the need for increased vigilance and security measures in response to this growing threat. Piracy off the coast of Somalia has been on the rise since the early 2000s, with numerous high-profile hijackings in the past decade. The pirates' main goal is to collect ransoms for the release of the ships and their crews. This practice is lucrative, as the ransoms paid are often in the millions of dollars. The Somali pirates are notorious for their audacity and brazenness. They have often targeted ships in international waters, and have been known to use sophisticated weapons and tactics to overpower their targets. Despite efforts by the international community to combat piracy, the pirates have continued to operate with impunity. As a response, countries have deployed naval vessels to patrol the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. This strategy has been somewhat effective in reducing the number of successful pirate attacks, but the threat still persists. The recent release of the two vessels serves as a stark reminder that the pirates are still active and that increased measures are necessary to keep international shipping lanes safe. In conclusion, the release of the two vessels is a welcome development. However, it has highlighted the continuing threat of piracy off the coast of Somalia. As such, the international community must remain vigilant and continue to take bold measures to keep shipping lanes safe and secure.
