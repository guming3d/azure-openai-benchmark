article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . The spider orchid at Swanage Sewage Treatment Works in Dorset is so rare that it is protected under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act . A rare flower has been discovered at a sewage plant, growing on a glass roof. The unusual spider orchid was spotted following reports that another rare flower had been seen in the same place last year, encouraging staff to keep a lookout. The plant, which was found at Swanage Sewage Treatment Works in Dorset, is so rare that it is protected under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. This means it cannot be uprooted, cut, sold or destroyed – as doing so is illegal. Ellen McDouall, senior conservation ecologist at Wessex Water, said: ‘This roof has only existed for ten years and the orchids can take that long to flower. 'We don’t know how they got on the roof, whether a seed was in the soil or blown in from nearby. ‘Thankfully the roof of the sewage treatment works is under no particular operational pressure, so we are hopeful we will be able to actively manage the land for the benefit of the plant.’ The limestone coastal cliffs around Swanage were one of only three UK strongholds for the orchid species, the others being Kent and Suffolk. A spokesman for Dorset Wildlife Trust said: ‘This is a lovely find as the spider orchid is so nationally scarce.’ Many of the species and habitats found in southern counties like Dorset are legally protected . The Wessex Water region is extremely rich in wildlife, and Dorset has some of the most bio-diverse land in the country. Many of the species and habitats found in the south are legally protected and represent the high level of biodiversity within the south west. Ellen added: 'It’s very important that we constantly assess the potential impact of our operations upon wildlife and this is a key component of our ongoing biodiversity action plan.'
