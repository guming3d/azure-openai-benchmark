Licking his wounds: Eric Simmons, 42, who tried to leap from a moving police car after he was arrested on suspicion of a burglary two days earlier . A suspected burglar has been left licking his wounds and counting the charges after leaping head-first from a moving police cruiser in an attempt to escape arrest. Uncuffed Eric Simmons, 42, skidded along the tarmac after reaching outside the open back seat window, unlatching the door and hurling himself onto the street in Dayton, Ohio. But he didn't get very far. Footage from the car's camera shows how before Simmons was even able to make it to his feet officers had stopped the car, jumped out and cuffed him tightly. He now adds a felony escape charge to the string of alleged offences he is suspected of committing. A mugshot shows he also suffered a painful-looking graze to the side of his head. And the officers involved in the incident now face awkward questions. 'He was supposed to be in handcuffs, the window should not have been down,' said Dayton Police Assistant Chief Bob Chabali. One of the arresting officers, Douglas Gresham had recently graduated from the academy. He was working alongside veteran officer Adam Sharp, the assistant chief told ABC News. 'Obviously, there are some clear violations that officers are involved in so we are reviewing all the video information and there will be discipline generated out of this,' he added. Officers Gresham and Sharp had been transporting Simmons to the police station after arresting him over an earlier burglary when he made his audacious escape attempt on August 29. Their car was travelling about 15 to 20mph when the suspect took his chance. Worth a try... This still from the police car's 'cruiser-cam' shows Simmons as he reaches towards the door .

Back in custody: Officers Gresham and Sharp quickly stop their car and leap out to put Simmons in handcuffs . Assistant Chief Chabali said that suspects should always be cuffed when in the back of a police car. Simmons, in particular, was considered a dangerous suspect with a criminal past. Just two days earlier an officer had fired a shot at Simmons as he fled the scene of a burglary in a pick up truck. The suspect had reached under his seat and the officer, fearing he may have been reaching for a gun, opened fire but missed. Simmons is now being held in the Montgomery County Jail where he faces a felony charge of escape, as well as charges of resisting arrest and burglary.
