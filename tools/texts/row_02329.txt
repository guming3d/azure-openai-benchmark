A builder who whistled in the face of police officers during a Hong Kong protest march was today jailed for six weeks. Ki Chun-kei insisted that the whistling was nothing more than drunken antics, and claimed he did not know the policemen were so close when he did it. But one of the officers claimed he had become deaf for three seconds thanks to the whistling, leading the judge to impose a prison sentence on the demonstrator. Jailed: Ki Chun-kei has been sentenced to six weeks in prison for whistling at police officers during a protest . Ki, 50, was participating in an annual demonstration on July 1 last year to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong being handed over to China by the UK, theÂ South China Morning Post reported. He was caught on camera approaching police and whistling at them, apparently without immediate provocation. One officer said Ki was less than a foot away from his ear when he whistled sharply, leaving him unable to hear for two or three seconds. The defendant's lawyer Pauline Leung Po-lam said that he had not meant to harm the policemen, and argued that 'a short ringing in their ears' did not amount to assault. But magistrate Ho Wai-yang disagreed, pointing out that the officers were clearly identifiable thanks to their uniforms, and characterised the incident as an 'illegal use of force'. Caught on camera: The defendant apparently made an officer deaf for around three seconds . Ki was found guilty in January of three charges of assaulting police. 'Every Hongkonger has the right to take part in protests,' Ms Ho said at the time. 'The court respects that. But the court does not allow the illegal use of force.' During sentencing today, the magistrate ruled that Ki should spend six weeks in prison for the three assaults. She said she was taking into account two similar offences committed by the defendant more than a decade ago. Defence: Ki, a builder, insisted he did not mean to harm the officers during the July 1 demonstration . Ms Po-Lam said that a doctors' report showed that Ki was an alcoholic, which could have impaired his decision-making. 'The offence was not made after detailed planning,' she said. 'He had perhaps become impulsive after drinking.' While Hong Kong is a partial democracy which is generally considered much more free than mainland China, many campaigners have complained of a crackdown on civil liberties and human rights in the territory.

chatgpt: A Hong Kong man has been found guilty of assaulting police officers during an annual protest march, after whistling in their faces which temporarily deafened them. Ki Chun-kei, 50, was sentenced to six weeks in prison after the judge ruled against his arguments that he was not in control of his actions due to drinking alcohol. The incident took place during the 2019 July 1 protest march, an annual demonstration that commemorates Hong Kong's transfer from British to Chinese rule. Thousands of people descended on the streets, calling for greater democracy and an end to police brutality. The march took place amid a widespread protest movement that began in June 2019 and lasted for months, sparked by a controversial extradition bill and continuing demands for greater democratic freedoms. During the march, Ki Chun-kei began whistling loudly in the face of police officers, which they said caused temporary hearing loss. He was subsequently arrested and charged with assault. In court, Ki admitted to the actions, but argued that he was not entirely responsible for them as he had been drinking heavily beforehand. Despite Ki's defense, the judge found him guilty of assault, ruling that he had intentionally caused harm to the officers. In addition to the six-week prison sentence, Ki was also ordered to pay a fine of HK$5,000 ($644 USD). The case has attracted attention as an example of the increased tensions between police and protesters during the Hong Kong protests. Police have been criticized for their use of heavy-handed tactics, including tear gas and rubber bullets, in response to protesters. Protesters, in turn, have been accused of violence and vandalism. The incident involving Ki adds to a climate of distrust between the two groups, as well as concerns over the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong. Ki's case also highlights the potential consequences of alcohol consumption during protest events. While alcohol can lower inhibitions and increase feelings of aggression, it also impairs judgment and decision-making, which can lead to violent or dangerous behavior. As protest movements continue to unfold around the world, authorities will need to consider the role of alcohol consumption in the risk of violence or injury. Hong Kong authorities have been criticized for their handling of the protests, which have faced heavy criticism from human rights groups and international organizations. The city has seen a sharp decline in democratic freedoms in recent years, and protesters have called for a greater voice in the city's governance. Despite the challenges faced by protesters, many continue to take to the streets in the face of police crackdowns and arrests, demonstrating their commitment to the fight for greater democracy and civil liberties.
