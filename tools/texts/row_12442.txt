The chaos reached critical levels when a condominium under construction in Raleigh collapsed, leaving four units severely damaged. The horrific incident occurred on Saturday afternoon when winds as high as 86 miles per hour whipped through the area.

It was not yet open for occupancy, and there were no reported injuries or fatalities. However, the dramatic collapse left many individuals shaken and spectators in disbelief. According to eyewitnesses, the winds were incredibly intense, prompting construction workers to evacuate the building several minutes before it fell. A video of the collapse emerged on social media, showing the building tumbling to the ground, sending debris everywhere. Fortunately, the building's structural integrity limited the damage to the four condominium units, with no other buildings or infrastructure affected by the fall.
