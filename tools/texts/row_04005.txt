article: By . Hamish Mackay . Anders Iniesta says he has fulfilled a 'lifelong dream' after being appointed Barcelona's new manager by manager Luis Enrique. Carles Puyol retired this summer after 10 years as Barcelona captain. Ironically, Puyol became captain after Luis Enrique retired from playing at the end of the 2003/04 season. Speaking to Marca about his new role, Iniesta said: 'Moments like these make you feel both proud and happy. 'For those of us who've been in the first-team for a long time and come through the ranks at the club, captaining the first-team is a lifelong dream, another step in your career, proof that you're still improving as a player, although on the flip-side, it means you're getting older.' Captain: Andres Iniesta, a product of Barcelona's academy, is the new club captain after Carles Puyol retired . Success: Andres Iniesta has won every major competition available to him with both Spain and Barcelona . Victor Valdes, who had been the vice-captain, also left Barcelona this season after spending his entire career at the club. Xavi, the club's record appearance holder was another option for the Catalan club but with his career winding down Iniesta appears a longer-term solution. Luis Enrique's Barcelona promise to be a different animal to that of the last few years, with considerable upheaval in terms of squad members. But the 30-year-old Iniesta admitted he was looking forward to being part of it. 'The truth is that I'm really happy to be part of this squad,' said the Spain international. 'The experiences you go through, not just on the pitch, but on a personal level, toughen you up. 'They make you a better person and a better player.'

chatgpt: Football legend Andres Iniesta has been appointed as the new captain of Barcelona by their coach, Luis Enrique. Iniesta will be taking over from the former captain Carles Puyol, who has recently retired from the club. Victor Valdes, the former vice-captain, has also left the club. Iniesta is a Barcelona legend and has been a key member of the team for over a decade. He has helped the club win numerous titles, including eight La Liga titles and four Champions League titles. He has also won the World Cup and two European Championships with the Spanish national team. The decision to make Iniesta the new captain comes as no surprise as he has always been seen as a leader on and off the field. He is a respected figure in the team and is loved by the fans for his loyalty and humility. Iniesta has always been a role model for young players and has been instrumental in shaping the Barcelona philosophy of playing beautiful football. Iniesta commented on his new appointment, saying "It's an honour to be named as the captain of Barcelona. This is a club that means everything to me, and I will do my best to lead the team to more success in the coming years." The Barcelona CEO, Josep Maria Bartomeu, also praised Iniesta, saying, "Andres Iniesta is a true Barcelona legend. He embodies everything that this club stands for, and we believe he is the perfect choice to lead the team." Barcelona has a rich history of producing great captains, including Johan Cruyff, Pep Guardiola, and of course, Carles Puyol. However, with the departure of Puyol and Valdes, the team needed a new leader to step up and take charge. Iniesta is a natural choice for the role, and his appointment has been widely welcomed by Barcelona fans. With Iniesta as the new captain, Barcelona will be looking to continue their successful run and win more titles in the upcoming season. There is no doubt that Iniesta will lead the team with the same passion and determination that he has always shown on the field.
