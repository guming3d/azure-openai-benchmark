chatgpt: Alyssa Ruiz's heart sank as she came home on Valentine's Day to a sight of an open front door. In an instant, she knew something was wrong. Her instincts were right. The intruder had broken into her home and taken something irreplaceable - her baby's ashes.  Ruiz's son, Donovan, passed away unexpectedly at just two months old. It was devastating for her and her entire family. They held a small ceremony for him and placed his remains in a silver urn engraved with his name, birth date, and a message. The urn became a precious keepsake for Ruiz. But on the one day when love and affection is celebrated, Ruiz's home was targeted. Despite having multiple valuable items in the house, the only thing the intruder took was the urn containing Donovan's ashes.   Ruiz is now pleading with the thief to return the ashes, no questions asked. "Losing a child is already unbearable. Losing his ashes is unexplainable," she said. She is even willing to have the ashes returned to her home, so long as they are safely back in her possession. The incident has left Ruiz feeling violated and vulnerable. She cannot fathom why someone would take something so personal and intimate that has no value to anyone but her family. Her family has started a GoFundMe page to raise money for security upgrades for their home and to replace the urn in case it cannot be retrieved. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department is asking the public for help in finding the stolen urn. Anyone with information is urged to come forward. They can call the department's Fontana office, Crime Stoppers at (800) 78-CRIME, or Ruiz's family directly through the GoFundMe page. Ruiz's story has touched many hearts and sparked outrage in her community. Friends and strangers alike have expressed their empathy and support for her during this trying time. Some have even offered to pay for upgrades to her home security system or chip in to replace the urn if needed.  As Ruiz waits for answers, she clings onto the hope that Donovan's ashes will be returned to her. "I don't care who did it or why they did it. I just want my baby's ashes home," she said. In a world filled with chaos and uncertainty, sometimes even the most valuable things are intangible. It is a heartbreaking reminder that possessions and security can be taken away at any moment, but the love we share for our loved ones will always remain.
