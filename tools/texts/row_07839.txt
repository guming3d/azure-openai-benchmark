Reports say the firearms instructor thought his handgun contained blanks when he shot a man in the arm . A firearms instructor has accidentally shot a student during a gun-safety class in Ohio - the second time he has shot someone by mistake. Shooting range master Terry Dunlap, 73, shot Michael Piemonte in the arm when he accidentally fired a .38 caliber handgun. The bullet first hit a desk at a shooting association training centre, ricocheted off and embedded in his arm. News of the accident has angered another former Dunlap student, Cathy Schmelzer, 50, who was also shot accidentally by the instructor. She told Disptach.com that when she was 14, she was shot in the leg by Dunlap when he fired his weapon to scare his daughter and friends during a Halloween 'haunted hay ride' on his property in Fairfield County, Ohio, US. Dunlap was a police department auxiliary lieutenant at the time, and reports said he thought the gun was loaded with blanks. On reading the latest Dunlap firearms error, Ms Schmelzer, of Prairie Township, Columbus, Ohio, was alarmed that the instructor had done it again. Quoted by the news service, she questioned: 'He’s supposed to be teaching classes and he doesn’t know there’s a live bullet in there?' No criminal or departmental actions were taken against Dunlap because the shooting was deemed accidental, Dispatch.com said. Fairfield County Sheriff, Dave Phalen, told the news service a decision had not yet been made on whether to charge Dunlap for the latest August 10 shooting. The accident happened towards the end of a 12-hour day of training in gun handling and safety, according to Dispatch.com. Weapon: Dunlap thought his .38 handgun contained blanks, reports say, when he fired it and hit a pupil in the arm . Dunlap is qualified to teach classes for Ohioans who are getting their concealed-carry permits. The shooting occurred at the Carroll-based home of the Central Ohio Coonhunters Association Inc., in Fairfield County. Victim Mr Piemonte, 26, of Pataskala, Ohio, told the news service he felt 'torn' about what had happened. On the one hand he said Dunlap was a good instructor, whose class had been 'very informative' and 'well laid out'. On the other hand he pointed out that he got shot, but said he and his wife, who was also in the class, had forgiven Dunlap and keep him in their prayers. Dunlap was formerly a Pickerington police department captain and later served as the community’s safety-service director. He is one of five directors of the Central Ohio Coonhunters Association, in Carroll, Ohio - a hunting and wildlife conservation group founded in 1968. The 73-year-old is also a Violet Township trustee and is seeking re-election in November. Read more here: Accidental shooting was not first for firearms instructor .

chatgpt: In a shocking case of negligence, Terry Dunlap, a retired teacher, accidentally shot a pupil during a gun safety demonstration. The incident occurred at a high school in a small town in the Midwest. The victim, a 17-year-old male student, was hit in the arm and was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital, where he underwent surgery. Dunlap, who is 73 years old, has a questionable track record when it comes to handling firearms. In 1977, he accidentally shot a teenager, Cathy Schmelzer, during a hunting trip. However, no charges were pressed against Dunlap at the time as the incident was deemed an accident. Now, as authorities launched an investigation into the recent shooting, the question arises: should Dunlap be held accountable for his actions this time? The answer seems to be a resounding yes from the victim's family, as well as from Schmelzer herself. Schmelzer, who was only a teenager when she was shot by Dunlap, expressed her shock and disbelief that he has made the same mistake again. “I can't believe he's done it again. It's like he's learned nothing from what happened to me all those years ago,” she said. The incident has also raised questions about the safety of firearms demonstrations in schools. While it is important to educate students on the dangers of guns and how to handle them safely, it is equally important to ensure that such demonstrations are conducted with the utmost care and vigilance. Following the incident, the school has suspended all gun safety demonstrations until further notice. The local police department is currently investigating the matter, and it remains to be seen whether Dunlap will face any charges. In the meantime, the victim's family is calling for Dunlap to be held accountable for his actions. “This is not the first time he has done something like this. He should have known better,” said a family member. The incident has once again brought to light the issue of gun safety in America. With countless shootings occurring across the country every year, it is essential that individuals are educated and trained in how to handle firearms responsibly. However, incidents like this serve as a reminder that even those who are experienced with firearms can make mistakes, and the consequences of those mistakes can be severe. As the investigation into the shooting continues, it is essential that all parties involved cooperate fully with authorities to ensure that justice is served. The safety of students in schools must always be a top priority, and incidents like this must not be taken lightly.
