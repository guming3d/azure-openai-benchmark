chatgpt: A teenager from Colchester found herself in a tight spot after a night out last Saturday. Jordan Armstrong, aged 18, had been out with friends and needed a place to stay for the night. Her first thought was to try and unlock her sister's front door, but unfortunately, her sister was not home. Undeterred, Jordan came up with what she thought was a clever solution - she would stick her arm through the letterbox and try to reach the lock from the other side. Unfortunately for her, things didn't quite go according to plan, and she ended up getting her arm stuck inside the letterbox. Thankfully, after a friend alerted the emergency services, firefighters arrived on the scene at around 2:30 am. They used a crowbar to free Jordan's arm from the tight space it was stuck in. According to reports, the rescue operation took around 20 minutes to complete. Despite the seriousness of the situation, some of Jordan's friends found the incident amusing and used messaging apps to share photos of her predicament. The photos showed Jordan with her arm jammed up to her shoulder inside the letterbox. Speaking after the incident, Jordan said: "I was very embarrassed, but relieved when the firefighters freed me. It was a silly thing to do, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else to try it." A spokesperson for the local firefighters' union said: "People should always avoid putting any part of their body into confined spaces where they could become stuck, as it can be dangerous and cause injury. We would also remind the public to only contact the emergency services in genuine emergencies." Although Jordan escaped the incident without serious injury, it's a timely reminder to everyone that sometimes, even the simplest of ideas can backfire. Whether it's trying to unlock your front door with your arm, or attempting to climb out of a window, it's important to think twice before taking actions that could put us at risk.
