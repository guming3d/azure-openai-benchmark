article: Washington (CNN) -- Recreational boating accident deaths are on the rise, the U.S. Coast Guard's Office of Auxiliary and Boating Safety announced in its 2009 Recreational Boating Statistics report Tuesday. The report states that deaths caused by recreational boating accidents have increased by 3.8 percent, with related injuries increasing by 0.8 percent, though the number of accidents actually decreased by 1.2 percent. A total of 4,730 accidents recorded by the Coast Guard in 2009 caused 736 deaths, over 3,300 injuries and about $36 million in property damage, according to the report. A number called the fatality rate, which compares the number of annual deaths against the number of registered boats, increased to 5.8 deaths per 100,000 registered boats in 2009. The top five contributing factors to the accidents included boat operator inattention and inexperience, excessive speed, improper lookout and alcohol consumption. The report states that alcohol consumption "continues to be of major concern" in fatal accidents, and was the leading factor in 16 percent of deaths. In addition, a full 86 percent of boat operators involved in fatal accidents had not received boat safety instruction. "Nearly 75 percent of the 736 people who died in boating accidents in 2009 drowned, and 84 percent of those victims reportedly were not wearing a life jacket," said Rear Adm. Kevin Cook, the Coast Guard's director of prevention policy. "The two most important things boaters can do to prevent the loss of life is to wear a life jacket and take a boater education course."

chatgpt: According to a recent report released by the U.S. Coast Guard, fatal accidents involving recreational boaters increased by 3.8 percent in 2009. Inattention, inexperience, and alcohol consumption were cited as the most common contributing factors to these incidents. The report revealed that out of the 736 fatalities recorded in 2009, over 70 percent of the victims drowned. Shockingly, 84 percent of them were not wearing a life jacket at the time of the accident. Wearing a life jacket, the Coast Guard says, is one of the most important preventative measures that recreational boaters can take. The report also illustrates that the majority of boating fatalities occurred on vessels less than 21 feet long. These smaller boats are more susceptible to capsizing and instability than larger vessels. Additionally, it was found that 90 percent of fatal accidents happened to operators who had not taken an approved boater education course. The Coast Guard strongly advocates for taking these courses, which can help educate individuals on the risks of boating and how to operate vessels in a safe and responsible manner. Since the release of the report, the Coast Guard has increased its efforts to raise awareness about boater safety, particularly as summer approaches and more individuals take to the water. They have urged boaters to not only wear life jackets but also to avoid alcohol consumption while operating a vessel and to stay alert and remain focused when on the water. Taking a boater education course is also recommended, as it can significantly reduce the risk of boating accidents and fatalities. In conclusion, recreational boating can be a fun and enjoyable activity. However, it is important to remember that it also carries its own set of risks. By taking preventative measures such as wearing life jackets and taking boater education classes, boaters can make their time on the water safer and more enjoyable for everyone involved.
