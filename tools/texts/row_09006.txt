chatgpt: Former child abuse accuser, Gavin Arvizo, has tied the knot with his sweetheart Shelby Drake. The wedding took place in Los Angeles and the guest list included notable personalities from the legal battle that followed after Arvizo made allegations against pop icon Michael Jackson in 2005. Among the guests was former Senior Assistant District Attorney Ron Zonen who headed the prosecution team in the case. Zonen was instrumental in building a case against Jackson before the singer was eventually acquitted of all charges in a trial that lasted over four months. Arvizo was one of the key witnesses against Jackson, alleging that the singer had molested him at his Neverland Ranch when he was only 13 years old. Jackson denied the allegations, saying that he had simply provided Arvizo and his family with accommodation, financial support, and gifts. Despite the high-profile nature of proceedings, Arvizo has managed to move on and is now happily married to Drake. The wedding was reportedly attended by close family and friends and took place without incident except for one awkward moment at the reception. During the wedding reception, the DJ inadvertently played a Michael Jackson song, creating an awkward atmosphere for the newlyweds and their guests. Arvizo, ever the gracious host, quickly diffused the situation and asked the DJ to switch to another song. Arvizo's marriage seems to mark a new chapter in his life, one that brings closure to the difficult period he went through during the trial. Speaking to reporters, Arvizo said that he was happy to have left that part of his life behind him and was now looking forward to a future with Shelby. The wedding is also a reminder of the fallout from the trial and the division it caused in the entertainment industry. Despite Jackson's acquittal, the trial had a profound impact on his career, leading to the cancellation of tours and undermining his public image. Nevertheless, Jackson's fans continue to show their support and appreciation for the late artist's music, even after his death. Arvizo and his guests may have been uncomfortable with the DJ's song choice, but it is a testament to the enduring appeal of Jackson's music. Today, Arvizo's marriage stands as a symbol of hope and renewal after a difficult period in his life. While the trial marked a low point for all involved, it is clear that Arvizo has now moved on and is ready to embrace the future with his new wife by his side.
