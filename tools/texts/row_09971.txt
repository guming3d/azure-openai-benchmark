For the past three years, he spent his time between Newquay and Cornwall, working in hotels and surfing as often as he could, and the French alps, where he would snowboard inbetween working as a manager at La Farandole hotel.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck a village in Switzerland after a young man was taken to the same hospital as Formula 1 legend Michael Schumacher, following a severe head injury. Michael Handley, who was just 20 years old, suffered a horrific accident while skiing in the Alps. He became airborne part way through his run before tumbling 200 meters downhill. Handley, a skilled skier, was tackling a red run in the popular Swiss ski resort of Verbier when the accident occurred. Despite wearing a helmet, the force of the impact caused a severe head injury that left him fighting for his life. He was immediately airlifted to the University Hospital of Lausanne, the same hospital where Michael Schumacher was treated after his own skiing accident in 2013. After two days in intensive care, Handley tragically passed away. His family, who were by his side throughout, are said to be devastated by their loss. They released a statement expressing their gratitude to the hospital staff and all those who had supported them during this difficult time. The news of Handley's accident and subsequent death has left the skiing community in shock. Verbier ski resort issued a statement expressing their deepest condolences to Handley's family and friends, and urging people to take extra care on the slopes. "Michael was a talented skier who loved the sport, and his loss is deeply felt by us all. We urge everyone to remember the importance of safety while skiing and to stay within their limits. Our thoughts are with Michael's family and friends at this very difficult time." The incident has also reignited the debate around skiing safety and the need for adequate protection on the slopes. Helmets have been mandatory in some ski resorts for a number of years, but many skiers still choose not to wear them, often citing discomfort or the belief that it is unnecessary. In the case of Michael Handley, the helmet was not enough to prevent a catastrophic head injury, and it serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with this exhilarating but dangerous sport. The tragedy also brings to mind the similar incident involving Formula 1 legend Michael Schumacher, who suffered a severe head injury while skiing in the French Alps in 2013. Schumacher was in a coma for six months following the accident and has since been receiving ongoing medical treatment at his home in Switzerland. The two incidents serve as a reminder of the inherent risks involved in skiing, even for those who are experienced and take all the necessary precautions. While skiing can be a thrilling and rewarding activity, it is important to remember that accidents can happen, and the consequences can be devastating. In the wake of Michael Handley's tragic death, tributes have poured in from the skiing community and beyond. A keen skier and talented athlete, Handley will be deeply missed by all who knew him. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.
