article: (CNN) -- Disneyland employees are paid to serve up magic and memories -- but not like this. A 22-year-old who works at the venerable Southern California theme park was arrested late Tuesday, hours after a small explosion in Mickey's Toontown section. The blast did not hurt anyone, but it did rattle nerves and prompt the evacuation of that part of the park for a few hours. Anaheim police on Wednesday identified the suspect in the explosion as Christian Barnes, a Long Beach resident and an outdoor vendor at Disneyland. Booked on suspicion of possessing a destructive device, Barnes is being held on $1 million bail. "Barnes is cooperating with investigators and has indicated this is an isolated incident with unanticipated impacts," police said in a press release. It all stems from an incident around 5:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET) Tuesday, when people heard "a small bang" coming from a trash can in Toontown. "Just a big boom and the trash can exploding ... the lid coming up ... people were at a standstill," Vanessa Vasquez told CNN affiliate KCBS. "It was kind of a little scary when I saw the whole area (look like a) ghost town." Others said the sound is a rarity in the area. "It was very tense at the moment it happened because you don't expect to hear that sound at Toontown," said Allen Wolf, another Disney visitor. Sgt. Bob Dunn, from the Anaheim police, explained the noise came from a plastic bottle with dry ice that exploded. On its official Twitter account, Disneyland stated it caused "no injuries and no reported damage." People were cleared from Toontown for about two hours as authorities investigated, though the rest of Disneyland remained open.

chatgpt: Early on Wednesday, Disneyland Park's Toontown area was evacuated after an explosion in a trash can. Officials quickly arrived at the scene, securing the area and ensuring that there were no injuries or damages resulting from the incident. The explosion in the trash can was caused by dry ice in a plastic bottle, said authorities. Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide, and if it is not handled carefully, it can cause injuries or harm to others. New details have emerged about the man who is believed to have been responsible for the explosion. Christian Barnes, 22, was arrested by authorities and ordered held on $1 million bail. He was taken into custody after being identified by witnesses who saw him putting the plastic bottle into the trash can. At an outdoor vendor in Disneyland, Barnes described the blast as an isolated incident, according to police. Officers have not yet released a motive for the explosion, but are still investigating the incident. The incident caused panic and confusion for visitors to Toontown, with some describing it as a "terrifying experience." Shortly after the blast, park officials announced that Toontown would remain closed to the public until further notice, while law enforcement officers carried out their investigation. Many visitors to the park were left wondering how something like this could happen in a place as family-friendly as Disneyland. However, officials were quick to assure the public that the situation had been handled safely and efficiently. This is not the first time that Disneyland has experienced a security breach. In 2013, a similar incident occurred where a dry ice bomb exploded in a popcorn cart, causing a small explosion. Despite these incidents, park officials continue to ensure the safety and security of their visitors, and Disneyland remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.
