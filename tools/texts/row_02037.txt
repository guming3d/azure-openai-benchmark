But for a team of cardiac surgeons in Kyrgyzstan, performing open heart surgery was made all the more complicated when their operating theatre was plunged into darkness. In the midst of the blackout the dedicated doctors refused to let their patient suffer, instead completing the life-saving operation by mobile phone light. Illuminating their phones, the team held them above the patient's open chest as torches allowing cardiac surgeon Dr Kaldarbek Abdramanov, 45, to carefully repair patient Tagir Karabayev's heart. Scroll down for video . A team of cardiac doctors in Kyrgyzstan were forced to complete open heart surgery in light from mobile phones after a blackout hit their clinic . Illuminating their phones the team held them above the patient's open chest as cardiac surgeon Dr Kaldarbek Abdramanov, 45, carefully repaired Tagir Karabayev's heart . The 54-year-old patient's heart had stopped, the result of heart disease. Dr Abdramanov said halfway through the delicate operation the lights went out, following a government crackdown on electricity consumption. Kyrgyzstan relies predominately on hydropower but has been struggling to generate enough electricity due to low water levels in local rivers. Dr Abdramanov, head of the state-run heart clinic in the city of Zhalal-Abad, in central Kyrgyzstan, said: 'Fortunately, the patient survived. 'But these are the kind of extreme circumstances under which we perform operations on hearts that have stopped beating. 'I am not sure if it is a crime or an act of heroism.

Do we continue trying to save lives hoping that the lights won't go out, or do we just stop when they do and hope the patient survives until we get the electricity back?' Now locals have said they will come to the clinic's aid, raising money to buy a generator to power the clinic in the event of future power cuts. Shop owner Tatyana Bobrovskaya, 33, said: 'Dr Abdramanov and his team saved the life of my friend's mother. 'What they do is so important I want everyone here to organise a collection so that if the electricity goes again, there will be enough light.'

chatgpt: A heart clinic in Kyrgyzstan was put to the ultimate test when a sudden and unexpected blackout plunged the facility into complete darkness. The doctors and support staff on duty were left to frantically search for a solution that would allow them to continue treating their patients. Luckily, the quick thinking of one surgeon, Dr Kaldarbek Abdramanov, saved the day. Dr Abdramanov, who was in the midst of an important operation when the blackout struck, was forced to finish the procedure using only the light from his mobile phone. His patient, Tagir Karabayev, was in critical condition, and any delay or interruption could have had disastrous consequences. Despite the dire circumstances, Dr Abdramanov remained calm and focused, relying on his extensive training and experience to navigate the unusual and challenging situation. With his steady hands and unwavering dedication to his patient's well-being, the surgery was a success, and Karabayev's life was saved. The blackout that caused the chaos was the result of the Kyrgyzstan government's efforts to crack down on electricity usage. Although the decision was made with good intentions, the consequences were severe and far-reaching. The heart clinic, which relies heavily on electricity to keep its critical equipment and life-saving machines operational, was hit particularly hard. Without power, the clinic's ability to provide essential care to its patients was severely compromised. However, the local community has stepped up to help out. In response to the crisis, citizens have rallied together to raise funds for a generator that will provide backup power to the clinic during future blackouts. The outpouring of support and generosity has been heartwarming and embodies the best of what it means to be a community. As the search for a new generator continues, the clinic remains open and operational. Dr Abdramanov and his colleagues remain committed to providing the highest level of care possible to their patients, with or without electricity. This incident serves as a powerful reminder of the challenges faced by medical professionals around the world, particularly in countries where resources may be limited. It highlights the need for government officials to carefully consider the implications of their actions when making decisions that can impact the wellbeing of their citizens. Despite the challenges, it is clear that the spirit of determination and resilience shown by Dr Abdramanov and the team at the heart clinic will persevere, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Whatever the future brings, they stand ready and willing to do whatever it takes to provide critical care to those who need it most.
