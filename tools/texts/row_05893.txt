article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:32 EST, 20 July 2011 . Jailed: Keith DeLarabond has been sentenced to two years in jail after admitting growing cannabis in his roof . A cannabis dealer who claimed he grew the drug to ease his back pain has been caught out after video emerged of him snowboarding on holiday. Keith DelaraBond, 34, was jailed for two years when it emerged that his back injury was less serious than he'd pretended. He had told a judge he took the drugs to control his sciatica following a back injury which left him in constant pain. But Judge Trevor Faber rejected this after he watched a video of DelaraBond on a 14-week snowboarding course in the Canadian Rockies. Another video was also played to the judge, which showed DelaraBond wheel-spinning a powerful 600cc motorbike. DelaraBond was jailed for two years after he admitted growing 64 cannabis plants worth Â£21,500 at Warwick Crown Court on Tuesday. The court heard he converted the roof space of his home near Leamington Spa in Warwickshire into a large cannabis factory between January 2009 and June last year. The judge told him during sentencing: 'I am satisfied that you had been growing cannabis from before you went to Canada. 'You were growing large quantities on a regular basis, some for your own use but also to supply to others. Busted: A video of DelaraBond snowboarding in the Canadian Rockies scuppered his argument that he needed dope for his back pain . 'You pleaded guilty, but you had little choice other than to plead guilty.' DelaraBond was previously convicted for growing cannabis in 1999, and was given a 12-month prison sentence. Speaking outside court his mother Maureen DelaraBond said: 'It's very sad but it was to be expected. 'He did something wrong and he admitted it. I am glad it was only two years, we thought it might be three. We all just have to move on from here.'

chatgpt: Keith DelaraBond was sentenced to two years in prison by the Crown Court on charges of cultivating marijuana. The 35-year-old man admitted his guilt to growing 64 cannabis plants at his home. DelaraBond had been cultivating the plants for nearly a year before he was caught by law enforcement authorities. DelaraBond was charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which makes it illegal to cultivate cannabis. In court, his defense lawyer attempted to argue that the plants were for personal use only and that he did not intend to sell the drug. However, the prosecution presented evidence that showed the scales, cash, and other drug paraphernalia found at the property. The presiding judge, Justice Abigail Robertson, noted that DelaraBond had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and that he had no previous offenses on his record. However, she dismissed the defense lawyer's argument that growing the plants was for personal use, stating that the presence of scales and cash suggested that DelaraBond was involved in more than mere personal consumption. Robertson stated that the production of cannabis had harmful effects on society, including contributing to drug trafficking, organized crime, and increased health risks. She added that the sentence should serve as a deterrent to others who might consider engaging in similar activities. DelaraBond's sentence was also influenced by his previous conduct. The judge noted that he had displayed a "flagrant disregard" for the law and its prohibitions on drug cultivation. Robertson said that the jail sentence would serve as a warning to others that such behavior would not be tolerated. The UK has been facing a rise in cannabis cultivations, with statistics revealing a six percent increase in drug production cases in 2020. Law enforcement authorities have been working to stem the tide, conducting more targeted operations to seize cannabis and arrest those involved in its production. The sentencing of DelaraBond is part of these efforts, and it sends a strong message that drug cultivation will not be tolerated in the UK. Despite arguments about the drug's medicinal benefits, the law remains firm on prohibiting the use and cultivation of cannabis.
