chatgpt: The friends of Rebecca West have revealed to the Sunday Mirror that the former Army medic has put her career aspirations on hold. Ms West, who was engaged to Fusilier Lee Rigby before his brutal murder in May 2013, has reportedly found it too difficult to focus on her career due to the grief she experienced after his death. According to the sources, Ms West had been making good progress in her career before the tragic incident. She had joined the British Army in 2007 and was a qualified nurse and medic, serving in Afghanistan in 2010. However, after Fusilier Rigby's murder, Ms West was left devastated and couldn't bring herself to work. She returned from Afghanistan to lay flowers where he died in Woolwich, which was a deeply emotional experience for her. Despite the support of her colleagues and friends, Ms West has found it hard to move on from the tragedy. "She just can't seem to find the motivation to work," said one of the sources. "She's been offered several job opportunities but she turns them down because she can't focus on anything other than Lee." Ms West has also been actively involved in fundraising and charity work in honor of Fusilier Rigby's memory. She has raised thousands of pounds for charities that support veterans and their families. "Rebecca has turned her grief into something positive," said one of her friends. "She is determined to make a difference and honor Lee's memory." Friends of Ms West have expressed concern that she is not seeking professional help for her grief. They fear that she is at risk of depression and hope that she will take steps to address her mental health in the near future. Despite the challenges she has faced, Ms West remains a strong and inspiring figure. Her dedication to honoring the memory of Fusilier Rigby and supporting her fellow veterans is admirable, and we can only hope that she finds the peace and healing she deserves.
