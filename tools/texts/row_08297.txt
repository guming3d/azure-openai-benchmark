article: An Indiana State Police Trooper is being sued over claims that he questioned a woman about her religious beliefs and presented her with church materials during a traffic stop. 'It's completely out of line and it just — it took me back,' plaintiff Ellen Bogan told The Indianapolis Star. Bogan is being represented by two attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana. 'I'm not affiliated with any church,' she also said. 'I don't go to church. I felt compelled to say I did, just because I had a state trooper standing at the passenger-side window. It was just weird.' Stopped: Ellen Borga has alleged Trooper Brian Hamilton gave her a church pamphlet during the August traffic stop . The lawsuit alleges that 'After conducting a traffic stop at which Indiana State Police Trooper Brian Hamilton presented Ms. Bogan with a warning ticket, Trooper Hamilton prolonged the stop by asking Ms. Bogan, among other things, if she had accepted Jesus Christ as her savior and then presented her with a pamphlet from the First Baptist Church in Cambridge that informed the reader that he or she is a sinner, listed God's Plan of Salvation, noting that the person must realize that "the Lord Jesus Christ paid the penalty for your sins; and, advertised a radio broadcast entitled "Policing for Jesus Ministries." The lawsuit goes on to allege that 'The actions of defendant Trooper Hamilton violated Ms. Bogan's rights under both the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Ms. Bogan is entitled to her damages.' 'The whole time, his lights were on,' Bogan told The Indianapolis Star. 'I had no reason to believe I could just pull away at that point, even though I had my warning.' Her lawsuit alleges Hamilton's behavior was 'coercive,' 'unwarranted' and 'extremely upsetting.' 'Unconstitutional': Borga's lawsuit alleges that Hamilton's behavior was in violation of First and Fourth Amendments . MailOnline has reached out to the Indiana State Police for comment. Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law professor Jennifer Drobac told The Indianapolis Star 'The police officer is representing the government... so that means, as a representative, this person, while on duty, while engaged in official action, is basically overstepping and is trying to establish religion.' However, Micah Clark of the American Family Association of Indiana told the newspaper 'I have people pass out religious material all the time. Mormons come to my door all the time, and it doesn't offend me. [This case] might not be the most persuasive time to talk to someone about their faith, but I don't think that a police officer is prohibited from doing something like that.'

chatgpt: Indiana State Police Trooper, Brian Hamilton, is facing a lawsuit filed by Ellen Bogan, who claims that he infringed upon her First Amendment right to freedom of religion during a traffic stop in August 2017. Bogan alleges that Hamilton asked her several religious questions and even presented her with a pamphlet for a Baptist church. According to court documents, Bogan states that she was pulled over on her way to work and was given a warning ticket by Hamilton. However, she alleges that Hamilton did not allow her to leave and instead asked her several religious questions, including whether she had a home church and what her beliefs were. Bogan claims that she felt compelled to answer the questions because of Hamilton's position as a police officer and his authority to write tickets. Furthermore, Bogan claims that Hamilton presented her with a pamphlet titled "What Does Grace Say?" which she alleges had dates of revivals listed on it and stated that she was a sinner. The pamphlet also allegedly listed "God's Plan of Salvation" and included a prayer for salvation. Bogan claims that Hamilton's actions violated her First Amendment right to freedom of religion and that his behavior was discriminatory. Bogan's attorney, Kenneth Falk, stated that the lawsuit is not meant to attack Hamilton's religion or anyone else's, but rather to hold him accountable for his actions as a police officer. Falk stated that Hamilton's actions were not only unconstitutional, but also intimidated and coerced his client. However, Hamilton’s attorney, David Hensel, argues that his client was simply engaging in a "friendly conversation" with Bogan and that he did not pressure her to answer any of his religious questions. Hensel also defended the distribution of the pamphlet, stating that it was Hamilton's own personal property and that he shared it with Bogan in good faith. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and a court order barring Hamilton from engaging in similar behavior in the future. The Indiana State Police has not commented on the pending litigation. This lawsuit comes amid a nationwide conversation surrounding police conduct and accountability. In recent years, several high-profile cases have brought attention to the issue of police officers abusing their power, particularly against minorities and other marginalized groups. While the outcome of this particular case remains to be seen, it serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting individual rights, including freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination, and holding those in positions of authority accountable for their actions.
