article: (CNN) -- So much for Instagram? Facebook on Thursday launched a photo-sharing app called Facebook Camera, which aims to make it simpler for the social network's users to upload and browse photos on smartphones. The news comes only weeks after Facebook spent $1 billion on a similar photo-sharing app called Instagram. And only days after the company's initial public offering got a lukewarm reception from Wall Street and raised the eyebrows of financial regulators. The company says the app, which will be available late Thursday for Apple iOS devices, makes Facebook photos more fun and accessible. "When you launch the app, you'll see a feed of just great photos from the people you care about," the company said in a press release. "You can swipe to see more of any album or tap to enlarge an individual photo." The app lets users crop photos and add colorful filters. And people who use the app also can upload multiple pictures at once. "Just select the shots you want to share by tapping the check-mark on each photo and then hit post," Facebook's statement says. "You'll have a chance to add a caption, say where you were and tag friends before you share." The app gets generally good marks from early reviewers, who say it is much faster than the primary Facebook app and displays photos in a large, crisp fashion. But the comparisons to Instagram are confounding tech bloggers, who are trying to figure out to what degree Facebook was influenced by the company it purchased. Mike Isaac, a writer at the blog All Things D, calls the app "Instagram redux," since the release comes so closely on the heels of the company's purchase of that startup. While there are key similarities between the apps, he writes, Facebook "was most likely working on this product long before buying Instagram was ever a real possibility." The New York Times' Bits blog also says the similarities between the apps could be overstated. "It might seem strange for Facebook to release a camera application with built-in filters just weeks after announcing plans to buy Instagram, the social photo app," the Times writes. "But Facebook Camera is aimed at a different audience. Instagram has 40 million users, while Facebook has 900 million. This leaves a large swath of people who are not on Instagram but are actively taking photos and uploading them to Facebook. The filters in Facebook Camera were developed by Facebook and are not borrowed from Instagram." At the blog VentureBeat, Sean Ludwig writes that Facebook Camera was "clearly influenced by it [Instagram]. Once the Instagram deal does close, we expect the lines to blur even more," he says. Ellis Hamburger, writing for The Verge, had a more critical take: . "Had the Instagram deal never occurred, Facebook Camera wouldn't really be much of an Instagram competitor anyway, lacking any mobile-only social circles, hashtagged sharing around specific topics, tilt-shift, and interesting filters, for that matter," he wrote.

chatgpt: Facebook, the world's largest social network, has launched a brand new app today. The app is called 'Camera' and allows users to easily edit, filter and share photos with their friends, family and followers. Facebook has been facing increasing competition from sites such as Instagram, which it recently purchased for an astonishing $1 billion. The new Camera app is being compared to Instagram by bloggers and critics, but Facebook has made it clear that Camera was in development before the Instagram deal was made. The Camera app is currently available for free on iPhones, and Facebook has said that an Android version will be released in time. The app allows users to take photos with their smartphones and then quickly edit them using a range of filters and tools. Users can also upload photos that they have already taken and edit them in the app. Facebook has also included some features that are unique to Camera. For example, users can easily see photos that they have taken at the same place, which is useful if they are planning a return visit. Users can also easily find photos that they have been tagged in, and can edit them if they want to. The launch of the Camera app is being seen as a direct challenge to Instagram, which has become wildly popular in recent years. Instagram allows users to take, edit and share photos using their smartphones. The app has been downloaded more than 30 million times since its launch in October 2010, and currently has around 16 million active users. Some critics have suggested that Facebook's purchase of Instagram was a way for the company to protect itself from the app's growing popularity. Facebook has always had a strong emphasis on photos, and the launch of the Camera app is a way for the company to compete with Instagram on its own turf. However, Facebook has denied that the Camera app is a direct competitor to Instagram. A spokesperson for the company said: "We're excited to bring our own photo editing and sharing experience to market with Camera. We believe the app offers a lot of great features that our users will love, but we don't see it as a competitor to Instagram. We think there's plenty of room in the market for both apps to coexist." Despite Facebook's protestations, some bloggers have pointed out that the Camera app was in development long before the Instagram deal was made. They suggest that Facebook had always planned to launch its own photo editing and sharing app, but decided to purchase Instagram as a way to gain access to the app's large user base. Whatever the motives behind the launch of the Camera app, it is clear that Facebook is taking the world of mobile photo editing and sharing seriously. The app has been well received by users so far, and many are excited to see what new features Facebook will add to the app in the coming months. In conclusion, Facebook has launched a rival app to Instagram called Camera. The app enables users to edit, filter and share photos. Facebook has denied that the app is a competitor to Instagram, claiming it was developed before the acquisition of Instagram. Despite that, bloggers and critics have compared the two apps, and Facebook looks to be a strong contender due to its large user base.
