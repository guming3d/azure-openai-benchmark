article: (CNN) -- Federal civil rights investigators have found "reasonable cause" to believe that police in Portland, Oregon, use "unnecessary or unreasonable force" with persons who have mental illness, the U.S. Justice Department said. The department's civil rights division and U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon issued a letter to Portland Mayor Sam Adams stating that local and federal authorities will "continue our collaborative relationship to craft sustainable remedies." In the 42-page letter, federal officials outline remedies that include training and new policies to investigate alleged police misconduct. Investigators found cause to believe that the Portland Police Bureau engages in "a pattern or practice of using excessive force in encounters involving people with actual or perceived mental illness." "We found instances that support a pattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat and who could not, as a result of their mental illness, comply with officers' commands," said the letter, which was signed by Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez and U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall. "We also found that PPB employs practices that escalate the use of force where there were clear earlier junctures when the force could have been avoided or minimized." One incident in December 2010 involved several officers who used "repeated closed-fist punches and repeated shocking of a subject who was to be placed on a mental health hold," the letter said. Adams, in a posting on his web page, vowed that the city and its Police Bureau would improve quickly, and listed a series of changes: . -- The city will revise its use-of-force policies -- particularly those regarding the use of stun guns -- "to ensure that officers have necessary guidance when encountering someone with mental illness or perceived to have mental illness." -- The police will expand their Mobile Crisis Unit -- composed of an officer and a mental health worker -- "to ensure availability at all times and enhance non-law enforcement capacity to respond to persons in crisis that do not pose a public safety threat." -- The city will establish a mental health desk at its 911 calling center to ensure calls are properly dispatched. -- The city will lead efforts to boost community mental health treatment options, such as establishing a 24-hour secure drop-off and walk-in center, "that will provide police officers more options when assisting persons experiencing a mental health crisis." -- The city will use an early intervention system to identify officers, supervisors and units "for non-punitive corrective action, and to assess gaps in policy, training, supervision and accountability." -- The city will move to speed investigations of complaints about possible officer misconduct. -- A community body composed of representatives of a variety of groups will assess how well the agreement is being implemented, offer recommendations on additional steps, and advise the police chief and Adams on how to improve community relations.

chatgpt: Civil rights investigators have come out with a scathing report that accuses the Portland Police of engaging in a pattern of excessive force, especially when it comes to individuals with mental illness. The findings of the report are based on a two-year investigation by the US Department of Justice. Victims of the excessive force by police officers in Portland include people with mental illness or those who are perceived as having mental illness. The report points out that these individuals are vulnerable and require a different approach when it comes to policing. The report also raises concerns about the use of Tasers to subdue individuals in crisis, which have been found to be problematic in many cases. The Portland Police Department has promised to make the necessary changes to address the issues raised in the report. Mayor Ted Wheeler has vowed to take action and institute changes as quickly as possible. He has stated that the findings of the report are deeply concerning and has pledged to take the necessary steps to ensure that the Portland Police Department becomes a model of good policing. The report also highlights the need for better training for police officers when it comes to dealing with individuals who have mental illness. It recommends that the Portland Police Department create a specialized unit to handle such cases. This unit would be staffed by officers who have received specialized training and would be equipped with the tools necessary for handling such cases. Moreover, the report strongly suggests the need for more community engagement to reduce the demand for police intervention in the first place. The report acknowledges that not all police interventions involving people with mental illness can be avoided but suggests that better community services can reduce the number of times police are called upon to intervene. The Portland Police Bureau has responded positively to the report, and Chief Danielle Outlaw has promised to take the necessary corrective actions. The department has already started implementing some of the recommendations, including better training for officers on the use of Tasers. Mayor Wheeler has emphasized that the changes must be swift, and the city needs to take responsibility for these positive changes. The city is committing the necessary resources to implement the proposed reforms, and Mayor Wheeler has pledged to work closely with the Portland Police Bureau to ensure that the changes stick. In conclusion, the report by the civil rights investigators has shed light on the excessive force used by the Portland Police Department, especially when it comes to individuals with mental illness. The report has urged the department to take corrective actions, and the Mayor has pledged his full support. The actions taken by the Portland Police Department will go a long way in making the city a safer place for everyone.
