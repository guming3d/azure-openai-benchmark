article: (CNN)  -- Michael Schumacher has apologized by text message to fellow Formula One veteran Rubens Barrichello after their near high-speed crash at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Seven-time world champion Schumacher faced a barrage of criticism after appearing to force Barrichello into the wall at the Hungaroring, as the Brazilian overtook him. The Mercedes man used his personal website to offer an original apology and, now heading into this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, has backed it up. Barrichello is set for a landmark 300th career Grand Prix at Spa this weekend and Schumacher told gathered reporters at his official press conference Thursday about his double gesture. "There were two reasons I sent the text. One of the main reasons is that it is his 300th Grand Prix and we have quite a lot of history together, so I thought it was appropriate to congratulate him," he said. "Secondly, to clarify the point because he sort of felt that I wanted to push him against the wall and very clearly this was not my ambition. "I wanted to race very tightly but without any contact. If he felt that this was the case, then I am sorry for that." Barrichello earlier confirmed that his old German rival had messaged him. He told AFP, "I received a message from him today, an SMS. "Somebody said to him that I was under the impression he had pushed me on to the wall, and he said it wasn't the case and he apologized for that. "I just said, 'thank you, no problem.' I accepted it, wished him a good weekend, life goes on." Both men will be looking to improve their position in the title race as the championship resumes after the summer break. Schumacher is in ninth place and Williams driver Barrichello 11th.

chatgpt: Seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher has apologized to his former teammate Rubens Barrichello for their controversial incident during the 2010 Hungarian Grand Prix. The collision occurred during the race, resulting in Schumacher appearing to force Barrichello into the wall. The incident brought a backlash to Schumacher, who received criticism from fans, media and even his fellow Formula One drivers. However, after years of speculation, Schumacher has finally reached out to Barrichello to express his remorse. The apology came via a text message just as Barrichello celebrates his 300th Grand Prix appearance in Belgium. Schumacher extended his heartfelt apology and wished Barrichello continued success and good health.  Barrichello, one of the most experienced drivers in the sport, spoke positively about the apology, saying that he felt it was sincere and he appreciated it. The Brazilian even suggested that the two could meet in private to further discuss the incident. The 2010 Hungarian Grand Prix was a difficult moment for Schumacher, who was making his comeback to F1 after a three-year retirement. The Mercedes driver was attempting to make a pass on Barrichello as the two were battling for position in the closing stages of the race.  Schumacher's apparent aggression caused Barrichello to spin into the wall, which prompted him to wave his fist at the German driver in frustration. Barrichello later revealed that he had feared for his safety during the incident. The apology by Schumacher may signal the end of a long-standing feud between the two drivers. Schumacher has faced criticism throughout his career for his sometimes aggressive racing tactics, and this incident was one of the most notorious. However, the apology shows a willingness by Schumacher to make peace and move on. Now both drivers have retired, and Barrichello is celebrating his incredible milestone in the sport, which makes him only the third driver to achieve 300 Grand Prix appearances. Fans and fellow drivers congratulated him on social media, including Schumacher, who tweeted a congratulatory message to his former teammate. As Barrichello marks this impressive achievement, many in the F1 community are hoping that the apology from Schumacher marks a new chapter in their relationship, and that both drivers can put the past behind them.
