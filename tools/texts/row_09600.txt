Tie, the dog that chased a commuter train heading into Manhattan from the Bronx on Tuesday, will be put up for adoption on Friday unless his owner claims him before then. Late Tuesday morning, an engineer on a southbound Metro-North train spotted the Collie-Shepherd mix near a train yard in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx, DNAinfo reported. Tie, who is thought to be about three, then ran with the train all the way down to the 125th St. station in the Harlem section of Manhattan, a distance about a mile and a half away. Tie — named after railroad ties in between train tracks —was running on a track parallel to the one the train was on, according to the New York Post. A couple of times, the dog fell between the ties, but managed to get up and continue racing. Tie, the Collie Shepherd mix that tried to out-run a Metro-North commuter train Tuesday morning .

chatgpt: A tenacious Collie-Shepherd mix named Tie recently made headlines in Harlem after chasing a train for a mile and a half along a parallel track. Tie's owner, Eduardo Rodriguez, was taking the dog for a walk when Tie spotted the train and took off after it. Rodriguez initially tried to call Tie back, but the determined pup was determined to catch up to the speeding train. The chase went on for quite some time, with Tie keeping pace with the train as it barreled down the tracks. However, things soon took a tense turn when Tie fell in between the railroad ties not once, but twice. The dog's tenacity and determination did not falter, and it emerged unscathed from both incidents. The incident caught the attention of the train's engineer, who slowed the train down considerably, fearing that Tie might jump in front of the train and get hit. Fortunately, for both Tie and the train, the dog did not attempt to jump in front of the speeding locomotive. Instead, it continued chasing the train, even as it slowed down. When the train finally came to a stop at a station in Harlem, police officers were waiting, unsure of how to handle the situation. However, they need not have worried, as Tie immediately ran up to them and wagged its tail, happy to see friendly faces after its epic chase. Rodriguez, the dog's owner, was both amazed and proud of his furry companion's incredible feat of endurance. He recounted that Tie had always been an active and curious dog, and he was not surprised that Tie had taken off after the train like it did. Tie's chase quickly went viral on social media, with thousands of people sharing videos and pictures of the dog's amazing journey. Many people praised Tie's loyalty and determination, with some even calling it a hero for sticking with the train until the very end. This is not the first time that a dog has chased after a train, nor will it likely be the last. However, Tie's story is unique in that it highlights the incredible resilience and tenacity of man's best friend. It is a reminder of just how much love and loyalty dogs are capable of, and how they will go to great lengths to protect their loved ones. In the end, Tie's story serves as a reminder that we should never underestimate the strength and determination of our furry companions. They may be small, but they are mighty, and their love and loyalty knows no bounds. Tie may have chased a train for a mile and a half, but it also captured the hearts of people all over the world and reminded us of the incredible bond that exists between dogs and their owners.
