article: London, England (CNN) -- Rafael Van der Vaart's dramatic deadline day transfer to Tottenham has finally been rubber stamped by the English Premier League. The Dutch international joins from Real Madrid after a technical hitch meant Spurs struggled to submit the relevant paperwork shortly before Tuesday's English transfer deadline, but the Premier League have now ratified the move. Van der Vaart, who was part of the Dutch side that lost in the World Cup final to Spain, joins the London club for a fee believed to be in the region of $12 million. "The interest from Tottenham came very quick and I did not have much time to think," Van der Vaart was quoted as saying on the Premier League's official website. "But I want to play football again and if possible every week, with a beautiful club. I'm totally happy. I am excited about playing in England. "Whether it suits my style remains to be seen, but I think a good footballer can adapt and I am very proud of this transfer." Both clubs confirmed the deal, with Real Madrid refuting a claim from Tottenham's manager Harry Redknapp that Van der Vaart had been the subject of a $26 million bid from German champions Bayern Munich. Real's sports director Miguel Pardeza told the club's official website: "It is absolutely false that Real Madrid received a 21 million euro offer from Bayern Munich for Van der Vaart. "In fact, the German team never showed an interest to sign the player, so the allegations made in England have greatly surprised us." A statement on Tottenham's official website read: "We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with Real Madrid for the transfer of Rafael Van der Vaart. "The Holland international came through the ranks at Ajax and won two league titles during 141 appearances with the Eredivisie side, scoring 60 goals before leaving for Hamburg in the summer of 2005. "The attacking midfielder, 27, was the Bundesliga side's leading scorer in his first season in Germany and went on to captain the side before joining Real Madrid ahead of the 2007/08 campaign. "Rafael has been capped by Holland a total of 83 times, scoring 16 goals, since making his international debut against Andorra in 2001 at the age of 18. "He has since represented the Netherlands at two European Championships and two World Cups, including this summer's tournament in South Africa where he featured five times in the side's run to the final."

chatgpt: Tottenham fans have a reason to smile again as the club completed the signing of Dutch international midfielder Rafael Van der Vaart, in a deal worth approximately Â£8 million. The technical problems, which delayed the transfer just before the deadline, have been resolved, and Van der Vaart is now officially a Spurs player.  The 27-year-old joins Tottenham from Spanish giants Real Madrid, where he spent the last two seasons, scoring 21 goals in 63 appearances. The Dutchman, who has scored 15 goals in 67 appearances for his country, was part of the Dutch side that made it to the World Cup final earlier this summer, only to lose out to Spain in a tense and dramatic encounter.  "I am very happy to be here," said Van der Vaart. "Tottenham are a big club with a great history, and I am excited to be part of this team. I am looking forward to playing in the Premier League and Europe, and I hope to help the club achieve success." Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp expressed his delight at securing the services of Van der Vaart, a player he has admired for many years. "Rafael is a top-class player with great skills, and I am sure he will make a big impact at Tottenham. He has a lot of experience playing at the highest level, and he will bring that to our team. He is a fantastic addition to our squad, and I am looking forward to seeing him play." The transfer saga that saw Van der Vaart join Tottenham was anything but straightforward, as technical problems delayed the deal just before the transfer deadline. The Dutchman was training with the national team at the time and had to return to Spain while waiting for the issues to be sorted. However, Tottenham officials worked tirelessly to resolve the problems, and the deal was finally given the green light. Van der Vaart's arrival will give Tottenham added depth and quality in midfield, an area where they have struggled in recent times. The Dutchman is an attacking midfielder who can play in a central role or out wide and is known for his creativity and ability to score goals. With his experience of playing at the highest level, he will bring a new dimension to Tottenham's midfield, and his partnership with the likes of Luka Modric and Gareth Bale could prove to be a formidable one. Overall, Van der Vaart's signing is a significant boost for Tottenham, who have now added another quality player to their squad as they look to build on their impressive season last year. With the likes of Van der Vaart, Modric, Bale, and Jermain Defoe in the team, Tottenham will fancy their chances of competing with the best and achieving success in both the Premier League and Europe.
