article: Fans of the iPhone have apparently been given a sneak peak at the latest model after images of the mobile's packaging was leaked online. While it may not look all that different from the iPhone5, Apple's latest offering appears to have a thin silver ring around the home button. The images appear to confirm rumours that the new model has an embedded fingerprint sensor in the home button and will be called the iPhone5S. This image was leaked earlier in the week by Chinese website C Technology. It was believed to be Apple's new iPhone 5S and appears to show a thin silver ring around the home button believed to be a fingerprint reader . They were leaked by Chinese site C Technology ahead of the phones' official launch on September 10. The high-end handset's sensor is said to be able to identify the owner by his or her fingerprints - making them a lot more secure than at present. Code uncovered describes a user touching the Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the 'recognition is complete'. It is believed the silver metal around the home button may form part of the censor. Fox News anchor Clayton Morris has previously claimed that the upcoming iPhone 5S would 'have a silver ring around it'. He also claimed the new phone could be up to 31 per cent faster than the iPhone5. Mr Morris said the iPhone 5S will include a fast A7 processor to make the phone noticeably faster than the latest model currently available. He tweeted: 'Sources are telling me the new iPhone's A7 chip is running at about 31% faster than A6. I’m hearing it’s very fast.' In another interview he added: 'I’ve also heard there’s a separate chip devoted to motion tracking. Should be an interesting camera upgrade.' According to 9to5Mac Apple is testing 64-bit A7 processors in its prototypes, which would give the phone much better performance per watt and let it handle animated graphics more smoothly. If the company can deliver a faster smartphone, it will once again put them on a level pegging with Samsung's popular high-end smartphones. Experts have speculated that the same processor will probably be included in the nextiPad. Apple's eagerly anticipated new smartphone, the iPhone 5S could be 31 percent faster than the current iPhone 5 model, according to rumours .
