Benefits cheat: Kevin Meredith, 44, claimed almost £40,000 from the public purse despite entering £27,000 worth of premium bonds in the monthly £1million prize draw . A benefits cheat claimed almost £40,000 from the public purse despite entering £27,000 worth of premium bonds in the monthly £1million prize draw. Kevin Meredith, 44, fiddled benefits for five years while his haul of bonds was entered in the ERNIE draw each month. The father-of-four, who had just short of the £30,000 maximum in premium bonds, received £34,835 in income support and £3,126 in council tax subsidies over the course of five years. Meredith narrowly avoided an immediate prison sentence after admitting one count of benefit fraud at Cardiff Crown Court. Prosecutor Gareth Evans told how when the authorities eventually caught up with Meredith, he told them: 'Usually I’m ethical but this started and I couldn’t see a way out of it. 'I couldn’t think of a way of stopping it and putting things right.' The court heard that Meredith also failed to disclose the fact he earned a further  £600 a month by renting out a property, in addition to another house that he was buying. Owen Williams, defending, said kitchen designer of Meredith, Bridgend, South Wales, was in 'financial hardship' after his wife left him in 2008. Mr Williams said: 'He is the sole carer for his son, now eight years old, and looks after his elderly parents. 'He is hard working and and is not proud of what he has done.' Recorder Jeremy Jenkins said Meredith’s cheating richly deserved an 18-month prison sentence. However, he said that, for the sake of Meredith's young son and his elderly parents, it would be suspended for two years. He also ordered him to carry out 180 hours unpaid community work and pay £1,740 costs. Recorder Jenkins said: 'The benefit system is there for those in need not for people to abuse. 'Taxpayers justifiably feel cheated when they realise their hard-earned taxes are being stolen from them.' Prize draw: Meredith had just short of the £30,000 maximum in premium bonds .

chatgpt: A man from South Wales has admitted benefit fraud, after claiming benefits for five years and also earning a steady income from renting out a property. Kevin Meredith, a father-of-four, also earned £600 a month from renting out a property in addition to the benefits he was receiving. Meredith, 44, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court and admitted to one count of benefit fraud. Despite the severity of his crime, he was spared an immediate prison term due to the impact it would have on his young son and elderly parents. The court heard that Meredith had fraudulently claimed benefits between 2013 and 2018, which included income support and employment support allowance. During that time, he had also been renting out a property and had failed to disclose this to the Department for Work and Pensions. When questioned about the fraud, Meredith expressed remorse and admitted that he knew what he was doing was wrong. He explained that he had initially turned to benefits due to financial difficulties but eventually found himself in a position where he was able to earn an income from renting out property. Despite this, he failed to disclose his additional income and continued to claim benefits. The judge presiding over the case stated that although the court took a dim view of benefit fraud, he acknowledged that Meredith had been able to support himself and his family during a difficult time. However, it was clear that his actions were deliberate and that the fraud had continued for five years. Meredith was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service and pay back the full amount of the fraudulently claimed benefits. The judge warned that if he failed to comply with the sentence, he would be sent to prison. In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of being honest and transparent when it comes to benefits claims. Although Kevin Meredith was able to avoid an immediate prison term, he has been left with a criminal record and will have to pay back the money he wrongly claimed. It is a warning to others that benefit fraud will not be tolerated and that those who are found to have committed such crimes will face the consequences.
