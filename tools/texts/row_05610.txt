A Saturday morning JetBlue flight from New York to Las Vegas was diverted to Detroit after a belligerent passenger lunged at a flight attendant in front of his horrified family. The unidentified male is shown in a passenger video shouting at the crew member as his children plead with him to stop and another person can be seen trying to hold him down. He was yelling in a foreign language and did not speak English, a passenger told WABC, so no one had any idea what he was upset about. Scroll down for video .

The man only became more irate, and was banging on seats while gesturing at a flight crew member trying to calm him down. But the effort had the opposite effect, and the man lunged at the flight attendant as his children shouted in horror. ‘Dad, dad, stop it,’ they begged.
