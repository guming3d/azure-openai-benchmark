article: E! News host Giuliana Rancic has helped a two-time cancer survivor to chop off 45 inches of her hair while live on air during Wednesday’s episode of The Rachael Ray Show. Giuliana, who was herself diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, was given the honor of making the first snip from 59-year-old Charley’s hair, before calling on a team of stylists to help her transform the previously lengthy locks into a chic bob. Charley’s decision to cut her hair, which previously extended all the way down to her thighs, was especially emotional, as she has spent the last nine years growing her hair back after losing it all while undergoing chemotherapy treatment in 2005. Scroll down for video . New look: Charley, a two-time cancer survivor, was given a dramatic haircut by fellow cancer survivor Giuliana Rancic on The Rachael Ray Show . Shear genius: Ms Rancic made the first cut, chopping off a whopping 45 inches of hair . Charley said that the loss was 'devastating' because she'd always taken pride in her lengthy locks. 'People know me by my long hair; it's a trademark,' she explained. 'I couldn't face the world without my hair. My crowning glory was gone; my self-esteem was gone; my confidence was gone. I lost more than just my hair when I lost my hair.' Charley's first bout with the disease came at age 23, when she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. The long and short of it: The 59-year-old hadn't had a haircut in nearly a decade . Although she didn't lose her hair during that treatment, it led to a life-changing meeting with a young girl in a children's cancer ward, who said her greatest wish was to have long hair like Charley's. 'They could've shaved my head in that moment and I would've handed her my hair,' she recalled of the heartbreaking moment. From then on, Charley donated her her hair to children with cancer every few years up until her second diagnosis nine years ago. Mirror, mirror: Charley was stunned when she saw her stylish new look for the first time . Youthful look: 'This is reminiscent of my thirties,' Charley told Ms Ray and Ms Rancic of the new hairdo . Charley told Ms Rancic, who underwent a double mastectomy after her diagnosis, that she was ready for her first haircut in nearly a decade. The 40-year-old TV personality chopped off Charley's ponytail, announcing that a team of professional stylists from New York City's Cutler Salon was waiting backstage to finish the job. When it was time for the big reveal, Charley stepped out in a sleek, modern bob, gasping as she saw her stunning reflection in an oversize mirror. 'This is reminiscent of my thirties, and I'd like to go back there,' she said.

chatgpt: Breast Cancer Survivors Join Forces to Raise Awareness and Funds A group of breast cancer survivors have come together to host a fundraising event to raise awareness of the disease and funds to support research efforts. The event was held in a local salon where participants had their hair cut and styled to make wigs for people undergoing treatment for cancer. At the event, Ms Rancic, a fellow breast cancer survivor, had the honor of making the first snip before handing over the scissors to a team of stylists. The event was organized by the Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports those who are affected by breast cancer. The event was not just about raising awareness for breast cancer but also about empowering the survivors to boost their confidence and self-esteem. The survivors received the VIP treatment from the stylists who volunteered their services for the day. The event was attended by over 50 participants, including some who had travelled from other states to support the cause. The Breast Cancer Survivors Foundation was founded in 2005 and has been actively involved in supporting breast cancer patients and their families. The foundation provides financial assistance to those who are unable to afford the high cost of treatment. Many breast cancer patients lose their hair due to chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which is why the foundation has been successful in organizing events like this to help provide wigs to those in need. According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, and around 2,000 men will be diagnosed each year. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death for women, after lung cancer. "It's important to raise awareness about breast cancer so that people understand the importance of early detection." said Ms Rancic. "Participating in events like this is not just about raising funds but also about showing support for those who are currently fighting the disease." The survivors shared their personal stories and experiences with the disease, which united the group and motivated them to work together to make a difference. The event was a success, raising over $15,000 which will be donated to breast cancer research. One of the organizers, Ms Johnson, said "It's amazing to see the support and generosity of the community. Everyone came together to make a difference, and we are grateful for their participation and donations." Breast cancer survivors have been increasingly involved in raising awareness and funds to support research efforts. The power of their collective voice and experiences have been instrumental in increasing awareness about the disease and reducing the stigma associated with it. The event was a heart-warming display of solidarity and compassion towards those affected by breast cancer. The organizers hope to hold similar events in the future and inspire others to join the cause. In conclusion, breast cancer survivors have come together to raise awareness of the disease and funds to help support research efforts. The event was held in a local salon where participants had their hair cut to make wigs for people undergoing cancer treatment. The event was a success and raised over $15,000 which will be donated to breast cancer research. The stories and experiences shared by the survivors united the group and motivated them to work together to make a difference.
