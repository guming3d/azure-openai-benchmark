In hospital: King Abdullah bin Abdulziz, 90, has ruled Saudi Arabia since 2005, but has been absent from public events in recent months due to his ill health . Just last week, the king had left the capital city to spend time at the royal encampment in Rawdat Khuraim, a green oasis about 62 miles north of Riyadh. It was at the resort that the monarch met US President Barack Obama in March and appeared before the press wearing an oxygen tube. Official photographs of the king have also shown him in a wheelchair. The health of the monarch is watched closely since any changes in leadership could have an impact on the stability of one of the world's largest oil producers. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy with no elected parliament. The king has sole power to ratify legislation and appoint ministers. The king reportedly underwent surgery in October 2011 and November 2012 for his back at the same hospital he was admitted to today. He also had two back surgeries in 2010 in New York. Absolute monarchy: The health of King Abdullah, pictured in 2006, is watched closely since any changes in leadership could have an impact on the stability of Saudi Arabia . His 79-year-old successor and half-brother, Crown Prince Salman, has increasingly represented the kingdom in meetings abroad, including the latest Gulf summit in Qatar this month. As deputy prime minister and defence minister, he has also increasingly presided over cabinet meetings at home. The king's latest hospitalisation comes as Saudi Arabia holds a high-profile position in the US-led fight against the Islamic State group, which has seized swathes of neighbouring Iraq and Syria. Saudi warplanes have joined in coalition air strikes against the jihadists in Syria, although the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom has faced calls to do more to halt the flow of funds and fighters to IS from among its own citizens. The king has outlived two other half-brothers who held the crown prince post. Under his guidance, a council comprised of the sons and some grandsons of modern Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, was activated and in March selected King Abdullah's half-brother Prince Muqrin, 69, as second-in-line to the throne. The king officially assumed the throne in 2005, becoming the sixth king of Saudi Arabia, but had been widely viewed as the de facto ruler since the mid-1990s. As king, he holds the post of prime minister and commander of the National Guard.

chatgpt: Sources from Saudi Arabia have confirmed that King Abdullah, the current ruler of the country, has been admitted to a hospital due to his health issues. The 90-year-old monarch has been absent from public events for a considerable amount of time, leading to speculation about his condition.  Members of the royal family and top officials have visited the king in the hospital to check on his health. The Saudi Arabian government released a statement confirming the king's hospitalization but did not disclose any details about his condition. Sources close to the king's family have stated that his condition is stable and that he is undergoing medical treatment. King Abdullah's health has been a topic of concern for many in the country, as he has been battling various ailments for the past few years. In November 2020, he underwent a successful surgery to remove his gallbladder. In 2012, he underwent a similar operation to treat a herniated disk. King Abdullah has also suffered from a lung infection and has had multiple surgeries on his back. The king's age and health issues have led many to speculate about his successor. According to Saudi Arabia's laws and customs, the king's successor is chosen by a council of senior princes after the death of the monarch. King Abdullah's half-brother Salman, who is currently serving as the country's crown prince, is next in line to the throne. Prince Salman, who is 79 years old, has been taking on many of the king's responsibilities in recent years, indicating that he is being groomed to take over as the country's ruler. He has also played an influential role in the country's recent policies, especially regarding oil production and foreign relations. The possibility of a succession crisis in Saudi Arabia has long been a topic of concern for analysts, considering the country's strategic position in the Middle East and its significant oil reserves. The country is a key ally for many Western nations, including the United States, and developments in the country can have far-reaching impacts. King Abdullah has been seen as a cautious reformer during his reign, introducing some socioeconomic and political reforms while still maintaining traditional values. However, his rule has also been criticized for human rights abuses and a lack of political freedom. Saudi Arabia has been undergoing significant changes in recent times, with reforms aimed at modernizing the country's economy and reducing its dependence on oil. The country has also been working on improving its international relations, in a bid to establish itself as a more influential player in the region. The king's hospitalization comes at a time when the country is going through significant changes, both domestically and internationally. The government has not yet indicated how long the king is expected to stay in hospital, or when he will be able to resume his official duties. In conclusion, King Abdullah's admittance to hospital has raised concerns about his health, and the possibility of a succession crisis in Saudi Arabia. His half-brother, Prince Salman, is next in line to the throne and has been taking on more responsibilities in recent years. The developments in the country are being watched closely, given Saudi Arabia's significance as a key player in the Middle East and the global oil industry.
