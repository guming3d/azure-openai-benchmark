A renowned diver who is known as a skilled 'shark whisperer' has been filmed putting her hand inside a shark's mouth to remove a fishing hook lodged in its gullet. As sharks swarm all around her and fellow divers in clear blue waters off the Bahamas, Italian-born Cristina Zenato fearlessly reaches into the predator's mouth and pulls the hook out. The fierce fish seems totally at ease with her, and even as she reaches deep into its throat it doesn't attempt to bite. Nevertheless, in addition to her wetsuit she is dressed in chainlink body armour.

This causes induces 'tonic immobility', where the shark enters a natural state of paralysis for up to 15 minutes and appears to be asleep in her hands. The pores act as electroreceptors detecting prey moving in the electromagnetic field around the shark - but also for some reason rubbing them turns 'Jaws' into a sleeping baby. Ms Zenato uses her ability to put the . sharks in a sleepy state to educate other divers, remove parasites and . even - as in this case - take out fishing hooks caught in their mouths. 'In my daily work and dives with sharks I am always removing their hooks,' Ms Zenato was quoted as saying. 'In this particular case it was harder than usual. After putting the shark in tonic I had to pull it from deep inside.'

Ms Zenato has been working with sharks for nearly 20 years, but still wears a chain link suit in case one of the animals is tempted to bite. Her remarkable talents have made her much sought-after by filmmakers, documentary and TV producers worldwide and she has worked with organisations including BBC, Discovery, Nat Geo, ABC, Science and Nature. She is the dive team manager at the Underwater Explorers Society (UNEXSO) on Grand Bahama Island.

chatgpt: Renowned diver Cristina Zenato has been making waves in the marine biology community for years with her unique approach to handling sharks. Zenato’s technique involves a little-known trick that puts the fearsome creatures into a trance-like state, allowing her to handle them with ease. Known as “tonic immobility,” this technique is achieved by gently stroking the shark’s nose or by flipping them on their back, causing them to enter a trancelike state. This allows Zenato to safely examine the sharks and even remove hooks from their mouths. Zenato’s approach has been praised by marine biologists and conservationists alike, as it allows for close study of these often-misunderstood creatures without causing harm. But even with her considerable experience and this effective technique, Zenato still takes precautions when working with sharks. As she explained in a recent interview, Zenato always wears body armor when working with sharks. “I have to assume that at any given time, one of these animals could decide it doesn't want me near," she said. "It could be sick, injured, or just happen to be in a bad mood that day. I always put on a bit of protection." Despite the precautions, Zenato has had her share of close calls over the years. She recalled an instance when a 12-foot tiger shark approached her while she was anchored to a reef. Despite the potential danger, Zenato remained calm and the shark eventually swam away, unharmed. Zenato’s work with sharks has not gone unnoticed in the scientific community. In fact, her expertise has led to her involvement in various conservation efforts, including a recent project aimed at studying the behavior of nurse sharks. Working alongside other marine biologists and conservationists, Zenato hopes to better understand these often-overlooked creatures and develop effective conservation strategies to protect them. Additionally, Zenato has become something of a public figure due to her unique work with sharks. She has been featured in various documentaries and news broadcasts, and has given talks at conferences all over the world. Through her work, she hopes to challenge the often-negative stereotypes that surround these incredible creatures, and to raise awareness about the importance of preserving marine ecosystems. For Zenato, working with sharks is not just a job – it’s a passion. As she puts it, “I love what I do. I think sharks are incredibly beautiful, fascinating animals, and I feel privileged to be able to work with them.” Thanks to her innovative approach and commitment to shark conservation, Cristina Zenato has become a leading figure in the marine biology community – and a true inspiration to us all.
