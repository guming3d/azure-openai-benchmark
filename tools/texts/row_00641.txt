article: (CNN) -- First it was Chinese tourists apparently being targeted by criminal gangs in Paris. Roma pickpocketing crews were reportedly picking on Chinese travelers because of their habit of carrying plenty of cash with them. Now the tables seem, in a way, to be turned. French authorities suspect Chinese organized criminals to be behind the circulation of thousands of fake tickets to Paris' Louvre -- the world's most visited art gallery -- in a scam worth hundreds of thousands of euros. The museum was alerted to the swindle at the beginning of August when a staff member became suspicious of a ticket handed over by a Chinese tour guide, France 24 reports. The ticket "felt strange to the touch and the paper quality was not good. All our staff were immediately put on the alert," a Louvre spokesperson told Le Parisien. Upping their game . But the criminals behind the scam appear to have upped their game at some point -- or more than one gang is operating. Days later, the Louvre discovered fake tickets that at first appeared "in every way identical to the genuine article," the spokesperson said. Then, at the end of August, Belgian customs officers seized more than 4,000 forged Louvre passes in a parcel from China. The counterfeit tickets being worth at least â‚¬36 ($48) each, that haul alone would have saved the scammers at least â‚¬144,000 (about $191,000).

The Belgian discovery has sparked a French criminal investigation into whether criminal gangs in China are collaborating with Chinese tour operators in Paris to profit from the fake tickets, the Louvre said. However, French officials are reportedly wary of commenting publicly on the investigation for fear of causing diplomatic embarrassment with China. Scope of scam uncertain . The Louvre as yet has no idea of the scope of the scam. "Our tickets are valid for a year. There's no telling how many are in circulation and there's no way as yet of calculating the cost of this scam to the museum," the Louvre said. The gallery would "enhance [its] anti-counterfeiting system" in response to the forgeries, the gallery told the Beijing Times, emphasizing that it continued to welcome Chinese tourists. French diplomats may be right to tread warily around the incident. Comments on Chinese social media expressed concern about the damage the scam could do to China's image. "Can you please stop forging? This is so embarrassing!" read one post on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter (link in Chinese language only). "Ticket holders may not know the tickets are fake -- yet Chinese people are the ones being shamed," read another.

chatgpt: French officials are concerned that Chinese criminal gangs may be behind the production of thousands of fake Louvre museum passes. The concern stems from a recent raid in Belgium, where authorities seized almost $200,000 worth of forged passes. The Belgian police arrested six Chinese nationals in connection with the fake passes.  The Louvre recently reported an increase in counterfeit passes being presented to its staff. The museum sells approximately 9.6 million tickets annually, making it the most visited museum in the world. The pass for the Louvre provides access to both permanent and temporary exhibitions. As such, the popularity of the pass makes it a target for counterfeiters.  The fake passes are sold for between $35-70 each, making it a lucrative business for the criminal gangs involved. It is not clear how many fake passes have been produced or how many are in circulation.  French officials are reportedly concerned about the diplomatic fallout if it is proven that the counterfeit passes are being produced by Chinese gangs. Diplomatic relations between France and China are already strained, with France being one of the few European countries to publicly criticize China's human rights record.  News of the fake passes has caused embarrassment among Chinese social media users. Many have expressed their shame and disappointment at the criminal activities of their compatriots. They have called for harsh penalties for those involved in the production and trade of fake passes.  This is not the first time that Chinese gangs have been implicated in the forgery of European cultural artifacts. In 2018, police in Italy arrested 13 Chinese nationals for the production of counterfeit designer handbags. In the same year, Chinese police seized over 50,000 counterfeit vaccines, which had been sold to hospitals across the country.  While it is too early to definitively link the fake Louvre passes to Chinese gangs, the recent arrests in Belgium do suggest a Chinese connection. French officials have called for increased vigilance among museum staff and visitors to prevent further fraudulent activities.  In conclusion, the production and sale of fake Louvre passes is a cause for concern among French officials. The involvement of Chinese gangs has added further complexity to an already strained diplomatic relationship. Museum officials are now tasked with the responsibility of preventing the circulation of the fake passes, while authorities work to identify and prosecute those involved in the illegal trade.
