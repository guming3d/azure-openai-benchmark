article: Residents in a Seattle, Washington neighborhood have spent the last few months in fear of a group of squatters that took over a local home and trashed the property, covering the yard in knee-deep filth. Last week, a judge granted the Haller Lake community's request to have the squatters evicted, but they still haven't left the property and now the neighbors are sending a petition to the mayor in hopes of changing the laws around squat homes. Joaquin Gauna is one of the men that lives at the trashed property, and told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer he is no squatter, and that he and his four roommates pay bills at the home  on the corner of N 137th Street and Burke Ave North. Wrecked: Neighbors near this home in the Haller Lake community of Seattle say it has been taken over by squatters who have trashed the property . Claims: Joaquina Gauna is one of five people who live at the property, and he claims he is no squatter and that the neighbors are just harassing him . 'They've been doing everything they can to get us out of here,' Gauna said of his neighbors. He says they've actually been cleaning up the home, saying the mounds of dirty clothes and trash in the yard are a 'recycling' project. Steve Warren, a resident who lives up the street from the squat, has been leading the effort to get Gauna and his roommates kicked off the property. 'People are threatened,' Warren said. 'They're afraid to come out of their homes when this kind of thing happens.' And Warren says the trash is just one of the many problems the group has been causing. He says the home has been the subject of over 80 complaints to police this year, many of the calls involving drugs. While Warren and the community members Â won a major battle last week with the eviction, they say the time it took is evidence of a larger problem. They are now putting forth a petition to Seattle Mayor Ed Murray to give authorities more power in evicting squatters from the homes and apartments they don't legally own. As of Tuesday, the petition had over 350 signatures on Change.org. Drug den: The home has been the subject of over 80 complaints to police in the last year, many for drug issues .

chatgpt: Despite an eviction order granted last week, the five squatters living in a Haller Lake home have decided they won't move. The home, located in the 13700 block of Stone Ave. N., has been the subject of over 80 complaints to police, many involving suspected drug use. Neighbors have been vocal about their concerns, with some stating that they no longer feel safe in the neighborhood. "It's been terrible. We've had to call the police countless times because of the noise and the suspicious activity going on in that house," said resident Lisa Johnson. Seattle police have raided the home multiple times, and have found evidence of drug use and other illegal activity. Despite this, the squatters remain defiant. "We're not going anywhere. This is our home now," said one of the squatters, who declined to give their name. The situation is a tricky one for law enforcement, as squatters' rights vary depending on the state. In Washington, squatters must have lived in a property for ten years before they can claim adverse possession. However, the eviction process can be lengthy, and in the meantime, the squatters are allowed to remain in the home. Many locals are frustrated with the lack of action being taken to resolve the issue. "It's just a never-ending cycle. We file complaints, the police come and raid the place, and then nothing changes. It's becoming really frustrating," said resident John Smith. Some have even taken to protest outside the home, with signs reading "Get Out Squatters" and "Protect Our Community." However, the squatters have shown no signs of budging. The situation highlights the difficulties faced by both law enforcement and residents when dealing with squatters. While the legality of the situation may be murky, the impact on the community is clear. "We just want our neighborhood to be safe and peaceful again," said Johnson. The future of the Haller Lake home remains uncertain, with no resolution in sight. It remains to be seen how the situation will be resolved, and how long it will take for the community to regain a sense of safety and security.
