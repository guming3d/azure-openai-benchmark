With her husband gone, Battisti was left uncertain about managing the family's finances. Despite her best efforts, she got behind on a property tax payment, which resulted in a disturbing chain of events. In 2011, officials placed Battisti's home up for tax sale due to a $6.30 late fee that had accrued a substantial $234.72 interest. Battisti stated that she had no idea about the penalty and was shocked to learn about the impending sale of her house. The tax sale had a significant impact on Battisti's life. It forced her to relocate and caused her undue emotional distress. Thankfully, a recent ruling by a judge has provided some much-needed relief. The judge overturned the tax sale of her home, citing the fact that officials had failed to provide her with adequate notice about the penalty and interest. Battisti's attorney, Ed Santillan, said that his client was overcome with emotion after learning of the ruling, crying tears of joy. The case has raised concerns about the harsh penalties and consequences associated with even a small tax debt.
