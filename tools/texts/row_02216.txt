article: (CNN) -- In the heart of the bustling capital of Cairo, Egypt, a lone female taxi driver navigates her bright yellow cab through the unforgiving traffic. "I wanted to take this adventure, as I consider it an adventure, rather than an experience. Thank God, I believe it is a nice adventure so far and I feel happy with it," Inas Hassan Ali says. Ali is one of only eight female cab drivers in a city where the profession is dominated by men. "For me, it's a very normal job, and there is nothing wrong for women to try to join a field of work that we deem as male-dominated. I see nothing wrong with that if the woman has the required skills and abilities," Ali says. Female cab drivers started appearing in Cairo's streets only earlier this year. While some welcome the transition, Ali is facing many challenges. "Still the society is not used to such an idea -- that a woman joins a field of work that was only limited to men. And still there are some people who see it as strange. On the other hand, others get curious and wonder: how did you enter this area of work and why?" Ali says. One factor that makes it difficult for women to break into a male-dominated profession is the high rate of sexual harassment in the country. In a recent report, the Egyptian Centre for Women's Right (ECWR) concluded that 83 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of foreign women in Egypt have experienced sexual harassment in some way or another. "It's usual here in Egypt that women get subject to some minor acts when they drive a car. ... Some encourage and show support for me. Others act by trying to block my way to show they are more skillful drivers and to prove that it's a male-dominated job," Ali says. However for an enthusiastic Ali, the rewards of her profession move beyond gender politics. "I am most interested in making my clients best satisfied at the end of the trip, regardless of their gender, as the common impression is that women are bad drivers," she says. "To have both men and women as my clients and make them feel comfortable is the greatest success for me."

chatgpt: Despite the numerous societal and cultural challenges in Egypt, Inas Hassan Ali is defying the odds as she becomes one of only eight female cab drivers in Cairo. In a male-dominated profession, Inas, like most other women in Egypt, has had to face challenges that come with the job. Egypt, a deeply patriarchal and conservative society, has a high rate of sexual harassment of women, and female cab drivers are not immune to this. Inas says that she was motivated to enter the profession as she was passionate about driving and the freedom it gave her. While starting, she faced several obstacles. Many cab drivers would refuse to work with her because of her gender, and she would receive countless comments from male drivers minimizing her capabilities. Despite this, Inas is passionate about her job and is proud to be part of the few women who can operate a taxi in Cairo. She reveals that many of her female customers, particularly those who find it difficult to navigate through Egypt’s complex and crowded public transport system, are pleased to see a woman behind the wheel. She says that at times, passengers become curious, wanting to know more about what motivated her to become a taxi driver, and the cultural traditions she had to break to reach this position. Inas says that one of the most significant challenges of her job is the harassment and discrimination she sometimes gets from male cab drivers who view her as a threat to the male-dominated profession. Some passengers also judge her before she even picks them up, and there have been instances when she is forced to avoid picking up passengers at certain times when the streets get busy and chaotic. Despite the challenges, Inas remains optimistic and believes that the more women enter such traditionally male-dominated spaces, the more likely societal perceptions will change in the long run. She hopes to see Egypt become more receptive to women in such roles while also inspiring other women to join the profession. In conclusion, Inas Hassan Ali is a source of inspiration to many women in Egypt looking to enter male-dominated professions. Her story is a clear indication that determination and passion can lead to success, even in the face of social and cultural challenges. She is a reminder that women can and should be allowed to participate and succeed in all fields regardless of societal gender norms.
