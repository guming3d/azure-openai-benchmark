article: (CNN) -- Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier died of a heart attack in Port-au-Prince at the age of 63, a family member told CNN Saturday. Known by his nickname "Baby Doc," the so-called "President for life" actually fled Haiti in 1986 and stunned Haiti when he returned 25 years later. He was charged with human rights crimes within days of his return, but he successfully argued in court that the statute of limitations had expired on charges that included torture, rape and extrajudicial killings. Human rights groups decried the court ruling that spared Duvalier. In February, a Haitian appeals court ruled that the lower court was wrong and that there is no statute of limitations for human rights violations. The ruling reopened the possibility that Duvalier could face such charges, but he died before a judicial investigation decided whether to pursue the charges. Duvalier inherited the title of "President for life" in 1971 upon the death of his father, Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier, who had ruled with an iron fist through his paramilitary force, the Tonton Macoute. Just 19 years old when he came to power, Baby Doc became one of the world's youngest heads of state. Haitians initially celebrated his ascension, thinking the young man would be less oppressive than his father, but that didn't turn out to be the case. Duvalier used his father's security apparatus to continue ruling in a totalitarian fashion. Fast facts on Duvalier .

chatgpt: Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier passed away on October 4, 2014, at the age of 63 due to a heart attack. Duvalier, who ruled Haiti with an iron fist from 1971 to 1986, had a controversial reign marked by allegations of human rights violations and corruption. Haiti's Tonton Macoutes, Duvalier's secret police force, was infamous for its brutality and repression. The regime was responsible for the disappearance, torture, and killing of tens of thousands of Haitians. During Duvalier's 15-year reign, the country was plunged into poverty, and the people suffered from widespread corruption, human rights abuses, and economic mismanagement. Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986 after a popular uprising toppled his government. He lived in exile in France for many years, where he faced lawsuits and allegations of corruption, enraging many of his countrymen. Despite facing numerous human rights abuse lawsuits, Duvalier returned to Haiti in 2011 after having evaded prosecution for decades. However, he was soon after charged by Haitian authorities with crimes against humanity, embezzlement, and corruption during his tenure as the country's ruler. Duvalier's legacy of corruption and repression remains a thorn in the side of Haiti, and his death has reignited debates about the country's past and future. Some Haitians mourned his passing, while others celebrated it as the symbolic end of an era marked by dictatorship and brutality. In the weeks leading up to his death, Duvalier was living in seclusion with his longtime partner Veronique Roy. His death has drawn mixed reactions from around the world, with some expressing sympathy for his family and others condemning his actions as a ruthless dictator. Despite his controversial rule, Duvalier's passing marks the end of an era in Haitian politics. His legacy will continue to influence the country's trajectory, but his death also presents an opportunity for Haiti to move forward and embrace a more democratic and prosperous future. Haitians must come together and work towards a brighter future for their nation, one that promises justice, equality, and basic human rights for all.
