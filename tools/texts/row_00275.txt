article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Four southern California teenagers have been charged following the apparent drug overdose death of an 18-year-old high school quarterback whose father is a retired NFL player, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Saturday. Three of the teens have been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Griffen Kramer, son of former pro quarterback Erik Kramer, who played for several NFL teams including the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions, officials said. Griffen Kramer played quarterback at Thousand Oaks High School, which lists him as a 6-foot 210-pound senior. Kramer was found dead October 30 in a friend's bedroom in Agoura Hills, the sheriff's office said in a statement. That friend, David Nemberg, 19, of Agoura Hills, is charged with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance, authorities said. After investigating several of Kramer's acquaintances who were involved in narcotics-related activities, police also charged Corey Baumann, 19, also of Agoura Hills, with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance for sales, the sheriff's office said. Baumann and Nemberg were each released in lieu of a $125,000 bail, authorities said. The two other accused teenagers are minors, whose names weren't released, the sheriff's office said. A 17-year-old boy from Oak Park, California, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance, the sheriff's office said. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall without bail, authorities said. Investigators found "deplorable" living conditions during the search of the boy's home and took five children from the residence into protective custody, said authorities. The fourth teen, also a 17-year-old boy, of Agoura Hills, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, the sheriff's office said. He was released to his parents' custody, according to police. Police allege Griffen, Nemberg and a juvenile met at Sumac Park in Agoura Hills on October 29 and drove to a nearby cul-de-sac, where Griffen injected narcotics, causing him to instantly become ill and unconscious, authorities said. Nemberg allegedly dragged the unconscious Griffen into his car and then drove him around the area, police said. Nemberg called acquaintances and asked them if he could drive to their residences, but they told him no because their parents were home, police said. Nemberg allegedly took a still unconscious Griffen to Nemberg's home, authorities said. He didn't seek medical attention for Griffen until the next morning, when Nemberg woke up and saw Griffen was still unconscious, authorities alleged. "He woke up the following morning and called 911 because Griffen was unresponsive," Sheriff's Sgt. Barry Hall said in a statement. Griffen was believed to have been dead for several hours before Nemberg made the call, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Investigators believe Griffen had likely died from an overdose, but "we're still waiting for a toxicology results to determine the ultimate cause of death," Hall said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Griffen Kramer, 18, the son of retired NFL quarterback Erik Kramer, was found dead of an apparent drug overdose in a suburban Chicago residence on October 11th. The tragic news shocked and saddened the local community, especially considering Kramer's young age and athletic family background. The circumstances leading up to Kramer's death were revealed to be even more distressing as four teenagers, aged 17 and 19, were arrested and charged with various offenses in connection to the incident. One of the 19-year-olds was accused of keeping Kramer unconscious overnight before finally calling the police, resulting in a delayed response during which Kramer was dead for several hours. The four teenagers were identified as Ryan Phillip, 19, Sam Reay, 19, Antonio Perez, 17, and David Colletti, 17, all from the neighboring community of Thousand Oaks. Phillip was charged with concealing a death, reckless homicide, and unlawful delivery of a controlled substance, while Reay was charged with drug-induced homicide, along with Perez and Colletti, who were both charged with drug-induced homicide, conspiracy, and unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. According to authorities, the four teenagers were with Kramer when he ingested the fatal dose of drugs, which was later confirmed to be a combination of fentanyl and Xanax. However, instead of seeking immediate help or notifying authorities, Phillip allegedly decided to keep Kramer in the residence overnight while he was unconscious. It was only the next morning when Phillip eventually called the police, and by then, Kramer had already passed away. The delayed response has drawn criticism from the public, who believes that a timely response could have potentially saved the young man's life. The situation has also raised concerns about the easy availability of drugs among teenagers, and how the lack of awareness and education about the potential dangers of substance abuse can have devastating consequences. The arrest of the four teenagers has sent shockwaves through the community, with others expressing their condolences and support for the Kramer family in this difficult time. Erik Kramer, Griffen's father, released a statement describing the deep pain and sorrow he and his family are experiencing, and urging others to be vigilant about the dangers of drug use among young people. The tragic death of Griffen Kramer, a promising young athlete and member of a well-known football family, has cast a somber light on the dangerous consequences of drug abuse and the excessive availability of illegal substances. The incident serves as a reminder to us all of the importance of educating young people about the devastating effects of substance misuse and encouraging them to seek help when they or their peers are at risk.
