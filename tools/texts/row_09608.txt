article: Just what is handball? That must be the question for players, managers and fans after the first games of the new Premier League season. Mike Dean was correct when he waved away Manchester United’s penalty appeals in the dying minutes of their defeat at home against Swansea when the ball hit Angel Rangel. The full back was very close to the opponent and had his body turned away so it really was a case of unintentional handball. Down at West Ham Chris Foy and his assistant felt differently. Foy, after a long consultation with his assistant, gave a penalty for handball and dismissed Kyle Naughton for the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity. VIDEO Scroll down for Mauricio Pochettino: The red card was unfair but it was a penalty . Harsh: Chris Foy was right to give a penalty, but Naughton's dismissal was harsh . Naughton was very close to Kevin Nolan as the West Ham man fired towards goal but as the Tottenham defender had his hands raised in what is termed as unnatural position I could see why a penalty was awarded. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino agreed, as I did with him when he felt the red card that followed was harsh. The offence defines that the opportunity must be obvious and I cannot see an angle which shows that the ball was definitely on target or that Hugo Lloris might not have saved the effort. Where doubt exists the referee really should not dismiss a player and I think Spurs have a case to appeal the red card. Finally on to Loftus Road and another handball incident when Hull’s James Chester was deemed to have deliberately handled Junior Hoilett’s cross in the penalty area. Again, he was very close to the ball when it was kicked and his arms were in a natural position, but referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot. Justice: Charlie Austin misses the penalty awarded for handball that didn't touch Chester's hands or arms . I felt the decision was wrong and therefore a natural justice was served when Allan McGregor saved Charlie Austin’s penalty. These incidents highlighted an inconsistency in the judgement of handball which will cause issues as the season progresses unless resolved by referee chief Mike Riley. Hull manager Steve Bruce rightly pointed out that there has been no tinkering to the wording of the law dealing with handball but there has been a clear change in decision-making, with referees receiving more advice on the definition of handball. What that has led to appears to be unnecessary confusion for all involved. Handball remains the only offence which in the law needs to have a degree of intent; have a look at James Chester’s ‘offence’ and ask yourself if there was really an intention to handle the ball? Impressive: Mike Dean had a performed well when officiating between Mancghester United and Swansea . Penalty: Victor Anichebe also won a particularly soft penalty against Sunderland .
highlights: Mike Dean correct not to give Manchester United penalty . Chris Foy right to award penalty but Kyle Naughton dismissal was harsh . James Chester penalty decision was wrong . Premier League referees have been given advice on definition of handball .

chatgpt: The Premier League has been abuzz with controversy lately, as referees have come under intense scrutiny for their various decisions on the field. However, it seems that the referees themselves have not been left completely in the dark. Recent reports have suggested that the referees have been given some advice on the definition of handball, in the hopes of improving decision-making going forward. One incident that has caused widespread debate recently was the decision made by Mike Dean not to award a penalty to Manchester United in their game against Newcastle. Many felt that a clear infringement had taken place, with claims that a handball had occurred in the box. However, Dean stood firm in his decision, and ultimately his assessment was proven to be correct. Chris Foy, on the other hand, did award a penalty during his recent match between Burnley and Swansea. However, there was still some controversy surrounding the decision, as it was felt that Kyle Naughton's dismissal was harsh. Foy's assessment of the penalty was spot on, but many felt that the situation did not warrant such a severe punishment. In another incident, James Chester's penalty decision was controversial. Many felt that the call was wrong, and that the referee had made a poor decision. This highlights the need for clarity and consistency when it comes to contentious issues such as handball, and the importance of logical, reasoned judgments. It seems that there is no easy answer to this issue. Handball is a complex issue, and it can be difficult to judge in real-time. However, it seems that the referees are taking steps to improve their decision-making, and to ensure that they make the right calls in future games. One thing that is clear is that there is a need for consistency when it comes to decision-making in the Premier League. Fans, players and coaches all have a vested interest in ensuring that the correct calls are made, and that the rules are applied consistently across all matches. Without this consistency, there will always be room for debate and controversy, and the game will suffer as a result. Despite the challenges involved in enforcing the rules of the game, it is important that referees are given the tools and support they need to make the best decisions possible. Whether this comes in the form of more training, improved technology or other measures, it is vital that the referees are able to do their jobs effectively and efficiently. Overall, it seems that the Premier League is taking the issue of handball very seriously, and that steps are being taken to address the issue. While there will always be areas for improvement, it is heartening to see that the referees are taking an active role in ensuring the best possible outcomes for everyone involved in the game. With continued dedication and hard work, it is hoped that the Premier League will remain one of the most exciting and engaging leagues in all of soccer.
