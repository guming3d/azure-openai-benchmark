article: Hong Kong (CNN)A 32-year-old man was found dead in an Internet cafe in Taiwan after a marathon three-day gaming binge, the island's second death of an online gamer this year. The man, surnamed Hsieh, entered the cafe in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city, on January 6, Jennifer Wu, a police spokesperson from the Hunei district precint told CNN. An employee found him motionless and sprawled on a table at 10 a.m. on January 8 and he was rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead from cardiac failure, she added. "He has been unemployed for a long time, and internet cafes were the only place he could go to," she said. "His family said he would disappear for two to three days on end." Police first released details of the case late last week. It is not known exactly how long the man lay dead in the Internet cafe but police said his corpse had begun to stiffen so he must have been dead for several hours before they arrived on the scene. Police said gamers in the caf√© continued as if nothing happened even when the police and paramedics arrived. "The CCTV footage from the Internet cafe showed that he had a small struggle before he collapsed motionless," said Wu. Cold temperatures and over-exhaustion from the long hours spent playing games likely contributed to Hsieh's cardiac arrest, a police statement said. According to the Taipei Times, the man was a "regular customer" who often played for consecutive days. "When tired, he would sleep face down on the table or doze off slumped in his chair," the staff member was quoted as saying. "That is why we were not aware of his condition in the beginning." Taiwan is no stranger to deaths from marathon sessions of online gaming. Hsieh's death came after 38-year-old man was found dead at an Internet cafe in Taipei on January 1 after playing video games for five days straight. And in 2012, the corpse of man who died playing online games went unnoticed for 10 hours by other gamers and staff.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck once again in Taiwan's internet cafes as another gamer was found dead after spending two consecutive days playing video games. The man, identified as Hsieh, entered the cafe on January 8 and was discovered lifeless two days later. The authorities believe that the cause of death was a cardiac failure. The incident is the latest in a series of gaming-related deaths that have occurred in Taiwan over the past few years, raising concerns over the health effects of excessive gaming. Earlier this year, a man was found dead in an internet cafe after playing video games for five consecutive days. According to reports, Hsieh regularly visited the internet cafe in Tainan, southern Taiwan, where he would spend hours playing games. The cafe owner stated that Hsieh had been a customer for more than a year and had never shown any signs of health problems. Authorities are urging gamers to take breaks regularly and to monitor their health while playing. Over the past few years, Taiwan has implemented measures to tackle the issue of excessive gaming, including imposing age limits and requiring gaming cafes to monitor players and limit their time spent in the establishment. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently recognized gaming disorder as a mental health condition, citing persistent gaming behavior despite negative consequences on a person's life. The condition is characterized by a lack of control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences. While gaming can have positive effects, including improving cognitive skills and social connections, excessive gaming can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, sleep disturbances, and eyestrain. The current pandemic has only exacerbated the issue, with more people turning to gaming as a form of entertainment and escape. The tragic death of Hsieh serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive gaming and the need for individuals to monitor their health while indulging in this activity. As the gaming industry continues to grow in popularity, it is crucial for players to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to mitigate them.
