The blaze was reported Wednesday afternoon at the prison in Sunbury, a city of 10,000 residents about 40 miles north of Harrisburg, the state capital. Intense flames and thick smoke shot through the roof. The prison, a stone building with castle-like parapets, was built in the late-1800s and sits a few blocks off the banks of the Susquehanna River in close proximity to homes and businesses.

Sunbury Fire Chief Ken Kipple said in a press conference once the fire had been brought under control, that it was challenging  to tackle having to work around law enforcement and evacuations from the secure facility. County officials said the male and female inmates were being moved to separate state prisons nearby, and a neighboring county agreed to house new inmates brought in following the fire. Female inmates have been moved to SCI Muncy in Lycoming County, a state facility that typically houses medium to maximum-security female prisoners, WNEP 16 reported. The male inmates have been moved south to the state facility in Coal Township. Officials are not giving too many details away about the prison transfers as securely moving inmates from one location to another creates a delicate situation.

Despite the devastation caused by the fire, authorities are relieved that no injuries were reported during the incident.

In conclusion, the fire at the 140-year-old prison located near Harrisburg has caused irreparable damage to a historic structure that had held a remarkable place in the history of the state.
