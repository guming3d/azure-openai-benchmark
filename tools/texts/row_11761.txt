While University students are often stereotyped as bookworms with no common sense, new research has shown that they are actually picking up vital life skills while studying. Among them are the ability to turn on a grill, how to set up the internet, and how to budget. The list does little to undermine stereotypes however, as playing pub games, blagging essays and the effectiveness of napping all come high up. Other strange pieces of wisdom picked up between library sessions include the fact that fridges don't clean themselves, and why it is a bad idea to eat mould. A list of the top 50 'life skills' gained while at Uni has been published, revealing that students learn how to study all night and survive three days without sleep . A spokeswoman for Disney, which conducted the research to mark the release of Disney Pixar's Monsters University, said: 'No matter which walk of life you come from, it would seem that university is a great leveller. 'Learning day to day basics such as budgeting, how to book a doctor's appointment and using a washing machine along with finding out who you are and want to become is integral to the whole university experience. 'There's definitely a valuable alternative curriculum at Uni with some of it more fun than others. While some practical skills were picked up, such as basic DIY and how to tune a television, the benefits of napping were also in the top 50 . 'Not only does our research confirm this but it also reveals this is not particular to just today's generation of university students it also applies to previous generations.' Two thirds of students said that the experience of moving away from home had been a 'real eye opener' with nearly half saying that they were shocked by how little they knew when mum and dad were no longer around. In fact new students called home on average 20 times a month to check how to do things, though that lessened as time went on. Luckily for parents, however, those surveyed also said they only really started to appreciate home after they had gone. It took people four months to feel settled in their new accomodation, with five months passing before they knew who their friends were going to be. Among the hardest challenges were learning to live with strangers, making new friends, and mixing with people from different backgrounds.

chatgpt: A new list of the top 50 "life skills" gained at university has been published, and it includes a range of practical and not-so-practical abilities that students acquire during their time at university.  Among the practical life skills on the list are basic DIY knowledge, such as fixing a leaky faucet or putting up a shelf, as well as more technical knowledge, such as how to use a boiler or tune a TV. These skills can come in handy for students throughout their adult lives and can save them money on home repair bills.  However, the list also features some less useful skills, such as blagging essays, napping, and playing pub games. While these skills may not seem immediately helpful in the real world, they do have their benefits. Knowing how to blag a persuasive essay or presentation can help students shine in job interviews or even in their social lives. And taking a nap throughout the day can improve productivity and concentration when studying or working on assignments.  The list was compiled by a team of researchers who surveyed university students and graduates, asking them about the skills they acquired during their time in higher education. The researchers then analyzed the responses and came up with the top 50 most commonly cited skills.  Other practical skills on the list include cooking a meal from scratch, cleaning properly, and basic first aid knowledge. These skills can help students become more independent and self-sufficient, preparing them for adult life.  Less practical skills include mastering the art of beer pong, knowing how to recover from a hangover quickly, and the ability to cram for exams the night before. While these skills may not seem particularly useful, they do have their place in student culture and can help students bond with their peers.  The publication of this list is timely, given the recent debates around the value of a university education and what students actually gain from attending university. While academic knowledge and qualifications are undoubtedly important, the practical and interpersonal skills students develop at university are also valuable and can help them throughout their lives.  Overall, the list highlights the diverse range of skills that can be gained at university, from the practical to the frivolous. While some of these skills may seem less immediately useful than others, they all contribute to the holistic development of students and their preparation for life beyond higher education.
