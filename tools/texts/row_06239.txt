article: By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . It might be barking mad, but a Turkish company has come up with an ingenious way of getting people to recycle AND feed stray animals at the same time. Meet Pugedon - the vending machine where you put the drinks bottles in, and out comes a portion of food for Istanbul's stray dogs and cats to gobble up. The profit made from the recycled bottles covers the cost of the pet food, so the machine works economically, while it is also super eco-friendly, as it runs off solar power. Scroll down for video . Doggie dinner: This Turkish vending machine both encourages recycling and helps feed hungry stray animals . Ameowzing: A stray cat gratefully tucks into the food dispensed at the bottom on the machine . Istanbul has a high number of stray cats and dogs, many of which can go for days without food. It is estimated that there are around 150,000 dogs alone without owners in the city. The station has two insertion holes, one for plastic bottles, metal soda cans and carton containers and one for the water which the plastic bottles may contain. When a plastic bottle or can is dropped into the hole the unit releases some food to the feeding container below, while the water that is poured down the separate hole goes directly to a container below for the animals to drink. Good deeds: Inventor Engin Girgin says the machine kills two bird with one stone, and is economically viable . Engin Girgin, inventor of the machine, told Der Spiegel: 'My primary goal was to make people see that they don't have to spend any money to help stray dogs. And I also wanted to show that people can do good deeds with things they would normally throw away. 'At the same time, of course, I know that we don't give much priority to recycling here in Turkey. In my opinion, this has to change. So I basically killed two birds with one stone.' It is manufactured by industrial company YCN Yucesan group, who usually make steam boilers, but they were keen to buy into Mr Girgin's innovative project. There were fears among residents that these food boxes may lead to parts of the city being flocked with packs of hungry dogs, but that has not been the case, as all dogs have their own territory, which they do not leave for any long time, even for food. The project's success has been noted all round the world. Mr Girgin says that 61 countries have expressed interest in having vending machines of their own, and they are being shipped out to 20 cities outside of Turkey in the near future.

chatgpt: Istanbul, Turkey - A new vending machine that dispenses pet food in exchange for recycled bottles and cans has been introduced in Istanbul city centre. The invention, which has been dubbed the "feral-friendly vending machine," was created by inventor Engin Girgin and aims to both reduce litter on the streets and feed stray animals. Girgin explained that his invention "kills two birds with one stone." Each time a recyclable bottle or can is inserted into the machine, a portion of pet food is dispensed, providing much-needed sustenance for the city's stray cat and dog population. But the benefits don't stop there. The profit made from recycling the bottles and cans covers the cost of the pet food, making the venture sustainable in the long-term.  Girgin's vending machine has already proven to be a hit in Istanbul, and it is now being distributed to 20 other cities outside of Turkey. The inventor hopes that the machine will help combat the problem of stray animals' hunger while also promoting recycling. Stray dogs and cats are a common sight on the streets of Istanbul, with an estimated 150,000 strays inhabiting the city alone. Feeding these animals can be a challenge, as they are often considered a nuisance by locals and are therefore ignored, leading to starvation. Girgin's invention offers a solution to this problem by providing a sustainable source of food for the animals. The vending machine has been designed to be both user-friendly and accessible, meaning that anyone can use it to help feed the animals. The concept of feeding stray animals using vending machines has been gaining popularity in recent years. In Japan, a company called "Dokeki" has created vending machines that dispense cat food to help feed the country's feline population, while in the UK, a similar initiative called "The Street Cat Hub" has been set up to provide food and water to stray cats. Girgin's invention is an important step towards addressing the issue of stray animal hunger in Istanbul and beyond. By promoting recycling and offering a sustainable source of food for the city's strays, the feral-friendly vending machine serves as a reminder of the importance of creating innovative solutions to today's most pressing problems.
