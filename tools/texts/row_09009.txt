chatgpt: Wayne Rooney has revealed that he once supported Arsenal during a Premier League match at Anfield. The striker, who recently won his 100th cap for England, confessed that he attended the match as a fan of the Gunners. Rooney's friend Francis Jeffers was playing for Arsenal at the time, and the Manchester United striker decided to show his support by joining the away fans in the stands. However, despite his allegiance to Arsenal, Rooney was unable to see his team win the match, as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Liverpool. 
Although the match took place in 2003, Rooney's memories of the occasion are still clear. Speaking ahead of England's friendly with Scotland, Rooney said, "I remember being in the away end with my mate, who was playing for Arsenal. It was a great game, but unfortunately we didn't get the result we wanted." Despite his support for Arsenal on that occasion, Rooney has enjoyed a successful career with Manchester United, winning multiple trophies and becoming the club's all-time leading goalscorer. He has also been a key player for England, earning his 100th cap in a World Cup qualifier against Slovenia last weekend. Rooney's achievement was marked by a special presentation before the match, with former England striker Sir Bobby Charlton presenting him with a commemorative cap. The Manchester United star was visibly emotional during the ceremony, and later described the occasion as a "huge honour." 
While Rooney's support for Arsenal may have raised eyebrows among some fans, it is not uncommon for footballers to have connections to clubs other than their own. The 31-year-old has previously spoken about his admiration for Everton, the club where he began his career, and has also expressed an interest in playing in Major League Soccer in the United States. Whatever the future holds for Rooney, he can look back on a remarkable career that has seen him achieve great success with both Manchester United and England. And while his support for Arsenal may have been fleeting, it serves as a reminder that even the biggest stars in football can have unexpected allegiances.
