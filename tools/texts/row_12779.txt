It is perfect, according to American manufacturer Deluxe Comfort website, for 'singles who desire to feel the touch of a man without actually having to be with one', and 'people whose partner is away on military leave or work absence'. The 2lb pillow, available in the UK online at Wayfair for £35.99, allows the user to wrap themselves in the nook of an arm and be cuddled to sleep, and would be 'a great gift for a friend or relative with a good sense of humor that would love to have a little more cuddling at night'.

Priced at an even more economical $24.95 (£15.69) - perhaps because it is wearing no clothes - the pink-breasted comforter has raised eyebrows in the pillow-loving community's feminist subdivision for its pinkness, its nakedness and the fact it is wearing a Marigold washing up glove on its solitary hand.

chatgpt: Deluxe Comfort has recently created a pink version of their popular cushion, known as the Girlfriend Pillow. This addition allows customers to choose from a wider range of colors to fit their personal tastes and décor. The original cushion, known for its comfort and versatility, has been a favorite among consumers since its release. The Girlfriend Pillow version has received similar high praise, with many customers noting the added touch of femininity the pink color provides. In addition to being a stylish addition to any room, the cushion’s unique shape lends itself to multiple uses. Its arm-like extensions allow for comfortable placement behind the back or around the neck, providing personalized support. Its soft, plush feel makes it perfect for lounging or use during a long flight. “Adding the Girlfriend Pillow in pink was a natural choice,” said Deluxe Comfort’s founder, Rick Silver. “We wanted to offer a color option that felt fun and feminine, while still providing the same level of comfort and support as our other cushions.” The Girlfriend Pillow is not just a decorative item, but a functional one designed to enhance the user’s experience. Its flexibility makes it ideal for use during activities such as reading, watching TV, or even meditating. Its portability also allows for easy transportation, making it an excellent option for travel or taking to the office. “We strive to create products that improve people’s lives in small ways,” added Silver. “The Girlfriend Pillow is a prime example of this, as it can provide added comfort and relaxation during everyday activities.” The cushion is made of high-quality materials and is machine washable for easy maintenance. The pink cover is removable for those who prefer a different color or desire a change in décor. The Girlfriend Pillow is available for purchase on Deluxe Comfort’s website or through select retailers. With its unique shape, plush feel, and now a variety of color options, it’s a must-have for anyone seeking an elevated lounging or relaxation experience.
