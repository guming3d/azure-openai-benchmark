article: The troubled inquiry into historic child abuse is facing fresh criticism after it emerged that panel members were told what to say to MPs by a long-serving Home Office official. Experts and abuse survivors were given a 23-page document advising them how to answer ‘difficult questions’ when they appeared before a high-profile committee, prompting fears that the huge Government-ordered investigation is not independent. It can also be revealed that the woman in charge of administration for the inquiry was seconded from the Home Office, where she has worked for 36 years – even though the department is at the centre of many of the allegations of cover-ups and VIP paedophile rings. Police watchdog Dru Sharpling (left) and academic Jenny Pearce were emailed a 23-page document outlining key kessages, key facts, and a chronology to use when they were quizzed by Labour MP Keith Vaz (right) Last night critics said it was yet another blow to the reputation of the inquiry, which has barely begun work more than six months after it was announced. Baroness Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf both had to quit as chairman over conflicts of interest, with the replacement due to be announced this week. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are concerned that members of the secretariat, who have been seconded from the Home Office, have told witnesses what to say.’ He led the questioning of police watchdog Dru Sharpling and academic Jenny Pearce when the panellists appeared before his committee last month to discuss the turmoil. Internal emails now reveal that the two witnesses had been given detailed ‘key messages’, ‘key facts’ and a ‘chronology’ to learn, as well as instructions on ‘difficult questions’. It is just the latest blunder to hit the inquiry, after Fiona Woolf (left) and Baroness Butler-Sloss (right) were forced to resign as chairman over possible conflicts of interest . The email was sent by Angela Kyle, ‘head of secretariat’ for the inquiry, who is effectively running its administration. She has been a Home Office employee since October 1978, a time when the department was allegedly giving funding to the Paedophile Information Exchange. The late Leon Brittan was criticised for failing to outlaw PIE when he was Home Secretary in the 1980s and for not taking action on a dossier of alleged high-profile child abusers. Responses given by panel members to the Home Affairs Committee on January 16 matched the answers suggested in advance by Mrs Kyle, including those on questions on whether the panel was going to be disbanded and who should chair the inquiry. A spokesman for the inquiry said: ‘There was no coaching of panel members, but advice was legitimately given.’

chatgpt: In the ongoing inquiry into allegations of inappropriate behavior within the workplace, the two previous chairmen who were leading the investigation have been forced to quit. Possibility of conflicts of interest has been cited as the reason for their resignation. While the inquiry was put on hold for a brief period to sort out the matter, Dru Sharpling and Jenny Pearce were given a document containing key facts and messages that they would have to learn. The document was meant to help prepare Sharpling and Pearce for the grilling that they would face during the inquiry. The document provided a detailed chronology of events that they must be familiar with, along with a clear understanding of the key facts that would be central to the inquiry. The material was sent to Sharpling and Pearce via email by Angela Kyle, the 'head of secretariat' for the inquiry. The aim was to ensure they had the necessary knowledge and awareness to tackle any questions that may be thrown their way during the inquiry. The situation has caused a brief interruption in the smooth functioning of the inquiry, but Sharpling and Pearce are expected to be able to carry on the proceedings. While the resignation of the two chairmen was an unexpected and disappointing setback, efforts are now underway to ensure that the investigation continues without further delays. The inquiry deals with allegations of inappropriate behavior within the workplace, which is a matter of serious concern for everyone involved. It is important that the investigation is conducted thoroughly and without bias, so that any wrongdoings can be exposed and rectified. Sharpling and Pearce will be critical in ensuring that the inquiry stays on track and that the truth is uncovered. With the information contained in the document provided to them, they will be well prepared to tackle any challenges that may arise. They now have a clear understanding of the facts and the events that have led to this investigation, and they will be equipped to provide detailed and accurate answers to any questions that may come their way. The situation has been a reminder of the challenges that can arise when dealing with sensitive and important matters. It is essential that those responsible for such inquiries are free from conflicts of interest and that they act impartially to maintain the integrity of the investigation. While setbacks and challenges may arise, it is important to remain focused on the task at hand and to ensure that justice is done. In conclusion, the resignation of the two chairmen has been a blow to the inquiry, but Sharpling and Pearce are well equipped to carry on the proceedings. The document provided to them will prove invaluable in providing them with the knowledge and preparedness to face the inquiry with confidence. It is our hope that the inquiry will continue to uncover any wrongdoings and set standards for appropriate behavior in the workplace.
