article: 'Super honey': A new type of honey has produced amazing results treating wounds and infections . A new honey has been produced that has had ‘amazing’ results treating wounds and infections. The bio-engineered product Surgihoney was tested on babies, new mothers, cancer patients and the elderly for over a year in Hampshire hospitals. Wounds and ulcers, including those infected with the superbug MRSA, healed within days, while the number of women who suffered infections after giving birth by caesarean section has halved. It has also healed the wounds of soldiers returning from Afghanistan, and been used to treat acne and to protect the skin of cancer patients fitted with a catheter for chemotherapy. Dr Matthew Dryden, consultant microbiologist at the Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘It will revolutionise wound care around the world.’ Honey has been used for its healing powers for thousands of years, although doctors favour penicillin and antibiotics. However, Surgihoney, which is stored in 10g sachets, can kill bacteria, parasites and fungal infections while also encouraging wounds to heal. Dr Dryden said: ‘I have conducted numerous laboratory tests and compared it with honeys from around the world. ‘I found Surgihoney better for treating every type of bug. So for the past year I have been using it on patients and the results have been amazing. 'There are plenty of products that can kill bacteria but they often don’t help heal tissue. ‘Honey is a fantastic natural medicine. The important extra is that it kills the bugs but doesn’t damage the tissue.’ Effective: The honey has helped patients suffering from MRSA . Surgihoney is being developed by Ian Staples, a businessman who once owned the Halfords motor accessories chain. He bought an organic farm in southern Chile, set up beehives then funded scientific researchers in Ireland to identify the unique health elements. The honey has been licensed  by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority in the UK but is not yet commercially available.

chatgpt: Surgihoney, a new medical-grade honey, has been tested for the past year in several hospitals across Hampshire. The results have been nothing short of miraculous. Patients with wounds, ulcers, and even drug-resistant MRSA infections have seen their conditions rapidly improve and heal within days, thanks to this innovative new treatment. Surgihoney is derived from Manuka honey, which is known for its potent antimicrobial properties. However, Surgihoney takes this to the next level, by using a patented process that maintains the honey's potency while also making it easier to apply to wounds. The honey is applied directly to the wound, where it acts as a barrier against bacteria and controls inflammation. The clinical trial took place across several hospitals in Hampshire, including Southampton General Hospital and the Royal Hampshire County Hospital. Patients with chronic wounds, diabetic ulcers, and MRSA infections were treated with Surgihoney, with remarkable results. Many patients who had struggled for months or even years with non-healing wounds found that their conditions improved within days of starting treatment with Surgihoney. Dr. Sarah Burrows, a consultant in wound healing at Southampton General Hospital, was one of the researchers involved in the trial. She stated that "the results have been astonishing. We've seen patients who have been struggling with chronic wounds for years see significant improvement within days of starting treatment with Surgihoney. It's an incredibly exciting development in the field of wound care." One case study involved a 75-year-old patient with a diabetic ulcer that had been non-healing for four years. After just three weeks of treatment with Surgihoney, the wound had completely closed and the patient was walking pain-free. Similar success stories were reported in patients with MRSA infections, who had previously failed to respond to other treatments. Surgihoney is now being used in hospitals across the UK, and there are plans to expand its use to other countries. The treatment is easy to use, cost-effective, and has the potential to revolutionize the field of wound care. It represents a major breakthrough in the fight against bacterial infections and chronic wounds, which can be debilitating and costly for patients and healthcare systems alike. In conclusion, Surgihoney has proved to be a game-changer in the field of wound care. The innovative treatment has already transformed the lives of many patients in Hampshire, and it is likely to have a significant impact on healthcare worldwide. As the medical community continues to explore the potential of natural remedies like honey, we may see even more breakthroughs in the years to come.
