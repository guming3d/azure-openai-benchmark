The Blues have been putting in some impressive performances and Serbian midfielder, Nemanja Matic, has heaped praise on their new signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas. In an interview, Matic said, "Both Diego and Cesc have been excellent for us." Diego Costa, who joined Chelsea from Atletico Madrid during the summer transfer window, has already scored seven goals in seven games. His bulldozing style of play and clinical finishing have made him an instant hit with the Chelsea faithful. Cesc Fabregas, on the other hand, has been an integral part of the Chelsea midfield. The Spanish playmaker has been instrumental in setting up goals for his teammates and has already provided seven assists in the Premier League this season. His creativity and vision have added a new dimension to Chelsea's attack. Matic, who is part of the Chelsea midfield alongside Fabregas, has also been in scintillating form this season.
