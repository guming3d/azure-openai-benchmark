The collapse in value of Facebook shares after the company's disastrous flotation on the stock market might be a sign of worse things to come. One senior investment analyst predicts that the firm will collapse in value and will virtually disappear within eight years. Eric Jackson of investment firm Ironfire Capital predicts that Facebook will collapse like ex-internet titans such as Yahoo, as it struggles to keep up with younger, leaner firms. Zuckerberg in the wake of the firm's recent disastrous IPO - but an analyst predicts things will get worse for the company . Speaking to the CNBC show Squawk on the Street, he said that Facebook would struggle with the 'modern', mobile web, and would disappear. ‘In five to eight years they are going to disappear in the way that Yahoo has disappeared. Yahoo is still making money, it’s still profitable, still has 13,000 employees working for it, but it’s 10 percent of the value that it was at the height of 2000. For all intents and purposes, it’s disappeared,’ said Jackson. The key to the impending disaster that Jackson predicts for the social networks is that it's falling between 'generations' of technology - and will struggle with moving into mobiles. Facebook has aggressively targeted mobile users with a range of new apps, but has struggled to make apps profitable without making advertising too intrusive. Jackson divides companies into three generations - web portals, such as Yahoo, social sites such as Facebook, and mobile companies, such as today's hot app start-ups. ‘When you look over these three generations, no matter how successful you are in one generation, you don’t seem to be able to translate that into success in the second generation, no matter how much money you have in the bank, no matter how many smart PhDs you have working for you,' says Jackson. Initial public flop: Shares of Facebook have fallen 30 percent since Zuckerberg proudly announced the $38 IPO of his social media giant . ‘Look at how Google has struggled moving into social, and I think Facebook is going to have the same kind of challenges moving into mobile.’ He continued, ‘The world is moving faster, it’s getting more competitive, not less, and I think those who are dominant in their prior generation are really going to have a hard time moving into this newer generation.’

chatgpt: Shares of social media giant Facebook have plummeted by nearly 30 percent, falling below $27 per share. This news comes in the wake of criticism about the company’s handling of user data, and concerns over the company’s growth prospects. Adding to the negative news surrounding Facebook, a prominent founder of an investment firm has stated that the company is on a path to collapse. This harsh assessment is based on concerns about the company’s long-term outlook, as well as its ability to attract and retain users. The founder of the investment firm stated that Facebook will be "like former internet titans Yahoo" in just eight years. This is a bleak prognosis, as Yahoo, once a dominant force in the internet industry, has struggled in recent years and been acquired by other companies. While Facebook is far from collapsing at this point, the fact that such a prominent figure in the investment world is sounding the alarm should be a wake-up call for the company’s leadership. There are several factors contributing to Facebook’s current challenges. One major issue is the scrutiny the company is currently facing over its handling of user data, particularly in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This has led to increased calls for regulation and oversight of social media companies, and it remains to be seen how this will impact Facebook’s business model. Another issue is the company’s ability to continue growing its user base. With nearly 2.5 billion monthly active users, Facebook is already a massive platform. However, as the company saturates existing markets and faces increasing competition from other social media platforms, it may struggle to maintain its growth trajectory. Finally, there are concerns about the company’s ability to innovate and adapt to changing trends in the tech industry. Facebook’s core product, the News Feed, has remained largely unchanged for years, and there are questions about whether the company can continue to engage and retain users with this model. Despite these challenges, Facebook remains a powerful force in the tech industry and is unlikely to disappear anytime soon. However, the fact that such dire predictions are being made by prominent figures in the investment world should be a wake-up call for the company’s leadership to address its issues and work towards a more sustainable long-term future.
