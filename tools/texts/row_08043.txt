chatgpt: Jonny Wilkinson has bid a fond farewell to rugby union in the most fitting way possible, helping Toulon complete a stunning domestic and European double triumph in his final season. The 35-year-old World Cup winner was a key figure as his side beat Castres 18-10 in the Top 14 final to add to their Heineken Cup success two weeks earlier. It was a fitting send off for the former England fly-half who has been at the club since leaving Newcastle Falcons in 2009. He had already bowed out of international rugby following England's quarter-final defeat by France in the 2011 World Cup. Wilkinson first tasted European Cup success with Toulon in 2013 and had always stated his intention to retire at the end of this campaign. He surpassed his own expectations as he became the first Englishman to lead a team to a European Cup win outside of his homeland. Toulon's success has not gone unnoticed by the local authorities, with the club's players being awarded honorary citizenship by Toulon mayor Hubert Falco. On their return to the city on Tuesday evening, Wilkinson and his team-mates arrived by boat at the harbour where they were greeted by thousands of supporters. The team then made their way by open-top bus to a reception at the city's main square, where the players were presented with the Top 14 trophy. For Wilkinson, it was an emotional night as he took the chance to say a final goodbye to the Toulon faithful. "It's been an amazing journey," he told the crowd. "I first came here looking for a new challenge and I've found that and more. I'll never forget my time here and I'll always be a Toulon fan." Wilkinson has enjoyed a glittering career that spans 17 years, during which time he won 91 England caps and played 91 times for Newcastle before joining Toulon. He has scored over 1,200 points in his career and was named IRB World Player of the Year in 2003 following England's World Cup triumph. Despite his significant achievements in the game, it is his contribution to Toulon that will be remembered most fondly. The club has won three successive European Cups and back-to-back domestic titles, with Wilkinson playing a key role in their success. As he steps away from the game, there is little doubt that Wilkinson has left an indelible mark on rugby union. He will be remembered as one of England's greatest ever players and a true legend of the sport.
