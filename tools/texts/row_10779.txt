chatgpt: Oakland - Moses Kamin, 16, has plead guilty to the murders of Susan Poff, 50, and Robert Kamin, 55, in a last-minute plea deal that took place on Tuesday. He admitted stabbing both victims to death, and will now face a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. The killings took place in January of 2012, and Kamin was arrested soon after. Prosecutors alleged that on the day of the murders, Kamin had an argument with Poff, who Poff had taken in as her own son. They said that Kamin then went on to murder Poff first, and then her partner Robert Kamin, after he returned home. Initially, Kamin had pled not guilty, and his trial was set to begin in the coming weeks. However, on Tuesday, he changed his plea to guilty, much to the surprise of the court. The decision to plead guilty may have come as a result of discussions between the prosecution and Kamin's defense team. The two parties have been in negotiations for several months, and it is understood that the plea deal was reached only in the last few days. The plea deal means that Kamin will avoid the death penalty, which was a possibility had he been found guilty following a trial. His sentence of 25 years to life means that he will remain in prison until at least 2045. The case has shocked the local community, who had known Poff and Kamin as respected members of the Oakland community. The couple had been together for several decades and were known for their commitment to social justice causes. Speaking after the hearing, the couple's family expressed their relief that the case had finally been resolved. "We're just glad it's over and that we can begin to move on," said one relative. Kamin's sentencing is set for January, during which the victims' families will be given the opportunity to make victim impact statements. It is expected that they will offer a searing indictment of Kamin's actions, and call for the full force of the law to be applied. Meanwhile, Kamin will begin what will likely be a lifelong incarceration, his future shattered as a result of his actions.
