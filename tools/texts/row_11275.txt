chatgpt: In a thrilling match between Zambia and Tunisia, Yassine Chikhaoui was the hero for Tunisia as he scored a late winner to secure all three points in the Group B African Cup of Nations match held in Equatorial Guinea. Southampton's Emmanuel Mayuka gave Zambia the lead with a stunning goal after 59 minutes, leaving the Tunisian goalkeeper helpless. But the lead didn't last for long, as Ahmed Akaichi equalised for his side after just 11 minutes. The game was evenly contested throughout and both teams looked dangerous in attack.  The momentum kept shifting from one side to the other and it was anyone's guess who would come out on top. However, it was Yassine Chikhaoui who emerged as the hero for Tunisia when he scored the winner in the 89th minute with a beautiful header. Tunisia had started the game brightly but failed to convert their early chances. Zambia looked composed and were defending well until Mayuka's goal shook them. After conceding the equalizer, the Chipolopolo looked a bit rattled and were struggling to contain the Tunisian attack. Tunisia's second-half performance was much improved, and they kept pushing for a winner. It was no surprise when Chikhaoui scored the decisive goal with just a minute left in the match. This win will come as a huge boost for Tunisia who are now joint leaders of the group along with Cape Verde. They will be hoping to continue their winning ways in the next match and cement their position at the top of the table. Zambia, on the other hand, will be disappointed with the result as they failed to hold onto their lead. They will need to regroup quickly and focus on their next match against Cape Verde, which is a must-win encounter for them. The match was an entertaining spectacle with both teams playing some exciting football. The Tunisian fans will be delighted with their team's performance, while the Zambian fans will be hoping for a turnaround in their next match. Overall, it was a great advertisement for African football and a testament to the quality of players on display.
