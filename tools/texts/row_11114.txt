chatgpt: A Brinks truck carrying the new Canadian currency crashed into a rock, spilling an estimated $3m to $5m worth of coins across the highway. The incident took place in Ontario, Canada, and resulted in the driver and passenger of the truck sustaining "life-threatening" injuries.  The truck was also carrying candy, which added to the chaos of the accident. The candy was seen scattered across the highway along with the coins, causing a major traffic jam.  The incident occurred on a busy stretch of the highway, and eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud bang. The truck had apparently hit a rock on the side of the road and flipped over, causing the coins to spill out across the highway.  The Royal Canadian Mint confirmed that the Brinks truck was carrying a shipment of the new Canadian currency, which had been recently introduced to the market. The coins were in denominations of $1, $2, $25, $50, and $100. It is not known exactly how much money was lost in the accident, but a spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mint said that it was "a significant amount".  The recovery effort was a major undertaking, with traffic on the highway being brought to a standstill. Emergency services and road crews worked tirelessly to clear the highway and recover as much of the spilled currency as possible. The coins were counted and taken back to the Royal Canadian Mint for further examination.  The driver and passenger of the Brinks truck were taken to hospital with "life-threatening" injuries. Their condition remains unknown at this stage. It is not clear what caused the accident or whether any other vehicles were involved.  The incident highlights the potential dangers of transporting large quantities of valuable items on the road. Brinks, a well-known armoured truck company, has faced scrutiny in the past over the safety of its drivers and the security of its shipments.  The Canadian Bankers Association, which represents the country's banking industry, said that the incident would not have any impact on the security of the new currency. "The safety and security of Canada's currency is of utmost importance, and we are confident that Brinks and other armoured truck companies take all necessary precautions to protect the valuable cargo they transport," a spokesperson for the association said.  The investigation into the cause of the accident is ongoing, and it is not yet known whether any charges will be laid. The Canadian public has been urged to be on the lookout for any stray coins and to report any sightings to the authorities.  Overall, the incident is a reminder of the potential hazards of transporting valuable items on the road and the importance of taking necessary precautions to ensure their safe delivery.
