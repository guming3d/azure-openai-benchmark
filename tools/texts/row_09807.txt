article: By . Joel Christie . Transport Canada is investigating an incident involving a seaplane making a dangerous takeoff underneath a bridge in Ottawa last weekend, which onlookers described as 'suicidal'. Footage of the stunt has since emerged, showing the pilot slowly lifting along the Ottawa River on Saturday morning, with terrified witnesses believing the plane wouldn't clear the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge it was heading directly for. As rowers on the water stop to watch and people can be heard screaming and yelling, the light aircraft sails through two pylons of the bridge - which connects Ottawa and Gatineau - and out the other side. 'Honestly, I thought he was suicidal,' Lana Burpee, preisdent of the Ottawa Rowing, told The National Post after witnessing the takeoff. Scroll down for video . 'What is he doing': Onlookers watch in horror as the pilot of a seaplane starts to lift off on the Ottawa River, headed straight for a car bridge . 'He's not going to make it': At this point the plane seemed as if it would smash straight into the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge . Stupid: Witnesses said there was no need for the pilot to do what they did, and could have just taxied under the bridge to the other side . Barely made it: Witnesses say the risky takeoff could have gone horribly wrong . Lucky: The plane makes it under the bridge and out the other side . 'I thought he was going to try to smash into the side of the bridge, but fortunately the pilot was able to get through that ascent safely.' Burpee added that the pilot had only been 'a heartbeat away it could have been the worst-case scenario'. She described the stunt as 'crazy, reckless and endangering', especially since there were numerous small boats and rowers on the river at the time. It is unusual to see seaplanes on the Ottawa River. Investigations into the the takeoff continue to see whether the pilot could face penalties for the stunt. Video, taken by Burpee's husband Peter, was uploaded to Youtube.

chatgpt: An incident that occurred on Saturday on the Ottawa River near the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge has left witnesses in shock. The pilot of a seaplane decided to take off under the bridge, barely clearing it. Witnesses reported that they thought the pilot was purposely trying to crash. The incident took place at approximately 3:00 pm when the seaplane was seen making its way towards the bridge. As the plane approached, it became clear to those watching that the pilot was attempting to fly under the bridge. Witnesses reported feeling anxious and feared that the plane would crash, but to their relief, the plane barely cleared the bridge. Transport Canada has launched an investigation into the incident. They are looking into whether the pilot's actions were in violation of any regulations or if there was a malfunction of the aircraft. The investigation will also look into the pilot's overall experience and the safety procedures that were in place at the time of the incident. The incident has left many questioning the safety measures in place for seaplanes flying near bridges. The Macdonald-Cartier Bridge is a major landmark and is frequently used by seaplanes as it provides a shorter route over the river. However, it is essential that safety protocols are in place to prevent accidents from occurring. Seaplanes are typically used for recreational purposes and are a popular form of transportation in areas surrounding Ottawa. While they are generally safe, this incident highlights the importance of safety measures for seaplanes operating near busy urban areas. As the investigation continues, it is hoped that more information will become available about the pilot's actions and potential safety breaches. Transport Canada has stressed the importance of following safety procedures and ensuring that all aviation regulations are followed to prevent accidents from occurring. In the meantime, those who witnessed the incident are grateful that no one was hurt and are hopeful that safety measures will be put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
