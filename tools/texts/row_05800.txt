article: By . Chris Kitching . Scottish officials are pointing the finger at English tourists after heaps of rubbish were allowed to pile up near the busiest border crossing with Scotland. Grease-stained takeaway containers, empty plastic bottles and assorted litter covered the ground at the base of an overflowing bin on the A1 just north of Berwick-upon-Tweed, the northernmost town in England. Stunned motorists snapped photos as they drove past the unpleasant sight that formed just metres from a sign that proudly welcomes visitors to Scotland. This place is not a dump: Locals say the mess on the A1 is giving people the wrong impression of Scotland . Residents were so upset with the foul-smelling mess they complained to local and national officials and demanded it be cleared at once. Scottish Borders Council apologised to angry residents and blamed English tourists who are visiting Scotland for the Commonwealth Games and other big summer events. The eyesore is one of the first things motorists encounter as they enter Scotland at a border crossing used by about 23 million vehicles a year. Locals say the sight of the bin is an awful advertisement for Scotland as it gives visitors the wrong impression of their country. Scotland is seeing a spike in visitors - and roadside rubbish - thanks to a series of high-profile summer events . Joyce McLean, who resides about eight miles north of the border in Reston, is vowing to forward her photos to First Minister Alex Salmond. The 69-year-old retired office worker for Northumbria Police said: ‘The amount of litter is phenomenal. It's a real problem - but it's people in cars throwing it out. It's very, very difficult to catch them. ‘I have never seen a rural area so bad. It's really time it was highlighted.’ She said two of her dogs have been maimed by broken tins on two separate occasions. She added: ‘It sends out the wrong message during the Commonwealth Games.’ Clean up that mess: Residents of nearby towns complained to local and national officials about the eyesore . Locals also complained about waste that piled up at the lay-by just north of the A1 at Ayton. Eyemouth resident Karen Walker called it ‘absolutely disgusting’. With so many high-profile events taking place, Scotland is seeing an influx of visitors at the border crossing on the A1 and that means more rubbish is being dumped by motorists. Scottish Borders Council is promising to review its refuse collection service at the border. Scottish Conservative Borders MSP John Lamont said he hopes the issue will be resolved immediately. He said: ‘Nobody wants to see litter all over the place when they arrive into Scotland. It's the kind of image that gives Scotland a bad reputation.’

chatgpt: Motorists crossing the border from England to Scotland were left disgusted after they saw rubbish spewing from a bin at a local border crossing last week. Some travelers even snapped photos and shared them on social media, expressing their shock and concern regarding the unsanitary situation. This incident could not have taken place at a worse time for Scotland as they hosted the Commonwealth Games. The eyesores of overflowing bins send out the wrong message to tourists and athletes alike, who have come to expect a clean and healthy environment in which to enjoy the games. Border crossing patrols reported the overflowing bin to the Scottish Border Council, who has since promised to review their refuse collection service, reaffirming the importance of a clean and safe environment across the region.  "Littering poses a significant environmental risk to the area, and we are committed to making sure that our refuse collection services are appropriate for maintaining a clean and tidy environment at border crossings," said a council spokesperson. With the Commonwealth Games in full swing, both locals and visitors alike have expressed concerns about the overflowing bin, which could have potential health hazards. According to experts, neglecting proper waste disposal could lead to environmental pollution, and even attract pests that carry diseases. "The Council must work on raising awareness with local residents and visitors to the area about the proper disposal of waste, specifically the potential health risks associated with littering," said a local environmentalist who wished to remain anonymous. As the number of visitors traveling to the region steadily increase every year, there is a growing expectation that authorities will take more significant measures to maintain a clean and environmentally sound Scotland. To ensure that the health and safety of the public remains a top priority, the Scottish Border Council plans to review its waste disposal policies and increase patrols to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. As border crossings act as a gateway to Scotland for many tourists, it is vital to people's comfort and well-being that the environment remains safe and attractive. It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that waste is disposed of properly so that our beautiful surroundings can continue to be enjoyed for generations to come. In conclusion, the Scottish Border Council's decision to review its waste management system is an encouraging step to making sure that such incidents never repeat themselves. Moving forward, it is essential for everyone to recognize the dangers littering poses to the environment and work together to maintain the cleanliness of the region to prevent further health risks.
