article: A 20-year-old woman has been jailed for six years after she falsely accused a man of rape then led a gang to beat him to death. Latiqwa Mayes was enraged that her victim Donald Robinson had not received a stricter sentence for breaking into her room and assaulting her friend at a boardinghouse. Months later, she saw him walking down the street in Baltimore, Maryland, and yelled: 'He raped me! He's a sex offender!' Jailed: Latiqwa Mayes, 20, (left) cried, 'He raped me!' then ordered a gang to beat Donald Robinson (right) in the street in Baltimore. He died later in hospital. Mayes has been jailed for six years for the attack last year . According to the Baltimore Sun, her father, Willie Mayes, rushed over and a group of teenagers playing basketball nearby joined to hold Robinson down. Surveillance footage of the attack on September 2, 2013, then showed passers-by joining the attack to kick and punch Robinson as Latiqwa Mayes pepper-sprayed him. Robinson stumbled away from the scene but hours later fell ill. He was pronounced dead in hospital and an autopsy stated the beating as the cause of death. Slamming Latiqwa Mayes, who has been in solitary confinement since September 2013, Judge Timothy Doory said Robinson's offense did 'not justify a call to the community to impose physical, violent retribution.' Complicit: Her father Willie Mayes joined the attack. He was jailed for two years for second-degree murder . Joshua Insley, defending, argued Robinson was a dangerous sex offender that should have been off the streets and violated his parole. He said: 'They wanted him to never come back, with good reason.' However, Judge Doory dismissed the claims, insisting they 'went too far'. Latiqwa and Willie Mayes both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. They were each sentenced to 10 years in prison, however Latiqwa will serve six and Willie will serve two, with the other years suspended.

chatgpt: A 20-year-old woman from Philadelphia has been sentenced to six years in prison for attacking and killing a man who she claimed had sexually assaulted her friend. Latiqwa Mayes, who was enraged to see Donald Robinson walking free months after breaking into her boardinghouse and assaulting her friend, saw him on the street and cried out, "He raped me! He's a sex offender!" Mayes's father, a group of teenagers, and several passers-by joined in the attack, kicking and punching Robinson. Mayes pepper-sprayed him throughout the attack. Robinson was taken to a hospital, where he later died due to injuries sustained in the attack. Mayes was initially charged with first-degree murder but later pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Her father, who also took part in the attack, was sentenced to two years in prison. During her sentencing hearing, Mayes expressed remorse for her actions, saying that she had been "desperate to protect" her friend. However, the judge noted that Mayes had gone too far, saying that "vigilante justice is not justice at all." The case has highlighted the dangers of taking the law into one's own hands, particularly when it comes to sexual assault. While Mayes may have believed that she was doing the right thing by attacking Robinson, her actions ultimately led to his death, and she will now spend the next six years of her life behind bars. In a statement, Mayes's lawyer said that his client had learned from her mistakes and was committed to making a positive change in her community. However, others have argued that her actions have set a dangerous precedent and could encourage others to take similar actions. The case is a tragic reminder of the devastating impact that sexual assault can have on victims and their loved ones. While it is important to seek justice for those who have been assaulted, it is crucial that we do so through legal channels, rather than resorting to violence and vigilantism.
