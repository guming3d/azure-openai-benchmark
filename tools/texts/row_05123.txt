Firefighters battle a blaze Wednesday north of Boston after a tanker overturned carrying 9,000 gallons of gas. No serious injuries were reported in the Everett, Massachusetts, blast, but witnesses recounted close calls to a local television station. One man said he narrowly escaped from his car before it exploded. "In consideration of everything that firefighters had to deal with, I think it's a miracle that we haven't seen some serious injuries," Everett Fire Chief David Butler said. The tanker overturned and caught fire at a traffic circle in the town of about 37,000 outside Boston. Officials are investigating whether the driver was speeding, Butler said. "Our major concerns right now are we still have an ongoing fire operation in the family dwellings, and we are still heavily engaged in those operations, and we have some concerns environmentally," Butler said.

Seven hours after the truck caught fire, firefighters were still battling a blaze in one of the homes, according to the television station. Evacuees were taken to an armory converted into a shelter, Red Cross official Amelia Aubourg told CNN. Local streets were closed temporarily, and a nearby school was shut down for the day, WCVB reported. One evacuee who fled a high-rise building told the television station he saw at least 15 cars burning. "And popping, they were popping. I don't know if it was tires that were blowing, but they were completely gone, the cars," Dan Savage told WCVB. Nearby resident Chris Barrow awoke to the sound of a "big bang," he told WCVB. At first, he thought it was a car accident, but when he went outside to investigate the noise, he saw fire "just coming down the hill toward the houses as fast as you could think." Barrow tried to escape in his car, but fire quickly surrounded the vehicle, he told the TV station. "I rode over the fire and my car caught fire," he told WCVB. "I got out just in time, and I ran a couple feet just before it blew up." E-mail to a friend . CNN's Michelle Cumbo and Saundra Booker contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A major accident occurred on Wednesday evening on a busy highway just outside of town. At approximately 6 p.m., a truck carrying hazardous materials crashed, causing a massive fire that engulfed several surrounding automobiles. While no serious injuries have been reported, many are calling it a miracle. "I think it's a miracle that we haven't seen some serious injuries," said the fire chief on scene. The cause of the accident is still under investigation. Officials are closely looking into whether the truck's speed played a role in the accident, causing the driver to lose control and crash. Emergency responders are also monitoring the hazardous materials that were being transported by the truck, ensuring that the fire is fully extinguished before people can safely return to their homes. Multiple evacuees have been transported to a nearby armory, which was converted into a shelter. The Red Cross has organized the shelter, providing refuge for those who have been displaced from their homes. People are being advised to stay away from the area until officials give the all-clear. One man who was involved in the accident spoke to local news station WCVB-TV about his harrowing experience. His car caught fire and then exploded as he fled the scene, but he was able to escape unharmed. "I got out just in time," he said, still visibly shaken from the experience. As emergency crews worked tirelessly to contain the fire and clear debris from the roadway, traffic was backed up for miles in each direction. Drivers were advised to seek alternate routes and stay clear of the area. The local authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant and cautious on the roads, especially during times of inclement weather or other adverse conditions. They are also advising drivers to adhere to all traffic laws and regulations, including speed limits, to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of others on the road. This accident serves as a stark reminder of just how quickly things can go wrong on the roads, and how important it is to always exercise caution and good judgment behind the wheel. Officials will continue to work diligently to investigate the cause of the accident, hoping to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. In the meantime, the community is rallying together, offering support and prayers for those affected by the accident. It is during times like these that we all need to come together and lend a helping hand.
