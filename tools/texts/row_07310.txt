He  promised families the search will resume in the future when the situation is 'more stable' in Ukraine and praised the effort made so far. The Ukrainian government announced afterwards that it was suspending the ceasefire with separatist rebels at the site of the Malaysian airliner crash. Several bodies were left lying among the wreckage for nine days after the disaster last month. Local villagers were among some of the people seen rifling through the wreckage, which stretches across kilometres of farming villages. Mr Rutte said the international recovery team has learned that the recovery effort undertaken by local authorities immediately after the crash was more thorough than initially thought. The international team of Dutch, Australian and Malaysian recovery workers was unable to reach the site until July 31 because of fighting in the area between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatist rebels. A separate investigation into the cause of the crash is continuing, Rutte said. A spokesman for the Dutch Safety Board, which is overseeing that investigation, yesterday said preliminary findings due on August 17 won't be ready until several weeks after that date.

chatgpt: The forensic team in the Netherlands has formally identified 23 victims of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which crashed in Ukraine in July 2014. Among them are 18 Dutch, two Malaysians, a Canadian, a German, and a Briton.  According to Justice Ministry spokesman, Jean Fransman, the families of the victims have been informed about the identification process. The forensic team used DNA samples from the victimsâ€™ remains, which had been recovered after the crash, to identify them. The identification process had been a difficult one, with the team having to rely on various techniques, including dental records and fingerprints, in addition to DNA testing. The team also had to symbolically identify some of the victims, as their remains had not been recovered.  The MH17 crash occurred in July 2014, when the Boeing 777 was shot down over eastern Ukraine while on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The plane was carrying 298 people, most of whom were citizens of the Netherlands. The Dutch-led investigation into the crash concluded that the plane had been shot down by a Russian missile fired from rebel-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. The Russian government has denied involvement in the incident. The investigation also found that the missile had been transported from Russia to Ukraine and was fired from a launcher that was later returned to Russia. The rebels, who had been waging a war against the Ukrainian government, were accused of shooting down the plane, but they denied any involvement. The identification of the victims is seen as a significant step in bringing closure to their families. The crash had deeply affected the Netherlands, with several of the victims being well-known figures.  The Dutch government had been heavily involved in the investigation into the incident, which had been hampered by the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The investigation had led to several arrests, including that of four suspects, who were charged with murder, in June 2019. However, the suspects, who are believed to be members of the Russian military or intelligence services, are unlikely to face trial, as Russia has refused to extradite them. The Netherlands is now expected to take the case to the International Court of Justice. The identification of the victims is also significant in terms of providing closure to the families, some of whom had been waiting for over six years for news about their loved ones. The Dutch government has pledged to continue its efforts to bring those responsible for the crash to justice.
