article: (CNN) -- A late strike from Samir Nasri, set up by the returning Carlos Tevez, helped Manchester City maintain their quest for a first English league title in 44 years with a 2-1 win over Chelsea on Wednesday. The France international collected a clever reverse pass from Tevez, making his first appearance in five months after falling out with manager Roberto Mancini, to score an 86th-minute winner. City had trailed to Gary Cahill's deflected strike until Sergio Aguero leveled the match from the penalty spot with 12 minutes remaining. The victory maintains City's 100% record in home league matches this season and draws them within a point of Premier League leaders and bitter rivals Manchester United. The buildup to the match was dominated by the return of Tevez, who hadn't featured for City since refusing to warm up during a Champions League clash with Bayern Munich back in September. He took his place on the bench to a mixture of boos and applause, and he was called upon in the 66th minute after Cahill had pounced on a loose ball in the area to fire a shot into the net via an inadvertent flick from Yaya Toure. But when Pablo Zabaleta's shot hit the arm of Chelsea substitute Michael Essien, City were handed a lifeline and Argentina striker Aguero slotted home the spot kick. Then Tevez played a cute one-two with Nasri, and the midfielder dinked the ball over Chelsea keeper Petr Cech to secure a vital win. On a dramatic night in England's top flight, Tottenham surrendered third place to Arsenal after being held 1-1 at home by Stoke. Taking to the field for the first time since Saturday's FA Cup quarterfinal clash with Bolton was abandoned due to Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest, Tottenham's poor form continued. The London side had to rely on an injury-time goal from Netherlands international Rafael Van der Vaart to salvage a draw after striker Cameron Jerome had put City in front. Arsenal leapfrogged their north London rivals with a 1-0 win at Everton, as defender Thomas Vermaelen's eighth-minute goal put the Gunners a point clear. Chelsea stayed fifth, losing ground on both Tottenham and Arsenal in the race to finish in the fourth and final European Champions League qualification spot. Liverpool's hopes of finishing fourth are all but over after squandering a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 to relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers. Uruguay international Sebastian Coates put Liverpool ahead with a superb volley early on before Dirk Kuyt made it 2-0 on 72 minutes. But Rangers hit back with three goals in the last 14 minutes, from Shaun Derry, former Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie. The result kept Liverpool seven points behind Chelsea, while QPR moved out of the relegation zone, moving one point clear of Bolton.

chatgpt: Manchester City secured a crucial 2-1 victory over Chelsea in a dramatic Premier League clash on Sunday, with a late goal from Samir Nasri sealing the win. The game had been locked at 1-1 for much of the second half, with both sides creating numerous opportunities to take the lead. City had started brightly, with Sergio Aguero's goal giving them an early lead. However, Chelsea responded strongly and equalized through the in-form Raul Meireles, who scored a superb long-range effort. The game remained finely poised throughout the second half, with both teams trading attacks. But it was City who finally found the breakthrough in the dying minutes, with Carlos Tevez setting up Nasri for the winner. The victory moves City to within one point of league leaders Manchester United, who had beaten Norwich City earlier in the day. Elsewhere in the Premier League, Arsenal secured a valuable 1-0 win over Everton to move into third place. The Gunners had dominated for much of the game but had to wait until the 77th minute to break the deadlock, with Santi Cazorla scoring the decisive goal. Tottenham Hotspur and Stoke City shared the spoils in a hard-fought 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane. Clint Dempsey gave Spurs the lead midway through the second half, but Stoke responded quickly through Peter Crouch to earn a point. In a dramatic encounter at Loftus Road, Liverpool squandered a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 to Queens Park Rangers. The Reds had looked in control after goals from young stars Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho, but QPR fought back strongly and secured the win with a late goal from Jamie Mackie. The result is a major boost for QPR, who are fighting to avoid relegation, while it leaves Liverpool's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League in doubt. The Premier League table is now finely poised, with Manchester United holding a slender lead over Manchester City at the top. Arsenal are in third place, just two points behind City, with Tottenham a further two points back in fourth. Chelsea remain in fifth place, six points behind Arsenal, while Liverpool's defeat at QPR leaves them seven points off the top four. With just four games left to play, the race for Champions League qualification is set to go down to the wire. Can Arsenal hold on to third place? Will Tottenham or Chelsea make a late surge? And can Manchester City overhaul Manchester United at the top? The final few weeks of the season promise to be full of drama and excitement.
