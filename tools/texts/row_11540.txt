article: (CNN) -- It's hard to believe it's been five years since Mumbai was rocked by terror attacks. Life goes on, the city continues its chaotic beat. The next news story replaces the last one, the cycle of life goes on. The date 26/11 is now a somber anniversary the city marks. But for many, it's something much more personal. The newspapers here today are full of pictures of smiling couples and entire families who lost their lives during the attacks. They accompany messages of remembrance in ads placed their by surviving family members who miss them and grieve for them. Ten Pakistani men associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed buildings and killed 164 people. Nine of the gunmen were killed during the attacks, one survived. Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman, was executed in India last year . One of the pictures I saw in a newspaper today that froze me was of a broken blue wall inside Chabad House, the building where Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka were killed. Their baby son, Moshe survived. My colleague, Sanjiv Talreja and I were the first journalists allowed inside Chabad House a few weeks after the carnage. It was the hardest assignment I have ever had. The place hadn't been cleaned. Walls and windows were blown out, only half of the floors and ceilings remained. Blood stains splashed across the wall, grenade shells and bullets littered the crumbling floor. One thing that stopped me in my tracks though was a broken blue wall. It was in the room that baby Moshe occupied. His mother Rivka had marked his height on the wall, with the enthusiasm of any young mother watching her baby grow. Several little pencil lines marked every inch or two this young boy grew. I remember standing by this blue wall in 2008, overcome with emotion, unable to get the cries of Moshe wailing for his mother out of my head. I had seen and heard him at a service at a synagogue a few days earlier. Moshe was saved by his Indian nanny, Sandra Samuel, who carried the boy through the gunfire and smoke to safety. Nanny credited with tot's daring rescue . Moshe is with his grandparents and his nanny in Israel. I think of this young boy often and I think of the families who lost loved ones during the attacks. My thoughts are with those who suffered bullet wounds, burns, trauma and injuries during the siege. Nanny who saved Israeli boy during Mumbai attack honored in Israel . Mumbai continues to throb. But every year, on 26/11, the city slows down a touch -- in remembrance and in solidarity. Mumbai attack survivor: 'It's like a dead man living'

chatgpt: It has been five years since a group of terrorists stormed the city of Mumbai, leaving 164 people dead and over 300 injured. The attack, carried out by 10 Pakistani men with ties to the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, was one of the deadliest the city had ever seen. As the anniversary of the attack approached, journalist Vikram Kapur reflected on his experience covering the aftermath. "It was the hardest assignment I have ever had," he said. "The sheer scale of the tragedy was overwhelming, and the images of the victims and their families will stay with me forever." Kapur, who was working for the Times of India at the time, was one of many journalists who covered the attack as it unfolded. He recalled the chaos and confusion of those first few hours, as reports of gunshots and explosions began to filter in from various parts of the city. "We knew something was happening, but we didn't know the full extent of it until later," he said. "It wasn't until we started getting reports of terrorists taking hostages and planting bombs that we realized just how serious the situation was." Over the course of three days, the terrorists carried out a series of coordinated attacks on several prominent locations in the city, including a railway station, a popular tourist spot, and two luxury hotels. The attacks were widely condemned by leaders around the world, who expressed their solidarity with India and pledged to help bring the perpetrators to justice. In the years since the attack, there have been numerous investigations, trials, and diplomatic efforts aimed at holding those responsible accountable. While some of the attackers were killed during the siege, others were captured and later executed or sentenced to life in prison. Despite the best efforts of law enforcement and the international community, however, many questions still remain unresolved. Some have criticized the slow pace of the investigations and the perception that justice has yet to be fully served. For Kapur, who has covered his fair share of tragedies and conflicts over the years, the Mumbai attacks remain a sobering reminder of the fragility of peace and security in the world. "It's easy to forget just how quickly things can spiral out of control," he said. "We have to stay vigilant and do everything we can to prevent something like this from happening again."
