The state of Maryland are keen to rid the Pomtomac of the fish because it is a voracious top-level predator, meaning that it has no natural enemies, and could decimate populations of native fish. About 90 per cent of it's diet consists of other fish and it is even known to swallow sea bass whole.

He told how you shouldn't touch the fish while it was still alive because its fangs would 'tear your thumb off' and how he thought the fish's pattern looked like a 'diamond-back rattlesnake'. It's been eight years since a snakehead fish was discovered in the Potomac. But biologists would rather see them gone and the state have offered to give the angler with the biggest catch a $200 gift certificate. 'Slippery and aggressive': At 18lbs the it needs strength and dedication to reel a snakehead in . Fangs: Luckily this snakehead is dead but you wouldn't want to have your fingers so close to a live one .

chatgpt: A 19-inch long snakehead fish weighing 19.9 pounds has been caught in the Potomac River in Maryland, USA. This catch breaks the previous world record held by a snakehead fish caught in Japan, which weighed 18.7 pounds. The snakehead fish was caught by a tournament angler, Caleb Newton, as he fished in the river. Snakehead fish are not native to the Potomac River and have become a nuisance in the US because of their indiscriminate feeding habits. They are known to eat almost anything they can catch, which includes crayfish, frogs, fish, and even small birds and mammals. This behavior has led to them being labeled as invasive species, and they pose a threat to the native fish population. The snakehead fish is native to Asia and was first introduced into the US in the early 2000s. They were first discovered in the Potomac River in 2004, and since then, their population has exploded. This invasive species is found in other parts of America, including California, Florida, and Virginia. The snakeskin fish is characterized by its sharp teeth and elongated body, which make it an excellent swimmer. It can also breathe air and has the ability to move across land, which enables it to travel between different bodies of water. Following Newton's catch, there has been concern that the snakehead fish's population could continue to surge, leading to further damage to ecosystems in the area. Efforts continue to be made to control and manage the snakehead fish population. One of the methods used to control them is to encourage people to fish for them. Snakehead fish is a delicacy in Asia, and it is believed that creating a market for the fish in the US will encourage more people to hunt for them. However, experts warn that there is still much work to be done to manage the snakehead fish population. They urge anglers to take any snakehead fish they catch and report their catch to the relevant authorities. In summary, Caleb Newton's catch of a 19.9-pound snakehead fish in the Potomac River in Maryland has broken the previous world record held by a snakehead fish caught in Japan. Snakehead fish are invasive species in the US, and they are known to eat almost anything, which has led to concern about their impact on the ecosystem. Efforts to control their population continue, and anglers are encouraged to help in managing the population.
