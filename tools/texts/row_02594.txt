article: Laurent Koscielny is hoping his name doesn't appear in the Guinness Book of Records anytime soon. It was revealed earlier this week that the Arsenal defender has conceded the most amount of penalties in the Premier League since August 2010. The Gunners centre half took his tally to seven in four seasons when he hacked down Eden Hazard last weekend during the 2-0 defeat by title rivals Chelsea.

Hazard converted the spot kick in the 27th minute to give Jose Mourinho's men the lead before Diego Costa sealed victory 12 minutes from time. Amazingly, Arsenal team-mate Wojciech Szczesny is just one place below Koscielny on the list of shame. And the defender, who is away on international duty with France ahead of their friendlies against Portugal (October 11) and Armenia (October 14), admits it is an area in which he must improve. 'I don’t know if Guinness have a record for that,' said Koscielny. 'Unfortunately, we do not choose. It’s something I have to resolve earlier in the play. 'When Eden comes very quickly, he either scores or I clear the ball. It was toss of a coin. 'I do not pass judgment on what you think of my games or my mistakes. The most important thing is to be good for Arsenal.'

chatgpt: Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny has admitted to conceding seven league penalties since August 2010, topping the tally for the Premier League in that period. Second on the list is his former teammate, Gunners keeper Wojciech Szczesny with six penalties.  Koscielny's latest penalty concession came during Arsenal's recent 2-0 defeat to Chelsea on Sunday when he tackled Eden Hazard in the penalty area. The Frenchman's tendency to give away penalties has been a cause of concern for Arsenal and their fans. Koscielny's total of seven penalties conceded since 2010 is the highest among active Premier League players, and he leads the list by a good margin. Sebastien Bassong, currently playing for Norwich City, sits at the fourth position having conceded four penalties during the same period. The ex-Liverpool center-back Martin Skrtel is third with five, while Stoke City's Ryan Shawcross is fifth with four penalties.  It is worth noting that Koscielny has been a crucial player for Arsenal in the last decade, making over 350 appearances for the club since joining from French side Lorient in 2010. However, his tendency to concede penalties is an issue that the Gunners' manager, Mikel Arteta, will need to address.  Despite Koscielny's penalty troubles, it is important to remember that he is still a vital player for Arsenal. He is known for his aerial ability, tackling skills and reading of the game, making him one of the best defenders in the Premier League. If he can cut down on the penalties, he can be a huge asset to the team. As for Szczesny, his penalty trouble happened during his stint at Arsenal, and he has since moved on to Juventus. Nevertheless, both players' struggles with conceding penalties highlights the importance of discipline in defense. The Premier League's top defenders must find a balance between being aggressive and avoiding fouls that give their opponents the edge they need to score. In conclusion, Laurent Koscielny's feat of conceding the highest number of penalties in the Premier League since August 2010 is not an achievement to be proud of for the Arsenal defender. However, he remains an important player for the Gunners, and if he can reduce his tendency to give away penalties, he can continue to contribute to the team's success.
