chatgpt: The summer months can be a time of happiness and celebration for many, but for some girls in the United Kingdom, it is a time of great risk. According to the government, hundreds of girls are at risk of being forced into marriages during the summer, a practice that has been illegal in the UK since 2014. However, despite this, women's rights groups say that forced marriages continue to be a significant problem in the country. One group that is working hard to help those at risk is Karma Nirvana, a campaign group that focuses on ending forced marriages and honour-based abuse. Among their many tactics, the group often advises girls to employ a unique strategy: use their last chance to be separated from their families, and tell someone what is happening. For many girls in the UK, their families are often the ones who may force them to marry, leaving them feeling trapped and unable to speak out. By using their last chance to be separated and telling someone what is happening, these girls can potentially find help and start their journey out of a potentially harmful situation. With reports indicating that the number of forced marriage cases rises during the summer, it is crucial that girls understand the tools and resources available to them. While Karma Nirvana is just one group working to end forced marriages and honour-based abuse, their work highlights the very real risks that some girls face. According to Jasvinder Sanghera, the founder of Karma Nirvana, the group often receives calls and messages from girls who are struggling with the possibility of forced marriage. Through their work, the group has found that many girls who are at risk often do not know what help is available to them, leaving them feeling isolated and alone. To help combat this, Karma Nirvana has been working with schools, hospitals, and other organisations to raise awareness of the issue and provide information and support to those who need it. The group has also been working to build relationships with law enforcement agencies to ensure that the necessary steps are being taken to protect those at risk. While progress is being made, the reality is that more needs to be done to address the issue of forced marriages in the UK. The government has pledged to tackle the issue, but more needs to be done to ensure that girls at risk are aware of the resources available to them, and that there are consequences for those who engage in this harmful practice. For those who are struggling with the possibility of forced marriage, there are resources available. Karma Nirvana provides a helpline and online support, and the government has launched a forced marriage unit to help those at risk. By raising awareness and providing support to those who need it, we can work towards ending forced marriages in the UK and creating a safer future for all.
