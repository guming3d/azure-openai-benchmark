article: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tensions rippled through Pakistan's tribal region Saturday as three drone strikes killed 18 people and the government continued to block a NATO supply route into Afghanistan. Pakistani intelligence officials said 10 people died in one drone strike targeting a militant hideout, four people died when a vehicle was struck, and four others were killed when another hideout was targeted. All three occurred in the Data Khel area of North Waziristan. The intelligence officials did not want to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. While the United States is the only country in the region of Pakistan and Afghanistan known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- U.S. officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes. Saturday's attacks come amid an uptick in drone strikes in Pakistan as insurgents fighting in Afghanistan have taken refuge across the border. At Torkham, the main border crossing in Pakistan's Khyber district, queues of trucks and tankers formed at the border crossing, officials said. The supplies are all-important for the NATO-led war effort in Afghanistan. Pakistan halted the convoys Thursday after officials blamed cross-border NATO helicopter fire for the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers. A senior Pakistani government official in Khyber told CNN on Saturday that NATO supplies are still not allowed to enter in Afghanistan and doesn't know when the main route for supplying 152,000 U.S. and NATO forces will open again. "We were asked by our seniors to block these supplies until further orders and we can't allow it to go until we receive orders from our seniors," the official said. A senior security official in the northwestern city of Peshawar also confirmed that convoys were suspended for third day but said negotiations to solve the problem continued. NATO said aircraft had entered Pakistani airspace Thursday in self-defense and killed "several armed individuals" after the crews believed they had been fired at from the ground. It was the fourth such strike this week by NATO helicopters pursuing militants into Pakistani territory in actions that have been condemned by the government. The Pakistani government said it was investigating Thursday's incident in the Kurram district of the northwestern tribal belt, which Washington has branded as a militant hub.

chatgpt: Pakistan has once again blocked a crucial border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The border closure comes amidst rising tensions between the two countries and increasing drone strikes in the tribal regions of Pakistan. The border crossing is a vital lifeline for goods and people moving between the two neighbouring countries. This is not the first time that Pakistan has blocked the border crossing. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been simmering for some time, with both countries accusing each other of harbouring militants and allowing them to launch cross-border attacks. Pakistan has long accused Afghanistan of being porous and not doing enough to stop militants from entering Pakistan. The recent border blockage will undoubtedly exacerbate the already tense relationship between the two countries. It is a serious blow to the Afghan economy, which relies heavily on trade with Pakistan. Thousands of trucks are now stuck on either side of the closed border, causing significant financial losses for Afghan traders and farmers. The closure of the border comes amid an increase in drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region. The United States has been carrying out drone strikes in Pakistan since 2004, targeting militants hiding in the area. However, the number of strikes has increased significantly in recent years, causing discomfort in Pakistan, which sees it as a violation of its sovereignty. The recent drone strikes have reportedly killed several high-profile militants, including the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. However, there is increasing concern that the strikes may also be killing innocent civilians. This has led to continued protest from Pakistan, who views the strikes as a violation of its sovereignty. The increase in drone strikes has also led to a surge in anti-American sentiment in Pakistan. Critics of the strikes question why the US continues to carry them out when there is little evidence that they are making the region any safer. Some argue that the strikes are doing more harm than good by fueling extremism and anti-American sentiment. In conclusion, the closure of the important border crossing and the increase in drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region is contributing to the already tense relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is vital that both countries work towards finding a common ground to address their differences as tensions are likely to escalate further unless the situation is resolved.
