One website claimed Mr Hollande, 58, had confessed that Ms Gayet was his mistress during a dinner with friends at the Elysee Palace. Rumours: Julie Gayet, pictured right in at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009, and President Hollande, left . Gayet has filed a complaint against person unknown, after a rumour spread on the internet claimed she was French President Francois Hollande's mistress . The couple were said to have begun the affair after she appeared alongside him during his presidential election campaign last May, it was reported. In one campaign video, she described Hollande as 'marvellous', 'humble' and 'a really good listener'. The French media reported that a friend at one of Mr Hollande's dinner parties told one blogger: 'Julie and Francois met during his election campaign, but sadly they can't see much of each other as Valerie Trierweiler is very jealous.' Ms Gayet - a married mother-of-two who has starred in more than 50 French films - launched her legal action on March 18, her lawyer Vincent Toledano told France's AFP news agency today. He said: 'The actress Julie Gayet has instructed my chambers to take legal action over the rumour, widely disseminated on the Internet, suggesting, with no foundation, that she has a romantic relationship with the president of the republic. 'She expects her right to a private family life to be respected as there is nothing to justify these claims.'

Mr Hollande began his relationship with girlfriend Ms Trierweiler five years ago after separating from the mother of his four children Segolene Royal. The French First Lady, 47, is also fighting her own legal action over a book claiming she cheated on her former husband with two lovers at once. The biography called The Troublemaker claims she was the shared mistress of Mr Hollande and former conservative minster Patrick Devidjian, now 68, while she was still married to Denis Trierweiler nine years ago. Both men knew they were 'sharing' Ms Trierweiler, but when Mr Devidjian refused her demands to leave his wife, she chose her affair with Mr Hollande over him, before finally divorcing her husband in 2010, the book says. Ms Trierweiler is demanding Â£35,000 in damages for invasion of privacy from the authors Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet, both TV journalists.

chatgpt: The French media has once again been hit by a scandal involving a high-profile politician and a potential extra-marital affair. This time, the rumours are surrounding former French President Francois Hollande and his alleged mistress, actress Julie Gayet. According to reports, the rumours about the affair first surfaced on multiple French websites. One site in particular, claimed that former President Hollande had admitted to having an affair with Ms Gayet. The rumours have since captured the attention of the public, with many people questioning the validity of the allegations. Ms Gayet, a French actress, first made headlines in 2014 when it was revealed that she was allegedly involved in a romantic relationship with former President Hollande. The alleged affair was reported to have begun in 2012, while Mr Hollande was still in a relationship with his then-girlfriend and current partner, Valerie Trierweiler. Since the rumours were first reported online, Ms Gayet has remained mostly silent about the allegations. However, her lawyers have come forward to deny the reports, stating that they are completely false and without merit. Despite the denials from Ms Gayet's lawyers, the rumours have continued to spread throughout social media, with many people expressing their opinions on the matter. Some have criticized Mr. Hollande for his alleged relationship, while others have defended him, arguing that his personal life should remain private. While the rumours about the alleged affair continue to circulate, the attention has turned to Ms Gayet's role in Mr Hollande's presidential campaign in 2012. At the time, Ms. Gayet was reportedly seen beside Mr. Hollande on the campaign trail, leading many to question whether her involvement with the campaign was a factor in their alleged relationship. However, supporters of Mr Hollande have argued that the allegations are nothing more than an attempt to tarnish his image and reputation. They claim that the rumours are baseless and that Mr Hollande is innocent of any wrongdoing. For now, the speculation surrounding Mr Hollande and Ms Gayet's alleged relationship will continue to dominate headlines. While there is no concrete evidence to support the allegations, the rumours refuse to die down, leaving many to wonder whether there is any truth to the reports.
