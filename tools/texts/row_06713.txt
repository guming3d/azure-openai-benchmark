article: Finland's largest airport will be the first in the world to track passengers' movements in real-time - from the car park to the departure gate. Dozens of sensors throughout Helsinki Airport will automatically pinpoint the location of mobile phones with wifi setting turned onÂ  - as part of a plan that is drawing criticism from privacy advocates. The system, which aims to monitor crowds and eliminate bottlenecks at security checkpoints or shopping areas, will send alerts to passengers if their departure times or gates change. Passengers at Helsinki Airport will soon be monitored by mobile phone if they leave their WiFi turned on . The international airport, which is operated by state-owned Finavia and accommodates 15 million fliers a year, estimates 60 to 70 per cent of all visitors will leave their wifi turned on once the system is up and running by the end of the year. Finavia and Walkbase, a Finnish company that developed the technology, insist the system is secure and doesn't store or reveal any personal data belonging to the user or owner of the mobile device. Tuomas Wuoti, CEO and co-founder of Walkbase, told Bloomberg passengers' details will not be put at risk. However, privacy watchdogs are not entirely convinced. Antti Tikkanen, director of security response at software maker F-Secure, told Bloomberg: 'The fact that my movements are tracked is a scarier thought than someone knowing which websites I visit.' Airport officials insist the system does not store or reveal the personal information of mobile phone users . He added: 'I have a hard time believing location tracking is only left at statistics when the same technology makes so many other things possible.' Finavia says its system has clear benefits for travellers and will transform Helsinki Airport into a technologically-advanced 'smart airport' thanks to the ability to manage crowds. The system . uses nearly 300 small devices, including iBeacons and wifi routers, . which will discreetly monitor smartphone signals either passively or . with an app-based opt-in. About 150 white boxes will collect the unique identifier number, or MAC address, from devices searching for wifi networks. Retailers inside the airport can use the technology to notify travellers about special offers in their shops . The boxes are designed to scramble the information and forward it to servers. In addition to detecting crowding and congestion, the technology can be used by the airport's retailers to market their products to visitors. Customers can opt in to receive messages with special offers from 35 shops and 32 restaurants and cafes.

chatgpt: Devices scattered throughout Helsinki Airport are detecting smartphone WiFi signals to monitor crowds and eliminate congestion at checkpoints. The airport officials have stated that the system does not store or reveal personal data, but it will help them to better understand the flow of passengers and ensure that they are properly directed through the airport's security process. The tracking system has been introduced to alleviate long waiting times and improve the overall experience for travelers. By scanning the WiFi signals, the system can determine how long passengers are waiting in security lines and identify which areas of the airport are busiest. The gathered data will then enable airport officials to better manage the crowds and make necessary adjustments to mitigate congestion and delays. However, some passengers are concerned about the privacy implications of this new tracking system. They worry that their personal data might be at risk if it is tracked and stored by the airport system. The airport authorities have acknowledged these concerns and reaffirmed their commitment to protecting passengers' privacy. They have stated that the system only collects data on the volume of WiFi signals and does not identify any specific devices or individuals. The officials have emphasized that none of the data collected will be shared or sold to third parties, ensuring that passengers' personal information remains confidential. Furthermore, they have stated that passengers can opt-out of the tracking system by disabling the WiFi on their devices while moving through the airport. Despite these assurances, some privacy advocates remain skeptical. They argue that any type of data collection can be used to track and monitor individuals, and that such practices should be subject to strict regulation and oversight. However, supporters of the system argue that it will ultimately lead to a more efficient and streamlined airport experience for all travelers. Airport officials have pressed on the point that the tracking system is strictly intended to improve airport security and ease congestion. The Helsinki Airport has experienced steady growth in recent years and, as a result, has consistently had to deal with increasing amounts of traffic. The new tracking system will be a significant step towards making the airport's operations more efficient and effective. In conclusion, Helsinki Airport's innovative tracking system is aimed at improving the airport experience for travelers. Although some concerns have been raised about privacy implications, the airport officials have reassured passengers that their personal data will remain confidential. The Helsinki Airport is setting an example for other airports to follow, delivering a new level of service that is both accessible and efficient.
