article: (CNN) -- World No.1 Novak Djokovic ended up on the losing side in the Hopman Cup final Saturday just 24 hours after it was announced that the ATP 250 tournament he owned back in his native Serbia had folded. Djokovic and former World No.1 Ana Ivanovic were beaten in the deciding mixed doubles 6-4 7-5 by Fernando Verdasco and Anna Medina Garrigues as Spain won the final 2-1 to claim the trophy at the mixed team event in Perth. Djokovic beat Verdasco in the opening rubber 6-3 7-5 but Ivanovic suffered a surprise 6-4 6-7 6-2 defeat to veteran baseliner Garrigues in their singles tussle as Spain drew level. Djokovic's family has run the Serbia Open tournament, which was scheduled to take place from April 29 to May 5 in Belgrade, since 2009. Staged on an outdoor clay court, it acted as a warm-up event for the French Open and was the first ATP tournament to be held in the country.. He had won the title twice, most recently in 2011, while Italy's Andreas Seppi claimed the crown in 2012 in what has turned out to be its last staging. Djokovic had opted not to play in his own event, dramatically reducing its appeal. A statement by Djokovic's Family Sport company, the tournament organizers, was posted on the official ATP Tour website to confirm the decision, but without giving any reasons. "We have made the most rational decision considering the circumstances. We are grateful for everyone's contribution and help in running this event that brought a lot of international stars and attention to Serbia," it read. "Unfortunately, we will not be able to run the Belgrade tournament and we have decided to cease the tournament's operations from 2013." Djokovic has suffered mixed fortunes since arriving in Australia for the defense of the title at the opening grand slam of the season later this month. Jetlagged on his arrival from Abu Dhabi, he suffered a scare when a crowd barrier collapsed on him during his opening match, a straight sets win over Seppi. He was also beaten by Bernard Tomic in his singles rubber in the match against hosts Australia, but against Verdasco in the final he showed the form which has kept him at the top of the world rankings for the past two seasons. He then had to watch Ivanovic lose a two-hour 38 minute tussle with Garrigues before they were second best in the doubles. Last year, the Serbian duo reached the final, but an abdominal injury to Ivanovic ended their chances. "We were unfortunate last time, this time we were beaten by a better team," Djokovic said after their defeat.

chatgpt: The world's best tennis player Novak Djokovic and his partner Ana Ivanovic failed to win the Hopman Cup title as their team Serbia were defeated by Spain in the final match. The Spanish team of Fernando Verdasco and Anabel Medina Garrigues clinched the title with a hard-fought victory in the deciding mixed doubles. Despite Novak Djokovic's victory in his singles match against Fernando Verdasco, his team was unable to secure the title as Ivanovic was outplayed by Garrigues in her singles match. The deciding mixed doubles was evenly contested but Verdasco and Garrigues proved to be the better pair in the end, winning the final set 7-5 and clinching the Hopman Cup title. The defeat is a disappointment for Djokovic and Ivanovic, who were hoping to start the year on a high note. Djokovic, who is ranked World No.1 in men's singles, had been looking forward to defending his title in the Hopman Cup, which is a popular mixed-gender team tennis tournament that takes place annually in Perth, Australia. This loss comes on the heels of another setback for Djokovic, as news emerged that a tournament he owns in Serbia has been axed from the 2013 ATP schedule. The Serbia Open, which has been held in Belgrade since 2009, will not take place this year due to financial difficulties. The cancellation of the Serbia Open is seen as a significant blow to Djokovic's efforts to promote tennis in his home country. Djokovic has been actively involved in the tournament, both as a player and as an organizer, and has worked hard to raise the profile of tennis in Serbia. The cancellation of the tournament will leave a significant gap in the tennis calendar and make it more difficult for aspiring Serbian players to gain experience and exposure on the international stage. Despite the setback, Djokovic remains one of the top players in the world and will be looking to bounce back from his defeat in the Hopman Cup. With the Australian Open just around the corner, Djokovic will be hoping to get his season back on track and defend his title at the first Grand Slam of the year. However, he will face stiff competition from the likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Andy Murray, all of whom are expected to provide a tough challenge for Djokovic. In conclusion, Novak Djokovic's Serbia has been beaten by Spain in the Hopman Cup final, despite Djokovic's personal victory in his singles match. Meanwhile, the cancellation of the Serbia Open has dealt a significant blow to Djokovic's efforts to promote tennis in his home country. Despite these setbacks, Djokovic remains one of the best players in the world and will be looking to bounce back in the upcoming Australian Open.
