article: (CNN) -- The Obama administration is asking a special federal court to allow its secret storage of telephone records to be extended beyond the current five-year limit. In a legal brief filed with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that was revealed Wednesday, the Justice Department said several civil lawsuits over the government's so-called metadata collection program require it to preserve those records. "When litigation is pending against a party (or reasonably anticipated), that party has a duty to preserve -- that is to identify, locate and maintain -- relevant information that may be evidence in the case," said federal officials, noting that evidence would likely be used at a trial, which may not be held for months, even years. Current surveillance court orders require the National Security Agency or telecommunication companies that gathered the phone records to destroy the material within five years. The court is likely to grant the request, but may seek assurances the agency would not access the material for intelligence-gathering purposes, absent a warrant. NSA leaker Edward Snowden last June revealed a secret surveillance court order approving government collection of mass amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. It includes phone numbers called and their location. The exact percentage of metadata being collected has not been revealed publicly. Monitoring of actual conversations requires a separate warrant. President Barack Obama last month cited privacy concerns when announcing that such data should no longer be held by the government, but instead be turned over to the domestic telecoms or a private third party. NSA would still have access to the calls to track potential terror connections. He ordered the intelligence community to formulate such a plan by March 28. The mission of the FISA court, named after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that created it, is to decide whether to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring for "foreign intelligence purposes" of suspected terrorists and spies operating in the United States. The once-secret approval of collecting bits and pieces of information from electronic communications comes quarterly from judges at the court. To collect the information, the government has to demonstrate to a judge that it is "relevant" to an international terrorism investigation. There were 1,856 applications in 2012 to the FISA Court for electronic surveillance and physical searches for "foreign intelligence purposes," the Justice Department said. The current case is In re: Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things (BR 14-01).

chatgpt: The Obama administration is seeking to extend the five-year limit on the storage of phone records under the USA Freedom Act. The request was made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in response to ongoing litigation that requires the preservation of such records beyond the current five-year time limit. According to documents filed by the Justice Department, the government is seeking an extension of the storage limit to ensure that the phone records related to ongoing litigation are preserved. The documents further state that the litigation "necessitates that the Government have ongoing access to the historical metadata to meet its discovery obligations and other needs." The request comes in the wake of revelations made by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Snowden's leaks publicized the sweeping surveillance of phone data by the U.S. government, sparking widespread controversy and debate over privacy and surveillance. Under the USA Freedom Act, the government is required to obtain court orders before collecting phone records from telecommunications companies. The data collected includes phone numbers, call duration, and other identifying information, but not the contents of the calls themselves. The law also imposes a five-year limit on the storage of such records, after which the data is required to be purged. The government's request for an extension of this limit marks a departure from previous efforts to curtail government surveillance in the wake of Snowden's leaks. The government's request has raised concerns among privacy advocates, who fear that the extension could lead to further abuses of government power. The American Civil Liberties Union has called the move a "disturbing development" and criticized the government for seeking to extend its surveillance powers at a time when public trust in government is already low. However, the Justice Department has defended the move, stating that the preservation of phone records is necessary to ensure ongoing litigation and lawful intelligence activities. The department has also emphasized that the extension is limited in scope and does not represent a broader expansion of government surveillance powers. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is expected to review the government's request in the coming weeks. The outcome of this review will have significant implications for the scope and limits of government surveillance in the United States.
