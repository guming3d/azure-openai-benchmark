article: (CNN) -- Four-time NFL MVP Peyton Manning is expected to announce today that he will be leaving the Indianapolis Colts, the only team he has played for in his 14-year career. Manning and Colts owner Jim Irsay are scheduled to appear at a noon ET press conference in Indianapolis to make the announcement. The two flew into Indy from South Florida together on Tuesday night, according to media reports. "We'll see ya'll tomorrow. We're gonna talk tomorrow," Irsay told reporters after arriving in Indianapolis, ESPN.com reported. "We're going to do this the right way. We'll talk to you guys tomorrow," Manning said, according to CNN affiliate WISH-TV. Wednesday morning, Irsay tweeted, "It was a long, emotional flight ... now the sun is trying to rise." The Colts will release Manning rather than pay him a $28 million bonus he is due on Thursday if he remains on the Indianapolis roster. Manning was the No. 1 pick in the 1998 NFL draft by the Colts. He became their starting quarterback that year and led them to 11 playoff berths, two conference championships and one Super Bowl victory. But Manning sustained a neck injury during the 2010 season and was forced to sit out the entire 2011 season after having surgery to fuse vertebrae in his neck. The Colts plummeted to a 2-14 record without Manning, which gained them the first pick in April's NFL draft. They are expected to take Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck or Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III with that pick. Both are considered franchise quarterbacks, like Manning was when the Colts took him No. 1 in 1998. Although he's expected to leave the only pro team he has played for, Manning's career is far from done. His doctors have cleared him to play and he's been working out at Duke University. He'll become a free agent and is expected to be sought after by several teams. Among the favorites to land the 35-year-old QB are the Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, Arizona Cardinals and Tennessee Titans. ESPN reports that Manning is expected to work out for select teams once he narrows his choices. Colts fans were sad to see their city's shining star on his way elsewhere. "I'm disgusted. Manning is who Indianapolis is, he's our identity and what he's done for the community. He's more than a football player," Bob Nellish told CNN affiliate WTHR-TV. "I wouldn't be nearly as big a fan without him," WTHR quoted fan Aly Wiggs as saying.

chatgpt: Indianapolis Colts fans are eagerly awaiting a highly anticipated noon ET press conference where the team's management will address the future of the team. The news may leave some fans heartbroken, as it has been confirmed that star quarterback Peyton Manning will be out for the entire 2011 season due to a neck injury.  Manning has been the quarterback for the Colts for the last 14 seasons, and this news is not only significant in terms of the immediate future of the team but also for the big picture of Manning's future with the Colts. Manning has been a cornerstone of the team, leading them to a Super Bowl win in 2007 and being named the league's MVP four times. In Manning's absence, the team will have to turn to other quarterbacks to lead them through the season. The backup quarterback position has been a concern for the Colts, as Manning has not missed a game due to injury in his entire career. It remains to be seen who will step up to fill this role and what impact this news will have on the team's performance this season. However, the Colts do have some bright prospects for the future. The team holds the coveted first pick in the 2012 NFL draft, which they will now surely use to select a quarterback. This pick has been highly coveted by other teams, but the Colts have consistently stated their intention to hold onto it and select a franchise quarterback. The team also has a number of other talented players, such as wide receiver Reggie Wayne, who will need to step up and take on leadership roles in Manning's absence. Although this news may be disappointing to Colts fans, it is important to remember that Manning's health is the top priority. His absence this season will give him the necessary time to heal and recover, and could pave the way for an exciting new era for the team. As the press conference approaches, fans are hopeful for some additional news about the team's plans for the coming season. It remains to be seen whether the Colts will be able to overcome the loss of their star quarterback and emerge as a strong contender, but one thing is for certain - this season will be one of the most closely watched in recent years for the team and their fans.
