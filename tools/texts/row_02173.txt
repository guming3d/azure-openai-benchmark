The young model is hoping to find her own Ken to complete the fairytale romance.  However, her friendship with fellow Ukraininan model Valeria Lukyanov, who has been dubbed the 'Human Barbie', has been tumultuous. The two were once friends, but their relationship has since soured.

Meanwhile, Kovalevskaya has been making a name for herself on YouTube with her tutorial videos on how to achieve the perfect Barbie look. Her channel has attracted hundreds of thousands of views, and she has become somewhat of a social media star.  "I just love the Barbie look," Kovalevskaya said in an interview. "I've always found Barbie to be the epitome of beauty, and I wanted to emulate that. Plus, it's just really fun to experiment with different makeup styles and hair colors."  Despite the scrutiny that both Kovalevskaya and Lukyanov face, their Barbie-like appearances have sparked a new wave of interest in the iconic toy. Barbie has been a source of controversy in recent years, with critics arguing that her unrealistic proportions promote unhealthy beauty standards. However, the appearance of real-life Barbie models has proven to be a source of fascination for many.  Kovalevskaya, who prides herself on her natural beauty and is often seen without makeup, has even started hosting meet-and-greets with her fans. "I love meeting my fans and hearing their stories," she said. "It's amazing to see how people have been inspired by my look."  In the end, whether or not Kovalevskaya finds her own Ken remains to be seen. But there is no denying that she has captured the attention of the world with her unique beauty and determination to achieve the perfect Barbie look.
