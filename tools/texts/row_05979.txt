Henry revealed that he had little support from his own federation and as the row raged decided, with the help of his lawyer, to issue a statement in which he said that a replay of the second leg would be the "fairest solution." It came hours after world governing body FIFA had turned down Irish appeals for a second chance. "After the game, and even for the next two days, I felt alone, truly alone," Henry claimed. "It was only after I sent my statement that people from the French federation appeared." The 32-year-old, who forged his reputation in a glittering clear at English Premier League Arsenal, is France's record scorer with 51 goals and will be a key player in the World Cup finals in South Africa.

But Henry was repentant over his celebration with teammates after referee Martin Hansson had waived away Irish appeals to award the goal. "I should not have done it," he said. "But frankly, it was uncontrollable. After all that had happened... yes, I regret it. That's why right after I spoke with the Irish one by one." France, runners-up to Italy at the 2006 World Cup, will go into the draw for the finals in South Africa on December 4 as one of eight-seeded teams.

chatgpt: Former Arsenal and Barcelona striker Thierry Henry has revealed that he almost quit international football following the controversy that ensued after a blatant handball he committed during a World Cup qualifier match against Ireland. Speaking in an interview with The Guardian, the French football legend said he felt "truly alone" and struggled to come to terms with the fallout after he set up the winning goal for William Gallas. The incident, which happened back in 2009 at the Stade de France, sparked widespread criticism and anger after Henry's handball went unnoticed by the referee, leading to the crucial goal for France in the play-off tie. The Irish team was eventually eliminated from the tournament, causing a lot of consternation and outrage in their home country. In the aftermath of the match, Henry said he received a lot of hate messages and insults, which made him rethink his future with the national team. “It was the toughest time of my career,” he said. “I felt like I was alone. I didn’t have any escape. You can’t escape your phone. I was in a bad place.” Despite the difficulties he faced, Henry went on to play for France until 2010, becoming the country's all-time leading scorer in international matches with an impressive record of 51 goals. Furthermore, he revealed that he has no regrets about the handball, claiming that he was simply trying to help his team qualify for the World Cup. “I didn’t cheat,” he said. “I did what I had to do to help my team win a game. It was a split second decision. I didn’t have time to think about it. I'm happy I did it because we won, but it wasn't a happy moment for me personally.” He also acknowledged the mistake and the impact it had on the Irish team, adding that he apologized to their captain Robbie Keane soon after the match. In conclusion, Thierry Henry's confession highlights the intense pressure that athletes often face while representing their countries. While the "handball" incident will undoubtedly remain a contentious issue, it is evident that Henry's dedication and commitment to his national team is second to none.
