And now the late artist’s estate has found an equally unorthodox way to settle his £10 million . inheritance tax bill – by trading in parts of his art collection. In April, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Freud left £96 million in his will, the largest sum ever by a British artist. But rather than hand a large slice of it to the taxman, executors of the estate have offered to give a selection of artworks to museums in lieu  of payment. Executors are understood to have offered some of Lucien Freud (left) 's favourite works including Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot's painting L'Italienne, Ou La Femme A La Manche Jaune to settle his tax bill . Works offered are understood to include examples by French sculptor Edgar Degas, and French artist Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot’s painting L’Italienne, Ou La Femme  A La Manche Jaune. Freud, whose sitters included the Queen, Kate Moss and a naked Jobcentre supervisor nicknamed ‘Big Sue’, died in  July last year. Last month, the Government’s Acceptance in Lieu panel (AIL), which works in conditions of utter secrecy, is said to have approved the application to use artworks to settle the tax bill, deciding the items offered were of enough significance. Its decision will have to be ratified by Ministers, who will then decide which museums and galleries receive the items. One source in the art world said: ‘It was not a long list of items but it included the Corot painting and the sculptures. There may have been one or two other things. ‘The amount to be covered is just under £10 million.’ A spokesman for the Arts Council, which runs the AIL panel, last night declined to confirm or deny whether Freud’s estate had even made an approach to the panel. The National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery both declined to comment. The Tate Gallery said: ‘We can’t comment on works of art that are not part of the Tate collection.’ Another source last night said that it was almost certain that the Corot painting would end up  in the National Gallery. In a rare interview in 2002, Freud, who fathered at least 14 children, named Corot as one of the all-time greats of the art world alongside Constable, Rembrandt and Gericault. His collection contains several works by his friend, the German-born artist Frank Auerbach. The Corot painting offered to the nation was once owned by Hollywood star Edward G. Robinson, best known for his gangster roles in films such as Key Largo and Double Indemnity. Freud’s will revealed that he left David Dawson, his assistant of more than 20 years, £2.5 million as well as his West London home. Dawson was unavailable for comment. Lawyer Diana Rawstron, an executor of the estate, who is believed to have handled negotiations with the panel, was also unavailable.

chatgpt: The art world is buzzing with excitement as executors offer up works by two revered artists, Edgar Egas and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. The latest news coming out of the art world suggests that a government panel has understood, and thus likely accepted, an application for the artworks to be displayed in museums. Executors have long planned to provide art enthusiasts with access to some of the standout works by Egas and Corot. They have been eagerly awaiting approval from the government panel to move forward with their plans. The executors believe that displaying these works in museums across the country will provide visitors with the opportunity to appreciate the artistic marvels that both Egas and Corot have produced over the years. After submitting their application to the government panel, the executors finally received news indicating that their submission has been understood, indicating likely acceptance. While this is certainly an encouraging development for the executors, it is not the final step in the process of displaying these works in museums. Ministers will have to ratify the panel's decision before the artworks can be displayed in museums across the country. Additionally, ministers will need to decide which museums will benefit from the addition of Egas' and Corot's works to their collections. This decision is a crucial factor in determining how widely their artwork will be available for public viewing. The government panel's acceptance of the application gives hope to art enthusiasts that these pieces will soon be available in museums, but the process is not yet complete. Executors have selected works that showcase Egas' and Corot's talents and highlight their unique perspective on the world. Visitors to these museums will have the opportunity to see how the artists' styles have evolved over time and get a glimpse into their political and social opinions as well. Ega's works are considered important examples of portraiture and photography, and visitors to the museums will have an opportunity to gaze upon some of his most distinguished pieces. Much of his work is characterized by grand gestures, muted colors and relatable subject matter. Corot, on the other hand, developed a style that many considered to be the precursor to Impressionism. His works are known for their shimmering light and dreamy atmosphere. The pieces selected for display are considered to be among his finest works and will add a new dimension to museum collections. In conclusion, the news that the government panel has understood an application for displaying the works of Egas and Corot in museums nationwide is an encouraging sign for art enthusiasts. However, it is not the final step in the process to get their works into these museums. Once the ministers ratify the panel's decision, they will decide which museums will receive these marvelous works. Nevertheless, the anticipation of what is to come will only increase the eagerness with which art enthusiasts approach museums, looking forward to catching a glimpse of these brilliantly crafted works.
