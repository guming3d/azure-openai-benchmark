At least 1,000 dead ducks were found floating in the Nanhe river in southwestern China . It has not yet been established what killed the ducks, which were disinfected and buried in plastic bags . They were found in over 50 woven bags but the bodies were so badly decomposed it was impossible to tell how they died. The news came as Shanghai environmental workers said almost all of the dead pigs had been removed from the Huangpu river, which supplies 22% of the city’s drinking water. Government officials said 98 pigs were recovered on Sunday and 93 on Saturday, the first time the daily toll had fallen below a hundred in days.

An initial investigation suggested they originated from upstream and were not dumped by local farmers. The Nanhe river is not a source of drinking water. Mystery remains over the exact origin of both the dead hogs and ducks. ‘Dead pigs, dead ducks... this soup is getting thicker and thicker,' wrote one person with the username Baby Luck on weibo, China’s version of Twitter. ‘The dead pigs haven’t even disappeared yet, and now the dead ducks emerge - does this society enjoy being competitive?” wrote netizen sugarandsweet.

chatgpt: Fears are mounting over the safety of China's drinking water, as yet another reminder of the issue arrives with the discovery of multiple animal carcasses in the Nanhe river in Sichun, a southwestern province in China. The contaminated river has sparked concern among residents who rely on the river for water supply. The discovery of these carcasses comes in the wake of last week's discovery of thousands of dead pigs in Hongqiao, Shanghai's main waterway, raising concerns across the country regarding the safety of drinking water. An environmental official stated that most of the dead pigs have been removed, but the situation has left many fearful about the quality of China's water sources. According to local reports, the remains of multiple animals were found floating in the Nanhe river, with a few of them being identified as pig carcasses. The authorities quickly dispatched officials and equipment to examine the water quality and to collect samples to check for any contaminants. According to state-run media, the water quality in the area has been inspected regularly, with the tests proving that the water was clean and safe. However, the discovery of animal remains in the river raises doubts about the credibility of these tests and the safety of the drinking water. China's water system has been strained due to industrialization and urbanization, resulting in pollution and a lack of safe drinking water for many. It has also brought to light the country's troubles with enforcing environmental regulations, leading to concerns that many companies still continue to pollute the water sources with impunity. To combat this issue, the government has been making efforts to clean up the water sources and punish those who violate the environmental regulations. Nonetheless, the latest discovery of animal carcasses in the Nanhe river has highlighted the enormity of the task at hand, and the need for greater efforts in ensuring the safety of China's water supply. Many groups have highlighted the need for continued monitoring of the water systems across the country, calling on the authorities to make a greater effort to ensure the safety of the water supply. This includes the implementation of harsher punishments for environmental violations, as well as stricter regulations to improve the safety of the country's water sources. In conclusion, the discovery of animal carcasses in the Nanhe river in Sichun has raised concerns about the safety of China's drinking water, adding to the already mounting fears amid the discovery of thousands of dead pigs in Hongqiao. As the authorities work to clean up the water sources and punish those who violate environmental regulations, many are calling for greater efforts to ensure that China's water supply is safe and clean.
