The body of a 79-year-old woman was found this past weekend in the aftermath of the Colorado flooding, Larimer County authorities said Monday. The body of Evelyn Starner, of Cedar Cove, was discovered on a bank of the Big Thompson River, the sheriff's office said. It is the first confirmed fatality in the county due to the floods, and it brings the storm-related death toll in the state to eight. One other person in the county is currently listed as missing and presumed dead. A man previously listed as presumed dead checked in with authorities and is alive and well, the sheriff's office said. One other Cedar Cover resident, a 60-year-old woman, is still missing and presumed dead. Vice President Joe Biden visited Colorado on Monday and took a one-hour aerial tour to view the damage. He also checked on recovery efforts. "Once all these cameras are gone, once these press conferences are done, FEMA and the Red Cross are still going to be here until we make you whole. Until we make it right for you," Biden told Colorado residents. Biden said the federal government had approved $35 million thus far for road rebuilding and other projects. He said those funds wouldn't be affected by a possible government shutdown. Torrential rains fell September 12 in mountainous areas north of Denver, and such downpours persisted for several more days, adding up to 18.1 inches in parts of Boulder County and 15.6 inches in Adams County, Gov. John Hickenlooper said. The heavy rainfall spurred flash floods that turned picturesque canyons into funnels that deluged towns downstream and left hundreds stranded. More than a week later, many remained marooned -- cut off from the rest of the world thanks to floodwaters that wiped out roads and bridges. Tune strikes a poignant chord amid deluge in Colorado .

The man, whose identity has not been released, was reported missing three days ago after not returning from a hiking trip in the mountains of Larimer County. Search and rescue teams scoured the area for any signs of the missing hiker, but to no avail. Just as authorities were about to call off the search, a group of hikers stumbled upon the man lying in a clearing. He was severely dehydrated and suffering from exposure, but alive nonetheless. The hikers immediately alerted the authorities, who rushed to the scene. The man was airlifted to a nearby hospital, where he is currently being treated for his injuries. Authorities are calling his survival a "miracle" given the harsh conditions of the wilderness he was found in. The discovery of the missing hiker came amidst grim news that a 79-year-old woman had been found dead in a separate incident in the same area this weekend.
