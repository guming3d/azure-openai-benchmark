Facebook's fall from grace has been sudden - from being used by 72% of teens in the spring to just 45% now, while just 12% said they used Google+ . In the survey, analysts examined how children's social media preferences have changed over the last six months. Instagram has become even more popular, with 76 percent of teens currently saying they use it - up 7 percent since last spring. Twitter ranked second, used by 59 percent of teens. Facebook came in third. Pinterest and Tumblr each claimed a little over 20 percent. Another 20 percent of teens said they use 'other' social networks, not named in the survey but likely including some popular anonymous messaging services and the disappearing-message app Snapchat. Apple remains the top consumer electronics brand for teens, according to the annual fall survey of 7,200 teens, conducted in classrooms and electronically. Kevin Systrom, Instagram Chief Executive Officer and co-founder: The firm has now overtaken its owner, Facebook, in the teen market . About 67 percent own iPhones (up from 61 percent in the spring), with an even greater number (73 percent) saying their next device will be an iPhone. However, response to the Apple Watch remains, in the words of Piper Jaffray technology analyst Gene Munster, 'tepid', according to Re/Code. Only seven percent of teens said they already own a smartwatch — and just 16 percent would be interested in shelling out $350 to buy the Apple Watch. 'The concept of wearing a watch for teenagers is foreign — and I think that's part of what is reflected in that response,' said Munster. 'The second piece is, it's still something that people need to hear more about, beyond what Apple has to say about it, before people get interested in it.' something to think about: Facebook is nolonger the most popular social network among teens - although luckily it does own Instagram, which pipped it to the post . Researchers also analysed wider teen habits. 'Our fall 2014 survey results indicate teens continue to diversify their tastes through discovery of emerging brands and multi-brand experimentation, even as their views of the economy worsen,' said Steph Wissink, co-director of research and senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. 'We also observe trends that indicate teens use social media, mainly Instagram, to create their own unique personal brands and seek peer affirmation. 'Millennials continue to be early adopters of change who use technology to engage with brands 'on demand' on their own time.'

The study involved a survey of more than 1,000 individuals, and the findings revealed that Instagram was used by 61% of the respondents. Following Instagram, Twitter ranked second with 56% of the respondents using the platform. And on third place, with 53% of the respondents, came Facebook. This may come as a surprise, considering that Facebook has been the forerunner in the social media realm for many years. However, the new findings suggest a shift in social media preferences. The study also revealed some interesting insights into the preferences of users for tech brands. With the ever-growing tech landscape, it is not surprising that customers have differing opinions about which brand is the best. However, in this recent research, Apple came out as the most popular tech brand. 68% of the participants said that they preferred Apple products over any other tech brand available in the market. The study conducted by the research team involved questions about the social media platforms that people use and their views about the various tech brands. The researchers say that this study has been conducted to get insights into the likes and dislikes of the general public when it comes to technology and social media use. The research conducted also revealed that users across all age groups were found to be using social media platforms. It was found that Instagram was most popular among the younger age group of people, while Facebook was most popular among older people. Additionally, the research found that Twitter was a platform preferred by people of all ages, whereas Snapchat was more popular among the 16-24 year old age group. This is not a surprising finding, as Snapchat has been historically known to be more popular among younger users. The researchers say that the findings of this study could be beneficial to social media companies and tech brands. Knowing what users prefer can help in making informed decisions regarding the development of platforms and products. This is especially important at a time when the competition is high, and social media companies are looking for ways to attract and retain users. The news of Instagram being the most popular social media platform among users will come as a boost for the company, which has been in the limelight for offering new features and updates recently. Similarly, for Apple, the news of being the most popular tech brand will come as a boost, especially given the brand's constant efforts to innovate and stay ahead of competition. In conclusion, with the ever-growing popularity of social media, understanding the preferences of users becomes even more critical for social media companies and tech brands. Findings such as these can help them gain a deeper understanding of what users want, which can help them in improving their offerings and staying ahead of the competition.
