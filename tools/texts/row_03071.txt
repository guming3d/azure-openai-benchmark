It has a reputation as a rather po-faced Middle England town, typified by the famed fictional letter writer ‘Disgusted, of Tunbridge Wells’. Now the good burghers of the royal spa town want to inject a little cheer. In an attempt to boost tourism, councillors are considering re-branding the town Funbridge Wells. Other slogans up for discussion include ‘Why not Tunbridge Wells?’ and ‘Cultural Capital of West Kent’. Cultural Capital of West Kent: Councillors want to re-brand Tunbridge Wells to make it more appealing . The council says a slogan will help ‘guide its development strategy’ and are also looking to ‘make the most’ of famous quotes about Tunbridge Wells. Among the quotes being examined as possible mottos for the council include one from David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia in which head of the Arab Bureau Mr Dryden says: ‘On the whole, I wish I’d stayed in Tunbridge Wells’. Another line, from 007 movie On Her Majesty’s Secret Service starring George Lazenby in which Bond girl Tracy Di Vicenzo - played by Diana Rigg - tells Bond that she ‘looks forward to living as Mr and Mrs James Bond of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells’. And yet one more line from H.G Wells’ book Christina Alberta’s Father in which he wrote: ‘Tunbridge Wells is Tunbridge Wells, and there is nothing really like it upon our planet.’ Nothing like it: The council is looking to make the most of famous quotes about the town . Cllr John Cunningham, who sits on the think tank, said a new motto was important to attract tourists to the area, but said that he was not a fan of Funbridge Wells. He said: ‘A motto would be good. We have got so much for tourists to see, but I think Funbridge Wells is not on - I wouldn’t pick it myself.’ Councillor Francis Rook said: ‘I think we should leave it to the younger and vibrant members of the council to think about taglines. ‘I think it is important that the borough council informs people of the fantastic diversity and culture and history we have in the area.’ Cabinet member for tourism, leisure and economic development, Jane March, said: ‘It will involve a lot of people but it’ is at a very early stage and we are still formulating.’ Local Richard Spicer, 54, said: ‘Tunbridge Wells needs to get rid of its fuddy duddy image of people always complaining and never being happy with life. ‘The place is packed full of bars, theatres, restaurants and all sorts, so we need to use that to bring people in - I don’t really like Funbridge Wells, but it’s better than the rest of the ideas.’

chatgpt: The council of Tunbridge Wells is calling upon the town's residents to help decide on a new slogan that will shape the town's development strategy. Two potential slogans up for discussion are "Why not Tunbridge Wells?" and "Cultural Capital of West Kent."  The council believes that the slogan will play a significant role in attracting new businesses and visitors to the town. They hope to create a tagline that encompasses the town's history, culture, and values, while also appealing to a wider audience.  In addition to these slogans, the council is looking to incorporate famous quotes about the town. They believe that these quotes could help to reinforce the town's identity and make it more recognizable.  The council's decision to focus on branding comes as a response to a recent decline in the number of visitors to Tunbridge Wells. They are hoping that a new, more compelling slogan will help to reverse this trend, and position the town as a must-visit destination.  The council is calling on residents, businesses, and tourists to give their input on the new slogan through a public consultation process. They want to ensure that the town's identity is accurately represented, and that the slogan resonates with locals and visitors alike.  The process has already received attention from many members of the community. Some Tunbridge Wells residents have expressed their excitement at the opportunities that a new slogan could bring to the town. Others, however, are more hesitant, expressing concern that the council's focus on branding could risk losing the town's historic identity.  Despite these concerns, the council remains optimistic. They say that the slogan will not only serve as a marketing tool but will also serve as a guide for the town's development strategy. By having a clear and cohesive message, the council hopes that they will be able to attract businesses that align with Tunbridge Wells' values and history.  The consultation process is set to run until the end of next month, and the council will then analyze the feedback before deciding on the final slogan. They say that they are excited to hear the ideas and opinions of the town's residents and are looking forward to incorporating them into the town's branding strategy.  The town has a rich history and heritage, ranging from its famous Chalybeate Spring to its association with famous writers and poets such as Percy Bysshe Shelley and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. It is believed that the new slogan will reflect the town's rich history and its current aspirations.  In conclusion, Tunbridge Wells is on the hunt for a new slogan that will shape the town's development strategy and attract new businesses and visitors. The council is calling on the community to give their input and is excited to see what ideas and opinions arise from the public consultation process. It remains to be seen what slogan will ultimately be chosen, but with community engagement and clear objectives, it is hoped that the chosen slogan will guide Tunbridge Wells' growth and success for years to come.
