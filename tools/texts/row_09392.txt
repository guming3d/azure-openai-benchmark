Cavill bought his dog Kal-El – who was named after Superman’s own name on his home planet Krypton – last year with his then girlfriend, American actress Gina Carano. Animal behaviour expert Dr David Sands said: ‘Many people get anxious when on a plane and it is much better for them to stroke a dog than to try to get over their fear by tucking into the alcohol.’ But consultant psychologist at the London Medical Centre, Ingrid Collins, said: ‘Plane journeys are ordeals for animals and I would not recommend them unless they were absolutely necessary. 'There is a danger that a sympathetic doctor will sign someone off to have their dog fly with them when they could probably do without it.’ It is not known where Cavill and Kal-El were flying to on Friday.

chatgpt: On a sunny afternoon in Los Angeles, Henry Cavill arrived at LAX airport accompanied by his pet dog, Kal-El. As the two made their way through the bustling airport, Kal-El was seen sporting a vest that read "Working. Do not pet. Emotional Support Dog". This served as a visible reminder to other travelers that Kal-El was a working service animal and needed to be left alone. While it is not uncommon to see dogs at airports, many may not be aware that service animals like Kal-El are permitted to fly with their owners. The US Department of Transportation allows individuals with disabilities to travel with their service animals, which can include dogs, cats, and even miniature horses, provided they meet certain guidelines. For nervous fliers, having an emotional support animal like Kal-El can make all the difference during a stressful travel experience. Some airlines may require documentation or advanced notice before allowing a service animal to board, and passengers must ensure that their animals are well-behaved and properly trained. Of course, Henry Cavill needs no introduction to fans of superhero movies. The actor is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Superman in the DC Extended Universe. While Kal-El may not have the ability to fly like his on-screen counterpart, he is undoubtedly a beloved companion to the actor when he is not busy filming. The use of emotional support animals has become increasingly popular in recent years, and many people have found comfort and relief when traveling with their service animals. These animals are trained to provide comfort and support to their owners, and their presence can help alleviate anxiety and stress. However, it is important to note that the use of service animals should not be taken lightly. While the US Department of Transportation allows service animals on flights, there have been cases of people attempting to pass off ordinary pets as service animals in order to bring them onboard. Ultimately, the proper use of service animals is crucial to ensuring that people with disabilities are able to travel safely and comfortably. Henry Cavill and his emotional support dog, Kal-El, serve as a reminder of the importance of these service animals and the benefits they can provide.
