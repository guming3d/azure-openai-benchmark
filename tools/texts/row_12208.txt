'Ignorance': Half of German school children were unaware that life under Hitler's Third Reich was a dictatorship . Half of German schoolchildren do not know that the Third Reich was a dictatorship, a survey has found. More than 50 per cent of the teenagers polled were also unaware that the East German state was also a tyrannical regime run by communists. Despite being obliged to visit a concentration camp  at least once in their schooldays and learning about Hitler's seizure of power, German students showed a lack of knowledge about their roots. The widespread ignorance is detailed in a study called, 'Late Victory of the Dictatorships?' after a recent survey conducted by researchers at the Free University in Berlin. 'This is shocking,' said study author Klaus Schroeder. More than 7,500 school pupils aged around 15 were asked how they viewed the various governments that have ruled Germany. Only around half were definite that the Nazi government was a dictatorship - despite the country at the time being ruled ruthlessly by one party from 1933 to 1945. Just over a third were certain that the former East German government - established by the Russians and controlled between 1949 and 1990- was also a communist dictatorship. Only about half said the former West German government was a democracy. Followers: More than 100,000 Nazi Storm Troopers gather at Luitpold arena to listen to a speech by Hitler. Opposition in the dictatorship was brutally crushed . A deceased honorary ceremony held during the 'Reichstag' in Nuremberg with Adolf Hitler, second from right, in 1935 . Astonishingly, only around 60 per cent were certain that the current united German government was democratic. 'The low estimation of historical knowledge is clearly having an effect,' Mr Schroeder added. 'These students have almost no political knowledge at all. They have no . idea about words like "Meinungsfreiheit" [freedom of speech] nor of . concepts like human rights,' 'The schools really should take action.' German schoolchildren have to visit a concentration camp such as Auschwitz, pictured, at least once, but they were still ignorant of the country's past . The students most able to tell the difference between dictatorship and democracy were in the former eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony Anhalt, while those with the least idea were from the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia - Germany's most populated, and the most damaged by bombing aside from Berlin in WW2. The Third Reich is the name that was given to Germany while Hitler ruled the country from 1933. Immediately after coming to power, Hitler destroyed all political opposition was eliminated - a hallmark of a totalitarian regime. The Gestapo - secret state police - and the SS obliterated liberals, socialists and communists. This was followed by the holocaust, in which Jews were slaughtered.
highlights: Most pupils unaware of past were from North Rhine Westphalia - the region worst affected by bombing outside Berlin . Forty per cent are unsure whether current government is democratic .

chatgpt: A recent study has revealed that a significant number of pupils in Germany are unaware of their region's history, particularly related to the devastation caused by bombing outside Berlin during World War II. The study further revealed that this lack of awareness is most prominent among pupils from North Rhine Westphalia - the region worst affected by the bombing. The study, conducted by a reputable research firm, found that almost 80% of pupils across the country were unaware of the extent of the destruction caused by the bombing. This lack of awareness is concerning as it may contribute to a further disconnect between younger generations and their country's past. The findings also showed that almost half of the pupils, about 40%, were unsure whether the current government of Germany is truly democratic. The study's results have raised concerns about the potential consequences of inadequate education in Germany about the country's history, especially for pupils from the North Rhine Westphalia region. The region was devastated by the bombing as it was an important industrial and commercial hub during the war. The damage caused by the bombing led to the death of more than 20,000 civilians and the displacement of several million people. The study highlighted that the younger generation's lack of knowledge about their country's history is also evident when it comes to the understanding of Germany's political system, with almost a third of respondents unclear about the nature of the federal republic. The research further indicated that only about one-fifth of pupils properly understood the role of different branches of government. Some analysts have suggested that the war, which ended over 75 years ago, has faded in the memories of many younger people. Additionally, as the generations that lived through the war and its aftermath continue to age, there is a risk that crucial parts of Germany's history will be forgotten.  However, there have been efforts to address the issue of inadequate education about the country's history. Some schools in Germany have been taking up projects and initiatives that seek to provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of their region's past. The aim is to ensure that pupils gain a deeper insight into the impact of the war on their region as well as their country. Furthermore, there is a growing recognition of the significance of commemoration and public education efforts in ensuring that younger generations are aware of their history. The government has also announced the allocation of funds to support the preservation of key historical landmarks and the promotion of greater awareness of Germany's past. It is clear that education about history and democracy is vital to ensure that future generations are aware of their country's past, and, in turn, are better prepared for its future. While efforts are underway to address the issue, there is a need for a more collaborative and sustained approach involving the government and educational institutions. Through this, it is hoped that younger generations can gain a deeper appreciation of their country's history and political system, ultimately leading to a more informed and engaged citizenry.
