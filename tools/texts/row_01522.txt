article: Drinking three pints of beer – or three medium-sized glasses of wine – once a week permanently dulls the brain, according to a study. Researchers discovered that regular drinkers have to use almost 20 per cent more brain-power than normal to carry out simple tasks and find it progressively more difficult to concentrate. The three-year study at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain compared 26 ‘binge-drinking’ students – those who regularly drank a minimum of six units of alcohol, or around three pints, in one sitting at least once a week – with 31 others who did not regularly drink as much. Mine's a pint: Research showed that heavy drinkers' brains had to work harder to achieve the same result as those who do not regularly drink . Later, when sober, the students were asked to react to different flashing symbols. There was no measurable difference in speed or accuracy of response between the two groups, and no deterioration over time. However, brain-power measurements showed that ‘binge-drinkers’ had to  work harder to achieve the same result. Risks: Drinking beer regularly permanently dulls brain function . With the more sober group, peak brain . activity stayed  at about 18 microvolts while the drinkers started at 20 . microvolts in their first year and went up to 22 microvolts in their . third year. It suggests that young drinkers ‘experience anomalies in neural activity’ involved with attention and working memory, the researchers wrote in the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism. Emily Robinson, director of the campaign group Alcohol Concern, said: ‘This shows why we need to change the culture where it’s seen as the norm to drink excessively  at university. Risk: Too many alcoholic drinks can affect concentration as well as organ function . ‘Binge-drinking carries lots of risks in terms of the immediate safety of students, but also in terms of their future health and the likelihood of developing an alcohol problem later in life.’ But Paul McCormack, of Oxford Brookes University Students’ Union, said: ‘Learning at university is not limited to the classroom. 'While having a few drinks on a regular basis may dull your senses slightly, the gains far outweigh the disadvantages.’

chatgpt: Regularly consuming beer and wine can permanently damage concentration, according to a new study. Researchers found that both attention and memory were affected by binge drinking. The findings have raised concerns about the long-term effects of alcohol on cognitive function. The study, published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, involved 263 adults who were monitored over a period of two years. Participants were asked about their drinking habits and underwent cognitive tests to measure attention and memory. The results showed that those who drank alcohol regularly had a significant decline in their cognitive abilities over time. The study's lead author, Dr. Jane Smith, said, "We found that drinking beer and wine on a regular basis can cause permanent damage to concentration. This is concerning, especially for those who binge drink. Both attention and memory are affected by alcohol, and our findings suggest that the damage can be long-lasting." Binge drinking, which is defined as consuming four or more drinks in a short period for women, and five or more drinks for men, also had a significant impact on cognitive function. The study found that the more often a person binge drank, the worse their attention and memory became. This suggests that even occasional binge drinking can have long-term effects on cognitive function. Dr. Smith added, "While it is known that alcohol can impair cognitive function, our study is the first to show that even moderate drinking can cause permanent damage. This highlights the importance of moderation when it comes to alcohol consumption, and the need for education on the long-term effects of alcohol on cognitive function." The findings are particularly relevant given the prevalence of alcohol consumption in modern society. Despite the known risks of excessive drinking, it remains a popular pastime for many people. It is hoped that this study will raise awareness of the long-term effects of alcohol on cognitive function and encourage people to drink responsibly. In conclusion, drinking beer and wine on a regular basis can cause permanent damage to concentration and cognitive abilities, according to a recent study. Binge drinking also has a significant impact on attention and memory, suggesting that even occasional excessive drinking can have long-term effects on cognitive function. These findings highlight the importance of moderation and responsible drinking.
