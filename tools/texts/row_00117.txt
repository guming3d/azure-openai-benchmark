Hurtling down a mountain track on a mountain bike, with sheer drops awaiting careless riders, is a terrifying and thrilling way to spend your free time. But it's not adrenaline-fuelled enough for German extreme sports enthusiast Lutz Eichholz, who instead takes to some of the world's most rugged terrain on a unicycle. The 26-year-old, who has been unicycing since he was just nine, is a pioneer of extreme mountain unicycling and has travelled the world to indulge in his heart-stopping hobby. Scroll down for video . Eichholz pauses to survey the terrain before cycling his way down the Dolomite Mountains in Italy . Mr Eichholz, who is often joined by his friend Stephanie Dietze, recently took to the unforgiving Dolomite Mountains in Italy and the pair were filmed making their perilous descent, using an incredible amount of skill and physical fitness. The riders are often forced to bail on their one-wheeled machines, which have similar tyres to mountain bikes, as they take a spill during their hair-raising journey. Mr Eichholz has to 'bunny hop' down sheer rock faces, fight to maintain his balance on the treacherous shale beneath him and teeth-grindingly pedal up arduous steep slopes. His exploits have even earned him sponsorship from major sports brands. Eichholz (left) plunges down a slope as his friend Stephanie Dietze looks on . He is also the world record holder for the highest ever unicycle drop, landing a plunge from 6m of an overhanging rock in the Moroccan desert. Extreme mountain unicycling was pioneered during the 1990s on the West Coast of the United States, and has since attracted thousands of enthusiasts from around the world. 'People like the novelty of it,' Wendy Grzych, the president of the Unicycling Society of America,  told the New York Times. 'It’s a whole subculture, and a different makeup than your church friends or work buddies.' The pair won the support of Adidas sportswear, who sponsored their trip and provided a professional cameraman to record their unbelievably dangerous feats . Practitioners claim the sport is no more dangerous than mountain biking, despite the frequency of falls. 'We fall more often than mountain bikers, but we’re going slower so it’s not as bad. 'The same cliffs are out there,' said unicyclist Hans Van Koppen. 'Unicycling is by far much more exercise (than mountain biking),' Van Koppen added. 'You use every part of your body — arms, legs, stomach, back.' The sport has even spawned its own terminology for the many injuries it can cause, such as  'shindentations' (marks where rocks puncture the front of the legs) and 'calf tracks' (thin scars where the pedals cut into the back of the calves). Extreme unicycling is a niche sport but has grown in popularity, despite the dangers .

chatgpt: German thrill-seeker, Lutz Eichholz, has taken unicycling to new heights by tackling the  most rugged and terrifying peaks on his uni-wheel. This unorthodox way of conquering mountains has earned him the title of an "extreme unicycling" enthusiast, and made him one of the world's most remarkable athletes.  Eichholz has been riding unicycles since the tender age of nine and has progressively excelled in the sport, becoming one of the industry's leading figures. He has harnessed his skills to climb some of the most challenging peaks around the world, from Mount Fuji in Japan, to climbing the 3000-meter Marmolada in the Italian Dolomites, an expedition that he considered one of his most challenging ones yet.  To complete the daring feats, Eichholz uses a customized unicycle which is robust enough to withstand the rugged terrain, often with no regard for the lack of balance or the danger that could arise if he stumbled or fell. However, the "extreme unicycling" enthusiast credits his intense fitness regime, and strict training schedule for allowing him to successfully complete such daunting climbs safely.   In an interview with BBC, Eichholz shared the backstory behind the conception of his unusual hobby, saying it began as a form of training for balancing sports. Eventually, his love for the sport grew stronger, and he began to push his limits. He explained that despite the dangerous and scary situations that he has found himself in, he finds satisfaction in challenging himself and pushing beyond what he thought was possible.  Notwithstanding the challenges he has overcome, Eichholz says the most difficult part of his climbs is often the beginning when he is attempting to find a starting point. He meticulously reviews maps, making sure he knows the terrain well, to limit the chances of being caught unawares. Nevertheless, he admits to experiencing doubts about whether he will be able to complete the climbs from time to time. Undeterred by these fears, Eichholz consistently sets himself ambitious goals: recently, he completed a climb to the top of a 3200-meter volcano in Chile, and plans to soon attempt to cross the Eastern Alps on his unicycle.  The thrill-seeker is also known to explore the limits of his sport in front of live audiences. He has competed in several extreme unicycling contests across Europe, and holds six world records for various driving disciplines, such as the speed record for the fastest timed distance covered non-stop, and the ascent world record for unicycling on paved roads. Eichholz's passion for mountain unicycling has also spilled over onto social media, where he has a dedicated following of unicycling enthusiasts. They stay social on his Youtube, Facebook and Instagram pages where he shares photos and videos of his climbing expeditions.  To conclude, Lutz Eichholz has made an impressive name for himself, pushing the boundaries of his sport and proving that anything is possible with determination and courage, along with the belief that it's okay to be a little different from the norm.
