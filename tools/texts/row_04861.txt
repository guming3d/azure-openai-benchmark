Greedy: Sara Beale pictured leaving court today after pleading guilty to stealing more than £10,00 from her elderly father . A daughter stole more than £10,000 from her frail father as he battled Alzheimer’s in a nursing home - to fund her online gambling addiction. Sara Beale, 45, blew the cash on shopping and ‘evil’ internet betting rather than her 70-year-old father Brian Beale’s care, a court heard. Beale, who regularly withdrew money from her father’s account over 10 months, has walked free from court after pleading guilty to theft. He initially received respite care at home for his health problems, including Alzheimer’s disease, Southampton Crown Court heard. But his behaviour became difficult to manage and it was arranged that he would move into a home full time. Beale - who has a young son herself - met with social services and the home and agreed to pay £158 a week from her dad’s funds to cover costs. But no money arrived and she later wrote a letter to social services saying she was no longer responsible for his finances and he should be invoiced. Authorities decided her father was unfit to look after his accounts and agreed they would take control. A trawl of his bank records revealed the elderly man’s pension was still going in - but his daughter had taken out £10,167 over 10 months. Beale was arrested and initially denied taking the money, but later admitted it and said she had spent it on gambling and trying to pay off debts. Judge Derwin Hope handed Beale, from Sholing, Hampshire, a 12-month suspended sentence and 200 hours’ community work. Sentencing, Judge Hope said: 'Gambling is an evil addiction, you got caught up in it and committed this high breach of trust.'

chatgpt: Sara Beale, a woman from Stoke-on-Trent, has been accused of plundering her father's bank account over a 10-month period. According to reports, Beale spent money that was meant to pay for the care of her 70-year-old father Brian, on internet gambling, shopping and paying off debts. Despite pleading guilty to theft, she has walked free from court. Brian Beale is said to have suffered from various health problems and was living in a care home at the time his daughter took the money. The funds were intended to pay for his daily living costs, but instead, Sara Beale used the money for her own purposes. The hearing at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court revealed that Sara Beale had taken a total of £11,860 from her father's bank account. The theft was only discovered when the care home contacted the bank to ask why the payments had stopped. The prosecution argued that Sara Beale had betrayed the trust that was placed in her as her father's representative. Her actions had left him unable to cover the costs of his own care, and he was forced to rely on the council for financial support. Despite the seriousness of the offense, Judge David Fletcher decided not to send Sara Beale to prison. Instead, he gave her a 12-month community order and ordered her to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work. He cited her guilty plea, her remorse, and her lack of previous convictions as factors in his decision. The case has sparked outrage on social media, with many people arguing that the sentence was too lenient. There have been calls for harsher penalties for those who exploit vulnerable people, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. In conclusion, while Sara Beale may have escaped a prison sentence, her actions have had a significant impact on her father's life. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of safeguarding vulnerable adults and the need for stronger punishments for those who exploit them.
