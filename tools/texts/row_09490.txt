This set of cards, featuring 52 intricate maps of English and Welsh counties, would be the envy of any card game. But whoever buys this deck will be keeping them well away from the poker table as the 337 year-old collection is worth £4,500. Each of the hand-drawn 52 cards features a different county along with a map of major cities and roads, as well as the distance to London. The cards feature detailed maps of 52 English and Welsh counties along with geographical information, the suit in the top left, and a number or face in the top right. The King is depicted as Charles II, who was on the throne . Made by well-known map maker Robert Morden in 1676 each card has the name of the county at the top, along with the card number on the left, translated into large Roman numerals on the right. The face cards feature King Charles II, his wife, Catherine of Braganza, as the Queen, and various male heads on the Jack cards. The decorative playing cards feature a map of each county along with a list of data including width, breadth and circumference. Catherine Slowther, maps and atlases expert at Sotheby’s auction house, who are selling the cards, said: 'The first set of playing cards bearing maps of English and Welsh counties was thought to have been produced by William Bowes in 1590. While the cards had some educational value they were mostly made for decoration and as a way for cartographers such as Morden to make money . 'As playing cards were normally a gambling device, one might not expect to find them adapted to educational uses. 'The output of playing cards was seriously curtailed in Cromwellian times, when both cards and play were regarded as sinful. 'This puritanical attitude resulted in the wholesale destruction of many fine sets of cards.' The cards were owned by the former head of the World Bridge Federation Jaime “Jimmy” Ortiz-Patino, who also created the Valderrama golf course in Spain. A previous set made in 1590 also featured pictures of counties, but with nowhere near as much detail and without road networks . The previous set produced by Bowes featured green ink drawings of counties, though without roads or cities, and a bit of detail about each, with the four suits are represented in a pattern around image. The eight introductory cards have the royal arms of Elizabeth I, a portrait of Elizabeth, a map of England and Wales, and a bird's-eye plan of London. Four text-only cards describe the history, governance and character of England. The 1676 deck will be auctioned at Sotheby's next week.
