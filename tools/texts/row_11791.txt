article: (CNN)Javier Hirschfeld has a thing for eyes. He is gripped by unflinching stares, by looks that belie dignity and poise. "Even in street landscapes, I like pictures where the building is looking back at you," admits the Spanish photographer. It was this fascination that inspired him to photograph the women of Goree Island, off the coast of Senegal. "The powerful eyes of those girls; they are very dark and very deep. That's what attracted me to them," he recalls. The women and the landscape reminded him of a powerful portraitist who defined much of his childhood: Spanish painter Julio Romero de Torres. "La Chiquita Piconera is (de Torres') most famous painting, and one of the most famous paintings in the Spanish tradition," he says. "In the history of art, when women are portrayed, most of the time they're being looked at. I like portraits of women that look back at you, and the woman in La Chiquita Piconera is looking back with a lot of dignity and a lot of strength." Another defining feature of de Torre's paintings, says Hirschfeld, is the melancholy housed in their expressions. He found a similar sentiment in the Goree's architecture. "You can see that same melancholy in the crumbling buildings on the island," he says. The 'universal portrait' Though the influence is Spanish, the props, the fabrics, the models and the setting are all local to Senegal. Rather than recreate the Andalusian fashions donned by the women in de Torres' portraits, Hirschfeld picked fabrics from the Senegalese markets, and had dresses made by tailors on the island. "In Senegal, they have an amazing tradition of tailors, and they work really fast. In one day, they can create these beautiful dresses, which you can see in the pictures," he says. Hirschfeld's subjects also hold objects that reflect their culture. In de Torres' painting, "The Fortune-telling," for instance, one woman uses playing cards to give a psychic reading to her friend. In Hirschfeld's version, his models use cowrie shells, a traditional Senegalese fortune-telling tool. "I wanted to show that some emotions are universal, and create a more universal portrait, but I also wanted to create a more Senegalese scene," he says.

chatgpt: Photographer Javier Hirschfeld is making waves in the art world with his unique and culturally-inspired project. Hirschfeld has taken on the challenge of recreating portraits by modern Spanish painter Julio Romero de Torres, but with a Senegalese twist. Senegal is a country known for its vibrant culture and history. It was a fitting choice for Hirschfeld, who wanted to pay tribute to the Spanish influence in Senegal while embracing the local customs and traditions. The result is a stunning series of portraits that blend Spanish and Senegalese aesthetics. The props, fabrics, models, and setting were all sourced locally, making the project a true collaboration between Hirschfeld and the Senegalese community. Each portrait tells a unique story, showcasing the beauty and talent of the Senegalese people. One of the most striking portraits features a young woman dressed in a bright orange and yellow ensemble, seated in front of a traditional Senegalese tapestry. The colors of her outfit are reminiscent of the vibrant Spanish culture, but the tapestry behind her is a nod to the local customs of Senegal. Another portrait showcases a young boy dressed in a traditional Senegalese outfit, holding a Spanish fan in his hand. The juxtaposition of the two cultures is a beautiful representation of the collaboration between Hirschfeld and the Senegalese community. Hirschfeld's project is not only visually stunning, it is also a celebration of diversity and cultural exchange. By embracing the local customs and traditions of Senegal, Hirschfeld has created a series of portraits that truly capture the spirit of both Spain and Senegal.

His portraits are a testament to the beauty of collaboration and the power of art to bring people together across borders and cultures. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, projects like Hirschfeld's are a reminder of the importance of celebrating diversity and embracing different cultures. Through his portraits, Hirschfeld has created a beautiful representation of the symbiotic relationship between Spain and Senegal, and the beauty that can be found in diversity.
