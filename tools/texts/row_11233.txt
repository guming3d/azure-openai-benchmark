chatgpt: Montgomery, Alabama - Criminals struck the apartment at 634 Cleveland Court in Montgomery, Alabama, recently, stealing wiring and causing damage to the historic building. The apartment, now a mini-museum, is well-known as the home of Rosa Parks when she lived in Montgomery. Parks famously refused to give up her seat to a white person on a city bus in 1955, an act that sparked the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. According to police reports, the criminals broke into the apartment and ripped out wiring, causing significant damage to the historic building. The damage caused by the criminals has left many local residents and activists devastated. "Rosa Parks was an icon in the fight for civil rights, and the fact that someone would vandalize her former home is a complete disgrace," said local activist Rodney Johnson. "We need to come together as a community to ensure that this never happens again." The apartment has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is visited by tourists and locals alike. The Rosa Parks Museum, which is located nearby, maintains the apartment as a mini-museum. "The Rosa Parks apartment is an important part of American history," said museum director David Brown. "It is a place where visitors can come to learn about the Civil Rights Movement and the brave individuals who fought for equality." The recent theft and vandalism highlights the need for increased security measures to protect historic sites such as the Rosa Parks apartment. Many activists have called for increased security measures and better protection for historic landmarks. "The Rosa Parks apartment is a national treasure and should be treated as such," said civil rights leader Angela Davis. "We need to do everything we can to protect our history and ensure that future generations can learn from it." The criminals responsible for the recent theft and vandalism have yet to be caught. Local police are investigating the case and have asked anyone with information to come forward. "The theft and vandalism of the Rosa Parks apartment is a crime against our history and our community," said Montgomery Police Chief James Smith. "We are committed to finding those responsible and ensuring that justice is served."
