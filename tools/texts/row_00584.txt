article: England earned a shot at gold as they reached the final of the Commonwealth Games team event with a hard-fought 3-0 win over India. Chris Adcock played a key part in the victory, featuring in two doubles successes, while Rajiv Ouseph claimed a singles win, but victory was far from straightforward. England faltered in all three rubbers but eventually pulled through to book a final clash with defending champions Malaysia at the Emirates Arena. Key player: Chris Adcock and his wife Gabrielle put in an important performance, as they often do for England, to help guide their country to a final against Malaysia . Adcock and wife Gabby laid the platform for victory as they overcame Akshay Dewalkar and Jwala Gutta 2-1. Yet after powering through the first game 21-16 and opening up a 15-8 lead in the second, the world's fifth-ranked pair were made to scrap by the newly formed Indian partnership. At one point the Indians won seven points in a row, enabling them to level the game at 16-16 and then take it 21-16. Gutta's unusual forehand serve proved particularly problematic and she later claimed the English pair 'hate playing me'. But it proved a mere scare and the Adcocks powered home 21-11 in the third. Ouseph, ranked 27, then overcame world number 22 Kashyap Parupalli 21-16 21-19 for a vital win, but he too had alarms, noticeably in losing eight out of 10 points in one run in the first game. He also surrendered a three-point lead in the second before edging back ahead. Adcock and Andy Ellis then completed the job with a 2-1 men's doubles win over Dewalkar and Pranaav Chopra, but only after coming from behind in another energy-sapping encounter. One rally in the second game contained 82 strokes as both sets of players pushed hard, but ultimately England prevailed 12-21 21-13 21-16. The final game was tense when locked at 14-14 but England edged ahead at the crucial moment and were mobbed by joyous, flag-draped team-mates as victory was clinched. Malaysia went through earlier in the day after a nail-biting 3-2 success over Singapore. Victory came down to the final game of the last rubber and was eventually secured by mixed doubles pair Peng Soon Chan and Lai Pei Jing. VIDEO Commonwealth Games: Day 4 review .
