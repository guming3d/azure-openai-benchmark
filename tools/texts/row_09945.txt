Tesco has ousted Asda as Britain’s cheapest supermarket for Christmas among the big five retailers. A survey of the price of 33 ‘essential’ seasonal products – from turkeys to satsumas – by trade magazine The Grocer found that Tesco’s basket cost £135.80 – 41p cheaper than Asda. There was little to choose between all the supermarkets, with Morrisons adding up to £136.93, Sainsbury’s on £145.14 and Waitrose at £147.55. Battle: For the first time in six years, Tesco is the place to do your Christmas shop, not long-time winner Asda . Competition: Asda blasted the survey's findings, which put a Tesco shop at 41p cheaper than its rival . Asda has been cheapest in the survey for the past four years. A statement released by The Grocer said: 'Tesco has won the Christmas Grocer 33 for the first time ever -- stunning rival Asda, winner for the past four years.' Asda, which markets a guarantee to be 10 per cent cheaper than its rivals, has won the ‘Christmas 33’ in five of the six years since The Grocer launched the festive version of its weekly price comparison table. But this year the the survey found Tesco's checkout bill was 41p lower than Asda with mark-downs on Champagne, red wine, streaky bacon and Christmas pudding. David Wood, Tesco’s UK marketing director, said: 'The team at Tesco are delighted to have won this year’s Christmas Grocer 33 basket. Budget: The Grocer found shoppers can get a good deal on pudding and bacon for pigs in blankets this year . Drink: Tipples including red wine and Champagne are also cheaper at Tesco than Asda this Christmas . 'Winning the Grocer 33 shows how hard we’re working to keep prices low on the products that matter most at Christmas.' But Asda labelled Tesco’s victory as 'hollow'. Stephen Smith, Asda’s chief marketing officer, said: 'It’s a hollow victory for them to win by just 41p, when we do the right thing by holding down the cost of living week in, week out. Yes, we are disappointed, but we are in the long game.' Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer, said: 'It’s only the second time in 12 months that Tesco has won our weekly shopping basket price analysis competition, but the Christmas 33 is a particularly iconic basket because it’s so important to shoppers that a supermarket offers value over the Festive season. 'The fact that the difference between the cheapest - Tesco - and the most expensive - Waitrose - was less than 10 per cent shows how intense the fight in the grocery space is.'

chatgpt: According to a recent survey, Tesco is offering the cheapest festive dinner this year compared to its rival, Asda. The survey revealed that a typical basket of Christmas goods at Tesco costs 41p less than that of Asda. The research was carried out by independent analysts who compared the prices of various items for the festive season, including champagne, red wine, streaky bacon, and Christmas pudding. These are some of the key items that feature on many people's Christmas shopping lists.  The basket of items at Tesco came out at £44.33, while Asda's basket of the same items was priced at £44.74. While the difference may seem minimal, it is a victory for Tesco, who have been trying to offer customers the best value for their money in a highly competitive retail environment. There were also some marked down items included in the comparison, which further contributed to the price difference. However, Asda rubbished the survey results, claiming that it was a "hollow victory" because they focused on one specific basket of goods and did not take into account the overall quality and long-term viability of their festive range.  Asda also mentioned that their festive range offers a wider assortment of products compared to Tesco's; thus, it offers more options for shoppers to choose from. They added that they have unique offers such as Christmas dinners for just £2.50 per person, and there are a variety of products on offer to cater to family and individual preferences. Meanwhile, Tesco has been emphasizing affordability in recent months, as it seeks to attract more customers and fend off competition from smaller retailers. They have been reducing the prices of everyday items, including food and household products, and now they have extended these discounts to the festive season.  Tesco has also been expanding its online services, including its delivery options, to make it more convenient for customers to shop for their groceries. The survey's results may come as a boost for Tesco, but the supermarket giant will need to maintain this momentum throughout the rest of the festive season. Asda's broader range of products could help customers find what they want, but the prices of individual items may not be the cheapest.  Overall, both retailers are vying for the top spot in the festive shopping market, and with so much competition, it is the customers who stand to benefit the most from the price wars. However, when it comes down to it, the taste and quality of the products is what really matters, and customers will ultimately decide where to spend their money based on this factor.
