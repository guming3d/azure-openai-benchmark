These curious living trees have fused together into bizarre contortions both by accident and design. Thanks to bean farmer Axel Erlandson from California, who pioneered the art of weaving and pruning trees together, we have the basket-shaped and arch-shaped trees from his collection of 'circus trees'. The rest occur naturally in a phenomenon known as inosculation, when one tree bonds to another. Axel Erlandson sculpted this single tree into an arch design in a secret method that had not yet been replicated . The Basket Tree, one of Erlandson's rare circus trees, was woven together from six separate sycamore trees . Taking many years to gently shape, graft and prune the trees, Erlandson created the odd trees, starting with his 'Four Legged Giant' creation - four trees which he grew into a single truck creating a gazebo effect in the middle. The basket effect tree required 42 separate connections between six sycamore trees in a secret configuration that no one else has yet been able to replicate. Erlandson started off the sculptures as a way to entertain his family but by the time of his death, he had a collection of 74 of these circus trees. He was inspired by nature as he noticed the elegance of trees weaving together on his farm. Some trees are capable of creating unintentional art without any help from horticulturalists .

chatgpt: Inosculation, the phenomenon of trees bonding together, has been the focus of much attention in the scientific community. It is a rare occurrence that few have witnessed in their lifetime, yet it can result in some of the most beautiful and intriguing natural structures. One such example of inosculation is the work of pioneering gardener Axel Erlandson. Erlandson was known for his ability to shape trees into unique and curious designs, a talent which he developed during his years as a farmer in the 1920s and 1930s.  Erlandson's most famous creation is the "Circus Tree," which was made up of a group of sycamores that were meticulously pruned and trained to form various shapes and patterns. One of the most impressive aspects of the Circus Tree is that it was created without the use of any nails or other substances that could have damaged the tree. Erlandson's designs are a testament to the beauty and adaptability of trees. He believed that, with patience and care, trees could be shaped into a variety of different forms, from spirals and hoops to loops and squares. His work has inspired a new generation of tree sculptors, who are exploring the possibilities of inosculation and the unique structures that can be created through this natural process. While Erlandson may have been one of the first to explore the art of tree shaping, inosculation is a phenomenon that has been observed in many different types of trees and environments. In some cases, two or more trees will grow into each other, creating a single trunk that is made up of several different branches. This can result in a tree that is stronger and more resilient than its individual parts, as the bonding process allows the trees to share nutrients and resources. Despite its beauty and potential benefits, inosculation is still a relatively unknown phenomenon. Many people are unaware of the ways in which trees can bond together and the incredible structures that can result from this process. However, as more individuals like Axel Erlandson and his followers continue to explore the art of tree sculpting, perhaps inosculation will become more widely appreciated and embraced for the natural wonder that it is.
