article: Trying to reduce the time their children spend on laptops and smartphones is a constant worry for parents. But perhaps they should encourage them to remain glued to their devices, as computer scientists have emerged as the top-earning graduates. According to figures of graduate salaries, computer scientists from Oxford receive the most lucrative pay packets after graduating, earning an average of £43,895 six months after leaving university. Computer scientists from Oxford University (pictured), have emerged as the top-earning graduates . Google co-founder Larry Page (pictured) studied computer science at Stanford University - he is now worth $31.7billion . Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg read computer science at Harvard and is now worth $33.1b . The figure is almost four times that of graduates in drama, dance and cinematics from Essex University, the lowest earners on just £11,963. Professor Michael Wooldridge (pictured) attributed the success of his graduates to an 'uncompromising insistence on mathematical clarity' Famous graduates of computer science include Google co founder, Larry Page, and Facebook co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg. Professor Michael Wooldridge, head of the computer science department at Oxford University, told Sian Griffiths, of the Sunday Times: 'Ultimately, our students are trained to think clearly, rigorously and deeply about complex problems.' 'Computers are the future and computer science courses command a salary premium', agreed Professor Alan Smithers, of Buckingham University. The tables also highlight the growing gap between the highest and lowest earning graduates and found that one in 10 had not got a job six months after leaving university. Graduates in computer science from Imperial College London and Cambridge also feature in the top 10 for earnings. Science degrees are increasingly the path to higher earnings, the figures reveal, with engineering, medicine, veterinary science and dentistry all performing well. Arts subjects fare far less well. Elsewhere, the figures show there is a significant difference in pay depending on which university students attend. Graduates in accounting and finance from Huddersfield received an average of £16,335, while students reading the same subject at Bath earned £29,588.

chatgpt: Computer science graduates from Oxford University have the highest graduate salaries among all other courses, earning an average of £43,895 six months after leaving university, according to new figures. The data reveals that this figure is almost four times higher than those who graduated in drama and dance from Essex, who earn an average of just £11,472 within the same time frame. The study, conducted by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), also found that science degrees are increasingly the path to higher salaries. The report shows that graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, otherwise known as STEM subjects, are the most likely to earn higher wages after completing their degrees. The findings will come as a relief to graduates and prospective students who are considering career prospects long-term. With student debts, housing costs, and living expenses, it is understandable that many students are keen to pursue courses that offer high earning potential after graduation. While the report does not provide an exact reason for the higher salaries earned by computer scientists from Oxford, it does suggest that the high reputation of the university could be a significant factor. Graduates from prestigious universities often have an advantage in the labor market, and this could translate into higher salaries. Oxford's prestige, coupled with the demand for IT skills in today's digital economy, could be behind the higher salaries earned by computer science graduates. The report highlights a growing demand for STEM subjects, with the government continuously pushing for an increase in graduates in these fields. Previous research has shown that the UK is experiencing a significant skills shortage in science and technology industries. As technology advances and industries evolve, it is expected that the demand for STEM graduates will continue to grow. In conclusion, the latest HESA study confirms that computer science graduates from Oxford University have the highest graduate salaries among all courses, with a significant gap between these graduates and those from other disciplines. Science degrees, in general, are steadily becoming a popular choice for students looking to secure higher salaries in the long run. It becomes increasingly essential for universities to examine ways to support the development and emergence of STEM education to meet the demands of the modern economy. However, with the ongoing pandemic, it is difficult to predict how long-term the trend will continue.
