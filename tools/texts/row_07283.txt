article: Indian families have been instructed to ensure their future son-in-laws can provide an indoor lavatory before marrying off their daughters. The ‘no toilet, no bride’ campaign has been launched by the government after it emerged that that more people have a mobile phone contract than access to a toilet. The instructions were given by the country's Minister for Rural Development, Jairam Ramesh, who recently angered religious groups by claiming India has more Hindu temples than indoor bathrooms. More loos: Jairam Ramesh has launched the 'no toilet, no bride' campaign in order to improve the sanitary conditions for the Indian population . Over 75 per cent of the 1.2 billion population currently have a mobile phone subscription. In comparison, only 50 per cent of households have a lavatory and 11 per cent have one connected to the sewerage system, according to the 2011 census. This has led to Mr Ramesh calling on families to not only consult astrology when deciding the perfect match for their daughters, but also to check if the potential husband has an indoor toilet, the Daily Telegraph reports. ‘You consult astrologers about rahu-ketu (the alignment of sun and moon) before getting married. 'You should also look whether there is a toilet in your groom's home before you decide. Don't get married in a house where there is no toilet,' he warned during a speech to villagers in Rajasthan. Preferring phones: Half of Indian households have access to an indoor lavatory whilst 75 per cent of the population owns a mobile phone . Earlier this year Mr Ramesh branded India the ‘world’s largest open-air toilet’ saying that 60 per cent of the people in the world who carry out their business in the open, live in India. Speaking at the launch of an ‘eco-lavatory’ in June, Mr Ramesh said the country should be ashamed of this and that ‘even countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan have better records.’ Brindeshwar Pathak, founder of the sanitation charity Sulabh International called on the government to offer cheap loans to help families build lavatories and to make defecating in the open a punishable offence. As well as a sanitary issue, the lack of proper bathroom facilities is a security risk for Indian women as tradition begs them to rise before dawn to go to the toilet. This has led to a number of cases where women have been raped or assaulted whilst searching for somewhere to go to the lavatory under cover of darkness.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted in India has revealed some shocking statistics about the nation's living standards. While the country boasts the world's second-largest mobile phone market, with 1.2 billion mobile phone users, only half of Indian households have access to an indoor toilet. This comparison highlights the stark reality of the nation's socio-economic divide. According to the study, around 75% of Indians, which amounts to 900 million people, have a mobile phone contract, compared with just 50% of households that have access to indoor toilets. In some rural areas, open defecation is still a common practice, and the lack of access to clean sanitation facilities contributes to the spread of diseases and infections. The findings have raised serious concerns about India's sanitation infrastructure and the government's efforts to provide basic facilities to its citizens, especially those living in rural areas. Despite the government's efforts to improve public health and sanitation, the progress appears to be slow and insufficient to meet the growing demand for basic amenities. The study also highlighted the socio-economic gap in the country, with many households, especially those in rural areas, lacking the basic amenities that are considered standard in most developed countries. While the government has initiated several schemes and programs to address the issue, the situation calls for a more comprehensive and sustained effort to bridge the gap. The study's author said that while the government has invested heavily in developing infrastructure, such as highways and airports, the issue of basic amenities needs more attention. The author added that the lack of access to clean sanitation facilities has a direct impact on the growth and development of the country, and it needs to be addressed urgently. The study has sparked a debate in the country, with many questioning the priorities of the government and the adequacy of the resources allocated to address basic issues such as sanitation. Some experts have called on the government to take the issue more seriously and prioritize the development of basic amenities. In conclusion, the study's findings reveal a significant gap in the country's living standards, and the lack of access to clean sanitation facilities is a pressing issue that needs immediate attention. The government needs to take a more comprehensive and sustained approach to address this issue and ensure that all citizens have access to basic amenities. It is hoped that the study's findings will serve as a wake-up call for the government and lead to positive action in addressing the issue.
