The images were released in response to the recent Cosmetic Surgery Review, which looked into the safety of cosmetic surgery procedures across the UK. MYA Cosmetic Surgery has seen an increase in clients in recent years, with many people opting for surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures to enhance their appearance.

In response to these concerns, the Cosmetic Surgery Review was established to examine the current state of cosmetic surgery and to suggest ways to improve the industry. The review's report highlighted a number of issues, including a lack of regulation and training for practitioners, and the need for better communication between patients and surgeons. MYA Cosmetic Surgery was one of the clinics that responded to the review, and they have sought to reassure their clients that they take their safety seriously. In addition to releasing pictures of their clients, they have also stressed the importance of choosing a qualified and experienced practitioner for cosmetic surgical procedures. The release of these images has sparked a lot of debate, with some people questioning the ethics of using former clients' images in this way.

In conclusion, MYA Cosmetic Surgery's decision to release images of their clients has generated a lot of discussion about the safety of cosmetic surgery procedures and the role of qualified practitioners.
