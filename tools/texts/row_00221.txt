article: By . Sam Creighton . Christian monuments have been destroyed by the Chinese government in a move that will fuel fears of a state sponsored crackdown on the religion. On Saturday, fifty officials blocked entry to Longgang Hill, in the city of Wenzhou - know as China's Jerusalem - a site of pilgrimage for the country's Christians. They used cranes to rip up statues and built walls around three others - depicting Jesus, the Virgin Mary and Saint Jospeh - which weigh up to five tonnes each. There were no clashes with worshipers, as government workmen kept a promise not to damage the three bricked-off statues. Four bulldozers started demolishing Sanjiang church in Wenzhou on Monday, after six weeks of protests . The torn up monuments are being stored at a church property in Hengdaiqiao, a Wenzhou suburb, but all other relgious decoration on the hilltop park was destroyed. The authorities are claiming the construction of the park was illegal but Christians say this is just a pretext to justify their persecution. Joseph, a Wnnzhou Catholic who declined to give his full name for security reasons, told UCA News: 'Even if the authorities determined that erecting religious articles on the site is against the law, they should allow us to appeal through legal means. This could help build the rule of law in society and stop corruption.' Another anonymous witness to the destruction said: 'About 100 Catholics who came to watch the removals were blocked at the entrance. Some who managed to sneak in sang hymns and prayed while watching. Some could not hold back their tears.' Two days later, bulldozers were sent in to demolish the city's Sanjiang Church, which was only completed last year at a cost of Â£2.84million. The church's destruction is the end of a six-week-long struggle which had seen thousands of Christians camped outside the building in a bit to save it. UCA News also reported that last week, state officals beat up four Christians who were trying to prevent the demolition of a four-storey building, owned by a Catholic laymen. The authorities claimed that the building's top two floors had been built illegally and that it was being used as a site for underground worship.

chatgpt: In the city of Wenzhou, located in the eastern province of Zhejiang, there has been a recent controversy over the destruction of statues on Longgang Hill, a popular pilgrimage site. Government officials claim that the statues were removed due to the buildings' illegal status, but many Christians in the area are viewing it as a targeted attack on their faith. Longgang Hill has been a historical landmark for centuries, drawing in tourists and pilgrims alike with its temples and ornate statues. However, on a recent morning, visitors were shocked to find that many of the beloved religious statues had been destroyed, triggering outrage from many who believe that it was an act of religious persecution. The government, on the other hand, has stated that the buildings and statues were illegally constructed and have no legal status. A spokesman for the government stated that "These illegal buildings not only violate the land development law but also pose a risk to public safety." The spokesperson went on to explain that the demolition was part of a wider effort to root out illegal construction in the area. While this explanation may be valid in the eyes of the law, many Christians in the area are calling it an attack on their faith. This incident comes only a few weeks after the demolition of a church in the same province. The Sanjiang Church was destroyed by the authorities after six weeks of protests by its congregants, who were fighting to save the building from demolition. This series of events has sparked concern amongst Christian communities in China, who fear that the government may be cracking down on the religion. China's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but the government remains wary of the potential for religious groups to challenge its authority. Many have taken to social media to express their sadness and anger at the loss of the statues at Longgang Hill. "The destruction of the statues is an act of cultural vandalism," said one user on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform. "It's a disgraceful act against Chinese culture, history, and heritage." The debate over the legality of the buildings and statues at Longgang Hill will likely continue to play out in the coming weeks. However, for many Christians in the area, the destruction is seen as an attack on their faith and a cause for concern about the freedoms of religious groups in China.
