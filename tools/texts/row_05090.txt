article: Brazil's win over Colombia was an ill-tempered affair and was notable for both teams trying to stop the other side’s No 10. Neymar and James Rodriguez were both targeted. You could see the teams almost using a ‘rotational fouling’ tactic. Players would put in a tackle on the star man and then let somebody else make the next one. By taking it in turns, it becomes less obvious to the referee when players accumulate fouls. Attacked: Neymar (left) and James Rodriguez were consistently fouled by opposition players . Tough: Rodriguez is tackled by Fernandinho, who marshaled him for the entire game on Friday . Out of action: Brazil's team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said Neymar will be out for four-to-six weeks . VIDEO We'll cope with Neymar loss - Bernard . Brazil's game against Colombia set the tournament record for fouls with 54, with Neymar and James Rodriguez coming in for rough treatment. Neymar in particular was the victims of ‘rotational fouling’ - where players take it in turns to foul the opposition. It worked a treat too, none of the culprits were booked. And Colombia weren’t the only ones to target Neymar - Chile shared tackling duties over 90 minutes in their last 16 tie.

It’s not a common tactic, but it would not be unusual for teams to have that in their locker. With somebody like Neymar, it becomes easier to get away with cumulative fouls because he pops up all over the pitch. A defender can be more physical, knowing it’s unlikely that they will come into contact with Neymar again soon. In that quarter-final the referee seemed to have left his cards at home. Because of that leniency, we have been denied the chance to watch the brilliance of Neymar. Rodriguez came in for similar treatment and took more evasive action than Neymar, who looked to stay on his feet. I wondered how long it would take for Fernandinho to get booked, but the card never came. Instead it was Rodriguez himself who was cautioned after just one foul. Referees have a duty to protect players. They seem to be more lenient in this tournament and so it has become possible to stop the stars with clever tactical fouling.

chatgpt: Neymar and James Rodriguez, two of the biggest names in football, were once again the subjects of controversial on-field tactics during their latest matches. Reports from both games suggest that the duo were the targets of a "rotational fouling" tactic. Players are thought to be rotating fouling duties, with the aim of harassing the duo as much as possible. Neymar, in particular, was consistently targeted throughout the match, as his ability to pop up all over the field made it easier for players to rotate their fouling tactics. What is most concerning is that it appears as though players are getting away with cumulative fouls on Neymar, simply because they are able to rotate their fouling duties. This is a worrying trend, as the constant fouling of players can seriously hamper their ability to perform at their best, and even put their careers at risk. Meanwhile, James Rodriguez was also fouled consistently throughout his latest match. However, the Colombian was booked after only one indiscretion, which suggests that referees are becoming more aware of these tactics, and are trying to clamp down on them. Rodriguez's booking is a welcome development, as any attempt to curb this sort of behaviour is important for the future of the game. However, more needs to be done to ensure that players are not targeted in this way, and that their safety is protected while they are on the field. Many fans have taken to social media to express their frustration at these tactics, with some even calling for a crackdown on rotational fouling. Some have suggested that stronger punishments are needed, such as longer suspensions for players who engage in this sort of behaviour. What is clear is that something needs to be done to stop these tactics from becoming a regular feature of the game. While there is no doubt that football is a physical sport, there is a difference between playing aggressively and engaging in dangerous play that puts players at risk. The onus is on referees and football authorities to ensure that players are protected and that the game is played in a fair and safe manner. Whether this involves tighter rules and regulations, or simply a more proactive approach from officials, something needs to be done to prevent any more players from being unfairly targeted and injured on the field. Overall, it is clear that the issue of rotational fouling is one that needs to be addressed urgently. While it may seem like a small issue, the cumulative effect on players can have serious consequences, both for their health and their careers. Fans, players, and the football authorities all have a responsibility to come together and take action to prevent this sort of behaviour from becoming the norm in the game.
