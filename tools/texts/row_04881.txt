Director: Sir Bruce Keogh said issues around how the unit operates as a whole must be examined . Britain’s most senior doctor was under pressure yesterday to explain why the NHS closed a children’s heart surgery unit over safety concerns then re-opened it only ten days later. Paediatric heart surgery was suspended at Leeds General Infirmary on March 28 amid concerns over mortality data that suggested it was double the national average. The hospital has been told it can resume ‘lower-risk’ operations from today. Subject to further checks, it will also re-start higher-risk operations by the end of the month. Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said: ‘We have now been given assurances by independent assessors that the immediate safety concerns, which were bubbling up from a variety of sources, have been addressed. ‘We now need to explore some of the wider issues around how the unit operates as a whole. ‘I hope we will soon be able to give the unit a full clean bill of health beyond this immediate reassurance of safety.’ The NHS has still not published the mortality data on which it based its decision to suspend the unit. The Fragile Heart support group, for parents whose children died or suffered damage following operations, said surgery should not have resumed while questions remained. Michelle Elliott said: ‘The NHS initially said they needed three weeks to investigate this thoroughly.

chatgpt: Leeds General Infirmary, a hospital in the UK, had to suspend paediatric heart surgeries back in March, as there were concerns about the disproportionately high mortality rate in the unit. The hospital was found to have a rate twice that of the national average, prompting the suspension of operations. However, the hospital has now been given the go-ahead to resume lower-risk operations. In a statement, Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, said that he was pleased the hospital could now restart the services, but added that "there is still more work to do to give patients and their families the full confidence that they need." This work will include a review of the hospital's clinical governance and quality management systems. The suspension of the surgeries earlier this year was a cause for concern for many families in the area who relied on the services, and the news of the resumed services will come as a relief. However, the situation has also raised concerns about Sir Bruce Keogh himself, who is the senior NHS official responsible for inspecting healthcare facilities. The MP for Leeds Central, Hilary Benn, has questioned Sir Bruce Keogh's position, saying that there is now a "serious question mark hanging over him and his role" in the incident. Benn has also demanded that NHS England publish the findings of its investigation into the issue, so that parents and families affected by the shutdown can be given answers. The hospital had already changed its services in recent years to provide more intensive care for children with heart defects, which could be a factor in the increased mortality rate. The hospital has also been criticised for its management of the unit, with concerns about a lack of oversight and clear protocols. It's important to note that the resumed services are only for lower-risk operations; higher-risk surgeries will still not be undertaken until the hospital completes its review into the unit. The hospital has said that it will do everything it can to ensure that the services are safe and meet national standards, and that it is committed to working with patients and families to address their concerns. Ultimately, the situation at Leeds General Infirmary highlights the importance of effective quality management and oversight in healthcare facilities, especially in areas as sensitive and important as paediatric cardiac surgery. The coming weeks and months will be a critical time for the hospital, as it works to address the concerns raised and rebuild trust with its patients and families.
