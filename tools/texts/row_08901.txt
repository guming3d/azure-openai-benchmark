article: Britain’s net value has doubled in less than two decades to a record £7.6trillion, it emerged today. The total wealth is equivalent to £119,000 for every person or £289,000 for every family in the country. And we are a nation of homeowners, with the value of houses accounting for almost two-thirds of the entire net worth of the UK. Since 1997 the total net wealth of the nation has risen from around £3trillion to £7.6trillion in 2013 . The eye-watering sums were revealed in the latest National Balance Sheet, published today. It shows that the total value of everything in the UK more than doubled between 1997 and the end of 2013. The value of Britain has risen steadily every year, with the exception of the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009. The ONS said: ‘At the end of 2013, the UK was valued at an estimated £7.6 trillion, an increase of 4 per cent (£324 billion) from 2012, which continued the long-term upward pattern.’ Homes and charities were worth £8.46trillion alone, with the debts of businesses and the government reducing the total national wealth . The value of non-financial assets, which range from houses and cars to cattle and fine art, rose by £343 billion, while net financial assets and liabilities decreased in value by £19 billion. The combined wealth of households and non-profit organisations such as churches, charities and trade unions was a net £8.5 trillion, up from £7.6trillion in 2012. This was equivalent to an average of £320,000 per household. By far the most valuable assets in this sector were houses, worth £4.7 trillion. The value of properties have steadily increased in value in recent years, except for a decrease in 2008. In 2013 their value was estimated at £4.7 trillion, over three times their estimated value in 1997 (£1.4 trillion), without removing the effects of inflation. Between the end of 1997 and the end of 2013, the average house price increased by 234 per cent. The value of other buildings - including warehouses, roads, railways, pipelines, bridges and sports stadiums - increased by £86 billion (5 per cent) to £1.7 trillion. Machinery, transport kit and ICT equipment rose in value by £14billion to £814billion. The value of central government has fallen dramatically in recent years to -£633billion in part caused by rising national debts . Elsewhere insurance, pension and standardised guarantee schemes were worth £3.1 trillion while cash and savings were worth £1.4 trillion. Growing national debt means wiped £158billion off the value of the UK, the amount that the government owes more than it owns in assets. Central government net worth has fallen every year since 2001. Without removing the effects of inflation, central government’s estimated net worth was minus £663 billion at the end of 2013, a decrease of 0.2 per cent on the previous year and over eight times less than its net worth in 2006 (£82 billion).

chatgpt: The United Kingdom's total wealth has risen to a value of £7.6 trillion, a 4% increase from the previous year. This means that the nation's total wealth is equivalent to £119,000 for every person in the country. A large portion of this wealth comes from the value of homes, which are worth a staggering £4.7 trillion, along with £1.4 trillion in cash or savings. The increase in the UK's wealth is a positive sign for the economy and suggests that the country is on the path to recovery after the financial crisis. The rise in property value is one of the main factors behind the increase, as a growing housing market has boosted the overall wealth of the country. Homeowners have also seen the value of their properties rise, leading to an increase in their own personal wealth. The housing market has been on the rise for several years due to factors such as low-interest rates and a shortage of available homes. This has led to an increase in property prices, which has helped to boost the economy. Additionally, the government has implemented several measures to stimulate the market further, such as the Help to Buy scheme, which has helped first-time buyers get onto the property ladder. The rise in the UK's total wealth is not limited to just the housing market. Other areas that have contributed to the increase include the stock market, which has seen a significant increase in value over the past year. This has led to an increase in the value of shares and investments, which has in turn helped to boost the overall wealth of the country. The increase in total wealth is a positive sign for the UK economy, but it is important to note that there are still areas that need improvement. The country's total debt is still high, and there are concerns about the impact of Brexit on the economy. Additionally, there are still issues with income inequality, with many people struggling to make ends meet despite the overall increase in wealth. Overall, the rise in the UK's total wealth is a positive sign for the economy and suggests that the country is on the path to recovery. The housing market and the stock market have both played a significant role in the increase, but there are still areas that need improvement. With the right policies and programs in place, the UK can continue to grow and prosper in the years to come.
