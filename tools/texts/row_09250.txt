chatgpt: Tottenham suffered a surprise defeat against Newcastle United in a game that saw Spurs captain Younes Kaboul criticize his team's performance. The match, which took place on Sunday at White Hart Lane, ended in a 2-1 loss for Tottenham. Speaking after the game, Kaboul highlighted the team's lack of personality as an area in need of improvement. Kaboul was particularly critical of his team's defensive display that allowed Shola Ameobi to score the opening goal for Newcastle. He described the moment as a "blackout" defensively and voiced his disappointment in the team's inability to respond after conceding. "After the equaliser, we looked defeated on the pitch," said Kaboul. The defeat was the latest in a series of disappointing results for Tottenham, who have struggled to find form in recent weeks. They are currently sixth in the Premier League table, with their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season now in serious doubt. Tottenham manager, Tim Sherwood, was also disappointed with his team's performance, but was quick to defend his players. "We weren't great, but it wasn't through lack of effort," he said. "We just weren't good enough in the final third." Despite the loss, Tottenham still have a chance to salvage their season, with crucial games against Southampton and Manchester United coming up in the next few weeks. Kaboul, for his part, is hoping that the team can put in a better performance in those games, and show the kind of personality he believes is lacking. "We need to show more character," he said. "We need to be stronger mentally and fight until the end."
