article: There's been a sharp spike in radiation levels measured in the pipes and containers holding water at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan. But the company in charge of cleaning it up says that only a single drop of the highly contaminated water escaped the holding tanks. Tokyo Electric Power Company  said it is confident it can provide safety for workers dealing with the problem. "We will find out the cause of this issue and make proper counter measures immediately, and continue to make every effort to secure safety of workers," the company said in a statement released Sunday. TEPCO found high radiation readings at the contaminated water storage tanks and pipe Saturday. The four locations are the bottom of three tanks and a pipe connecting tanks in separate area. The highest reading as 1800 millisieverts per hour at the bottom fringe of the tank. 220 and 70 mSv were measured at the bottom of other two tanks. And TEPCO said they found a dried stain under the pipe with 230 mSv/h radiation measurement. One drop of liquid fell when a staff member pressed on insulation material around the pipe. But TEPCO said no contaminated water leak is expected as there were no change in the water level in tanks. The enormous tanks are identical to the container that was announced last week to have leaked 300 tons of highly toxic water and sparking a hike to the threat level to "serious." TEPCO will investigate the cause and look further if there were any leakage. But TEPCO also took issue with reporting by some news outlets that the new radiation levels were high enough to cause death after several hours of exposure. It said the highest levels measured were so-called beta radiation, which quickly dissipates over short distances and is easily shielded through the use of thin sheets of metal and foil. "Since beta radiation is weak and can be blocked by a thin metal sheet such as aluminum, we think that we can control radiation exposure by using proper equipments and cloths," the company added.

chatgpt: High radiation readings were found by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) over the weekend. The energy company released a statement on Saturday announcing that it had recorded high levels of so-called “beta radiation”. Beta radiation, which consists of electrons or positrons, is typically found near nuclear reactors, as well as in nuclear waste and fallout. It has a relatively short range and is easily absorbed by materials such as clothing, skin, and paper. However, it can be harmful if it enters the body via ingestion or inhalation. TEPCO detected the alarming levels of beta radiation during regular checks near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which had a catastrophic meltdown in 2011 following an earthquake and tsunami. The company stated that the highest reading was 900,000 becquerels per liter, which is nearly 7.5 times the legal limit for wastewater discharge. The company noted that it had taken measures to prevent further contamination, such as removing contaminated soil and adding anti-scattering agents to areas around the plant. It stated that it was investigating the source of the radiation, but suggested that it may have originated from contaminated water that had not been properly processed. The incident has reignited concerns about the safety of nuclear power in Japan, which relies heavily on nuclear energy. The Fukushima disaster resulted in over 18,000 deaths, forced over 150,000 people to evacuate their homes, and caused widespread destruction. Although the government has since introduced stricter safety regulations, many people in Japan remain skeptical of the safety of nuclear power. TEPCO’s announcement comes at a particularly sensitive time, as the company is currently seeking permission to discharge millions of liters of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima plant into the Pacific Ocean. The proposal has been met with fierce opposition from local fishing communities, environmental groups, and neighboring countries such as South Korea. The Japanese government has defended the plan, arguing that the water has been treated to remove most of the radioactive contaminants and that discharging it into the sea is the most practical solution. However, TEPCO’s latest findings may further erode public trust in the company’s ability to manage nuclear waste. The government will reportedly hold a meeting to discuss the matter later this month. TEPCO has pledged to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of local residents and the environment, but many remain skeptical of the company’s assurances.
