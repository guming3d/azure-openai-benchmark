article: (CNN) -- A fugitive task force in San Diego Tuesday captured a New Jersey man who is suspected in the death of his 2-year-old daughter, authorities said. The FBI had issued a nationwide manhunt for Arthur Eugene Morgan III, who was charged with homicide in Monmouth County, New Jersey. A tip from authorities in New Jersey led investigators to Morgan, the U.S. Marshals said in a statement. "U.S. Marshals in San Diego received information from New Jersey authorities that Morgan may be staying with friends in East San Diego," the statement said. Authorities will request Morgan's transfer to New Jersey to face the homicide charge, Monmouth County Prosecutor Peter E. Warshaw Jr. said in a statement. On November 22, a group of boys discovered the body of Morgan's daughter partly submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County, officials said. She was strapped into her car seat, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The stream runs beneath an overpass, suggesting that the child, Tierra Morgan-Glover, and the car seat were thrown from the overpass, said Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni. Morgan was supposed to return the child to her mother the night of November 21 following a custody visit, Gramiccioni said. When he didn't return the girl, prosecutors in Ocean County charged him the next morning with endangering the welfare of a child and interfering with child custody. The girl was found dead about 20 hours later, WABC reported. "Although the victim was a small person, our team of investigators is treating this case as if she were one of our own daughters," FBI Public Affairs Officer Bryan Travers told CNN. CNN's Deborah Feyerick and Kendall Green contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A grim development has emerged in the case of a father accused of killing his 2-year-old daughter. Authorities have announced that they will request the transfer of Arthur Eugene Morgan III from San Diego to New Jersey, where his daughter's body was found in a stream last month. Morgan was arrested on Tuesday, but the heartbreaking details of his alleged crimes have only now come to light. According to prosecutors, it appears that Morgan threw his daughter and her car seat from an overpass before driving away. Her body was later discovered in a stream by a group of teenagers who were exploring the area. The news prompted an outpouring of grief and shock from the community, while authorities raced to piece together the timeline of events that led to the girl's tragic death. It is not yet clear what may have motivated Morgan to take such a horrific action. The prosecutor's office in Monmouth County, New Jersey, issued a statement on Thursday detailing their intention to request Morgan's transfer to the state. The statement read, "The Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office will be seeking the defendant’s return to Monmouth County to answer for the charges against him." Morgan is currently being held on $10 million bail in California, and it is not yet clear when he will be transferred to New Jersey. He is facing charges of murder, endangering the welfare of a child, and interfering with custody. The news has understandably rocked the small community where the girl and her family lived. A memorial has been set up by the stream where her body was found, and locals have expressed their support for her grieving family. As this tragic case continues to unfold, many are asking how something like this could happen. For now, all that remains is to mourn the loss of a young life cut brutally short.
