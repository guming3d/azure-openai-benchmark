The test, which analyses a baby’s DNA present in its mother’s blood, could be an improvement on current screening methods, according to researchers. Down’s syndrome, and other chromosomal disorders characterised by an additional chromosome, is currently tested for between the 11th and 13th weeks of a pregnancy, using an ultrasound screen and a hormonal analysis of the pregnant woman’s blood. Those deemed at high risk of carrying a baby with such a disorder are then given a definitive test involving chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. But this is invasive and carries a risk of miscarriage. A study carried out at the Harris Birthright Centre at King’s College London is the first to look at the feasibility of screening for the chromosomal disorders - known as trisomies - using foetal cell free DNA (cfDNA) from a pregnant woman’s blood. The tests, carried out at the 10-week stage on 1,005 pregnancies, were found to be more sensitive at detecting Down’s syndrome and returned fewer 'false positive' results than the initial combined tests usually carried out between the 11th and 13th weeks. Researchers found that up to 98 per cent of cases of Down’s syndrome could be detected. Invasive testing was then needed for confirmation in less than 0.5 per cent of cases. The test costs £400 so will not be offered across the NHS at this stage, but it will initially be offered free of charge on a trial basis at two hospitals - Kings College Hospital in London and Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent. The test will initially be offered free of charge on a trial basis at King's College Hospital, in London (pictured), and Medway Maritime Hospital, in Kent . The authors of the study, published in the Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology journal, said: 'This study has shown that the main advantage of cfDNA testing, compared with the combined test, is the substantial reduction in false positive rate. 'Another major advantage of cfDNA testing is the reporting of results as very high or very low risk, which makes it easier for parents to decide in favour of or against invasive testing.' The authors added: 'Screening by cfDNA testing contingent on the results of an expanded combined test would retain the advantages of the current method of screening, but with a simultaneous major increase in detection rate and decrease in the rate of invasive testing.'

chatgpt: A new non-invasive test that could revolutionize prenatal screening for Down’s syndrome is set to begin trials in hospitals across London and Kent. The study, conducted by researchers at King's College London, looked at screening using foetal cell-free DNA from a woman's blood. The results were promising, with the test detecting 98% of Down's syndrome cases. Currently, screening for Down's syndrome in the UK involves invasive tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, which carry a small but significant risk of miscarriage. Non-invasive tests, which use a sample of the mother's blood, have been available for some time, but their accuracy is limited. This new test, which analyzes foetal DNA circulating in the mother's bloodstream, is expected to offer a more accurate and less risky alternative. The study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research and involved more than 1300 pregnant women. The trial will involve offering the test to women with a higher than average risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome, including women over the age of 35 and those with a previous pregnancy affected by the condition. Dr. Lyn Chitty, a professor of genetics and fetal medicine at King's College London, said: "The test we are using works by detecting fragments of foetal DNA in the mother's blood. By analyzing these fragments, we can determine whether the foetus has Down's syndrome, with a high level of accuracy." If the trial is successful, it is hoped that the non-invasive test will eventually replace the invasive tests currently used to screen for Down's syndrome. Dr. Ilias Goranitis, a senior research fellow at King's College London and lead author of the study, said: "We are very excited to be starting this trial, which represents an important step forward in prenatal screening for Down's syndrome. Our results suggest that this test could offer a more accurate and less risky alternative to existing screening methods." He added: "We will be closely monitoring the outcomes of the trial to see whether the test can be rolled out more widely, and we are optimistic about its potential to improve the lives of expectant mothers and their babies." Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome. It affects approximately one in every 700 babies born in the UK, and is associated with a range of physical and intellectual disabilities. While the condition can be diagnosed prenatally, many women choose not to undergo invasive testing due to the risk of miscarriage. Non-invasive testing, while less risky, can be less accurate. The trial of the new non-invasive test is being carried out at St George's Hospital in London and at the Medway NHS Foundation Trust in Kent. Results are expected to be published in late 2022. If successful, the test could potentially transform prenatal screening for Down's syndrome, offering expectant mothers a safer and more accurate option for detecting the condition.
