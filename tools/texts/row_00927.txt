article: Republicans hoping to secure yet another House victory in their already substantial majority won in the 2014 midterm election are on edge as GOP candidate Martha McSally's lead over incumbent Rep. Ron Barber has dwindled down to a mere 161 votes, a margin small enough to trigger an automatic recount. This will be the state's first-ever congressional recount. Emerging from election night, McSally led Barber by a mere 36 votes. But technical difficulties later triggered a recount for early votes in Cochise County -- a predominantly Republican area -- that gave McSally a slightly greater lead. Weeks later, Barber tried to cut McSally's lead by challenging a decision by election officials to reject 133 votes from two predominantly liberal counties. But on Thursday, a Tucson federal judge denied the request. Team Barber files suit in uncalled House race . The recount procedure in the Arizona is expected to take about two weeks with a final certification -- and presumably a final winner --  determined by Tuesday, December 16. Barber was elected to Congress in 2012 after his boss, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head and severely wounded outside an Arizona supermarket. McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, challenged Barber -- who also suffered two gunshot wounds in the parking lot attack -- for the seat. Barber won his first election with less than 1 percent of the vote in Arizona's second congressional district. The recount procedure in the Arizona is expected to take about two weeks with a final certification -- and presumably a final winner -- determined by Tuesday, December 16. The new House balance of power currently stands at 244 Republicans, 188 Democrats and three districts undecided: Gifford's seat and Louisiana's fifth and sixth congressional district. Republicans have a net gain of at least 10 seats and could have a net gain of up to 13 seats, depending on the outcome of this race, as well as two races in Louisiana.

chatgpt: The race for the former U.S Representative Gabby Giffords' seat has come down to the wire. The incumbent Congressman, Ron Barber, a Democrat from Arizona, is currently trailing behind his Republican opponent Martha McSally by a mere 161 votes.  As of now, the officials in Arizona are going through the complex and arduous process of recounting the votes. The results of the recount are expected to be available by Tuesday, December 16. It is being considered one of the closest races this year, and both parties are closely monitoring the situation. Ron Barber, a former aide to Gabby Giffords, won the special election for her seat in 2012 after she resigned. He faced a stiff competition from Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel and the first woman to fly in combat by US forces.  Both candidates have worked tirelessly to win the seat, and it seems that the recount might level the playing field. The Democratic National Committee has already pledged its support to Barber, and the Republican Party has deployed its top resources to secure McSally's win. Arizona, a traditionally conservative state, has seen a surge of Democratic supporters in recent years, due to a growing Hispanic population and shifting political dynamic.  The outcome of this race will have far-reaching implications, not only for the constituents of Arizona's 2nd district but also for the broader political landscape in the state. If McSally wins, it will be a significant victory for the Republicans and a blow to the Democrats. On the other hand, if Barber manages to stay in the race, it will be a sign of hope for the Democratic Party, especially in the upcoming presidential election. In conclusion, the closely contested race for Gabby Giffords' seat has kept both parties on their toes. The official results of the recount will be out shortly, and it remains to be seen who will emerge victorious in this race.
