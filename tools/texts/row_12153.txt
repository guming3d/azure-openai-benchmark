article: (CNN) -- Royal Ascot's most successful jockey Frankie Dettori won a thrilling Gold Cup on Colour Vision in Thursday's feature race. The 42-year-old sealed his first victory of this year's meeting by leading home a Godolphin one-two, with stablemate Opinion Poll second under Mikael Barzalona. Dettori had decided to switch rides from Opinion Poll, a decision that paid off when his Saeed Bin Suroor-trained gray won by half a length to earn the Italian's fifth victory in the prestigious race and his first since 2004. He is still some way behind the leading 11 victories by the legendary Lester Piggott, but nevertheless has more wins at Royal Ascot than any other jockey. Bin Suroor became only the eighth trainer to claim five Gold Cup victories and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Godolphin matched Sue Magnier's benchmark five for owners. Magnier's part-owned Fame And Glory, the pre-race favorite and the winner last year, finished down the field under Jamie Spencer. Meanwhile, there was more disappointment for England's Queen Elizabeth as her filly Momentary was well beaten in the Ribbesdale Stakes, finishing well back in the field. The race was won in convincing style by Princess Highway, who powered home to win by five lengths. The Queen, wearing mint green on the third day of Royal Ascot -- Ladies' Day -- had earlier taken her customary trip to the parade ring to inspect her filly ahead of the race and exchange a few words with her jockey, Hayley Turner. But Momentary never presented a serious threat and finished third-last in the field of 14 starters. It follows a gallant second place by the Queen's horse Carlton House on Wednesday. The Andrew Lloyd Weber-owned The Fugue -- who was an unlucky third behind Was and Shirocco Star in the Oaks -- finished second, with Shirocco Star this time coming third. The Ribbesdale Stakes for three-year-old fillies featured many of the same fillies who contested the Oaks at Epsom earlier this month.

chatgpt: Frankie Dettori and Colour Vision claimed victory at the prestigious Gold Cup race on Thursday at the Royal Ascot. In doing so, Dettori delivered Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin team's first victory at the race in 15 years. Dettori's decision to switch rides from Opinion Poll, which finished in second place, to ride Godolphin's Colour Vision ultimately paid off. Colour Vision was regarded as an outside chance, but Dettori's faith in the horse paid dividends. The race was run at a blistering pace, and it was clear that the horses that set the early fractions would play a crucial role in the final outcome. The pre-race favorite, Fame And Glory, was expected to contend for the victory, but the horse ultimately finished down the field in sixth place. Despite a strong showing in the early stages of the race, Fame And Glory was unable to maintain the pace set by the leading pack of horses. In the Ribblesdale Stakes, the Queen's filly Momentary finished third-last. It was a lacklustre performance from the filly who had gained attention ahead of the race. However, she was ultimately outclassed by rival horses on the day. Frankie Dettori is no stranger to success at the Royal Ascot, having won a staggering number of 60 races at the prestigious meet. However, winning the Gold Cup race is particularly special to Dettori, who hailed it as "extra special" after a long wait since his last victory in the race. The victory also marks a significant success for Godolphin, which has had a difficult few years at the Royal Ascot. Sheikh Mohammed was overjoyed with the win, describing it as a "great moment" for Godolphin and their loyal followers. Thursday's races at the Royal Ascot proved to be another exhilarating day of competitive horse racing. As always, there were a number of high level performances and surprises, with many punters now eagerly anticipating Friday's races.
