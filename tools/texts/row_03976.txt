chatgpt: The Norwegian Embassy in America has continued its longstanding tradition of gifting a Christmas tree to the United States in recognition of the country's assistance during World War II. This year's tree, which stands tall in Union Station in Washington D.C., is adorned with over 700 ornaments, all commissioned to recognize Norway's most celebrated artist, Edvard Munch. A talented painter and printmaker, Munch is best known for his iconic painting "The Scream." The Norwegian Embassy chose to honor Munch for his contributions to the art world, as 2018 marked the 75th anniversary of his death. The tradition of gifting a Christmas tree to the United States from Norway dates back to 1949. The gesture is a way for Norway to show its gratitude to the United States for its assistance during World War II. A strong relationship between the two countries continues to this day. Each year, the Norwegian Embassy commissions new decorations for the tree as a way to showcase Norwegian craftsmanship and design. This year's ornaments were carefully crafted by local artists in Norway and each one showcases a unique aspect of Munch's artistic style. The tree itself is a majestic sight to behold, towering over visitors who stop to admire it. The Norway spruce was grown in the forests of Norway, specifically for this occasion. It was transported to Washington D.C. in a special container aboard a cargo ship and was carefully unpacked and decorated by embassy officials. The lighting of the tree was a festive affair, with a ceremony that took place at Union Station. The tree was lit by Norwegian Ambassador to the United States, Egeland Harriet. The ceremony was attended by locals and tourists who had gathered to see the lighting of the tree. As the holiday season approaches, the Norwegian Embassy's gift to the United States stands tall as a symbol of gratitude and friendship between two countries that share a rich history. The tree, adorned with ornaments that showcase the life and work of Edvard Munch, is a reminder of the importance of culture and art in bringing people together.
