The Commission for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue, known as Haia, banned the pageant and have reported the women to the local governate, The Saudi Gazette reports.

Shocked at the news of a beauty pageant in Makkah, and the good news about the cancellation and follow up action,’ wrote Ismaeel Marikar. ’The authorities should take serious note and give the maximum punishment.

Such un-Islamic contests should never be held there. Those who investigated the matter and banned the contest are praiseworthy.’ Only one commentator defended Miss Makkah and its organisers: ’ What is the problem? There is no evidence that men would even be present. The article states the event was organized by and for women. 'If women wish to compete among themselves to look pretty or show off their talents and style to eachother, why is this anyone s business? Is it unislamic to look pretty now! How sad.’ Saudi Arabia follows an ultraconservative interpretation of Islam and bans women from a number of day-to-day activities, including driving a car, trying on clothes when shopping and entering a cemetery. Women are also banned from going out in public without a male chaperone, and although King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz passed a law in 2011 that would allow women to vote, it would not come into force until 2015.

chatgpt: In a surprising move by the vice police in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the Miss Makkah beauty pageant has been banned. The four-day pageant had been planned by a group of local women in Mecca and had invited "women of any colour aged between 17 and 27 years" to participate. According to local reports, the vice police took action after receiving complaints from residents who were concerned that the pageant was a violation of the country's strict Islamic values. The ban was quickly praised by many locals, who demanded that the organizers be punished for their attempt to hold the competition. The Miss Makkah beauty pageant was set to be held in a local hotel, with contestants expected to participate in a variety of beauty-related events, including a catwalk competition and a talent show. While the pageant was not officially affiliated with any government agency or organization, it had received some support from local businesses and residents. Despite this support, the vice police deemed the pageant to be a threat to the country's values and traditions. They issued a statement declaring that the competition was "incompatible with the teachings of Islam and the customs and traditions of Saudi society." The statement also warned that anyone caught promoting or participating in the pageant would be subject to punishment under the law. Many locals were quick to voice their approval of the vice police's actions. One resident told local media that the pageant was "an insult to the values of our society" and that the organizers had "no business trying to promote Western-style beauty ideals." Others took to social media to express their views, with many using the hashtag #NoToMissMakkah to voice their opposition to the pageant. Meanwhile, the organizers of the Miss Makkah beauty pageant have not yet commented publicly on the ban. It is unclear whether they plan to challenge the decision or whether they will simply cancel the event altogether. The ban on the Miss Makkah beauty pageant is just the latest example of Saudi Arabia's strict approach to public morality. The country's interpretation of Islam forbids public displays of affection, the consumption of alcohol, and the wearing of revealing clothing. While many Saudis support these laws, others have criticized them as being overly restrictive and limiting personal freedoms. For now, it seems that the Miss Makkah beauty pageant will not be held in Saudi Arabia. Whether this will pave the way for more conservative social policies in the future remains to be seen.
