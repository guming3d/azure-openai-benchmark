article: Diners at a restaurant in China will no longer have to deal with human errors from their waiters. Inspired by the Bots cafe from the US hit shot Sam and Cat, a restaurant owner in China has created an eaterie filled with robots. The cafe in Ningbo, a seaport city in northeastern China's Zhejiang province now has automated waiters who take orders and serve food to any table within the restaurant - and tell customers to enjoy their meal in Mandarin.

The machines navigate their way around with the use of an optical sensing system. Although wages for the robots are non-existent, they still do not come cheap, costing at least £6,000 each. But with a five-year-warranty on each one, and the fact that they only need to be charged four-hours-a-day, the owner Lu Dike, 48, says that in the long-term it will save him a fortune in wages. The machines are a popular draw at the restaurants, with diners wanting to experience being serviced by them. They also have the capability to speak up to 40 phrases in Mandarin Chinese, such as 'enjoy your meal'. Future investment: Each robot costs approximately £6,000 each and comes with a five-year warranty . Diners at the restaurant love the robots so much that they are pressuring the owner to start selling them . Owner Mr Lu is being pressured to put the robots on sale for people to take home. He said: 'I get asked at least once a day if I'm prepared to sell one of them. 'Who knows? Maybe it might be a good sideline.' Customer Xu Yuan, 34, who is interested in purchasing a robot waiter said: 'I really like the service and I think I would really like one at home. 'My son has been pestering me ever since we came here for a snack after a trip to the movies.'

chatgpt: An eatery in Ningbo, a city in northeastern China, is making headlines for taking an innovative approach to staffing: they have replaced human waiters with robots. These automated employees take orders, serve food, and even speak with customers in both Chinese and English.  The restaurant, which has been in operation since 2019, has already gained a reputation for fast service and precision. The robots are equipped with rechargeable batteries and come with a five-year warranty, so they are expected to serve customers well into the future.  Despite the initial excitement and novelty factor, this move towards automation is not unique in China. A variety of industries, from manufacturing to retail, have been embracing technology as a means of increasing efficiency and reducing labor costs.  Some experts warn, however, that relying too heavily on automation can lead to job losses and a further division between rich and poor. This particular restaurant has stated that they still employ people for tasks such as preparing food and maintaining the machines, but it remains to be seen whether they will continue to hire human waitstaff in the long term.  One potential advantage of robot waiters is their ability to work long hours without breaks. This is particularly useful in a country like China, where the labor market is notoriously demanding and work-life balance can be difficult to achieve. However, it is not yet clear whether customers will be comfortable interacting with machines instead of human beings.  The restaurant's co-owner, Li Xianyong, has reported positive feedback from customers so far. One patron, surnamed Wang, told a local news outlet that "the robots are fun to watch and don't get tired like people do". Another customer, surnamed Liu, praised the efficiency and accuracy of the machines.  It remains to be seen whether robot waiters will become a trend in the food service industry or simply a curio for tech enthusiasts. However, the fact that businesses are willing to invest in this technology suggests that there is potential for further innovation in the field of automation. As machines become increasingly advanced and versatile, it may become more difficult to draw a line between what is done by humans and what is done by robots.
