article: (CNN) -- The Marine husband of a slain Fort Bragg soldier was charged with murder Monday and another Marine was charged with aiding the crime, a local police chief said. Fayetteville, North Carolina, police released this undated photo of 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc. Authorities have been searching for the missing soldier, Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc, 24, since a fire torched her North Carolina apartment on July 10. Marine Cpl. John Wimunc and fellow Marine Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden were initially charged with arson, but after police interviews Wimunc was charged with first-degree murder, said Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine. Alden was charged with felony accessory after the fact to first-degree murder, Bergamine said. Both were taken to Cumberland County's jail and held without bond, he said. Earlier, a witness found a charred body in woods, but Detective Jeff Locklear told reporters that police were still awaiting a positive identification from the medical examiner and could not say for certain it was Holley Wimunc. The lieutenant's father released a statement about the death Monday in which he said his daughter was a nurse at a military hospital and had two children. "It is with profound sadness that our family just received the news from authorities that our beloved daughter Holley is dead," Wimunc's father said in a statement released to CNN affiliate WRAL in Raleigh, North Carolina. "Since last Thursday's shocking news about Holley's burned apartment and her missing person status, our family through the country has nonetheless been holding on to a thin thread of hope that she would be found alive." Military officials said both Marines were stationed at Camp Lejeune, which is about two hours away from Wimunc's Fayetteville home. Joe Lenczyk -- resident agent-in-charge for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- said Wimunc and her husband were estranged and lived apart. Wimunc is the second female soldier from Fort Bragg to die under suspicious circumstances in recent weeks. Spc. Megan Lynn Touma, 23, was seven months pregnant at the time of her death in June, authorities said. Investigators say they are treating that death as a homicide. Camp Lejeune also has had a suspicious death of a female soldier this year. Twenty-year-old pregnant Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach's charred body was found January in the back yard of another Marine stationed at the base. That suspect, U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, was captured in April in Mexico.

chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, authorities have charged two military personnel in connection with the murder of 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc. Cpl. John Wimunc, the victim's husband, has been charged with murder while Marine Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden has been charged with arson in connection with the crime. Wimunc, who is also a soldier, was taken into custody on Friday, and Alden was arrested on Saturday. Authorities have been searching for Wimunc since she was reported missing on July 10th. The investigation led to the discovery of her burned remains in a shallow grave in Onslow County, North Carolina on July 14th. The case has garnered attention due to the fact that Wimunc was a member of the military, and her husband is also a soldier. The couple had been married since May of 2008 and were stationed together at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Reports indicate that there may have been marital problems between the couple, and authorities believe that this may have been a factor in Wimunc's murder. While the exact motive for the murder remains unclear, authorities have stated that they believe it was not a random act of violence. The charges against Alden stem from allegations that he set fire to Wimunc's apartment in an attempt to cover up the murder. Authorities have yet to release any additional details on the investigation, and it is unclear whether anyone else will be charged in connection with the crime. The news of Wimunc's murder has sent shockwaves through the military community, and many are calling for justice for the young officer. Wimunc was a well-respected member of the military and had an accomplished career ahead of her. The investigation into Wimunc's death is ongoing, and authorities are urging anyone with information to come forward. The case serves as a tragic reminder of the dangers that members of the military face both at home and abroad. As the investigation continues to unfold, the military community is left reeling from the loss of one of their own. The charges against Wimunc's husband and Alden have left many wondering how such a horrific crime could have happened in their midst.
