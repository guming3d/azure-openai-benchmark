article: Videos purportedly showing guards abusing prisoners, including one male inmate being raped with a broom handle, have led to arrests and outrage both inside and outside the Eurasian country of Georgia. President Mikheil Saakashvili said Wednesday what occurred at Gldani Number 8 penitentiary in Tbilisi is "a horrific affront to human rights and human dignity." Georgia television stations, including TV9, broadcast the videos Tuesday night. The government has not questioned their authenticity. "The police have already arrested most of those identified as involved in these gross abuses," Saakashvili said in a statement. "Others are on the run but (are) being actively pursued by police." The faces of those being filmed were obscured. One man cries out while he is being raped with a broom handle. Another video shows an inmate being punched. The country's interior ministry on Tuesday blamed certain prison employees for the degrading treatment. The ministry said a prisoner at the facility offered "substantial reimbursement" to employees for their actions and the video recordings. Its statement did not elaborate on the prisoner's motivation. The interior ministry identified that prisoner as Tamaz Tamazashvili, father-in-law of Irlakli Garibashvili, a member of the opposition Georgian Dream party. Garibashvili said Tamazashvili's life was in danger and that he was being held "hostage" by the president. Tamazashvili had nothing to do with the taped incidents, Garibashvili said. Georgia's minister of corrections and legal assistance, meanwhile, tendered her resignation. "During my time in the office I tried my best and did everything possible to ensure the protection of human rights and to bring the corrections system, as much as possible, in conformity with the European standards," Khatuna Kalmakhelidze said in a statement. "It seems, however, that this effort was not enough, since such facts have taken place. I am very sorry about what happened and it does not matter who orchestrated these events." Human Rights Watch said Gldani Number 8 has been referred to as one of Georgia's "most problematic prison facilities." "The abuse captured in this footage is profoundly disturbing," said Giorgi Gogia, senior Europe and Central Asia researcher for the organization. "The authorities need to ensure full accountability -- including criminal accountability -- for this abuse and take measures to prevent it from ever happening again."

"Sexual assault on a detainee constitutes torture," Gogia said in a statement. "The prohibition on torture is absolute, and the government should ensure that the justice is done." The U.S. Embassy in Georgia said it was shocked and revolted by the images and noted the government's investigation. "Abuse of prisoners is a serious issue that needs to be addressed," the embassy said in a statement issued Wednesday. "We urge that the government conduct this investigation in a thorough and transparent manner and ensure that all those responsible are brought to justice as soon as possible."

chatgpt: In a stunning development on Wednesday, a prominent politician has come out in defense of his father-in-law, who has been accused of torture and human rights abuses. Meanwhile, the country's Corrections Minister has tendered his resignation amid mounting criticism of his handling of the scandal. According to reports, the allegations against the politician's father-in-law have been circulating for some time, but have only recently come to the public's attention. The individual in question is a former high-ranking official in the country's security apparatus, and is alleged to have overseen numerous instances of torture and abuse while in his previous post. The politician, who is a powerful figure in his own right, has vigorously denied the accusations against his father-in-law, and has issued a statement in which he defends the man as a "patriotic hero" who played a critical role in defending the country's national security interests. The politician also accused his political rivals of using the allegations as a pretext to attack him and his allies. The response from the government has been mixed. While some officials have expressed their support for the politician and his father-in-law, others have been quick to condemn the alleged abuses and have called for a full investigation. The country's Corrections Minister, in particular, has been under significant pressure to take action, given that many of the abuses are said to have taken place within the country's prison system. Amid mounting pressure, the Corrections Minister finally submitted his resignation on Wednesday, acknowledging that he had failed to adequately investigate the allegations of abuse and had not done enough to prevent them from happening in the first place. The move has been welcomed by many human rights activists, who have long criticized the government's response to allegations of torture and abuse. The scandal has also drawn international attention, with the U.S. Embassy releasing a statement that referred to the images of abuse as "shocking and disturbing." The embassy also called on the government to take swift action to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the abuses. For its part, Human Rights Watch has weighed in on the matter, referring to the alleged abuses as "torture" and urging the government to take concrete steps to address the issue. The organization has also called on the international community to raise awareness of the problem and to pressure the government to take action. The allegations of torture and abuse have rocked the country's political landscape and raised serious questions about the government's commitment to human rights and the rule of law. With the resignation of the Corrections Minister and mounting pressure from both domestic and international stakeholders, it remains to be seen what the ultimate outcome of this scandal will be. For now, however, one thing is clear: there is no place for torture and abuse in any government or society, and those responsible for such egregious human rights violations must be held to account.
