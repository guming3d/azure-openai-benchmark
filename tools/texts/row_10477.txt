chatgpt: Manchester United's £28million signing, Luke Shaw, has suffered a significant setback just days before the start of the Premier League season. The 19-year-old left-back picked up a hamstring injury in training on Tuesday, and it is unclear how long he will be sidelined. This injury will come as a blow to Louis van Gaal, who has previously expressed concerns about Shaw's fitness levels. Despite being one of the most promising young talents in English football, the former Southampton player has struggled to maintain his fitness since joining Manchester United last summer. The injury also raises questions about how United will set up for their opening game of the season against Swansea on Saturday. Van Gaal has been experimenting with different formations and tactics throughout pre-season, but he may now be forced to reshuffle his defence. United have a number of options to cover for Shaw, including Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, and Ashley Young. However, none of these players offer the same attacking threat that Shaw does from the left-back position. Shaw's injury is the latest blow for a United squad that has already been hit hard by injuries in pre-season. The likes of Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones, and Chris Smalling have all missed significant amounts of time, leaving Van Gaal with a depleted squad. Despite these setbacks, United will still be looking to start the season on a positive note. Last season was a disappointing one for the club, as they finished outside of the Champions League places for the second year in a row. Van Gaal will be hoping that his new signings, including Memphis Depay, Bastian Schweinsteiger, and Morgan Schneiderlin, can help the team improve on last season's performances. Shaw's injury will be a blow to those hopes, but United will be hoping that he can make a swift recovery and return to the pitch as soon as possible. For now, Van Gaal will have to turn to his other options as United aim to get off to a winning start against Swansea on Saturday.
