chatgpt: Devon, a picturesque county situated in South West England, is currently the most searched-for place by people looking for a plot of land to build on. This news comes as part of a recent survey that studied the UK's land search trends. The Scottish Highlands, known for its rugged landscapes and picturesque views, came in second place in the list of most searched-for places for land. However, the list is otherwise dominated by the South of England, where several counties such as Surrey, East Sussex, and Kent, have attracted would-be land investors. The survey also revealed that approximately seven million people are looking to buy a plot of land to build their dream home. Despite the challenges, more and more people are opting for self-builds and considering this alternative to buying an existing property. Budding house builders are attracted to the idea of building their own home to get exactly what they want, with the added benefit of creating a property that is unique and tailored to their needs. The trend of self-builds has been growing in recent years, mainly due to the increasing costs of buying properties in the UK. With soaring house prices deterring many from buying a pre-existing home, a self-build can be a more affordable option for those looking to invest in a property of their own. Many people are also attracted to self-builds due to their eco-friendliness. Building a home from scratch allows for more sustainable materials to be used, creating a more environmentally-friendly property. As such, self-builds are often seen as a way to combine affordability, practicality, and an eco-friendly lifestyle. The survey indicates that buying land to build on is becoming an increasingly popular choice among young people, families, and first-time buyers. Being able to design your own home and create something truly unique is a significant pull factor. Moreover, building a new property also decreases the amount of money spent on maintenance, as everything from the plumbing to the electric system is new. Overall, the survey's results indicate that self-building is likely to remain a popular trend, and as more people look to invest in a home, demand for land plots is expected to grow. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Devon is the most searched-for place in the UK for a plot of land, having been known for its stunning scenery and ideal climate; it is the perfect location for those looking to build their ideal home in a stunning setting.
