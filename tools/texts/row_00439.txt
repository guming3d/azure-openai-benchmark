article: (CNN) -- He has been at his side for all three of Rory McIlroy's major wins, but Sunday's British Open triumph may well have been the sweetest yet for the Northern Irishman's father Gerry. McIlroy's three-stroke victory at Hoylake ensured a wager placed by his dad a decade ago finally came to fruition. While working as a bar steward in Belfast in 2004, McIlroy senior placed a £200 ($340) bet, at odds of 500/1, with British bookmakers Ladbrokes that his 15-year-old son would win the British Open before he turned 26. And on Sunday, in the final edition of the tournament before the bet expired, a 25-year-old Rory rewarded his father's confidence by making him £100,000 ($170,000) richer. The new world No. 2 also cost Ladbrokes a further £80,000 ($136,000) in similar bets placed by Gerry's friends. According to British newspaper The Guardian, they placed £200, at odds of 250/1, that Rory would win the British Open within 10 years. Another £100 ($170) was laid on at 150/1 that he would lift the Claret Jug before turning 50. Rory also secured some cash off the back of a bet placed over the weekend, earning £20 ($34) off Darren Clarke after beating his compatriot during a practice round on Wednesday. He secured his third major -- following the U.S. Open in 2011 and U.S. PGA Championship in 2012 -- with a two-shot victory ahead of Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler. The Northern Irishman is the third player, after Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, to win three majors by the age of 25, while he is just a Masters victory away from completing a career grand slam of golf's top honors. Gerry, a regular at his son's tournaments, is a director of Rory McIlroy Inc -- a company created to run Rory's affairs following his split from the Horizon group. He embraced his son on the 18th green after he landed the 2011 U.S. Open on Father's Day, the first major triumph of his career.

chatgpt: In a stroke of luck and foresight, Gerry McIlroy has won a £100,000 payout thanks to his son Rory's victory at the British Open on Sunday. 10 years ago, Gerry placed a £200 bet on Rory winning the Claret Jug before he turned 26, which has now come to fruition as the world No. 2 claimed his third major at Hoylake at the age of 25.  The bet was a calculated risk for Gerry, who clearly had faith in his son's golfing abilities. Back in 2004, Rory was just a promising amateur, but Gerry had an inkling that his son had the potential to become a world-class player. Rory's early success vindicated his father's belief, with multiple major championships and a considerable fortune earned on the PGA Tour. While £100,000 may be a drop in the ocean compared to Rory's own earnings, it is still a significant sum for most people. Gerry's win is a reminder of the unpredictable nature of sports betting – sometimes, a long-term gamble can pay off, even against steep odds.  Rory celebrated his victory with his family, including Gerry and mother Rosie, who have been his constant supporters throughout his career. The Northern Irishman's triumph has further cemented his status as one of the world's top golfers, alongside the likes of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. For Gerry, the win is a reminder of his son's remarkable journey, from a young amateur with promise to a golfing superstar. Rory's achievements have surpassed even his father's wildest expectations, and Gerry's bet is a testament to the faith he had in his son's talent.  The news of Gerry's bet has also created a buzz among sports betting enthusiasts, who are now scrambling to place their own bets on the next generation of golfing stars. Who knows – perhaps another father will make a similar bet on their son or daughter, and strike gold in a decade's time. In any case, Rory's success has brought joy to his family and fans alike, and Gerry's unexpected windfall is a fitting coda to a remarkable tournament. As Rory sets his sights on further victories, one thing is clear – his parents will always be his biggest cheerleaders, both on and off the course.
