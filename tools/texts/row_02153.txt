article: Eden Hazard is currently lighting up the Premier League with his skills, flair and dribbling ability. He is arguably the favourite for the PFA Player of the Year award. And it also turns out that the in-form Chelsea winger is the most fouled player in the league this season, with opposing players being penalised 74 times. That works out at roughly three times a game; Hazard's twisting and turning is obviously too much for defenders at times. But who else makes the list? Eden Hazard has been fouled 74 times so far this season - the most in the Premier League . Hazard holds his neck during Chelsea's clash with Everton at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night . In stats provided by Opta, Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling is second after drawing 60 fouls so far this season. Hazard and Sterling's game provokes challenges from defenders, and are often too quick with their low centre of gravity, so their status at the top is unsurprising. Arsenal's player of the season so far Alexis Sanchez is also up there, but he is beaten to No 3 spot by Steven Naismith. The Scottish forward has drawn 52 goals this season to Sanchez's 47, despite playing one less game than the former Barcelona man. Santi Cazorla is also in the top 13, as is Southampton winger Sadio Mane with both being fouled 41 times. Gabriel Agbonlahor (56), Remy Cabella (45), Leroy Fer (45), Stephane Sessegnon (44), Jack Colback (44), Connor Wickham (41) and Alexandre Song make up the list, but Hazard is the clear winner. The Belgian has scored nine times this season and has added consistency to his game as Chelsea have opened a seven-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the table. Opposing defenders have been penalised 60 times for fouling Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling this season . Everton forward Steven Naismith (pictured tussling with Liverpool's Jordan Ibe) is third on the list . Charlie Adam picked up a yellow card for this foul on Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, who has drawn 47 fouls . He has been praised by manager Jose Mournho, who has also bemoaned the frequency of fouls on Hazard on several occasions. 'The first free-kick of every game is somebody kicking him,' the Portguese boss said last month. 'He has fouls and fouls and fouls. I don't see many yellow cards. Sometimes a yellow card is a consequence of violent conduct, but I also think that accumulation of small fouls is also violent conduct. 'The kid is suffering the consequences of that, but playing amazingly well.' Jose Mourinho has praised Hazard for his performances this season but says defenders target him in games .

chatgpt: Eden Hazard, the Belgian forward for Chelsea, has been receiving a lot of attention from defenders this Premier League season, and not in a good way. He has been fouled an incredible 74 times so far, making him one of the most targeted players in the league. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho recently spoke out about this issue, stating that Hazard is often targeted early on in games.  Despite this, Hazard has been able to maintain his impressive form and is now a top candidate for the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Player of the Year award. The 13-man shortlist for the prestigious award was recently released, and Hazard is one of the frontrunners to take home the trophy.  Raheem Sterling, the young English forward for Liverpool, is also on the list and is in close contention with Hazard. Sterling has had an excellent season so far, scoring seven goals and providing six assists for his team. His impressive performances have helped Liverpool stay in the top four and remain competitive in the league. However, it is Hazard who has really stolen the show this season. Despite being targeted by defenders, he has managed to score 12 goals and provide eight assists for his team. He has been instrumental in Chelsea's success this season, helping them to maintain their position at the top of the table.  His performances have not gone unnoticed, with pundits and fans alike hailing him as one of the best players in the world. His skill, pace, and agility on the ball make him a nightmare for defenders, and his ability to finish with both feet and his head makes him a complete attacking threat.  Hazard's impressive form has also led to rumors of interest from some of the biggest clubs in Europe, including Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. Chelsea, however, are determined to keep hold of their star player and are reportedly willing to offer him a new contract worth in excess of Â£200,000 per week.  While Hazard's talent on the pitch is undeniable, his conduct off the pitch has also been praised. He is known for being a humble and down-to-earth person, and has shown a great deal of maturity both on and off the pitch. This has endeared him to fans and peers alike, and has made him a popular choice for the PFA Player of the Year award. The winner of the award will be announced at a ceremony in London on April 26th. Other players on the shortlist include Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas of Chelsea, as well as Sergio Aguero and David Silva of Manchester City. However, it is Hazard and Sterling who are expected to be the main contenders for the award, and both players will no doubt be hoping to add it to their list of accomplishments at the end of the season. In conclusion, Eden Hazard has had an outstanding season so far, despite being targeted by defenders on a regular basis. He is now in contention for the PFA Player of the Year award, and it is clear to see why. His performances have been top class, and he is rightfully regarded as one of the best players in the world.
