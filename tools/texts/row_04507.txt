article: A driver had to be rescued after getting his car stuck in the mud - and then could only watch as the tide came in and swamped it. Stephen Cooper, 34, had driven his car along the beach at Weston Shore in Southampton, Hants, when it got stuck at 4.30pm yesterday. Mr Cooper, 34, from Eastleigh, Hants, was looking for a spot to fish when his 20-year-old Mitsubishi Pajero fell in a hole on the shingle beach. Submerged: The 4x4 sunk on the shingle beach before the tide came in and quickly swallowed the vehicle, causing extensive damage . Off road: Driver Stephen Cooper had been looking for a spot to fish when his Mitsubishi Pajero became stuck in a hole on a beach in Southampton and the tide came in . As the tide came in, he was taken to safety by Hill Head Coastguard and Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service but the car was left in the water. The self employed plasterer said around £1,500 worth of damage was done to the vehicle. People came from as far away from Portsmouth to help - once the tide went out at 10.30pm - six hours later, despite advice from the Coastguard. Stephen said: 'I'm angry and upset that it happened. 'I phoned up a guy I know who said he would come and help and then loads of other people said they were on their way. 'It's brilliant that everyone came to help.' To the rescue: Another 4x4 is used to tow the Mitsubishi out of the water after it became stuck on a Southampton beach and the tide came in . Five vehicles arrived at the shore to try to drag the car to safety but Solent Coastguard said only professional recovery teams should rescue a car from the water. A spokesman said: 'We would be concerned for the safety of any persons in or entering the water and we would urge anyone who sees a vehicle going into the water to dial 999 and ask for the coastguard. 'We would urge anyone thinking of attempting to recover their vehicle from the water to seek professional recovery and not attempt to enter the water.'

chatgpt: A leisurely fishing trip turned into a near-disaster for a driver who ventured onto a shingle beach in his Mitsubishi Pajero. The driver, whose name has not been released, was rescued after his vehicle became stuck in a hole as the tide began to rise.  Firefighters raced to the scene, but the incoming water made it impossible for them to reach the car. As the tide continued to come in, fears for the driver's safety grew, but fortunately, he was able to climb out of the vehicle and onto the roof, where he waited for rescuers to reach him. The incident occurred at a popular spot for beach fishing near the coastal town of Newquay in Cornwall. Local anglers say the spot is notorious for trapping unprepared drivers, despite repeated warnings from authorities. Once the tide receded, a tow truck was able to retrieve the car, which had suffered significant damage from the seawater. The bill for repairs is estimated at around £1,500. While the incident had a happy ending, authorities are warning drivers to exercise caution when driving on beaches, particularly at high tide. They advise beachgoers to check tide times and weather conditions before heading out and to be prepared for emergencies. According to the RNLI, every year they are called to a number of incidents involving vehicles stuck in the sand or mud on beaches, with some resulting in injury or even death. Their advice to drivers is to avoid driving on beaches entirely, except in designated areas, and to park on the hard surface above the beach. Despite the warnings, some drivers continue to take the risk, leading to costly and dangerous rescues, as well as damage to the environment. Local authorities are stepping up efforts to enforce laws against beach driving and to educate the public about the dangers it poses. For now, the driver of the ill-fated Mitsubishi Pajero is grateful to have escaped with his life and will likely think twice before attempting to drive on a shingle beach again.
