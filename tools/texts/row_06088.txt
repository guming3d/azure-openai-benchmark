chatgpt: Spain is set to face tough competition in the Euro 2016 qualifiers as they take on Slovakia and Luxembourg. Heading into the games, there have been some concerns surrounding Diego Costa's health, with reports suggesting that he has been dealing with hamstring problems. Despite these reports, Costa has been actively participating in training sessions leading up to the matches. The striker's form for Spain has been disappointing in recent times, having failed to score in any of the five matches he has played for the team. Alongside Costa, Cesc Fabregas, David Silva, and David de Gea have also been present at the training sessions. The Spanish national team will be looking to make a statement with a strong performance in these upcoming games. Speaking about his team's chances, manager Vicente del Bosque acknowledged that the squad is going through a period of transition. Spain has been considered one of the most dominant teams in international football in recent years, having won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championships in 2008 and 2012. However, their dominance has waned in recent years, with disappointing performances in major tournaments. Del Bosque acknowledged this, while also expressing optimism about the current squad's potential to compete at the highest level. "We are going through a change, not just in personnel, but in our style of play," said Del Bosque. "We have some talented players who can help us achieve our goals." One of the key players who will be looking to make an impact is Diego Costa. Despite his struggles with the Spanish team, Costa has been a prolific scorer for his club team, Atletico Madrid, and Chelsea in recent years. If Costa can find his form for Spain, it could be a major boost to their chances of success in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. The team will also be looking to players like Fabregas, Silva, and de Gea to provide leadership and inspiration on the pitch. Spain's path to the Euro 2016 championships will not be an easy one, as they face tough competition from across Europe. However, with a talented squad and a manager with a proven track record of success, they will be looking to prove that they are still one of the top teams in the world. As the matches against Slovakia and Luxembourg approach, fans and critics alike will be keeping a close eye on the team's performance. Can they find their form and achieve success on the international stage once again? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain â€“ the Spanish national team has the talent and potential to achieve great things in the years to come.
