An independent review is set to be carried out into the Food Standards Agency's response to the horse meat scandal.

The project will feed into a larger Government review of the scandal which forced supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Waitrose to clear their shelves. The news comes just days after Dutch . authorities announced they would recall 50,000 tons of meat sold as beef . across Europe that may contain horse meat. The FSA later confirmed that the meat did come to factories supplying supermarkets in the UK. It is believed that the much of the suspected horse meat originated in countries such as Romania before being packaged elsewhere in Europe and sold on as ready meals in the UK.

Ms Creagh said: 'The Government's fragmentation of the FSA in 2010 has left our food regulatory system unfit for purpose.

chatgpt: The UK supermarket industry was rocked by a major scandal after the Labour environment Secretary Mary Creagh branded the Food Standards Agency (FSA) 'unfit for purpose'. The fiasco caused shockwaves across the country, with consumers both bewildered and outraged by the news. The FSA is responsible for ensuring that UK food businesses comply with strict hygiene, safety, and labeling standards. However, recent revelations have put the agency's competence and effectiveness under intense scrutiny. Mary Creagh's harsh criticism came after a media investigation uncovered widespread breaches of food safety rules in major UK supermarkets. The investigation revealed that several big-name supermarkets had been selling meat products that contained undeclared ingredients, mislabelled use-by dates, contaminated meat, and even traces of DNA from other species. The news provoked an uproar among the public, who were quick to condemn supermarkets for neglecting their duty to protect their customers' health. However, Mary Creagh was particularly scathing of the FSA's failure to prevent the scandal from happening. The Labour MP accused the agency of being "unfit for purpose" and demanded that it be overhauled to improve its regulatory powers and resources. "The FSA has let down consumers and has damaged the reputation of the UK food industry," said Mary Creagh in a statement. "It is time for a radical overhaul of the agency to ensure that it has the legal powers, resources, and independence it needs to better protect public health." The FSA responded by stating that it took the issue seriously and was working with supermarkets to resolve the problems. However, industry experts warned that the fiasco may have long-lasting repercussions for the UK food industry, which is already grappling with a decline in trust and higher food prices. "The damage to the sector's reputation and consumer confidence is potentially huge," said Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium. "It's vital that we restore trust in the system and demonstrate that UK food supply is of the highest standard." The scandal has also raised questions about the adequacy of regulations and the effectiveness of enforcement in the UK food industry. Some critics have called for more stringent measures to prevent future breaches, including tougher penalties for food businesses that fail to comply with standards and a more proactive approach to inspecting and monitoring the industry. As the fallout from the scandal continues, UK consumers are left to wonder whether they can trust the food they buy in their local supermarkets. With Mary Creagh's damning assessment of the FSA, and the widespread breaches of food safety rules, it's clear that urgent action needs to be taken to restore the public's faith in the UK food industry.
