article: By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 5:07 PM on 7th December 2011 . Facebook's new 'timeline' feature - a new, deeper profile which allows you to 'fill in' more of your life pre-Facebook - was announced with some fanfare in September. At the time, Mark Zuckerberg promised, 'you can tell the whole story of your life on a single page'. Now it seems that the company is to launch Timeline - but only in New Zealand. The 'timeline' view will give your Facebook page a more 'magazine-like' feel - and will, Mark Zuckerberg promises, 'tell the story of your life'. So far, though, only New Zealanders can enjoy it . Timeline allows you to organise your life into a chronological view - and you can even add the years 'pre-Facebook' The redesigned pages have a more magazine-like photo-heavy feel, with a large 'cover photo' at the top of the page .On the right of the page there will be a timeline that breaks down all posts from a person's time on Facebook and allows viewers to jump back to people's earliest posts with a break down month-by-month. 'We announced Timeline in September and made it available to developers building apps on our platform,' the company said via a blog post today. 'Starting today, we are making Timeline more widely available as we measure speed and other types of performance.' 'We'll begin by making it available to people in New Zealand and then roll it out more broadly in the near future.' Timeline has been available to a million developers in an early test version already - but has not been available to the public at all so far. New Zealand has been chosen, presumably, because it has a relatively low population - just 4.4 million - and is English-speaking, allowing Facebook to iron out early problems with the service. Even before launch, some have pointed out that Timeline, with its month-by-month approach, may have some unwanted side effects, such as allowing people to see who 'defriended' them and when.

chatgpt: Facebook recently announced that it will be rolling out an update that will allow users to fill in their lives pre-Facebook on their profiles. The update is set to be available to users in the near future, although no exact date has been given. Users will be able to add information about their lives before they joined the social media platform, such as their education, work history, and personal milestones. This will give users the opportunity to provide a more complete picture of themselves on their profiles. One of the key features of the update is a month-by-month view of each user's life, giving their profiles a more magazine-like feel. This feature will allow users to share more detailed information about their lives in a visually appealing way, adding to the overall experience of using Facebook. While the update will provide an interesting feature for users to explore, it also has the potential to give Facebook more information about its users. With this updated feature, Facebook will have access to users' life events from before they joined the social media platform, which could be valuable data for advertisers. However, Facebook has reassured users that they will have control over what information they choose to share on their profiles, and that the new features will only add to the existing options. The update also fits in with Facebook's recent moves towards promoting a more personal and authentic experience for its users. By allowing users to add more details about their lives, Facebook is creating a space where users can share not only their current experiences, but also their past. This latest update is part of a larger trend in social media towards creating a more complete and personal experience for users. With the rise of platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat, which focus heavily on visual storytelling, Facebook is looking to ensure that it continues to be a relevant and engaging platform for its users. Overall, the new update is a welcome addition to the platform, giving users more control over their profiles and adding to the overall experience of using Facebook. While there may be concerns about privacy and data usage, Facebook has made a commitment to ensuring that users have control over their information.
