article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge declared a mistrial Thursday after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked in the murder trial of a teenager accused of gunning down a gay classmate in their Southern California classroom. Ventura County Superior Court confirmed the ruling in the eight-week trial of Brandon McInerney, who was 14 at the time of the shooting in 2008. The nine-woman, three-man jury panel said its last vote resulted in seven in favor of finding the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, CNN affiliates reported. McInerney was tried as an adult on charges of first-degree murder, use of a handgun and a hate crime. McInerney, now 17, allegedly shot 15-year-old Lawrence King, an eighth grader at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, twice while both were typing papers in a computer lab for their English class, authorities said. King, an openly gay teenager, was seated in the middle of the classroom with two dozen students and their teacher when McInerney allegedly shot him in the back of the head, authorities said. Friends said King was proud of being openly gay. He liked wearing jewelry and makeup to school, and he often wore high-heeled boots with the school uniform. He asked his teachers to call him Leticia instead of Larry. Some students bullied him, pupils said. The prosecution alleged McInerney had planned to shoot King over unwanted sexual advances, and said that McInerney had white-supremacist leanings, according to affiliate KABC. The defense contended McInerney had a violent upbringing. It also argued that King taunted and flirted with McInerney, ultimately sparking the fatal confrontation, KTLA reported. The trial was held in Chatsworth, in neighboring Los Angeles County, because the defendant successfully sought a change of venue in the high-profile case, said Ventura County Chief Deputy District Attorney Mike Frawley. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In 2008, the community of Oxnard, California was rocked by a tragedy that still resonates to this day. Lawrence King, a 15-year-old student at E.O. Green Junior High School, was shot in the back of the head while in English class. The crime was quickly labeled a hate crime, as King was openly gay and comfortable expressing himself as such. The suspected perpetrator was 14-year-old classmate Brandon McInerney. The two had been in a dispute over King's insistent romantic interest in McInerney. It was known throughout the school that King was gay and had been exploring his sexuality, but McInerney was not as comfortable with the idea. It was a trial that drew national attention, as McInerney was tried as an adult. The prosecution argued that McInerney's beliefs about homosexuality being wrong and immoral led him to commit the violent crime. The defense, however, argued that McInerney was manipulated and pushed to the brink of sanity by King's aggressive behavior towards him. Ultimately, McInerney was found guilty of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, among other charges. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, which he is still serving to this day. It was a verdict that was met with mixed reactions, as some felt that it was too harsh for someone so young, and others felt that the penalty fit the crime. The tragedy of Lawrence King's death cannot be overstated. He was a young boy who was simply exploring his identity, and he was punished for it in the most violent way possible. It's a reminder that hate and intolerance have no place in our society, and that children must be taught to embrace diversity and acceptance from an early age. May Lawrence King rest in peace and may his legacy inspire us all to be better, more compassionate human beings.
