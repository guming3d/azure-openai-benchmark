article: If you’ve ever taken a sneaky look through your partner’s phone, new research claims you are not alone. One in five men, and a quarter of women, in relationships admit to snooping through texts, apps and pictures on their partner’s devices. Although almost a quarter of male snoopers said they did so because they are nosy, 12 per cent admitted they were trying to catch their partner lying to them. The study from Prague security firm Avast surveyed 13,132 people in relationships across the US. It found one in five men, (stock image pictured) and a quarter of women check their partner’s phones. Almost a quarter of snoopers did so just because they are nosey, but 12% said they were trying to catch their partner lying . But looking for evidence of cheating was the number one reason why men looked through their boyfriend or girlfriend’s phone on tablet. Security firm Symantec recently left 50 fully charged handsets lying in the street, loaded with apps called Private Pix and Online Banking. The phones were left in New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Ottawa in Canada. By tracking which apps were opened on each device, the researchers found that 96 per cent of finders rooted through a handset for details including social network accounts. More than 43 per cent of finders tried to access online bank accounts. And only half tried to return the device. Almost a third of women said their excuse was curiosity, only 21 per cent thought their partner was cheating and 14 per cent wanted to see if their lover was lying to them. And more than half of men said they found evidence of cheating or lying, compared to 71 per cent of women. Although women were more likely to confront their partners about the lies. ‘One may think that people who snoop on their significant other to find evidence of cheating or lying are being paranoid,’ explained Avast. ‘Unfortunately, the majority of them are not paranoid–their gut feeling is often correct.’ A high percentage of respondents claimed they didn’t need a passcode to gain entry to their significant other’s device. More than 40 per cent of women reported their partner’s device did not have a passcode, compared to 33 per cent of men. Both male and female respondents claimed to know their partner’s device passcode because their partner had shared it with them in the past, unknowingly setting themselves up to get caught .

Both male and female respondents claimed to know their partner’s device passcode because their partner had shared it with them in the past, unknowingly setting themselves up to get caught. More than half of men and women who check their significant other’s device said they believe their partner does the same, and this was more common in couples who had been together a long time.

chatgpt: A new study has revealed that jealousy and suspicion are still alive and well in American relationships, with around one in five men and a quarter of women confessing to checking their partner's phones. The survey, which looked at the behavior of more than 13,000 people in relationships across the United States, found that a significant proportion of individuals are unable to resist the urge to snoop on their significant others. Of those who admitted to checking their partner's phone, almost a quarter said they did so simply because they were nosy. However, a worrying 12% said they were specifically looking to catch their partner lying to them. The results suggest that trust remains a crucial issue in many relationships, and that some people are willing to go to great lengths to uncover the truth. Interestingly, the study found that fewer men than women had passcodes on their devices, suggesting that men may be more comfortable with their partners accessing their phones. It's possible that men feel they have nothing to hide, or that they simply don't consider the possibility that their partner might snoop on them. Alternatively, it could be that women are more concerned about privacy and value the security of their personal information more highly. The study also revealed some demographic differences in phone-checking behavior. For example, younger people were more likely to check their partner's phone, with 34% of those aged between 18 and 29 confessing to doing so. By contrast, just 10% of those aged over 60 reported checking their partner's phone. There were also some regional differences, with individuals in the South and Midwest more likely to check their partner's phone than those in the West and Northeast. It's possible that cultural and social factors might impact on the extent to which individuals regard phone-checking as acceptable or normal behavior. Despite the prevalence of phone-checking behavior, however, experts warn that it can be damaging to relationships. "Trust is the foundation of any healthy and successful relationship," said relationship counselor Jeanette Raymond. "When you invade your partner's privacy by snooping, you're telling them that you don't trust them. This can cause feelings of resentment and anger, and can set the relationship on a path towards deterioration." Raymond recommends that couples establish open lines of communication in order to build trust and maintain healthy relationships. By talking openly and honestly about their feelings and concerns, couples can work together to build a sense of mutual respect and trust. Ultimately, the study suggests that phone-checking behavior is still common in American relationships, and that trust remains a crucial issue for many couples. While some people may view phone-checking as harmless or even necessary, experts warn that it can damage relationships and undermine trust. Instead, positive communication, honesty, and mutual respect are the key ingredients for building healthy, lasting relationships.
