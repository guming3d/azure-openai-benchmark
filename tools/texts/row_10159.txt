The Volvo Ocean Race, known as the toughest sailing event in the world, spans 39,379 nautical miles and visits 11 countries. The race is no stranger to danger, with teams facing extreme weather conditions and rough seas. But for Team Vestas, their dangerous situation was caused by a collision with a coral reef.
