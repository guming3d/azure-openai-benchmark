chatgpt: The use of drones has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with retailers reporting a surge in sales for the popular pilotless aircraft. And now, there is a new trend that is taking the drone world by storm: the "dronie". A dronie is a selfie taken from a drone, typically by attaching a small camera on the device and capturing a shot of oneself or a group of friends from high above. The trend has become increasingly popular in recent months, with skiers and snowboarders in New Zealand being among the first to experiment with the technique. Retailer Maplin has reported that sales of drones have risen by 200 per cent in just eight weeks. This surge in demand can be attributed to the growing number of people who are discovering the many creative uses of drones, from aerial photography and videography to delivery services and even search and rescue operations. The prospect of using drones for aerial selfies has also caught the attention of social media users who are always on the lookout for new and exciting ways to document their adventures. With a drone, they can capture stunning views from above and share them with their friends and followers on various social networks. The use of drones for dronies has added a new dimension to aerial photography and is expected to become even more popular in the coming months. Retailers are now offering special packages that include drones and cameras specifically designed for making dronies. In addition, many drone manufacturers are incorporating features such as facial recognition and tracking technology to enhance the quality of selfies taken from drones. While drones can be a lot of fun to fly, it is important to remember that there are rules and regulations that must be followed when using them, particularly in crowded public areas. In many countries, it is illegal to fly drones over certain areas, such as airports, sports stadiums, and public parks. Despite the potential risks, the use of drones for dronies has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for creative individuals and adventurers everywhere. With the ability to capture stunning views from above, the drone is quickly becoming an essential tool for those who love to explore the world from a different perspective.  As the trend continues to gain momentum, we can expect to see more and more people taking to the skies to capture their own unique and breathtaking dronies.
