With coffee shops springing up across the country, it seemed Britain’s reputation as a nation of tea drinkers was under strain. But a study has revealed that our love affair with the cuppa is still as strong as ever. We typically brew up three-and-a-half times a day, although one in four thirsty Britons will get through five cups or more. The poll for WRVS, a charity that provides support for older people, revealed 35 per cent of people like their tea to be mid-brown, with only 3 per cent preferring their tea very milky. One in five like to brew their tea in a teapot, while a traditional 6 per cent still use a cup and saucer. And 7 per cent are so picky that they will not let anyone else make them a cuppa. A study has revealed that our love affair with the cuppa is still as strong as ever . Scots have the sweetest teeth, with 41 per cent taking sugar in their tea compared to just 26 per cent in Yorkshire. Unsurprisingly, tea was seen as a comfort drink – 43 per cent of people claimed they feel better after a brew. Almost a third said that if a friend received bad news they would offer to put the kettle on. The study of the nation’s tea-drinking, which  surveyed 2,000 people, marks the Great Brew Break fundraising event. Launching on Monday, April 29, it’s aimed at raising money to alleviate loneliness among older people. Verity Haines, from WRVS, said: ‘A cup of tea, when it comes with a friendly ear, is a welcome combination. 'But it’s particularly important to many of the older people we support who may not see anyone but a WRVS volunteer that week. 'In May, we celebrate our 75th Anniversary and throughout the years, the charity has become renowned for its tea making abilities. 'Our focus now is on improving the lives of older people and the money raised through this campaign will mean more older people will benefit from the practical support, comfort and kindness our volunteers provide.

chatgpt: According to a recent poll conducted by the charity organization WRVS, the average person in the nation drinks tea up to three and a half times a day. The survey goes on to reveal interesting data on tea preferences, with 35% of respondents expressing a liking for mid-brown tea. Despite the diversity of tea preferences in the nation, only 3% of those surveyed prefer their tea to be more milky. This could indicate a trend in the populace for stronger, less diluted tea. However, what is more interesting to note is that 7% of people surveyed are so particular about their tea that they won't let anyone else make it for them. The tradition of tea-drinking in the United Kingdom is so pervasive that it is practically considered a national pastime. Even for individuals who do not drink tea out of choice, being offered a cup of tea is a sign of hospitality and kindness. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the study by WRVS also revealed that 80% of respondents viewed tea as a way to bond with colleagues, friends, and family. As for the preference for mid-brown tea over other types of brew, this could speak to the general disposition of the nation towards a good, strong cup of tea. The vast majority of those surveyed espoused a love for tea that was hearty, robust, and quick to brew. Therefore, adding too much milk or sugar to the tea could dilute the potency of its taste, something that the 35% of the respondents who chose mid-brown tea may have subconsciously realized. The WRVS survey may also have revealed a potential cultural divide in the nation. In previous generations, tea-drinking may have been more of a routine activity in households, with mothers and grandmothers serving up cups of tea to their family members. In contrast, the younger generation is more inclined towards grabbing a latte from a coffee shop or indulging in other, more exotic flavors. However, that is not to say that tea-drinking is dying out in the country. The study by WRVS reveals that tea-drinking is still strong in the nation, with the vast majority of those surveyed drinking tea at least once a day. In conclusion, with tea-drinking remaining an integral part of the United Kingdom's culture, the WRVS study highlights just how much of a social and cultural phenomenon tea-drinking is.
