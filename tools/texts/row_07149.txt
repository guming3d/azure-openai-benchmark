article: (CNN) -- Seventeen-year-olds in the Netherlands can't hold a driving license, let alone hurtle around a track at 200 miles per hour. But that hasn't stopped Dutch teenager Max Verstappen climbing behind the wheel of a Formula One car to make history Friday during practice for this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix and become the youngest driver to participate in the sport. Not bad considering the legal driving age in his native Netherlands is 18. At that age, most are preoccupied by schoolwork and teenage angst. But there's no stopping Verstappen. Next season, Verstappen will be a full-time racer for Toro Rosso, which has historically been a stepping stone towards a drive with the hugely successful Red Bull Racing team. "Today for me it was all about getting experience in the car, especially on a difficult track like Suzuka," Verstappen told the sport's official website. "I was impressed with the engine power." The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen, Max completed 22 laps of the Suzuka Circuit before engine failure brought his big day to a premature end. His fastest lap of one minute and 38.157 seconds was only 0.443 seconds slower than his more experienced teammate Daniel Kvyat. World championship leader Lewis Hamilton recorded a time of one minute and 35.078 seconds in his Mercedes. "The car is bigger compared to the one I'm used to in Formula 3 and there are a lot more things to think about while you're driving, so I had to use some laps to get confident with such a different car," added Verstappen. "I was not taking any risks and I drove within my limits for all the session, doing as much mileage as possible. "I have to thank Red Bull and Scuderia Toro Rosso for giving me the possibility to be in the car already this year on Fridays and get well prepared for next year. "I find myself very comfortable in this team and I like my working group. I hope to drive also in Austin, Sao Paolo and Abu Dhabi. "Now that I know what it means to drive a Formula One car, I'm looking forward to it even more." Interactive: Take a tour of the Suzuka Circuit .

chatgpt: Max Verstappen has made history by becoming the youngest driver to take part in a Formula One race weekend after he drove in the practice session ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix. The 17-year-old Dutchman drove for the Toro Rosso team in the session at Suzuka, replacing regular driver Jean-Eric Vergne.  The fact that the legal driving age in Max's native Netherlands is 18 makes his achievement even more remarkable. However, it is clear that Max has already established himself as a talented young driver, having been signed up as a Red Bull junior driver at the age of just 16.  Max is the son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen, who competed for the likes of Benetton, Tyrrell and Minardi during his career. Naturally, Max has been surrounded by motorsport from a young age and has clearly inherited his father's talent for driving.  Max's participation in the Japanese Grand Prix practice session has set the F1 world abuzz with excitement, as everyone waits to see how the teenager will fare against the sport's more experienced drivers. The Toro Rosso team has expressed its confidence in Max, with team principal Franz Tost saying that Max "has shown in testing that he can quickly get up to speed".  For Max, this is just the beginning of what promises to be a long and successful career in motorsport. He will no doubt face many challenges along the way, but he has already demonstrated that he has the talent, the drive and the determination to succeed. With his father's support and expertise, Max has the potential to become one of the greatest drivers the sport has ever seen.  Max's appearance in the practice session at Suzuka has also raised questions about the current rules governing the minimum age for F1 drivers. Some have argued that the rules should be changed to allow younger drivers to compete, whilst others have voiced concerns about the safety implications of allowing such young drivers to race. Whatever the case, Max's achievement is a true milestone in the history of Formula One, and one that we will be talking about for years to come.  In conclusion, Max Verstappen has already made history at the age of just 17, becoming the youngest driver to take part in a Formula One race weekend. His participation in the practice session at Suzuka is a testament to his talent and determination, and promises to be the beginning of a long and successful career in motorsport. With the support of his father Jos and the Toro Rosso team, Max has the potential to achieve greatness in Formula One and beyond.
