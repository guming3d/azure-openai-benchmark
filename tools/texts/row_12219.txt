The large board, which also features beefy male models, is covering up construction currently taking place at the hotel.

Winterson claims that the billboards, which also feature beefy male models, contribute to the issue of women being bombarded with negative and conflicting messages about sexuality . The author, who regularly stays at the hotel, claims that the photographs contribute to the issue of women being bombarded with negative and conflicting messages about sexuality and gender roles. Winterson, who teaches new writing at the University of Manchester, said the city has 25 Nobel prize winners and is the cornerstone of the Industrial Revolution so should be the place to encourage women into traditionally male-dominated professions. She said: 'Plenty of women on business stay at the Mal. The Malmaison hotel on Piccadilly is covering construction efforts with images of scantily-clad women .

'To get to their hotel room at the end of a long day they must take in, or blank out, the message that women at work are really soft-porn babes.

'The hard-hat babes send out a message that aligns with male fantasy not female reality.' Winterson says that such photographs promote the idea that 'women at work are really soft-porn babes' 'This message,' the author says, 'aligns with male fantasy, not female reality' She also claims that the adverts contribute to the debate on equal pay, rape and domestic violence, anorexia and self-harm, and prostitution. 'The joke is that as Britain falls down the equality ladder behind Rwanda and Nicaragua, and Victoria Beckham is named entrepreneur of the year for dressing us all in size zero - the nearest most women will get to being on the board is a strapless dress and a hard hat outside Malmaison,' she added . Kate Loyd, from the Construction Industry Training Board, also slammed the image: 'The picture on the hoarding of Manchester's Malmaison hotel was shocking, depressing and highly insulting to women working in construction.'

chatgpt: Jeanette Winterson, a renowned author and cultural icon, has taken aim at the Malmaison hotel in Manchester for what she sees as a troubling trend in their advertising. Specifically, Winterson objects to the use of "hard-hat babes" in the hotel's advertisements, which she believes sends a message that aligns with male fantasy. The hotel's billboard featured a group of attractive women wearing the iconic hard-hats and work gear of construction workers. Winterson sees this as an attempt to appeal to male fantasies of female subservience, wrapped up in a disingenuous package of female empowerment. In reality, she argues, the use of this imagery does nothing to challenge the male-dominated culture of the construction industry. "It's great that women can work in male-dominated fields like construction," Winterson said. "But when you use these women's bodies as commodities to sell hotel rooms, you're not really saying anything meaningful about the state of gender equality in the workplace. Instead, you're just perpetuating the same old stereotypes." Winterson also takes issue with the use of beefy male models to cover up the construction work that is currently taking place at the hotel. She argues that this perpetuates the idea that men are the only ones who are capable of doing hard physical labor. By treating the male models as an accessory to the construction work, the hotel is sending the message that men are the only ones who matter in the construction industry. The Malmaison hotel has not yet responded to Winterson's comments, but there is no doubt that her words have struck a chord with many people. The issue of gender equality in the workplace is one that has been receiving increased attention in recent years, and it is clear that many people are starting to see through the veneer of tokenistic gestures like those seen in the Malmaison's advertising. It remains to be seen whether the Malmaison and other businesses will start to take this issue more seriously, or whether they will continue to use attractive bodies as a cheap marketing tactic. But Winterson's words are a reminder that we still have a long way to go before we achieve true gender equality in the workplace, and that we need to be wary of empty gestures that do nothing to move us closer to that goal.
