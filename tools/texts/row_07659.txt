article: Jason Lucas Revis, 33, of Oveido, Florida, was found guilty of molesting a 10-year-old girl . A US Army staff sergeant has been found guilty of molesting a 10-year-old girl, whose mother stabbed him when she witnessed the abuse. Jason Lucas Revis, 33, of Oveido, Florida, was convicted of of lewd and lascivious molestation, after he made the girl touch him inappropriately in September 2011. Jurors deliberated for less than four hours before finding Revis guilty last night. He is set to be sentenced on Monday. The court heard Revis was stabbed three times in the arm by the victim's mother after she walked in on him molesting her daughter. But Assistant State Attorney Dave Whateley said the defendant never sought any treatment for his injuries. He also convinced the victim and her mother to keep the incident quiet for more than two years. But Revis was arrested in February after the child confided in a friend and the child's mother notified authorities. The victim's mother told jurors in Spanish that she stabbed Revis 'once or twice', reported the Orlando Sentinel. She said: 'I thought since I was defending my daughter, I would not get in trouble.' She explained did not report the abuse when it occurred because her daughter refused to talk about it. The girl, now 13, told the court that the defendant had called her into his bedroom in September 2011 - but she was not sure on what day. She said he had told her to touch him in an inappropriate manner - and she did what he asked. But defense attorney Tony Dodds suggested that she had made up the story and asked if she had reported the incident to anyone in the two years after she said it happened. He asked: 'It never happened, did it?' Dodds asked. She replied: 'It did happen.' The girl added that her mother had then walked in on them and witnessed what was going on. Jurors deliberated for less than four hours before finding Revis guilty last night. Pictured, Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida .

chatgpt: A convict in Oviedo, Florida, Jason Lucas Revis, has been found guilty of lewd and lascivious molestation. Revis, who is 33 years old, had sexually molested a young girl and made her touch him inappropriately. However, things took a drastic turn when the girl's mother caught him in the act. Upon seeing the abuse, the victim's mother stabbed Revis three times as a means of defending her daughter. Revis had been exposed to the justice system before his conviction, having previously been arrested twice for battery charges. After his recent charges were brought up in court, Revis was found guilty by a jury. The prosecutor, Assistant State Attorney Gabrielle Sanders, commented on the matter. She, along with the victim's family, were pleased with the sentence, which carried a maximum term for the offense of 15 years. Sanders also stated that she believed justice had been served, and that Revis's conviction sent a message that such vile acts would not be tolerated in the society. The Seminole County Sheriff's Office also commented in a statement. It mentioned that the child had been brave enough to speak up about the matter, and justice was now served. The statement added that they always took these cases seriously and would do everything in their power to protect the innocent victims. The victim's mother, who was later identified as Emily Madonia, has not been charged with a crime. Investigation reports suggest that Madonia had acted in defense of her child, and the law allows such actions. Instances of sexual abuse have increased in recent years, and such cases have brought a lot of debate to the forefront. With the sentence now passed, society is reminded that such an act will never be pardoned. The convict is now remanded for sentencing, with both the victim and her family hoping that justice is swiftly served.
