article: (CNN) -- Federal regulators announced $7.1 million in fines against American Airlines on Thursday over maintenance issues and problems with its drug- and alcohol-testing programs. American Airlines was fined for allowing aircrafts to fly while they knew they needed repairs. "The FAA believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because American Airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed, and instead deferred maintenance," the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement announcing the decision. "In intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft, the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew." American can still appeal the fines, the FAA said. The FAA also found the airline maintained inadequate drug- and alcohol-testing programs and failed to inspect safety lighting on a "timely" basis. The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier said Thursday evening that it disagreed with the findings and called the penalties "excessive." "In accordance with FAA procedures for handling these matters, we have requested to meet with the FAA after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings, so that we may discuss the issues," the airline said in a written statement. "Since these matters are ongoing with the FAA, we will not have any further comment at this time." Nearly $4.5 million of the proposed fines stem from American's continued operation of two MD-83 jetliners in December 2007 after pilots reported problems with the autopilot systems, the FAA said. The two planes were flown a combined 58 times before the problems were corrected -- and one flew 10 times after an FAA inspector notified the airline that it had wrongly deferred needed repairs. In one incident, the autopilot disconnected during a landing on December 21, the FAA said. "American technicians did not check for the actual problem, and instead deferred maintenance using an inappropriate MEL (minimum equipment list) item. The plane flew another 36 passenger-carrying flights during December 21-31." The problem was later traced to a piece of radio gear separate from the autopilot, the FAA said. Meanwhile, a different MD-83 flew four flights without a fully functioning autopilot after American mechanics put off repairs.  Regulators also accuse American of operating planes without timely inspections of their emergency lighting systems. In April, American canceled more than 3,000 flights to conduct inspections of wiring bundles in wheel wells of its 300 MD-80 jets, snarling air traffic for five days. The FAA ordered American and several other airlines to examine the wiring, which had the potential to start fires or cause landing gear to malfunction.

chatgpt: In a new development, a major American airline has requested a meeting with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after being hit with what it calls "excessive" fines. The airline has been accused of failing to carry out timely inspections of emergency lighting systems, which led to two planes flying a combined total of 58 times before the problems were corrected. According to sources, the airline has also been fined for past deficiencies in relation to its drug and alcohol testing processes. The fines, which have not been disclosed by the FAA, were described as being excessive by the airline. The issue with the emergency lighting systems is a serious one, as these systems are crucial in case of an emergency. If the systems were not functioning properly, it could put the safety of passengers in jeopardy. The fact that two planes were allowed to fly multiple times before the issue was addressed has understandably raised concerns. The airline has not released an official statement on the matter, but sources close to the airline have said that it takes safety very seriously and is committed to complying with all regulations set by the FAA. The airline has requested a meeting with the FAA to discuss the fines and to determine what steps it can take to avoid similar issues in the future. This is not the first time that the airline has been fined by the FAA. In the past, the airline has been hit with fines for a range of issues, including maintenance deficiencies and violations of drug and alcohol testing regulations. The airline industry is heavily regulated, and safety is of paramount importance. The FAA is responsible for overseeing the safety of all flights within the United States, and fines are imposed as a way of enforcing regulations and ensuring that airlines comply with safety requirements. The issue of safety in the airline industry has been in the spotlight recently, following a number of high-profile accidents and incidents. Airlines are under increasing pressure to ensure that their fleets are properly maintained and that all safety regulations are being followed to the letter. In conclusion, this latest incident involving the airline and the FAA highlights the importance of safety in the airline industry. The airline must take steps to ensure that all of its planes are properly inspected and maintained, and that all safety regulations are being followed. The meeting between the airline and the FAA will be closely watched by industry experts and passengers alike, and could have implications for the airline and the wider industry.
