chatgpt: A ninth-grade science teacher from Selah, Washington has resigned from his position after pupils found a hidden camera in his classroom. Dave McMillen is now under investigation, and the police are looking into the camera as well as the computers in his home.  The incident came to light when a student noticed what appeared to be a camera hidden in a classroom plant pot. Upon closer inspection, the student discovered that it was indeed a camera, and they immediately notified the school authorities. The police were then called in to investigate the matter. According to sources, the police have confiscated the camera and are now looking at the footage for evidence. They have also seized the computers from McMillen's home, and they are being examined for any incriminating evidence as well.  The school district has expressed its disappointment and shock at the news. In a statement, they said, "We are deeply concerned about this incident and the impact it may have on our students and families. We have taken appropriate action to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff." McMillen had been a teacher at the school for several years, and he was highly respected by his colleagues and students alike. However, the discovery of the camera has tarnished his reputation, and his resignation seems appropriate given the situation.  The incident has brought to light the importance of ensuring the safety and security of students in schools. Teachers are held to a high level of responsibility, and any breach of that trust is not taken lightly. It is unclear at this time what will happen next, but the police investigation is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge in due course. Parents of students in McMillen's class have expressed their shock and concern at the news. One parent said, "I can't believe this has happened. We trust our teachers to keep our children safe, and this is a huge breach of that trust." Overall, this incident serves as a reminder that all educators must be held to the highest standards of professionalism and integrity. The safety and well-being of students must always be the top priority, and any actions that compromise this must be thoroughly investigated and dealt with accordingly.
