article: London, England (CNN) -- Britain's top legal official "misled" the government over the case for war in Iraq under pressure from then prime minister Tony Blair, a former Cabinet minister claimed Tuesday. Clare Short, who was Blair's international development secretary until she quit over the Iraq invasion, said Attorney General Peter Goldsmith withheld his own "doubts and changes of opinion" in giving the go-ahead for war. "I think he misled the Cabinet. He certainly misled me, but people let it through," Short told an inquiry into Britain's role in the March 2003 Iraq invasion. The inquiry -- Britain's fifth examination of its Iraq involvement -- has already grilled senior figures including Blair, former defense minister Geoff Hoon and Britain's top military commander Jock Stirrup. Short said that Goldsmith, who last week testified before the inquiry that he was initially ambivalent but later adamant over the legality of the war, was wrong to press the case. Goldsmith initially advised Blair in January 2003 that it would be unlawful to invade Iraq without a United Nations Security Council resolution but changed his mind a month later. "I think for the attorney general to come and say there's unequivocal legal authority to go to war was misleading." Short said Goldsmith was "leaned on" by Blair to agree to the war. "Lord Goldsmith said he was excluded from lots of meetings -- that's a form of pressure. "It was suggested to him that he go to the U.S. to get advice about the legal position. "You have got the Bush administration who have very low respect for international law. It seems the most extraordinary place in the world to go to get advice about international law." She added: "I think all that was leaning on -- sending him to America, excluding him and then including him." Her comments came just days after Blair appearance at the inquiry generated protests, with several hundred anti-war campaigners gathering outside the London venue chanting "Blair lied, thousands died" and other slogans. Blair denied claims he had struck a secret deal with U.S. President George W. Bush in 2002 pledging British backing for the invasion and said he believed "beyond doubt" his unfounded pre-war claim that Iraq was capable of launching chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes. Blair: No 'covert' deal with Bush over Iraq . Analysts say involvement in the Iraq war remains a "live political issue" in the UK, because the same government -- now led by Gordon Brown -- was still power, whereas the parties of other leaders in the U.S. and Australia have been voted out of office. "The others have faced critical public scrutiny and been damaged by that," legal expert Glen Rangwala of Cambridge University told CNN. "The British haven't had a change of administration so in many ways it remains a live political issue because it reflects on people who are in government." CNN's Simon Hooper contributed to this report .

chatgpt: Former British cabinet minister Clare Short has alleged that the country's attorney general withheld his doubts about the legality of the Iraq War from the public. Speaking to the Chilcot Inquiry, Short claimed that Tony Blair put pressure on attorney general Lord Goldsmith to support the UK's involvement in the conflict without disclosing his reservations. This, she claims, ultimately led to the invasion and "the catastrophe that's happened since."  The Chilcot Inquiry marks the fifth time that the UK has examined its role in the Iraq War, and comes after years of accusations of questionable legality and poor management. According to Short's testimony, Goldsmith had initially raised concerns over the legality of the proposed invasion, but was later leaned on by Blair to give a different opinion.  It is well-documented that legal experts had questioned the legality of the Iraq War even before it began, and criticism of the conflict and its aftermath has continued to this day. Indeed, the ongoing inquiry has faced repeated delays, with many asking why it has taken so long for the UK to fully explore its involvement in such a controversial conflict.  Speaking to reporters outside the inquiry, Short emphasised the importance of transparency, particularly in matters of such significant international consequence. "If the attorney general had done what he should have done, which is give his clear opinion to the prime minister, then the prime minister could have decided," Short told reporters. "But we went into this quite catastrophic war on a lie, and it's been "one of the disastrous foreign policy actions any country has taken," she added.  Criticism of the UK's role in the Iraq War remains widespread, with the Chilcot Inquiry aiming to establish the full extent of the UK's involvement and the legality of such actions. However, Short's testimony has opened up further questions about the integrity of the UK's political processes, particularly in the build-up to the conflict.  Short has long been a vocal critic of the Iraq War and the decisions that led to it. In her evidence, she highlighted the importance of opening up about such controversies, particularly in light of the ongoing instability in the region. "It's an absolutely critical part of our democratic system that we are transparent, that we tell the truth, and that we don't let our leaders take us into foolish or catastrophic wars," she said.  As the Chilcot Inquiry continues to explore the UK's role in the Iraq War, questions will undoubtedly continue to be raised about the country's decision-making processes, and its responsibility for the conflict and its aftermath. While it remains to be seen what the inquiry's final conclusions will be, it is clear that the controversy surrounding this war shows little sign of fading away.
