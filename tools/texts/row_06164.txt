article: By . Leon Watson . Norman Foster has expressed his 'sadness' after his firm's controversial $350 million revamp of the New York Public Library was scrapped. The celebrated architect's company . Foster + Partners had been enlisted to redesign the Library's . century-old Beaux-Arts research building on Manhatten's Fifth Avenue. The plan had drawn widespread opposition from scholars and was the target of four lawsuits. One critic labelled the Foster design as having 'all the elegance and distinction of a suburban mall'. The New York Public Library has abandoned its $300 million plan to revamp its flagship midtown Manhattan building and move 1.5 million books to New Jersey . New York's new mayor Bill de Blasio also campaigned against the renovations during last year's municipal elections. And only last week hundreds of protesters gathered outside . the building during a meeting of trustees. But the most obvious reason . for the U-turn is the project's increasing price tag. Foster + Partners declined to . comment, but Lord Foster told The New York Times: 'Obviously, I respect . the decision of the trustees and whoever's been involved in the . decision. 'If I have any . kind of sadness on the thing – besides obviously not having the project . going ahead and having spent a huge amount of passion on the project . with colleagues – it is that the proposals have never been revealed, and . there hasn't really been a debate by those involved, including those . who would have benefited from an inclusive approach to the library.' British architect Norman Foster has expressed his 'sadness' that his firm's plan to revamp the New York Public Library has been scrapped . The renovation would have involved moving 1.5 million books from stacks in the Fifth Avenue building to storage in New Jersey . New York's new mayor Bill de Blasio also campaigned against the renovations during last year's municipal elections . The plan involved closing and selling two midtown branch libraries. Their functions would have been consolidated inside the main research library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, which would have become a circulating library. The New York Times, which first reported the library's about-face, said probable cost overruns were one factor in the decision. It said a study showed the project's cost would have been significantly more than the $300 million originally budgeted. The renovation would have involved moving 1.5 million books from stacks in the Fifth Avenue building to storage in New Jersey. Scholars complained that moving so many books would have created hardships for researchers. The revised plan still will involve renovating the research library, formally known as the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, while keeping the stacks intact. The renovation was to have been partly financed with $150 million from the city budget. That money still will go to the library but now will be used for other purposes.

chatgpt: London-based architecture firm Foster + Partners was recently enlisted to redesign the research building of the New York Public Library. The original plan was to transform the space into a massive public lending library, which would serve as a hub for New Yorkers to access knowledge and information. However, the firm's drawings, which had not been made public, sparked protests and criticism from various quarters. One critic, in particular, went so far as to claim that the designs had "all the elegance and distinction of a suburban mall." This critique may have been a turning point in the story, as it prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to campaign against the proposed redesigns. De Blasio made clear his opposition to the designs, stating that the library's purpose was not to become a suburban shopping mall. As a result, the plans for the redesign, which had been in the works for several months, were abruptly dropped. The decision to halt the project marked a significant setback for Foster + Partners and its vision of a modern, state-of-the-art library space. It also highlighted the importance of community input and consultation when carrying out such projects. The controversy around the redesign of the New York Public Library was, in many ways, rooted in a disagreement over what the space should be used for. Some believed that it could better serve the community as a public lending library, while others argued that it should remain a research building. However, regardless of the intended use of the space, it is clear that any proposed redesign would need to balance functionality, accessibility, and aesthetic appeal. Foster + Partners' involvement in the project was undoubtedly a major draw for the New York Public Library, given the firm's impressive track record of creating iconic structures around the world. However, the recent backlash against the redesigns serves as a reminder that even the most reputable and experienced firms need to engage in open dialogue and consultation with the community before proceeding with any project. Ultimately, the episode surrounding the New York Public Library's research building serves as a cautionary tale for architects and designers everywhere, highlighting the importance of listening to the community and incorporating their feedback into any project. While the firm's vision for the space may have been ambitious and forward-thinking, it ultimately failed to gain the support it needed to move forward, highlighting the importance of communication and collaboration in the design process.
