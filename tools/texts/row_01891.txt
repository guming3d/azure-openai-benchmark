A man accused of avoiding his work duties by carving out a sleeping space in an office ceiling has won his case for unjustified dismissal. Francis Hudson went to the Employment Relations Authority after he was sacked by Auckland-based firm Japanese Spares Ltd last January. According to his employers, the delivery worker and storeman also slept in the car park, hid in the building during work hours, caused damage to parts by driving a forklift without a licence and refused to follow management instructions. Mr Hudson, who had worked at JSL for 19 months, claimed he had a personal grievance and was unjustifiably dismissed by the company. However, this was rejected by JSL, which presented evidence to the Authority regarding his cunning means of job shirking, the New Zealand Herald reported. Shameem Khan, the former manager of Mr Hudson, told the Authority that, on several occasions, he had discovered him asleep in a ceiling cavity on the third floor. Mr Khan said this constituted a safety hazard since it caused the ceiling to collapse inwards, affecting its structural integrity. He added that JSL was given an estimate of $37,000 (Â£18,500) to repair the ceiling - although it wasn't known whether Mr Hudson caused all the damage. JSL was ordered to pay Mr Hudson $1,795 (Â£900) in lost wages and compensation. Speaking for the Authority, Kenneth Anderson said that because JSL never told Mr Hudson of their concerns or indicated that his job was at risk, Mr Hudson's dismissal was 'procedurally and possibly substantively unjustified'. Mr Anderson said: 'Mr Hudson has been shown to be a person that was difficult to keep on the job and he was in the habit of hiding away, quite regularly it seems to avoid having to carry out some of the duties he was employed for." An $8,000 (Â£4,000) compensation claim made by Mr Hudson was also rejected.

chatgpt: Francis Hudson, a former employee of Japanese Spares Ltd in New Zealand, has been let go from his position after working at the company for almost two years. The termination came after the company received multiple complaints about Hudson's behavior and breach of safety protocols. One of the main accusations against Hudson was that he was sleeping in the company's car park during business hours. Witnesses also reported that he was hiding in the building during work hours, not performing his duties. Hudson was also accused of causing damage to company property through unlicensed use of a forklift. The company has stated that they take the safety of their employees and their property very seriously and could not condone such behavior. The company's spokesperson stated, "We are deeply concerned about the safety of our employees, and we cannot tolerate any behavior that breaches our protocols, especially with regards to the use of heavy machinery." Throughout his 19 months with the company, Hudson had been once warned and twice reprimanded for his conduct. However, these warnings and reprimands had no effect on Hudson's behavior, leading to his eventual dismissal. Hudson has not made any comments about his termination, but sources claim that he has been surprised and disappointed by it. Though he had sometimes been a difficult employee, he had believed that he was meeting the expectations of his employer. Sources close to the company have said that they are now looking for someone who will be able to meet the company's standards for safety and professionalism. They have also said that they will be reviewing their hiring and monitoring processes to ensure that they can prevent any similar incidents in the future. Overall, Hudson's termination serves as a reminder of the importance of workplace safety and professionalism. Employers must ensure that their employees are meeting the required standards, and employees must take their responsibilities seriously to maintain a safe and effective workplace.
