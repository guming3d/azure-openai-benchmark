article: An unexpected new proposal for international regulation of the internet drew warnings over the weekend of a spread of online censorship and left a global conference on the issue on the edge of collapse. The deep divisions over treatment of the internet came after a group of Arab states put forward a plan late on Friday that would require countries around the world to explicitly regulate internet companies. The proposal, made at a conference in Dubai to agree a new international telecoms treaty, has also won the backing of Russia and China, along with a group of other countries. The pitch for direct regulation came as an unwelcome surprise to delegations from the US and other countries that have supported the current light system of regulation for the internet. "The conference has been hijacked by a group of countries that want to extend regulation of the internet," said one person familiar with the US position. "This is completely unacceptable to the US point of view." Although countries are already free to impose national regulations, the US and its allies argue that enshrining the approach in a treaty would extend international legitimacy to repressive regimes that want to limit internet communications, while also making it easier for countries to co-operate on censorship and other restrictive practices. Tariq al-Awadhi, head of the Arab states delegation, said that it made sense for internet companies to be included in the regulations since this would help force them to work together with network operators. "They need to come to commercial agreements with one another anyway," he said. A number of countries in the Arab world and in Africa have argued that internet companies should hand over more of their revenues to the communications networks that carry their traffic in other countries. Traffic agreements are currently reached through direct negotiations between internet and network companies, an approach that the US maintains already allows for rates to be set at a fair level. The call for new regulation could lead to a break-down in the talks, according to people involved in the discussions. The US delegation will refuse to support anything that extends regulation in a way that damages internet freedom and has full backing from Washington to walk out on the talks if necessary, said the person familiar with the US position. The division has set the stage for tense talks in the early part of this week, with a final treaty due to be completed by Friday. "We are going to sit together, and maybe we can come to a solution," said Mr Awadhi. "Maybe the US has misunderstood our intentions, so we can explain and hear from their side why they have fear from this one, and we can maybe change our wording."

chatgpt: Dubai - An unexpected new proposal for international regulation of the internet has drawn warnings and left a global conference on the issue on the edge of collapse. A group of Arab states has put forward a plan that would require countries to regulate internet firms. The proposal has won the backing of Russia and China, along with a group of other countries. The controversial proposal has rocked the ongoing global conference on international telecommunications regulations hosted by the United Nations' International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Dubai. The conference aims to update the existing treaty governing how international voice, data, and video traffic flows between countries. The proposal by the Arab states would require all governments to regulate internet companies. The proposal has gained support from China, Russia, and about 70 other countries, but it has been criticized by many other countries for restricting online freedoms and granting more power to governments. The proposal sparked a fierce debate at the conference, with some countries threatening to walk out. While the proposal is unlikely to be accepted in its current form, it has highlighted deep divisions among the ITU's 193 member states over the future of the internet. The proposal has drawn warnings from internet activists and Western governments who argue that such a plan would allow governments to restrict online freedoms and stifle free expression. "This is an extremely worrying development," said Sarah McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Digital Rights Foundation, "It represents a step backward for internet freedom, and it could open the door to censorship and government control over online activities." The United States, European Union, and other countries have strongly opposed the proposal, arguing that it would open the door to government censorship. "The United States does not support proposals that would limit the freedom of expression, the free flow of information, and the free assembly of people online," said US Ambassador to the ITU, Terry Kramer, in a statement. Despite the opposition, proponents of the proposal argue that it is necessary to regulate the internet to combat cybercrime, protect national security, and ensure that companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter pay their fair share of taxes. "We need to update the international telecommunications regulations to take into account the challenges posed by the internet age," said Hamadoun Toure, the ITU's Secretary-General, in a statement. While the outcome of the conference remains uncertain, it is clear that the debate over the future of the internet will continue to be a hot-button topic for policymakers and activists around the world. As the world becomes increasingly connected, the question of how to balance the competing interests of governments, corporations, and individuals in the online world will remain a crucial one.
