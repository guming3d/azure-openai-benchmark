article: Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A 14-year-old Australian boy accused of marijuana possession could face jail time on the resort island of Bali. With his face covered in a black mask, the teenager was mobbed by the media as he entered a local court complex for the first day of his trial Tuesday. Earlier, prosecutor Gusti Gede Putu Atmaja said the judge would not wear his usual robe to try to minimize stress on the boy. The trial is closed to the public. The Australian teen -- whose name has not been publicly released -- faces three charges under Indonesia's stringent narcotics laws. The most serious charge of possession, under article 111, carries a sentence of up to six years. The teen is also charged with drug use under article 127, which could result in a maximum sentence of four years. The least serious charge, under article 128, relates to drug use by minors and takes into account a person's history of drug use. This charge does not hold criminal liability and could send the teen to rehabilitation instead of jail. "We are optimistic, and we hope that we will get the result we want -- that he be returned to his parents and avoids jail time," said the teen's lawyer, Mohammad Rifan. But the prosecutor stressed that article 128 stipulates a minor's parents should report the drug use to Indonesian authorities. Any actions taken by his guardians in his home country are not recognized in Indonesia. If the teen does face a jail sentence, "The sentence may be as short as a few months," Atmaja said. The boy could also receive credit for time served. The prosecution presented two witnesses at the trial Tuesday. Rifan, the defense attorney, said he expects a quick decision in the trial, with twice-weekly court hearings that could end by mid-November. "The boy was under stress from the media attention but was otherwise in relatively good condition during the court hearing," Rifan said. The teen's next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The teen has been detained since his October 4 arrest, after allegedly buying 3.6 grams of cannabis off the streets. He was on vacation with his parents in Bali, a popular tourist destination for many Australians. He was initially detained at a police headquarters but was recently moved to an immigration detention center. Australian officials and the teen's lawyer lobbied intensively to have him released, but prosecutors announced last week that the minor would stand trial. Indonesia anti-drugs laws are considered strict. Visitors to the country are warned, upon arrival, that some drug crimes carry a maximum penalty of death. Still, many have been arrested and convicted for various drug offenses. Two Australians are on death row in Bali's Kerobokan prison. Six other Australians are serving life sentences.

chatgpt: A teenage boy who was arrested for marijuana possession in Bali has been detained since his October 4, 2020 arrest. The teen was on vacation with his parents on the beautiful Indonesian island when he was caught in possession of the drug. He has been staying in a detention center since his arrest, waiting for his fate to be determined. Indonesia, like many other Southeast Asian countries, has a strict no-tolerance policy when it comes to drugs. The possession of even small amounts of marijuana can result in long prison sentences, and in some cases, even death. However, the teen may yet avoid such severe punishment. Instead of sentencing him to jail, the Indonesian authorities are considering sending the teen to a rehabilitation facility. This is in line with the countryâ€™s policy of rehabilitating drug offenders rather than punishing them. The hope is that the teen will be able to address his drug problem and avoid future troubles with the law. The move to send the teen to rehab instead of prison is a departure from Indonesia's past approach. The country has previously been known for taking a harsh stance on drug crimes. It is often seen as a country where the mere possession of drugs can lead to very severe consequences. For example, in 2015, nine foreigners were executed for drug trafficking. The decision to send the teen to rehab has been welcomed by many human rights activists who have criticized Indonesia's drug policy. They believe that sending people to rehab rather than prison is a more humane approach to treating drug addiction. However, not everyone supports this decision. Some argue that drug use is a criminal offense that should be punished by law. They fear that the authorities' decision to send the teen to rehab instead of jail could send the wrong message, implying that drug use is not a serious crime. Others still believe that the teen should face jail time, as drug use can have a significant impact on the community. Despite differing opinions, the authorities' decision to send the teen to rehab has highlighted the need for better drug policy in Indonesia. Many believe that the country's use of harsh punishments for drug offenses does very little to address the root causes of drug addiction. Advocates of a more humane approach argue that treating drug addiction as a disease rather than a crime is the key to effective results. As the teen waits to see whether he will be sent to rehab, his case has sparked much discussion around Indonesia's drug policy. It remains to be seen whether the decision to send him to rehab will set a precedent for future cases or remain an isolated incident. Either way, this decision will have far-reaching implications for millions of Indonesians living with drug addiction.
