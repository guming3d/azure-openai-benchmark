The government says one in 10 youths at juvenile detention facilities around the country reported having been sexually victimized by staff or by other youths. The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that among the more than 1,300 youths who reported victimization by adult staff, 9 out of 10 were male juvenile detainees reporting sexual activity with female staff members. According to the bureau, about 2.5 per cent of juveniles, or 450, reported a sexual incident involving another youth last year, and 7.7 per cent, or 1,390, reported an incident involving facility staff. Victims: Young males made up more than 90 per cent of the juvenile population at the facilities surveyed . Georgia, Illinois, Ohio and South Carolina each had a sexual victimization rate of more than 15 per  cent. Delaware, Massachusetts, New York and the District of Columbia had no reported incidents of sexual victimization. The survey mandated by the Prison Rape Elimination Act defines sexual victimization as any unwanted sexual activity between youth and all sexual activity between youth and adult staff. Young males made up more than 90 per cent of the juvenile population at the facilities surveyed, and women accounted for nearly 45 per cent of the staff. The survey was conducted between February and September 2012 in 273 state-owned or operated juvenile facilities and 53 local or privately operated facilities that held youths under state contract. Abuse around the nation: Juvenile facilities with the highest rates of sexual victimization in the USA . Facilities around the US: State-owned or operated and privately owned juvenile detention centers are dotted around the USA . The survey covered incidents in the previous 12 months. One in five victims of staff sexual misconduct reported experiencing physical force or threats. One in five said they were given drugs or alcohol to engage in sexual contact. 'It's deeply troubling that staff – the very people charged with helping these young people turn their lives around – are the primary perpetrators of sexual abuse,' said Lovisa Stannow, executive director of Just Detention International, an advocacy group. 'Today's report illustrates the fundamental failure of many juvenile detention facilities to keep their youth safe, and to demand that staff uphold the most basic standards of professional behavior.' There was marked improvement in the figures between 2008-09 and 2012. The rate of sexual victimization dropped from 12.6 per cent to 9.9 per cent in that period. 'These numbers are both devastating and hopeful,' said Stannow. 'They show clearly that it is possible to protect young detainees from the devastation of sexual abuse.'

chatgpt: A recent report released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics sheds light on the prevalence of sexual victimization in juvenile detention facilities across the United States. The report analyzed data from the 2018 Survey of Sexual Victimization, which was conducted in 328 juvenile detention facilities in the country. According to the report, 2.5% of reports involved another youth, and 7.7% involved facility staff. Of those abused, 90% were male juvenile detainees reporting sexual activity with female staff. This trend is particularly concerning because sexual activity between staff and detainees is a clear violation of state and federal laws, which prohibit sexual contact between adults and minors, particularly those in custody. The report also identified certain states where the prevalence of sexual victimization was particularly high. Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, and South Carolina each had a sexual victimization rate of more than 15%. These states need to take immediate measures to address the alarming issue of sexual abuse within juvenile detention facilities. The report highlights the urgent need for more effective prevention and intervention measures to protect juveniles who are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse while in detention. Many juveniles come from backgrounds of trauma, abuse, and neglect. They are often placed in detention as a result of their involvement with the criminal justice system, adding yet another layer of vulnerability to their already precarious situation. The fact that the majority of the sexual abuse incidents involved male detainees and female staff is particularly alarming. This suggests that staff members in detention facilities may be using their positions of authority to manipulate and exploit juvenile detainees for their own sexual gratification. There are various reasons why this kind of abuse is allowed to occur, including the lack of proper oversight and insufficient training for staff members. The report recommends several measures to address these issues, including improving accountability and transparency within detention facilities, providing additional training for staff members on how to recognize and report incidents of sexual abuse, and establishing clear protocols for responding to reported incidents. It is clear that more needs to be done to protect the vulnerable population of juveniles in detention facilities across the United States from the scourge of sexual abuse. The findings of the 2018 Survey of Sexual Victimization highlight the need for improved prevention and intervention measures to ensure that future generations of juvenile detainees are not subjected to the same kinds of abuse and trauma suffered by countless others before them.
