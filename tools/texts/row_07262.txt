But now it seems that you can change people's perceptions - just by choosing the right foundation. Speaking to the Sunday Times Style magazine, French neuroscientist Dr Arnaud Aubert revealed that imperfections can distract the brain, with the result that people with less than flawless skin are ranked lower on the social scale than they otherwise might be. What's more, make-up can also help boost your chances of success in everything from career to love, if Aubert is to be believed. Essential: Make-up can make you appear more trustworthy, likeable and attractive to other people . According to the scientist, who has authored a number of studies reflecting on the links between make-up, appearance and the way people perceive others, the 'social triangle' - the area from the eyes down to the mouth - is key to success. 'All the social information is in the centre of the face,' explains Aubert. 'If the brain is distracted by imperfections [such as spots], it processes less and so has a weaker social assessment of the person it is looking at.' Aubert's contention is backed by a 2011 study by beauty giant Proctor & Gamble that looked at how people reacted to women of all ages and ethnicities in and out of make-up. According to Nancy Etcoff, the lead scientist, those who wore make-up were seen as more likeable, trustworthy, attractive and competent. Gwyneth Paltrow shows off flawless skin but Lady Gaga's heavy make-up could make her seem untrustworthy . Flawless: Concealer can help reduce brain-distracting imperfections - boosting social capital in the process . Even those with thick make-up, although considered less trustworthy, were still thought to be more attractive and competent than those wearing nothing at all. This is something with which Lisa Eldridge, a leading make-up artist, can agree. 'I think make-up is a bit of a calling card because it's the first place you look,' Eldridge told the Sunday Times. 'If someone is wearing too much make-up, it can affect the way people talk to them, especially in the workplace. Bad make-up just looks terrible and can be a hindrance: poorly applied and matched foundation or false eyelashes worn to the office, for example, is too much of a distraction.' The solution? Keep it light, don't forget the BB cream and save make-up free days for the weekend.

chatgpt: French scientist Dr. Arnaud Aubert has recently revealed how flaws can be a distraction to the brain and detrimental to social appeal, which could be problematic for those in search of love. His research findings could change the way people view their physical appearance and their pursuit of love. Dr. Aubert's research has shown that the brain is wired to scan faces and measure faces based on symmetry, proportion, and clarity of skin. Faces with blemishes or asymmetrical features are more likely to distract the brain from evaluating the person's natural beauty, thus diminishing their perceived social appeal. These findings could have a significant impact on people who are looking for love. The pressure to conform to societal standards of beauty can lead people to alter their appearance with makeup, plastic surgery, or other procedures. However, if these modifications do not improve the natural symmetry and clarity of the face, they could be perceived as a distraction to the brain and lower the person’s social appeal. Make-up artist Lisa Aldridge agrees that getting the right look is crucial not only for beauty but also for career success. She notes that while makeup can enhance a person’s natural features, it is important not to cover up too many flaws, as that can have the opposite effect. Aldridge advises her clients to “love their flaws” and embrace them instead of hiding them. Aldridge also notes that traditional beauty standards are evolving, and people are becoming more accepting of flaws. This shift in perception is reflected in the increasing popularity of the "no-makeup" look, which highlights a person’s natural beauty without any artificial enhancements. The beauty industry has also responded to this change in attitude. Many cosmetic companies now offer products that promote a more natural look, such as foundation that matches a person's skin tone perfectly or products that enhance the natural texture of a person's hair. In conclusion, Dr. Aubert's research shows that our brains are hard-wired to evaluate facial symmetry, proportion, and clarity of skin when assessing social appeal. While the pressure to conform to traditional beauty standards can be intense, beauty is not just about superficial features. Instead, it's about love, acceptance, and embracing one's unique flaws. Aldridge advises that getting the right look is key to career success, but it's important to always focus on enhancing natural beauty rather than hiding flaws.
