article: ITV are preparing to go head-to-head with the BBC for the rights to Match of the Day as they consider a bid for the rights to Premier League highlights. The broadcaster, which last held the rights for Premier League highlights between 2001-04,  is considering a bid to get them back with the BBC's current £60million per year deal set to expire at the end of next season. The potential move adds a layer of intrigue to the Premier League rights bidding that is set to take place next year, with BT Sport looking to further threaten Sky Sports stranglehold on the live broadcasting of matches.

Last time ITV held Premier League highlights rights, they signed Des Lynam from the BBC to host and attempted to switch the show from its regular late night slot on a  to Saturday prime time - but with little success. ITV have declined to comment on whether they are set to launch such a bid, but it is likely that any highlights show would be hosted by Adrian Chiles and feature regular pundits such as Lee Dixon and Andy Townsend. Chiles used to host Match of the Day 2 on the BBC until his switch to ITV ahead of the 2010 World Cup. Gary Lineker is the current host of Match of the Day on Saturday night on the BBC . The highlights show is currently celebrating its 50th anniversary on the BBC this season . In an interview with the Guardian earlier this month, the BBC's head of TV sport Philip Bernie spoke in praise of Match of the Day, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. 'It has bucked the trend. But it is a unique proposition,' explained Bernie. 'People can get the clips they want to, they can watch Football First if they want to, they can watch the 12.45pm match on a Saturday and yet they still come to Match of the Day because it’s a great digest and it’s different to all those other things.'

chatgpt: ITV, one of the largest broadcasters in the UK, is preparing to go head-to-head with the BBC for the rights to the Premier League highlights. According to insiders, ITV is considering presenting a bid for the rights to Match of the Day, the BBC's flagship football highlights show, which is currently watched by millions of viewers every week. The BBC's current deal, which is worth an estimated £60 million per year, is set to expire at the end of next season. The rights are expected to go up for auction in the coming months, with several broadcasters expected to put in their bids. ITV last held the rights to the Premier League highlights between 2001 and 2004, before the BBC won the rights in a lucrative deal that has since become synonymous with the league itself. Now, ITV seems eager to regain its place among the likes of the BBC and Sky Sports, which also hold the rights to some of the Premier League matches. However, with the BBC's long-standing success with Match of the Day, it is unclear how successful ITV's bid will be. The show is widely regarded as one of the most popular sports programmes in the UK, with its expert analysis and in-depth coverage of the Premier League matches. Nonetheless, ITV believes that it can provide a unique offering to the viewers, having built on its sports coverage in recent years with events such as the Rugby Six Nations and the World Cup, which saw them beat the BBC in terms of peak audience figures. The company is also said to be looking at expanding its football coverage with the UEFA Champions League that begins next year. If ITV is successful in its bid, it could potentially mean a huge shift in the way that football highlights are broadcast in the UK. Not only would the viewers have a new broadcaster to choose from, but this could also cause a change in programming timings or even presenters for the show. Despite the BBC's current stronghold on the Premier League highlights, ITV's bold move signals a new era in UK sports broadcasting. With the rights up for grabs, it remains to be seen which broadcaster will come out on top. But one thing is for sure: the fight for the rights to the Premier League highlights is going to be a fierce one.
