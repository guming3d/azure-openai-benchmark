David Lee, 37, ignored 140 tickets in one year after parking his Ford Mondeo across disabled bays in dozens of private car parks across Lincoln.

David Lee, 37, from Lincolnshire,  ignored more than 140 parking tickets in one year and faces a £14,000 fine . And the firm intends to issue a further £10,000 worth of charges before the courts, as well as an estimated £1,000 in costs. His total bill is higher than that racked up by footballer Mario Balotelli, who was hit with nearly £10,000 in parking fines when he played for Manchester City in 2011. Mr Lee's Ford Mondeo was often ticketed for being parked across disabled bays as well as being carelessly left across multiple spots. He  left unpaid and damaged parking tickets on the car's dashboard - with a notice labelling the Leeds firm 'UK Car Park Scammers'. His Ford Mondeo was often  left across disabled spots, pictured with an Audi not believed to belong to him . Mr Lee carelessly left his car across multiple disabled bays in private car parks across Lincoln . He also wrote a note claiming the charges were unenforceable. Speaking outside his £100,000 semi-detached house in Scampton, near Lincoln, Mr Lee said: 'I am very embarrassed about all this.' Steve Hall, UKCPS legal manager, said: 'This is one of the highest parking charge debts to be served on a single motorist in the UK for parking on private land. 'Four of the undefended county court judgements amount to £3,265, with an additional £10,000 still to be issued. 'The vehicle was often parked across more than one bay. On many occasions, the charges were for parking out of marked bays and without authority. 'The vehicle dashboard was clearly visible for all passing people to see, scattered with unpaid parking tickets. He left unpaid and damaged parking tickets on the car's dashboard and left abusive messages . 'UKCPS have had letters returned to us by Mr Lee after being cut up into small pieces. 'Staff have reconstructed the relevant section of the pages to discover the parking charge numbers referred back to the vehicle.' Mr Lee, who lives in Scampton, Lincolnshire, attended Lincoln County Court earlier this month. But UKCPS said they have not received any money from the driver. A spokeswoman for the British Parking Association said: 'UKCPS are a member of our organisation and operate under our code of practice. 'They have every right to take people to court.'

chatgpt: A man from Lincolnshire has accumulated a staggering £14,000 in parking fines. David Lee, 37, has reportedly been parking his Ford Mondeo across disabled bays and taking up multiple spots. In addition to his parking habits, Lee has reportedly left abusive notes on his dashboard, claiming that the fines being imposed on him are "unenforceable". Lee has already been served with four court judgements, totalling in excess of £3,000. However, UK Car Parking Solutions (UKCPS) is looking to issue even larger fines against him. The company is planning to issue £10,000 in additional charges, and £1,000 in costs, bringing the total bill to more than £24,000. This is significantly greater than the £10,000 parking fine that was issued to footballer Mario Balotelli for his Maserati a few years ago. According to reports, Lee has been parking his car in various locations across Lincolnshire, including at supermarkets and shopping centres. Despite the fact that he has repeatedly been slapped with parking fines and court judgements, he has seemingly continued to flout parking regulations. The latest developments come after reports emerged that UKCPS had appointed debt collectors to chase after Lee in order to recover the fines that he owes. The debt collectors are said to have sent letters and made phone calls to Lee in an attempt to secure the payments that are owed. Lee has yet to comment on the situation, but it is understood that he is facing mounting pressure to pay off his parking fines. If he fails to settle the debts that he owes, it is likely that his vehicle could be seized by debt collectors, or he could face further legal sanctions. The issue of parking fines has long been a contentious one in the UK, with many motorists complaining about the seemingly profiteering practices of private parking companies. While some argue that the fines that are imposed are excessive and disproportionate, others maintain that they are necessary in order to deter individuals from parking illegally. Regardless of one's views on the matter, it seems clear that David Lee's parking habits have landed him in hot water, with fines totalling in the tens of thousands of pounds. Whether he will be able to settle his debts and avoid any further legal repercussions remains to be seen.
