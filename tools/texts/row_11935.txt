Liverpool's pre-season tour of the United States promises to be an exciting affair, with the club looking to build on their impressive performances last season. With Gerrard on board, the Reds will no doubt be looking to add another trophy to their collection, and his experience and leadership will undoubtedly prove invaluable as they seek to do so. Overall, it's great to see Steven Gerrard enjoying some well-deserved downtime with his wife in Ibiza.
