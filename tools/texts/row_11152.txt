article: Gus Poyet believes it is a ‘disgrace’ that Premier League teams play twice in 48 hours between Christmas and New Year. Sunderland were beaten 3-1 by Hull on Boxing Day and travel to Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon. Poyet, though, has hit out at the festive fixture schedule.

Sunderland (4-1-4-1): Pantilimon; Vergini, O’Shea, Coates, Jones; Cattermole; Johnson, Gomez, Larsson, Giaccherini; Wickham . ‘We shouldn't be playing (on Sunday),’ said the Uruguayan. ‘I've been in England for a long time and I know that Boxing Day games are a tradition and I accept that and think we should maintain it. ‘But I think that then playing on the 28th is a disgrace. We shouldn't be playing then, we shouldn't. ‘If you want to see the best players performing well, you need to make sure you are not playing every two days. ‘It is not needed. That is not tradition and anyone who says it is, is not telling the truth.’ Poyet shouts out instructions from the technical area during Sunderland's loss to Hull City . The defeat came in stark contrast to last weekend's euphoric late win in the Tyne-Wear derby . Connor Wickham returns from suspension while Emanuele Giaccherini could make his first start since September. Patrick van Aanholt (shoulder) and Anthony Reveillere (calf) remain sidelined. The Black Cats failed to build on the euphoria of their Tyne-Wear derby win against Hull and their second-half performance was among their worst of the season. And Poyet says the only consolation of the 48-hour turnaround is the chance to make amends for that poor showing. ‘One of the good things is that we play again in two days - that's the only good thing about it,’ he added. ‘We need to perform better. Better decisions on the ball, not hurry and get carried away with the noise and the fans pushing us forward. ‘We have some qualities and we need to respect those qualities. For us, it is important to believe in what we do and not what people think we should be doing.’

chatgpt: Sunderland manager, Gus Poyet, has criticized the busy and demanding schedule of the Premier League during the festive period. The Black Cats will be travelling to Villa Park to face Aston Villa, only two days after their 3-1 defeat to Hull City on the Boxing Day fixture. Speaking ahead of the match, Poyet expressed his frustration towards the scheduling of fixtures. He said that playing two matches in such close proximity is not part of the traditional fixture programme, and it makes it difficult for the players to recover and perform at their best. He added that the hectic festive programme often leads to injuries and fatigue, which in turn affects the performance of the teams. He urged the Premier League officials to consider re-evaluating the schedule and providing more time for the teams to recover between matches. The Sunderland boss pointed out that other top leagues worldwide, such as the Spanish La Liga and the Italian Serie A, enjoy a winter break of at least two weeks, which allows the players ample rest and recovery time. He also cited the example of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League, which have more flexible schedules and allow clubs to play at least a week apart. Poyet's comments come amid a growing debate about the fixture congestion during the festive period in the Premier League. Several managers, players and pundits have voiced their concerns about the impact of the tight schedule on the players' health and performance. Last season, Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, criticized the festive fixtures schedule, labeling it as 'insane'. The legendary Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, also called for a winter break in English football, citing the need for players to recover and prevent injuries. Despite the concerns, the Premier League has so far opted to maintain the traditional festive fixture programme, arguing that it is an integral part of the league's tradition and attracts huge audiences worldwide. The Sunderland vs Aston Villa match is scheduled to take place on Sunday afternoon, and it remains to be seen how the Black Cats will cope with the grueling schedule. The teams are set to face each other in what promises to be a thrilling encounter and an opportunity for both sides to achieve a vital win.
