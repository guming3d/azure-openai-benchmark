article: Two Australian men think they may be in possession of the world's oldest burger, after they kept a Quarter Pounder with cheese bought for a friend who never turned up to eat it. When  Eduard Neetz and Casey Dean were 13 an 14 respectively, they took a trip to their local McDonald's restaurant in Adelaide to grab some food after a party. The men picked up an extra for their mate Jono who never showed. That was 20 years ago. Jono told the boys to hold on to his meal until next time he came to visit as a joke, and 'he hasn't been back yet', the men toldÂ The Project. Scroll down for video .

After all that time kept behind closed doors, Casey told the program it was time to 'free the burger' and boys have released a song on iTunes dedicated to their 'Senior Burger'.

Despite all The Project hosts trying to get Eduard and Casey to take a bite out of the age-old snack and the men playing along, quite quickly they flat out refused. 'No way you guys are sick!' Casey laughed. 'It's a 20-year-old burger we're not eating it, no way.' The men have set up a website, Twitter account and Facebook page for Senior Burger, where fans can purchase merchandise and listen to their serenade to the Quarter Pounder.

chatgpt: It's been 20 years since Eduard Neetz and Casey Dean made a purchase that still has people talking. In 1995, the duo decided to buy a Quarter Pounder from their local McDonald's with the intention of giving it to their friend Jono. However, Jono never showed up to eat the meal, and that's when the Quarter Pounder began its journey as a piece of fast food history. Instead of tossing the uneaten burger, Neetz and Dean decided to hold onto it. They locked it up, hoping to preserve it as long as possible. And that's exactly what they did. Two decades later, the Quarter Pounder still looks the same as the day it was made, but it's as hard as a brick. The duo recently brought the burger out of hiding for an interview with ABC News. Neetz and Dean appeared on the Australian news program "The Project" to share the story of the Quarter Pounder and show off their prized possession. Despite being exposed to air and kept in storage for an extended period, the Quarter Pounder maintains its original appearance. Its meat patty is still intact, complete with the classic shape of a McDonald's burger. The bun, too, looks unchanged, but with a much darker hue than a freshly made burger would have. The results are visually striking, both intriguing and disturbing. While the burger may have retained its appearance, its texture is far from what you'd expect from a fast-food burger. According to Neetz, it's "hard as a rock" and "completely petrified." Attempts to cut it with a fork or knife have been unsuccessful, and the burger remains unchewed. After two decades, Neetz and Dean continue to treasure the Quarter Pounder, even though it's unlikely they'll ever eat it. They're not the only ones interested in the story, either. The burger has become something of a legend, with people from around the globe contacting the pair over the years to ask about it. Although it may seem strange to keep a burger for two decades, Neetz and Dean's actions showcase how food can be more than mere sustenance. This burger has become a memento of a shared experience, a symbol of friendship and a time gone by. While the Quarter Pounder may be hard as a rock, it's a reminder that memories can last a lifetime, even if the physical remains of those memories are inedible.
