article: An HIV scare involving a porn movie actor has spurred another call to halt production in California's adult film industry. The Free Speech Coalition, a California-based trade group representing the industry is calling for a three-day production moratorium following a possible HIV exposure on an out-of-state film set. The Los Angeles Times reports the group called for the halt on Wednesday but didn't name the state where the film set was located. The Free Speech Coalition, a California-based trade group representing the industry is calling for a three-day production moratorium following a possible HIV exposure on an out-of-state film set . The coalition last called for an industry moratorium in August after a report that a performer tested positive for HIV. However, it lifted the two-day ban after determining the test result was a false positive. The group's CEO, Diane Duke, says she's working with public health officials, the production company and the performer to investigate the incident. She said: 'As with past production holds, we ask that people refrain from speculation until more news is forthcoming, and respect performer privacy'. Production of porn movies has shifted away from California since a law requiring actors to wear condoms was passed . An announcement is expected Friday on whether production can resume and whether performers should have additional HIV testing. Production of porn movies has shifted away from California since a law requiring actors to wear condoms was passed. Last year only 40 permits for adult productions were issued across the city and county - a 90 per cent drop from 2012 when the measure was passed. Porn production crews are now said to be mostly traveling to Nevada, Southern California, Florida, and Eastern Europe to film. Porn production crews are now said to be mostly traveling to Nevada, Southern California, Florida, and Eastern Europe to film . An earlier moratorium ended last September, at which point performers became required to test for HIV and other STIs every 14 days instead of every 28. Prior to that, a performer who goes by the name Cameron Bay made national headlines when she tested positive for HIV followed by her adult film actor boyfriend. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which successfully fought to require condoms for porn actors in Los Angeles city and county,  said it underscored the need for statewide action.

chatgpt: Following a possible HIV exposure among adult film performers, advocates are calling for a three-day production moratorium. This call echoes a similar one in August 2019, when a performer tested positive, only for it to be revealed later as a false positive. In 2012, California lawmakers passed a bill that required actors in the adult entertainment industry to wear condoms during all productions. However, the law has not been universally embraced and now production has shifted to states like Nevada, Florida, and even to Eastern Europe. The most recent call for a production moratorium comes as concerns grow about the possibility of HIV exposure in the industry. Given the nature of the work, where performers are expected to engage in unprotected sex, the risk of transmission is higher. It is not surprising, therefore, that performers and advocates are insisting on taking every precaution possible. Those who support the ban say that it is necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of performers. However, some in the industry are skeptical, seeing the call for a moratorium as yet another attempt to regulate the industry. One such skeptic is adult film actor and director, Mike Quasar. He believes that the push for regulations is motivated more by politics than a genuine concern for performers. "It seems like they're trying to drive the industry out of California," he said. "They don't really care about performers. They just want to make a statement and score political points." Despite the pushback from some within the industry, the call for a production moratorium is likely to gain traction. Advocates argue that performers should not have to take unnecessary risks with their health simply to earn a living. It remains to be seen whether the industry will be able to come to a consensus on the best way to move forward. Some believe that more stringent testing procedures and tighter regulation are the key, while others argue that the industry should be left to regulate itself. Ultimately, it is clear that the issue of HIV exposure in the adult entertainment industry is a complex one, with no clear-cut solutions. While advocates and industry insiders continue to debate the best course of action, performers and audiences alike will be looking on with interest, eager to see how this issue is resolved.
