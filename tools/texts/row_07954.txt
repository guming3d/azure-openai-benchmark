article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Hollywood will produce at least two versions of the controversial story of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Fox Searchlight Pictures confirmed Wednesday that it will make a movie based on the 2012 Rolling Stone article "America's Last Prisoner of War."

The Fox Searchlight film will be written and directed by Todd Field, best known for his Oscar-nominated movies "In the Bedroom" and "Little Children," studio spokesman Russell Nelson said. Bergdahl and his family have not given up any of their life rights for the screenplay, Nelson said. But journalist Michael Hastings, who was killed in a Los Angeles car crash a year ago, had close access to Bergdahl's parents when he wrote the Rolling Stone article.

chatgpt: Fox Searchlight is set to produce a film based on the Rolling Stone article titled "America's Last Prisoner of War," which details the story of former US Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Bergdahl was held captive for five years by Taliban forces and later released in exchange for Taliban prisoners held by the US government in 2014. The film will be directed by Todd Field, known for his work on critically acclaimed films such as "In the Bedroom" and "Little Children." Field is known for his ability to create complex characters and his ability to navigate difficult subject matter. These qualities make him the perfect choice to bring Bergdahl's story to the big screen. Field is not the only prominent director working on a film about the Bergdahl story. Kathryn Bigelow, the director of "Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," is also working on a film based on the same subject matter. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's story is a highly controversial one. His 2014 release sparked widespread criticism, with many questioning the trade of Taliban prisoners for an American soldier. Some have also criticized Bergdahl's actions leading up to his capture, with some reports alleging that he intentionally walked off his base in Afghanistan. Despite the controversy surrounding his release, Bergdahl's story is a fascinating one. He was held captive for five years, enduring harsh treatment and searching for a way to escape. His eventual release was a highly publicized event, and his story has continued to be a topic of conversation in the years since. With two talented directors working on separate films about Bergdahl, it's clear that his story is one that deserves to be told. Bergdahl's experience highlights the difficult and complex nature of war, and the impact it can have on individuals and their families. As both films approach completion, audiences can look forward to gaining a greater understanding of the events that led to Bergdahl's imprisonment and eventual release.
