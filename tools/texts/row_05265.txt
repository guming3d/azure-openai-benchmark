article: (CNN) -- Four Americans were killed during a rocket attack at Bagram Air Base, outside of Kabul, a Pentagon official said Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force confirmed that four NATO coalition service members had been killed in an attack but did not disclose the nationality of the casualties or the exact location of the attack. ISAF said the four were killed in an "attack in eastern Afghanistan." The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, the group said in a statement. News of the casualties came as NATO-led troops transferred security responsibility to Afghan forces. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said he welcomes the U.S. troop withdrawal and insists his army can defend the country against the Taliban. "It is exactly our job to deal with it, and we are capable of dealing with it," Karzai told CNN's Christiane Amanpour earlier this year. Even so, there are concerns about the abilities of Afghan security forces to deal with the Taliban and other militant groups. The Taliban continue to carry out high-profile attacks in the capital, Kabul, even targeting the Afghan Supreme Court during a suicide attack in June. Another strike targeted a building near Kabul International Airport. On Tuesday, a suicide bomber attacked the convoy of Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, a member of parliament, killing three people and wounding 21 others. Three bodyguards were among the injured. Mohaqiq -- a Shiite and an ethnic Hazara -- is a member of Afghanistan's political opposition. American forces, now at about 66,000, are expected to drop to 32,000 by the end of the year. The plan is to withdraw all combat troops but keep a residual force in the country to help train Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism operations when needed. The size of that force is still being discussed.

chatgpt: In a statement released earlier today, the Taliban claimed responsibility for a deadly attack that took the lives of four NATO coalition service members at Bagram Air Base. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) confirmed that the attack took place at the military installation, but did not reveal any further details about the incident or the individuals involved. "We can confirm that four coalition service members have been killed in an attack at Bagram Air Base," said an ISAF spokesperson. "We extend our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in this senseless act of violence." The ISAF did not disclose the nationality of the service members who were killed, although it is believed that they were from NATO countries. The identities of the victims have not yet been released pending notification of their families. A Pentagon official also confirmed the attack, stating that it occurred in the early hours of the morning local time. "We can confirm that there was an attack at Bagram Air Base earlier today," said the official. "The situation is currently under investigation and no further details are available at this time." The attack comes just days after the Taliban announced the start of its annual spring offensive, which is expected to escalate violence across Afghanistan. The militant group has been waging a deadly insurgency against the Afghan government and its NATO allies for nearly two decades, and has recently stepped up its attacks as the country prepares for national elections later this year. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks in recent months, including a suicide bombing that killed 14 people in the Afghan city of Ghazni last week. The group has also targeted foreign embassies and international aid organizations, further underscoring the fragility of the security situation in the country. The attack at Bagram Air Base is a sobering reminder of the dangers faced by NATO coalition service members and Afghan civilians alike as the conflict in Afghanistan continues to rage on. The ISAF and its allies remain committed to supporting the Afghan government and securing a stable and peaceful future for the country, but the road ahead will undoubtedly be a difficult one.
