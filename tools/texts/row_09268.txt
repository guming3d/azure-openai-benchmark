Cheese helps reduce cavities forming in teeth because it neutralises plaque acid, according to a new study. Researchers found that the fermented dairy product made the mouth more alkaline, which in turn reduced the need for dental treatment. They also discovered that cheese created a protective film around teeth. Tuck in!: A U.S. study has finally given people an excuse to indulge in a cheese board. Cheddar raises the mouth's pH which reduces the risk of cavities . The higher the pH level (the more . alkaline) on the surface of teeth, the more teeth are protected against . dental erosion, which causes cavities and leads to fillings, . said the study. The research, carried out by the Academy of General Dentistry in the U.S., divided 68 children aged between 12 and 15 into three groups. One group was asked to consume a daily portion of cheddar, another a sugar-free yoghurt, and another a glass of milk, followed by a mouth . rinse. The pH levels on their dental plaque were measured both before the test and then ten minutes, 20 minutes and half an hour afterwards. Those who ate the yoghurt or drank the milk showed no changes to the pH levels in their mouths at any of the intervals, said lead researcher Vipul Yadav. But those who ate the cheese showed a 'rapid' increase in pH level at each of the time intervals. Cheese!: The dairy product was also found to create a protective film on teeth . The researchers believe that eating cheese increases the amount of saliva in the mouth which is the body's natural way of maintaining a healthy pH level. Added to this, cheese releases chemical compounds that can form a protective layer on teeth which further protects it against the acids that attack enamel. A spokesman for the research said: 'The groups who consumed milk and sugar-free yogurt experienced no changes in the pH levels in their mouths. 'Subjects who ate cheese, however, showed a rapid increase in pH levels at each time interval, suggesting that cheese has anti-cavity properties.' The results were published in the journal General Dentistry.

chatgpt: A new study conducted by the U.S. Academy of General Dentistry has provided some very interesting news in the world of dental health. The study concludes that eating cheese can boost the production of alkaline saliva, which helps to neutralize the acids in the mouth and prevent tooth decay. The researchers found that chewing cheese can also create a protective layer around the teeth that keeps remaining acids at bay. The findings were based on an experiment in which 68 participants were split into three groups. The first group ate cheese, the second ate sugar-free yogurt, and the third drank a glass of milk. The saliva of each participant was then tested for its pH levels and buffering capacity, which measures its ability to neutralize the acid in the mouth. The results showed that participants who ate cheese had significantly lower levels of acidity in their mouths than those who ate yogurt or drank milk. The cheese group also had higher buffering capacities, which means their saliva was better at neutralizing acid. The researchers noted that the protective benefits of cheese were likely due to its high calcium and phosphate content. These minerals help to remineralize the teeth and prevent the demineralization that leads to cavities and tooth decay. Despite the positive results for cheese, the study did not find it to be a substitute for good oral hygiene practices like brushing and flossing. The researchers emphasized that using mouthwash was still the best protection against cavities. The study's lead author, Dr. Jeffrey M. Cole, said in a statement that "eating cheese is not the magic bullet for preventing tooth decay, but it can provide some added protection, especially when paired with other good dental habits." Dr. Cole also noted that the study's findings could have implications for people with dry mouth, a condition in which the mouth produces less saliva and is therefore more susceptible to acid erosion. Eating cheese could help to increase the production of alkaline saliva and reduce the risk of tooth decay in people with dry mouth. Overall, the study's findings provide yet another reason to enjoy a cheesy snack. While it's not a substitute for good oral hygiene practices, eating cheese can certainly boost your oral health and provide some added protection against cavities. So the next time you're hankering for a snack, consider reaching for some cheese instead of candy or other sugary treats.
