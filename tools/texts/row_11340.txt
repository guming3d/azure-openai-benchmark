article: Washington (CNN) -- Most Americans -- and most American Catholics -- think Pope Benedict XVI has done a bad job of dealing with the problem of sexual abuse by Catholics priests, according to a new national poll. CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey results released Friday also indicate that recent revelations about that matter have hurt the pope's standing with the public. Fifty-nine percent of American Catholics questioned in the poll have a favorable view of the pope, down 19 points from February. Among all Americans, the slippage is even greater: from 59 percent in February to just 35 percent today. "Only a quarter of U.S. Catholics have an unfavorable view of the pope, but they don't seem satisfied with his track record on the growing and persistent scandal within the church," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. According to the survey, 56 percent of U.S. Catholics disapprove of how Pope Benedict XVI has dealt with the problem of sexual abuse committed by priests; only about one in three Catholics has a positive view of how he has dealt with that subject. An even larger number -- 74 percent -- disapproves of how the church overall has handled that matter. Pope Benedict XVI called for "penitence" Thursday for the church's "sins" amid the sex abuse scandal that has embroiled the Roman Catholic Church, according to Italy's official news agency. Allegations against the church have piled up this year across Europe, including in Austria, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Pope Benedict XVI has found himself tied to the crisis after news broke last month that 30 years ago, when he was an archbishop, he approved accommodations in his diocese for a priest accused of child sex abuse so the priest could undergo therapy. The priest, who was not identified, was let go from church service in 2008, according to church officials in Germany. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted April 9-11, with 1,008 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points and plus or minus 6.5 percentage points for the 231 American Catholics questioned. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.

chatgpt: 59 percent of American Catholics surveyed in a recent Gallup poll have expressed a favorable opinion of Pope Francis. However, 56 percent of them have disapproved of the way the pope has dealt with the increasing number of abuse reports against the church.  The allegations against the church have been piling up across Europe, causing widespread outrage and protests. The response of the pope and the church's leadership in general has been met with widespread criticism from both within and outside the Catholic community.  The Vatican's handling of the abuse crisis has come under particular scrutiny in recent weeks. Many Catholics are calling for more transparency and accountability from the church when it comes to addressing abuse allegations. This sentiment is reflected in the poll's findings which show that more than half of American Catholics believe the church has not done enough to address the issue. This is a significant shift from previous years when the pope was seen as a beacon of hope for many Catholics, particularly those who had grown disillusioned with the church's conservative leadership. Pope Francis' focus on issues like poverty, immigration, and climate change made him a popular figure among progressives both within and outside the Catholic church. However, the abuse crisis has put a significant dent in the pope's reputation, causing many Catholics to reevaluate their views on the church and its leadership. The poll's results suggest that while many American Catholics still hold a favorable view of the pope, they are increasingly dissatisfied with the church's response to the abuse crisis. The Vatican has responded to the criticism with a series of measures aimed at addressing the issue. Pope Francis has pledged to take concrete steps to prevent abuse and hold abusers accountable. However, many Catholics remain skeptical of the church's ability to bring about real change.  The abuse crisis has been a major test of the pope's leadership and the church's credibility. While the results of the poll suggest that many American Catholics still have faith in the pope, they also highlight the need for the church to take swift and decisive action on this critical issue.
