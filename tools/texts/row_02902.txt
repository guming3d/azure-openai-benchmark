article: Police tried to smash a car window to rescue a young Queensland girl who was accidentally locked in the vehicle by her mother on Thursday. Authorities were called to the Aldi car park in Gympie, north of Brisbane, after the distressed two-year-old started to overheat. This comes as state roadside assistance bodies around Australia have revealed they are called to save thousands of children from locked cars each year, issuing a warning to parents and passersby to be extra vigilant as we enter the warmer months. Authorities were called to the Aldi car park in Gympie, north of Brisbane, after a distressed two-year-old was locked in her mother's car . On Thursday Gympie police officer Steve Buchanan tried but could not smash his way into the vehicle with his baton while waiting for roadside assistance from the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) to unlock the car, The Gympie Times reported. He chipped and scratched the car but was unable to get in to the Mazda 3 hatch. After a number of minutes the RACQ arrived and were able to unlock the rear passenger door. The toddler, who was unharmed, jumped into her relieved mother's arms. The RACQ said improved safety features and remote locking technology led to about 100 incidences per month of children needing to be rescued from locked in cars in Queensland alone. A spokeswoman told the Times that cars could reach 40 degree temperatures within seven minutes, even in winter. 'Being exposed to such high temperatures in a car can kill or lead to severe injury for young children in a relatively short time,' she said. Peter Khoury, spokesman for NRMA in NSW, said they had rescued 2179 children from locked cars in the past year. 'It becomes more alarming as we come into the summer months,' Mr Khoury said. 'In summer it doesn't take very long at all for the temperature to reach as high as 80 degrees â€“ that's almost cooking temperatures. 'It's not long at all for a child to become disoriented, agitated and then dehydrated and suffering organ failure.' Mr Khoury said people should call police or their local roadside assistance body immediately if they saw a child locked in a car. 'If they consider the child to be in danger, break the car window, don't wait,' he said. He also warned that is was illegal to leave a child unattended in a car, with the penalty carrying fines of up to $22,000. The RACV in Victoria was called to 1500 cases of children locked in cars in the year leading up to July. Victorian parliament recently discussed raising the penatly for leaving a child unattended in a car from fines of $2214 to $3690 and prison terms from one and a half months to three months.

chatgpt: Emergency services were called to an Aldi car park in Gympie on Tuesday afternoon, where a two-year-old girl had been accidentally locked inside a vehicle. The girl's mother, who had left the keys inside the car when she exited the vehicle, called for assistance upon realizing the situation. While the incident had a happy ending with emergency services successfully rescuing the child, it serves as a grim reminder of how easily children can be locked inside vehicles. Roadside assistance providers around Australia have revealed that they are frequently called to rescue children from locked cars. The National Roads and Motorists' Association (NRMA) reported rescuing 2179 children in New South Wales alone, while the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) saved 1500 children in Victoria. Locked cars are particularly dangerous for younger children, as they can rapidly succumb to heatstroke in hot weather. Even on mild days, temperatures inside a locked car can quickly reach dangerous levels. Preventing incidents like these from occurring requires vigilance and simple precautions. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to ensure that keys are never left inside of vehicles, and that car doors are locked remotely to prevent children from inadvertently locking themselves inside. Additionally, it's important to always double-check the back seat before leaving a vehicle to ensure no children are left inside. However, accidents can still occur even with the most careful preparation. In the event that a child is locked inside a vehicle, parents and caregivers are urged to call emergency services immediately. In response to the ongoing problem of children being locked inside vehicles, advocacy groups have called for car manufacturers to install warning systems to alert caregivers to the presence of a child in the back seat. Proposed systems include sensors that detect movements in the back seat and alerts that sound if a rear door is opened before the car is turned off. In the meantime, however, it is up to parents and caregivers to remain vigilant and prioritize child safety when traveling in a vehicle. Proper preparation and quick action can prevent tragic accidents and ensure the safety of children in even the most unexpected situations.
