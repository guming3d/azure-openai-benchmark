article: A Wisconsin woman whose high speed drunk driving left her two friends dead and injured another in 2012 was sentenced Tuesday to seven years in prison. Ashley Baumann, 26, spoke publicly at the seven hour sentencing hearing for the first time since her crazed driving killed Jessica Hartwig, 33, and Misty Glisch, 31, and seriously injured Jerrica Woller. 'I am not the monster the media has made me out to be,' she told Lincoln County Circuit Judge Jay Tlusty. 'I wish I had the answers to the questions about what happened that night, but I don't, and I'm sorry for that.' Sentenced: Ashley Baumann was sentenced today (left) to seven years in prison after drunkenly killing her two friends while driving recklessly in June 2012 (mug shot at right) The sentence was around half the jail time prosecutors had asked for. That prosecutor, Tara Jenswold, wanted Baumann to get 14 years plus 10 years probation thereafter. Jenswold pointed to what she called Baumann's lack of remorse and refusal to accept responsibility for the crash which experts revealed happened at well over 90MPH, reports the Wausau Daily Herald. Played at the trial were damning recordings made of conversations Baumann had while in the Lincoln County Jail. Baumann actually ridicules Woller, who very nearly died in the crash. 'I hate her,' Baumann is heard to say. it was reported that just before the crash Woller warned Baumann to stop her reckless driving mere moments before the crash.

'I hate her': Jerrica Woller was seriously injured in the crash that left her two friends dead and later slandered by Baumann. She asked Baumann to stop her reckless behavior moments before the crash . Baumann's defense attorney Wright Laufenberg argued his client 'has always felt horrible about what happened.' Despite that, the judge chose not to hand Baumann the sentence prosecutors wanted. 'Clearly this is a tragedy,' Tlusty said. 'It has affected so many people both young and old...There are no winners. The legal system cannot undo what has occurred.' The judge also referenced Baumann's drinking. 'Significant to the court is that alcohol was involved,' he said as he noted her history of alcohol abuse. Baumann's blood alcohol level after the crash was measured at twice the legal limit. A jury convicted Baumann in May on all seven counts against her, including two counts of homicide while operating a vehicle under the influence and one count of injury by intoxicated use of a vehicle.

chatgpt: Ashley Baumann, the 26-year-old woman accused of causing a fatal car crash in 2012, spoke out publicly for the first time on Tuesday, insisting that she's the victim of media bias. Baumann, who is facing two counts of reckless homicide for the deaths of Jessica Hartwig, 33, and Misty Glisch, 31, has been the subject of intense scrutiny in the media since the accident. "I feel like I've been judged before anyone even knew the facts," Baumann said in court on Tuesday. "The media has portrayed me as this evil, reckless person who didn't care about anyone else's safety. But that's not true." Baumann appeared in court for a preliminary hearing, where a judge would determine whether there was enough evidence to bring her case to trial. During the hearing, Baumann's defense team argued that the charges against her should be dismissed due to insufficient evidence. Baumann's attorney, John Gierach, told the court that the prosecution was relying on "speculation, conjecture, and hearsay" to make its case against Baumann. He argued that there was no evidence to suggest that Baumann had been under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash, or that she had been driving at an excessive speed. Gierach also took issue with the media coverage of the case, accusing journalists of using "emotional language" and "sensational headlines" to paint Baumann as a reckless driver who was responsible for the deaths of two innocent women. Baumann, who appeared visibly emotional during the hearing, said that she was "devastated" by the loss of Hartwig and Glisch, and that she was "praying for their families every day." She also spoke of her own struggles in the aftermath of the crash, saying that she had suffered from depression and anxiety and had been hospitalized several times. "I am not a monster," Baumann said. "I am a human being who made a mistake. I should have been more careful on the road that day, and I will regret my actions for the rest of my life." Despite Baumann's plea for understanding, the judge ultimately ruled that there was enough evidence to bring the case to trial. Baumann will now face a jury trial, where she could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison if convicted. The families of Hartwig and Glisch released a statement following the hearing, expressing their hope that justice would be served. "Our hearts are broken by the loss of Jessica and Misty," the statement read. "We will never forget them, and we will never stop fighting for justice on their behalf."
