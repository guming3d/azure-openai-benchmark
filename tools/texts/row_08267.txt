article: A New York woman has been indicted for collecting more than $47,000 in Medicaid benefits while living a luxury lifestyle of mansions and fancy cars. Hasime Lika, 34, is accused of hiding her assets to claim state benefits for herself and her children through Medicaid, a program that provides help to New Yorkers who can't afford medical care, between 2006 and 2011. All the while, prosecutors claim, she was living in a $2.4 million mansion in the Todt Hill area of Staten Island and driving around in a Rolls Royce and a Mercedes. Indicted: Hasime Lika is accused of claiming more than $47,000 in benefits fraudulently . Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes says Lika used her maiden name to file for benefits and claimed to live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Hynes says Lika generally uses the surname of her common-law husband Bill Lika, a wealthy property owner who owns 14 rental properties in New York and has assets of more than $5 million. According to ABC, Hasime Lika's name is on the deed to the $2.4 million mansion she and her husband bought without a mortgage in 2007, just months after she filed for benefits. Opulent: Lika lives in this Staten Island mansion, and not in Brooklyn's Williamsburg as she claimed when filing for benefits, say prosecutors . The house has a three-car garage, a pool and a large fountain in the front yard. Lika also had $35,000 in her checking account that she failed to declare at the time she applied for benefits for herself and her children, say prosecutors. They also allege that when re-certifying her Medicaid applications between 2006 and 2012, she never disclosed her relationship with Bill Lika. 'This case is an egregious example of an individual who lied to the system by hiding income and a plethora of luxurious resources to abuse one of New York City's most vital public benefit programs meant to serve those truly in need,' said HRA Commissioner Robert Doar in a prepared statement. Wealthy: Lika refused to answer questions as she left the court and ran to dodge reporters and photographers . Lika is charged with welfare fraud and grand larceny. If convicted, she faces up to seven years in prison. Local area blogs and YouTube videos allege Bill Lika is a 'slumlord' whose apartment buildings are in a 'third world' condition, while a Twitter user posed in March, 'My landlord Bill Lika sued me, and I won. No hard feelings, Bill (you sad disgusting piece of filth).' According to ABC, the Likas are currently renovating their Staten Island mansion and building a cabana in the backyard.

chatgpt: Staten Island woman, Hasime Lika, 34, is facing up to seven years in prison after being charged with welfare fraud and grand larceny. Lika, who claimed Medicaid benefits for herself and her two children from 2006 to 2011, received over $47,000 in benefits despite living in a luxurious mansion and driving a Rolls Royce. According to court documents, Lika failed to declare her common law marriage to property developer Bill Lika and even used her maiden name to hide the relationship. Additionally, she hid $35,000 in her checking account, which she failed to report during the time she was receiving Medicaid benefits. Lika's lavish lifestyle, which included living in a mansion and driving a luxury car, raised suspicions among authorities who eventually discovered her fraudulent activity. It was alleged that Lika's failure to declare her relationship with Bill Lika was an intentional act to remain eligible for Medicaid benefits. The case highlights the issue of welfare abuse and fraud, and the need for stricter rules and regulations to ensure that welfare programs are used only by those in need. The fact that someone can live a luxurious life while receiving government assistance is outrageous and calls for more stringent accountability measures. Lika now faces serious charges that could result in a lengthy prison sentence. Her case serves as a warning to others who might be tempted to abuse the welfare system. If found guilty, Lika will have to pay back the benefits she fraudulently received and could face additional fines and penalties. The prosecution has stated that welfare fraud is a serious offence and that it would not hesitate to pursue those who attempt to cheat the system. The case will go to trial soon, and the verdict will be closely watched by those who depend on government assistance. In conclusion, the case of Hasime Lika is a stark reminder of the dangers of welfare fraud and the importance of stringent regulations to prevent abuse of the system. The full extent of Lika's fraudulent activities will soon be revealed in court, and her fate will serve as a lesson to others who may contemplate committing similar offences.
