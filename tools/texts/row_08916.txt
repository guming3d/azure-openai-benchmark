article: Wales will be without midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen for their upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus in Cardiff. Manager Chris Coleman confirmed on Wednesday the Barclays Premier League pair would be absent for the games against the Bosnians on October 10 and Cyprus three days later. Arsenal playmaker Ramsey damaged a hamstring against Tottenham last weekend and has been ruled out of action for the next four weeks. Aaron Ramsey did not make the Wales squad after picking up a hamstring injury in the north London derby . Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen will also miss the matches against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus . Liverpool midfielder Allen has not played since Wales' opening Euro 2016 victory in Andorra on September 9 after undergoing a hernia operation. 'We've got used to being without players who everyone talks about being the main boys,' Coleman said after naming a 26-man squad for the Cardiff City Stadium double-header. 'I've never had them altogether and we're also without David Vaughan and Andy Crofts, so that's four out of that midfield area. 'It's disappointing when you lose players of the calibre of Aaron and Joe, but I've got confidence in those boys to come in and do a job for us. 'I'm still excited going into it because these are two huge games.' Chris Coleman was announcing his squad ahead of the upcoming European Championship qualifiers . Real Madrid star Gareth Bale is included in the squad, news that will particularly please Welsh fans . Bosnia are playing catch-up in Group B after a surprise home defeat to Cyprus last month but Coleman is aware that a side featuring the Premier League trio of Edin Dzeko, Muhamed Besic and Asmir Begovic are a dangerous proposition. 'Bosnia will be a wounded animal because they were expected to beat Cyprus,' Coleman said. 'They should have beaten them, they completely dominated the game but they couldn't score and were done twice on the counter-attack. 'They'll come to us, knowing they need to win and with a point to prove. 'But we've got the opportunity to put a bit of distance between us and them and it's all about getting the job done and continuing our good work.' Hennessey (Crystal Palace), Letheren (Dundee), Fon Williams (Tranmere), Chester (Hull), Collins (West Ham), Davies (Tottenham), Dummett (Newcastle), Gabbidon (Cardiff), Gunter (Reading), Ricketts (Wolves), Taylor (Swansea), Wiggins (Charlton), A Williams (Swansea), Cotterill (Birmingham), Edwards (Wolves), Evans (Wolves), Huws (Wigan), King (Leicester), Ledley (Crystal Palace), Bale (Real Madrid), Church (Charlton), Lawrence (Leicester), Robson-Kanu (Reading), Taylor (Reading), G Williams (Fulham), J Williams (Crystal Palace).

chatgpt: Chris Coleman, the manager of the Welsh national team, has announced his squad for the upcoming Euro 16 qualifying matches against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. Despite having to contend with a number of injuries to key players, Coleman has named a strong squad that he believes can secure the crucial victories that are needed to keep Wales on track for qualification. One of the most notable players missing from the squad is Aaron Ramsey, the Arsenal midfielder who has been an integral part of the Welsh team's success over recent years. Ramsey has been sidelined with a hamstring injury, and although he had expressed his desire to be part of the squad for these matches, it was ultimately decided that he was not yet fit enough to play. Also missing through injury is Joe Allen, the Liverpool midfielder who has also been a key player for Wales in recent years. Allen has been struggling with a knee injury that has kept him out of action for several weeks, and it was deemed too risky to include him in the squad for these important matches. Despite these setbacks, there is still plenty of quality in the Welsh squad, with Gareth Bale perhaps the most high-profile player included. Bale, who plays for Real Madrid, has been in excellent form this season and will be looking to continue that form as he leads the Welsh attack. Other notable players in the squad include Ashley Williams, the Swansea City defender who is also the captain of the Welsh national team, and Neil Taylor, the Aston Villa left-back who has been a regular in the Welsh team over the past few years. Of course, the real test for these players will come when they take to the field for the matches against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. The Bosnians, in particular, will be a tough opponent for Wales - they are currently second in their qualifying group, just one point behind leaders Belgium, and possess a number of talented players, such as Roma striker Edin Dzeko. However, Coleman will be hoping that his side can replicate the form they showed in their last qualifying match, a 3-0 victory over Israel back in September. That win put Wales in a strong position in their group, and they will be looking to build on that momentum in these upcoming matches. Ultimately, these next two games could be crucial for Wales' hopes of qualifying for the Euro 16 finals. With just three matches left to play after these fixtures, every point will be vital, and Coleman will be hoping that his squad can rise to the challenge and secure the victories that they need.
