article: New Delhi (CNN) -- Navy divers have recovered five bodies so far from an Indian navy submarine that exploded and sank in Mumbai this week, authorities said Saturday. The Indian government warned that there was almost no hope of finding any survivors among the 13 other sailors who were in the submarine when it was hit by the unexplained blast at a naval dockyard early Wednesday. Navy divers searching the trapped submarine for three days have recovered five bodies so far. Their task has been complicated by poor visibility inside the stricken submarine's passageways, which are full of oily, muddy water and wreckage. Adding to their difficulties, the heat of the explosion warped some of the hatches inside the vessel, blocking the divers' access to certain areas. The bodies found so far are unidentifiable because they were so severely burned, authorities said. They have been taken to a naval hospital for DNA identification. Searching 'every inch' The state of the bodies and conditions inside the INS Sindhurakshak, a Russian-built submarine, mean that "finding any surviving personnel within the submarine is unlikely," the ministry said. "The feasibility of locating bodies of personnel in the forward part of the submarine is also very remote, as the explosion and very high temperatures, which melted steel within, would have incinerated the bodies, too," it warned. But divers will scour through submarine until all the bodies are recovered, the ministry said. Authorities say they have contacted the families of all the 18 missing personnel and are keeping them updated. Worst peacetime disaster . An investigation into the explosion and fire -- the Indian navy's worst peacetime disaster -- is under way. Navy officials say they so far can't pinpoint the cause. Salvage work on the diesel-electric submarine won't begin until the search for bodies is over, the defense ministry said. The Sindhurakshak had recently returned from an extensive refitting in Russia before the disaster. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Khushbu Shah from Atlanta.

chatgpt: Divers have resumed their search for the 13 sailors who remain missing onboard the Indian Navy submarine, INS Sindhurakshak, which sank after an explosion and fire earlier this week. Officials are warning that there is no hope of finding any survivors.  The incident has sent shockwaves throughout India's military and political establishment. The Sindhurakshak was one of India's most advanced submarines, capable of carrying nuclear weapons. It was commissioned in 1997 and had undergone a major refit in Russia in 2010.  The submarine had been docked in Mumbai when the explosion occurred. At around midnight on August 14th, an explosion was heard and a fire broke out on the submarine. Despite efforts to extinguish the fire, the submarine soon sank.  The exact cause of the explosion is not yet known, but early reports suggest that it may have been caused by a munitions failure or possibly a battery malfunction.  The Indian Navy has launched an inquiry into the incident and has promised to release a report within the next few weeks. The incident has raised concerns about the safety and reliability of India's military equipment. The Sindhurakshak was one of several submarines acquired by India from Russia in the 1990s and 2000s. India has been modernizing its military in recent years as it seeks to assert itself on the global stage. The country is engaged in a long-running border dispute with China and is also facing threats from Pakistan, which has been accused of supporting terrorist groups. The loss of the Sindhurakshak is a major blow to India's naval capabilities. The submarine was one of only two Russian-made Kilo-class submarines in the Indian Navy, and its loss will severely limit India's ability to project power in the Indian Ocean. The tragedy has also reminded the Indian public of the dangers faced by those who serve in the armed forces. India's military is made up largely of volunteers who come from some of the poorest communities in the country. The loss of the Sindhurakshak is a reminder of the sacrifices that these men and women make every day in service to their country. As the search for the missing sailors continues, India is mourning the loss of one of its most advanced submarines and the brave men who served onboard. The incident is a reminder of the dangers that come with military service, and the need to ensure that our armed forces are equipped with reliable and safe equipment.
