The animals were either collected from the roadside, purchased, given to him by friends, and even brought inside his house by his cat. He said: 'I don't use live animals because I don't think it's right to expose them to the risks of X-rays for this purpose.'

Mr van't Riet is exposed to radiation every time he creates a new picture - but insists it isn't harmful . Mr van't Riet said that nature is  'amazing under X-rays' which show the complexity of the animals and plants . Colour is added once the picture is developed and scanned into a computer. Mr van't Riet is exposed to radiation every time he creates a new picture - but insists it is not a strong enough dose to be harmful.

chatgpt: A Dutch photographer has taken his love for nature to the next level as he captures the beauty of animals in his unique X-ray photography. Arie van't Riet, who started the hobby after X-raying flowers for his students, has now extended his photographic prowess to animals- particularly monkeys, birds, fish, and reptiles. His unique technique of capturing these animals has earned him great recognition and fame. With his X-ray technique, van't Riet almost strips the animals he captures off their skin and shows their skeletons, organs, and tissues in a stunning and visually striking way. His photos allow the viewer to appreciate the intricacies of nature that are invisible to the naked eye. Van't Riet said that his objective is to show the ‘beautifulness of nature,’ and his photos do just that. Among his most notable works is a photo of a monkey perched on a branch. The X-ray photo shows the intricate details of the monkey's spinal cord, ribcage, and other internal organs. The photo is a testament to Van't Riet's skill in capturing the beauty of animals in all their forms. His work has been praised for its artistic and scientific values, with scientists and researchers using his photos to study the anatomy and physiology of the animals he captures. Van't Riet's work also shines a light on the importance of wildlife conservation. By depicting the animals in their innermost form, he reminds viewers of the need to protect them and their habitats.
