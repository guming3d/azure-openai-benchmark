Horrific: Cousins Yonelisa and Zandile Mali were raped and murdered in the township of Diepsloot . Brazen: The girls were snatched from outside Yonelisa's house, CNN reported . Yonelisa was the only child of Thokozani Mali. She said that the girls were playing just outside the house and she was checking on them every five minutes. Then they went silent, CNN reported. She alerted relatives, neighbours and police, who combed the area – one of the most violent places in the country - in a bid to find them. She told CNN that she cannot bear to talk about her loss. Desperate: A frantic search involving friends, neighbours and police tragically came to nothing . Gruesome discovery: Their lifeless bodies were found in a public toilet . She said: ‘I am trying to be strong. When I am sleeping, she always next to me, so when I think of that I feel like crying.’ Five men have been arrested for the kidnap, rape and murder of the girls and briefly appeared at a Pretoria court on Thursday. Their identities have yet to be made public. Public protests followed the discovery of the bodies, with one person holding a banner that read ‘hand these dogs over to us and the people of Diepsloot’. Distraught: Yonelisa's mother, Thokozani Mali, cannot bring herself to talk about what happened . Diepsloot has a population of around 150,000, but the nearest police station is 10 miles away . The murder of the girls, and torture of a young boy in Katlehong, were condemned by South African President Jacob Zuma last week. He said: ‘These gruesome incidents of extreme torture and murder of our children do not belong to the society that we are continuously striving to build together. ‘Whilst we appeal to the communities not to take the matters into their hands, we also want to urge them to work with law enforcement authorities to find the perpetrators and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.’ There are 55,000 reported cases of sexual violence a year in South Africa, according to the country's Medical Research Council. But the organisation says that the real figure is masked by the fact that many attacks go unreported. Justice in Diepsloot is often meted out by mobs - the nearest police station is 10 miles away. Violent: Diepsloot is one of the most crime-ridden areas in South Africa .

chatgpt: In a tragic turn of events, cousins Yonelisa and Zandile Mali were kidnapped in broad daylight while in the township of Diepsloot. Their abduction sent shockwaves throughout their community, with friends, neighbors, and police launching frantic searches to find them. Despite their best efforts, the search for the Mali cousins came to a chilling end on October 15 when their lifeless bodies were discovered in a public toilet. Their brutal and senseless murder has left their loved ones and community reeling in grief and disbelief. The case has since taken a new twist as five men have been arrested in connection with the crime. However, the identity of the suspects is still unknown. Authorities continue to investigate the case to bring those responsible for this heinous crime to justice. The tragic passing of the Mali cousins has sparked outrage across the country, with many calling for justice and an end to the pervasive culture of violence in South Africa. In particular, the case has drawn attention to the high rate of violence against women and children in the country. In response to the incident, South Africa's minister of police, Bheki Cele, visited the community of Diepsloot to offer his condolences and pledge to bring the perpetrators to justice. He also urged South Africans to work together to end violence in the country. Cele's visit was welcomed by members of the community, who expressed hope that the government would take tangible steps to address the issue of violence in the country. Many have called for increased police presence and resources to combat violence and protect vulnerable members of society. The Mali cousins' tragic passing has also highlighted the need for greater awareness and education around issues of gender-based violence and the protection of women and children. It has sparked conversations and calls for action across the country, with many organizations and individuals coming together to demand change. In particular, the incident has drawn attention to the urgent need to address the root causes of violence in South Africa, including poverty, inequality, and systemic issues that perpetuate violence and discrimination. While the arrest of the suspects provides a small glimmer of hope for justice in this case, it is clear that there is still much work to be done to address the pervasive culture of violence in South Africa. However, the tragic loss of the Mali cousins has galvanized the country and sparked a renewed determination to tackle this issue head-on.
