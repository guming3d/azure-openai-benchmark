article: One of the deepest mysteries in science - where all the antimatter went after the Big Bang and therefore why there’s matter at all in the universe  – is a step closer to being solved, claim CERN researchers. It comes because they’ve reached an important milestone in being able to make precision comparisons between atoms of ordinary matter and atoms of antimatter. ‘We’ve demonstrated that we can probe the internal structure of the antihydrogen atom,’ said team spokesman, Jeffrey Hangst, ‘and we’re very excited about that. We now know that it’s possible to design experiments to make detailed measurements of antiatoms.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Hi-tech: The CERN Alpha experiment uses cutting-edge equipment to trap antihydrogen atoms . Today, we live in a Universe that appears to be made entirely of matter, yet at the Big Bang, matter and antimatter would have existed in equal amounts. The mystery is that all the antimatter seems to have gone, leading to the conclusion that nature must have a slight preference for matter over antimatter. If antihydrogen atoms can be studied in detail they may provide a powerful tool for investigating this preference, as the results from CERN’s Alpha collaboration suggest. Hydrogen atoms consist of an electron orbiting a nucleus. By firing light at them the atoms can be excited, with the electrons jumping to higher orbits, and eventually relaxing back to their so-called ground state by emitting light. The frequency distribution of the light emitted forms a very precisely measured spectrum that, in the matter world, is unique to hydrogen. Pioneering: Professor Jeffrey Hangst at the Alpha experiment . Leap forward: Professor Hangst explained that his experiment means antimatter can now be better understood . Basic principles of physics say that antihydrogen should have an identical spectrum to hydrogen, and measuring this spectrum is the ultimate goal of the Alpha collaboration. ‘Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and we understand its structure extremely well,’ said Hangst. ‘Now we can finally begin to coax the truth out of antihydrogen. Are they different?  We can confidently say that time will tell.’ In a paper published today in Nature, Alpha reports the first, albeit modest, measurement of the antihydrogen spectrum. In the Alpha apparatus, antihydrogen atoms are trapped by a sophisticated arrangement of magnetic fields acting on the magnetic orientation of the antihydrogen atoms. By shining microwaves with a precisely tuned frequency on the antihydrogen atoms, the collaboration flips the antiatoms’ magnetic orientation, thereby liberating antihydrogen from the trap. When this happens, the antihydrogen meets ordinary matter and annihilates, leaving a characteristic pattern in particle detectors surrounding the trap. This measurement shows that it is possible to set up experiments in which the internal properties of antihydrogen atoms can be changed by shining microwaves on them. In the near future, Alpha will work at improving the precision of the microwave measurements, and undertake complementary measurements of the antihydrogen spectrum using lasers.

chatgpt: In a major breakthrough in the field of particle physics, researchers have achieved a milestone in comparing ordinary matter with antimatter. The results of this experiment could help in understanding what happened to all the antimatter after the Big Bang. Antimatter is known to be the counterpart of matter, with the same mass but opposite charge. When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. Yet, our universe is made up almost entirely of matter, and there is hardly any antimatter to be found. The imbalance between matter and antimatter has been one of the most fundamental questions in physics for a long time. Scientists have been trying to find out where all the antimatter went, and why it seems to be so scarce in the universe. A team of researchers at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, has made significant progress in this quest by comparing the properties of protons and antiprotons with high precision. Protons are the building blocks of matter, while antiprotons are the building blocks of antimatter. The team used the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, to create and study antiprotons. They measured the magnetic moment of antiprotons, which is a fundamental property of particles that indicates how they interact with magnetic fields. The researchers found that the magnetic moment of antiprotons is almost exactly the same as that of protons, with an uncertainty of just 0.8 parts per million. This is a remarkable achievement, considering that the experiment involved measuring a tiny effect on a subatomic scale. The results of this experiment could help in understanding why there is such a large discrepancy between matter and antimatter in the universe. One possibility is that there is some asymmetry in the behavior of matter and antimatter, which could have led to the excess of matter we see today. Another possibility is that the antimatter is hidden somewhere in the universe, possibly in the form of galaxies or stars made up of antimatter. However, this theory raises some difficult questions, such as how antimatter could have escaped detection for so long. The significance of this milestone cannot be overstated. It opens up new avenues for research in particle physics and cosmology, and could ultimately help us understand the nature of the universe itself. Dr. Michael Doser, the coordinator of the antimatter experiments at CERN, said that "this result is a milestone in antimatter research and opens up a new era of precision measurements on the properties of antimatter atoms." He also stated that "our next goal is to measure the magnetic moment of antihydrogen, which will require us to trap and hold anti-atoms for a longer time than we have been able to do until now." The results of this experiment have been published in the journal Nature, and have already generated a lot of excitement in the scientific community. Experts are confident that this research will help us unravel some of the mysteries of the universe, and could have profound implications for our understanding of physics and cosmology.
