article: (CNN) -- It's been more than a year since NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal retired from the court, and he says he doesn't miss it. The basketball champ has his eye on a new target: diabetes. "It's alarming," says O'Neal. "We need to come together to try to help prevent the disease and stay healthy." Nearly 26 million Americans have diabetes, and another 79 million Americans are considered pre-diabetic, according to the American Diabetes Association. Approximately two thirds of diabetics eventually die from heart disease or a stroke. For O'Neal, the fight against diabetes is personal. He was drawn to finding a solution after watching close family members struggle to manage the disease. He's now focusing his energy on preventing people from developing diabetes in the first place. Waist size signals diabetes risk . "Childhood obesity is getting worse," he says. "People need to know the problem isn't going to go away unless we take control now." O'Neal spent years taking flak about his fluctuating weight throughout his 19-year NBA career. But the self-proclaimed "freak of nature" says there's always been a method to his madness. "[Critics] would automatically say, 'He's out of shape,' but I wanted to just relax during the summer, hang out with the family, and then work my way into basketball-playing shape," says O'Neal. "I've never been obese. Even now my body fat is only 13%." Makers of diabetes drug will pay $90 million . Today, the 7-foot tall O'Neal says his current weight stays around 350, "plus 10," but admits it's not easy to stay at a healthy weight and reduce his risk of developing diabetes. O'Neal says he limits the amount of carbohydrates in his diet, eats a salad for lunch everyday and only indulges in an occasional brownie, his vice. He also clocks one hour of cardiovascular activity each day. Diabetes diagnoses increasing at alarming rate . "It's a different world we live in now," says O'Neal. "I always urge people to eat healthy and ask them to try to help your kids get exercise. I stress the importance of keeping them in shape. It's not about the physical appearance but for their health." In addition to raising awareness on how to prevent diabetes through a healthy lifestyle, O'Neal says he also wants to help diabetics better manage their disease. He recently invested in a product called glucose quick sticks, which he describes as a healthier alternative for diabetics when their blood sugar is low.

chatgpt: NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has become an advocate in the fight against diabetes, a disease that has affected close family members. In an interview with CNN, he revealed that his mother and two uncles struggled with the disease, and it has hit him personally too. With almost 26 million Americans affected by diabetes, Shaq's story is just one example of the struggle that families face every day.

"My mom had it, my uncle had it, and I've seen what it can do." For Shaq, the issue is personal, but he is also aware of the wider impact that diabetes is having on the US population. According to the American Diabetes Association, nearly 26 million Americans have diabetes. Out of that figure, around 7.2 million people remain undiagnosed, and another 79 million people are pre-diabetic, meaning that they are at high risk of developing the condition. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease that can lead to a range of complications if left untreated, including heart disease, kidney disease, and blindness. Shaq's activism is timely, as diabetes rates continue to rise in the US. In recent years, the number of people affected by the disease has increased significantly, and health experts have been sounding the alarm about the need for prevention and management of the condition. For Shaq, the key is education and awareness. "It's important for people to understand what diabetes is and what they can do to prevent it," he said. Shaq is not the only celebrity to raise awareness of diabetes. In recent years, stars including Tom Hanks, Paula Deen, and Nick Jonas have all spoken out about their experiences with the condition. Their stories have helped to boost understanding of the disease and inspire others to take action. For Shaq, the fight against diabetes is a long-term project. He has already lent his support to various initiatives aimed at raising awareness and funding research into the disease. And he is encouraging others to get involved too. "If you have diabetes or know someone who does, don't be afraid to speak out," he said. "Together, we can make a difference." In conclusion, Shaq's personal experience with diabetes has made him a powerful advocate in the fight against the disease. With millions of Americans affected by diabetes and millions more at risk, the issue is a pressing public health concern. Shaq's efforts to raise awareness and support research are an important step towards preventing and managing this chronic disease.
