article: (CNN) -- American tourists heading to Mexico's Baja California state in the future can expect more police protection from a new task force, according to Mexican authorities. Mexican officials want to make sure the tourist traffic continues to flow into Tijuana. Officials from the Baja California cities of Tijuana, Ensenada and Rosarito gathered earlier this week to announce the creation of the task force, which will be made up of bilingual officers and which will be designed primarily to serve Americans. The initial plan, according to Ensenada Secretary of Public Safety Cesar Santiesteban, is to create a force that patrols a 50-mile tourist corridor from Tijuana through Las Playas Rosarito to Ensenada in Baja California, which is Mexico's northernmost and westernmost state. There were no immediate details as to when the task force would go into operation or how many officers would be in the unit. City officials in San Diego, California, said the city's police force would extend help in ways that Mexican officials deemed necessary in getting the task force up and running, including training the officers. "We've always prided ourselves in our working relationship with our friends to the south," San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, said. "When you look at it, we're really one community." For a region whose reputation has been tarnished by ongoing drug-fueled violence, plans for task force couldn't come soon enough. Policing the drug war has proven complicated for Mexican authorities, including the military, and also hindered the tourism industry in Mexico. American travelers, who represented 80 percent of the country's booming $13 billion travel industry last year, are a critical part of Mexico's economy. In 2008, more than 18 million Americans visited the country, according to the Mexico Tourism Board. In some areas, hotels and local businesses are struggling to recover from low visitor numbers, according to the Mexico Tourism Board. Tijuana Mayor Jorge Ramos said tourism in Baja California in the past two years has remained steady, and the task force was set up to create a stronger police presence for tourists. "We're here on this side of the border to invite you to our city and to [show you] we're making a lot of things ... better, and to make some progress in our city," Ramos said in a news conference in San Diego Monday.

chatgpt: Mexican officials have announced the creation of a task force that will primarily serve and protect Americans visiting the country. The task force will be made up of bilingual officers who will patrol the 50-mile tourist corridor of Baja. This region's reputation has been tarnished by ongoing, drug-fueled violence, and the hope is that the task force will help to restore confidence in the safety of the area. Mexico's travel industry is critical to its economy, contributing $13 billion to the country each year. However, persistent violence and crime have led to a drop in tourist numbers, particularly from the US. The task force is part of the government's broader efforts to address these issues and revive the industry. The bilingual officers in the task force will be responsible for assisting tourists and responding to any incidents that may occur. They will be specially trained to handle situations involving Americans, who often have different expectations and needs than Mexican tourists. The task force is just one of several measures being taken to improve tourism safety in the country. Mexican officials have also been working to improve law enforcement in tourist areas, including increasing police presence and installing more security cameras. While the task force is initially focused on the Baja region, officials hope to expand it to other areas of the country. The ultimate goal is to make Mexico a safer and more attractive destination for tourists from around the world. Many in the travel industry are cautiously optimistic about the task force's potential impact. However, some have expressed concerns about the cost of the initiative and whether it will be enough to overcome the negative perception of Mexico as a dangerous destination. Despite these concerns, Mexican officials are committed to improving the country's tourism industry and restoring its reputation as a safe and attractive destination. The creation of the bilingual task force is just one step toward achieving that goal, and it will undoubtedly be closely watched by both tourists and industry insiders alike.
