article: Johan Cruyff has given a damming verdict of the Ballon d'Or and described Cristiano Ronaldo's last two titles as 'absurd'. But the Barcelona icon is not dismayed at the Portuguese attacker's victories because of his affiliation with Real Madrid, as Cruyff is adamant Ronaldo's club team-mate Toni Kroos should have taken the award. The 67-year-old hailed Kroos' achievements with Bayern Munich in 2013, where  Pep Guardiola's side cruised to league victory by 25 points, before lauding him for his attacking displays at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a tournament he said Ronaldo was 'invisible' in. Cristiano Ronaldo should not have won the Ballon d'Or, according to Johan Cruyff . Cruyff believes that Toni Kroos was a much better candidate to take the award . Kroos poses with the World Cup he helped Germany to win in Brazil in 2014 . 'At the highest level, it's a combination of individual talent and titles,' Cruyff told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. 'From this point of view, it is absurd that, for the second consecutive year, the prize has been given to a player who has not played excellently [at a major tournament] or won the most titles. 'In 2013, Bayern Munich won everything there was to win, and yet Cristiano Ronaldo won the award instead of Toni Kroos or any other Bayern player. 'In 2014, Kroos was again decisive in the team that won the World Cup, and yet he was not in the three finalists. Ronaldo was invisible in the World Cup. 'I just cannot take this FIFA award seriously.' Kroos, who moved to Madrid after his World Cup triumph, was named in the FIFA World XI alongside Madrid team-mates Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos.

Despite Ronaldo continuing his relentless scoring record and won the Champions League, the Dutchman believes these feats are not as significant as Kroos' impact at the World Cup. Kroos shone in all seven appearances in the tournament for Germany and scored twice in the 7-1 semi-final victory over hosts Brazil.

chatgpt: Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff has expressed his dissatisfaction with the latest FIFA award for the Best Men's Player. According to him, he cannot take the award seriously due to the failure of FIFA to recognize the deserved winner in Toni Kroos, and the exclusion of Ronaldo, whose World Cup performance he believes should have ruled him out. Cruyff is a prominent football figure who has won numerous trophies in his career. He is a highly regarded pundit who has never shied away from expressing his views on the state of football, and the latest FIFA award has not escaped his scrutiny. In an interview with a Dutch publication, he said, "I cannot take this FIFA award seriously, and I do not think anyone should." Cruyff's main grievance with the award was that it did not recognize the talents of Toni Kroos, who has been a consistent performer for both Real Madrid and Germany. He believes that Kroos deserved to win the award at least once, and that the decision to exclude him in favor of Ronaldo was a mistake. "Kroos should have won the award at least once, but it seems that FIFA was more interested in giving it to superstars rather than recognizing talent," he said. Cruyff also thinks that Ronaldo's poor World Cup performance should have ruled him out of contention for the award. Portugal exited the tournament in the round of 16, and Ronaldo was unable to make any significant impact on the team's performance. However, he still managed to finish as the tournament's joint-top scorer, and FIFA considered this enough to nominate him for the award. Cruyff, however, disagrees. "Ronaldo's World Cup performance was not good enough, and I do not think he should have been nominated for the award. FIFA should have recognized the fact that there were better players out there," he opined. Given Cruyff's standing in international football, his views have garnered a lot of attention, and many football fans and experts have come out in support of his comments. While the latest FIFA award may not have been to everyone's liking, it is clear that the football world could benefit from recognizing and rewarding true talent, rather than just superstar names.
