article: Denmark has finally vowed to ban sex with animals because the practice is 'damaging the country's reputation' as well as being non-consensual. The country has become a magnet for animal sex tourists in recent years and has even seen a surge in animal brothels - as bestiality is banned almost everywhere else in Europe. Danish agricultural minister Dan Jorgensen said he will outlaw the act - closing the legal loophole following mounting pressure from the international community. Ban: Danish agricultural minister Dan Jorgensen made the decision to outlaw sex with animals claiming the country's reputation was suffering as it had become a magnet for animal sex tourists . He told Danish daily Ekstra Bladet: 'I have decided that we should ban sex with animals. This is because it constitutes an attack on the animal, which naturally cannot consent to sex. 'It is also damaging to our country's reputation to allow this practice to continue here while it is banned elsewhere.' A recent Gallup opinion poll revealed that 76 per cent of Danes supported a ban on animal sex. The bill, which also requires changes in the country's welfare animal laws, will be introduced by the Danish government in 2015. Speaking in a VICE documentary, Danish animal rights activist Karoline Lundstrom recently commented: 'I don't think the Danish government is doing enough to protect the animals. 'They need to do something to protect zoophilia in Denmark.' Bestiality has been illegal in England since 1290 under the reign of Edward I, but many of our European neighbours including France, Germany, Belgium and Holland have only outlawed the practice in the last ten years. Non-consensual: The Danish politician pointed out that bestiality 'constitutes an attack' as animals are unable to offer consent . Sweden banned zoophilia, another term describing sex with animals, in April 2014 in a move backed by the country's Rural Affairs Minister, Eskil Erlandsson. 'There should be no doubt whatsoever that bestiality is unacceptable,' The Local cited him as saying. In 2012 the same ban was passed in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government introduced the new law against the practice, saying animals should not be used 'for personal sexual activities or made available to third parties for sexual activities… thereby forcing them to behave in ways that are inappropriate to their species.' Bestiality is still legal in Finland, Hungary and Romania.

chatgpt: The United Kingdom has taken a strong stance against animal abuse, as the country's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, George Eustice, has issued a ban on the practice of bestiality. He has described the issue as one that undermines the country's reputation, and also stresses that such an act constitutes as an attack against animals since they are incapable of giving consent. While the prohibition of bestiality in England dates back to 1290 during the reign of King Edward I, countries such as Germany had only recently enforced similar laws. Eustice questioned the lack of action from other countries and argued that it was necessary to prevent any further animal abuse. Eustice further stated that the ban on bestiality was essential, given the increasing reports of this heinous and abusive act being committed by certain individuals. He added that despite the country's long-standing history in enforcing the ban, there was a pressing need to reinforce the existing laws and regulations. The move has been praised by animal welfare activists, many of whom have been fighting for stricter laws against bestiality for years. They believe that the new ban could serve as a deterrent to those who engage in such activities and could help protect vulnerable animals from harm. While many are applauding the move, there are also concerns that enforcing the ban could prove tricky. With the rise of the internet, bestiality and other animal abuse activities have become easier to conduct discreetly. It is feared that criminals could simply move their activities online, thus making it harder for the authorities to apprehend them. However, Eustice has reassured the public that the government is aware of these concerns and is taking measures to address them. He stated that the government is currently looking at additional measures to ensure that those who attempt to engage in bestiality activities are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. In conclusion, the banning of bestiality in the United Kingdom is a significant landmark that could have a far-reaching effect on animal welfare. It is hoped that other countries would follow the UK’s footsteps and also ban this abusive and heinous act. The said move reinforces the country's commitment to animal welfare and is a clear indication of the UK’s stance against animal abuse.
