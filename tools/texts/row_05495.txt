article: Chelsea may be top of the Premier League but their wage bill is still some way below their two Manchester rivals, according to latest figures. The London club's annual accounts have been lodged at Companies House and reveal that Chelsea's wage bill for the 2013/14 season was £190.5million, up eight per cent from £176m. United are currently the biggest payers in English football, shelling out a total £214.8m on salaries while City's wage bill dropped last season to £205m. Jose Mourinho has plenty to shout about with Chelsea paying their players less than their Manchester rivals . Diego Costa was one of five players signed by Chelsea in the summer for a combined £62m . Juan Mata moved from Chelsea to Manchester United as the Blues made room for new signings . The sale of David Luiz to Paris Saint Germain ensured there was only a small rise in the overall wage bill . Arsenal are next in the pay league with a total wage bill of £166.4m while the scale of Southampton's success on the pitch is illustrated by the fact that their wage bill was a fraction of their rivals - the latest figures available for 2012/13 show the Saints, currently third in the Premier League, paid out just £47.1m in salaries. Chelsea's accounts confirm the club's announcement in November that they made a £18.4m profit last season - but shows this was helped by a £65m profit in player trading thanks to the sales of Juan Mata to United, David Luiz to Paris St Germain and Kevin de Bruyne to Wolfsburg. It allowed the club to overturn a £49.4m loss on the season before and should make them assured to comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules. Chelsea's accounts show broadcasting income increased by £34m to £139m, due to the new Premier League television deal plus the benefits of being Champions League semi-finalists, while commercial income also showed a big rise, up £29m to £108m. Turnover overall was up £64m to £319.8m. The accounts say five new players brought in by Jose Mourinho since June 30 2014 - including Diego Costa and Filipe Luis - cost £62m with £19.6m coming in for players who were sold.

chatgpt: The Premier League is known for its competitiveness both on and off the pitch. In the current season, Manchester United has a wage bill that surpasses all other English football clubs. However, it appears that Chelsea isn't too far behind in terms of the figures, having spent a staggering £190m on wages in 2013/14. For the previous financial year, Manchester United spent an astronomical £214m on wages, which was the highest in English football. This included bonuses, payments for player appearances and performance, image rights, and other contractual obligations. Although they are still one of the richest clubs in the world, this season their wage bill will be lower due to a lack of Champions League football. Meanwhile, Chelsea is currently ranked third in terms of wage bills, just behind Tottenham Hotspur. But despite spending almost £30m less than Manchester United on wages, Chelsea has achieved great success under manager Jose Mourinho. The Portuguese coach, who returned to Stamford Bridge in 2013, has helped the Blues win various competitions in his two spells in charge. With a deep squad, Chelsea has been able to field quality players consistently, which has helped maintain a high level of performance. Mourinho's spending in the last summer transfer window alone was credited to £62m, and he successfully purchased five players, all of whom have been contributing to the team's success. Despite the high numbers, it seems that Chelsea's wage bill might decrease following Mourinho's recent departure from the club, alongside the reduced bonuses for missing out on European football this season. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal, on the other hand, has a wage bill of £166m. The Gunners' highest earner, Mesut Ozil, is paid a whopping £350,000 per week, making him the highest-paid player in the club's history. Ozil has proven to be a valuable asset for Arsenal, but the club has struggled to compete with the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City in recent years. Overall, football has become more of a business with each passing year, and the wage bill of a club can be a significant indicator of its success. While Manchester United has the highest wage bill in English football at the moment, Chelsea is not too far behind. However, the importance of a well-managed squad with players that can perform on the pitch is undeniable, and both clubs have proven that sizeable wage bills can indeed be justified.
