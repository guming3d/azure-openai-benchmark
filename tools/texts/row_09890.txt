Guilty: Robert Cordingley, 57, who was his father's sole carer, had previously been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome . An Asperger's syndrome sufferer who smothered his 91-year-old father to death before calmly feeding his cat then taking a shower has been jailed for life. Robert Cordingley, 57, from Bradford, admitted to murdering his father, George, in January by covering his face with a pillow wrapped in a bin liner. He then wandered to a police station to confess his crime but found it closed and went to a supermarket car park to find a uniformed officer. Cordingly's father, a widower who had been a well-known motorbike competitor, was found dead in a bedroom of the house he had shared with his son for 57 years. Cordingley, who was his father’s sole carer, had previously been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a form of autism. Newcastle Crown Court heard that after killing his father he fed his cat and had a shower. The court also heard that there was evidence that suggested his father had begun to suffer from dementia. Mr Justice McCombe said: 'This is a very tragic and unusual case. 'The deceased was 91-years-old when he died and he had lived with the defendant for his whole life. 'There is evidence that he began to suffer from dementia but no help was sought. 'The defendant cared for his father by writing him notes to tell him where his food was and helped him prepare for the day. 'But a growing frustration was present with the defendant which led him to taking the decision to end his father’s life.' Carpark confession: Newcastle Crown Court heard that Cordingley then went to a police station to confess, but it was closed, so he approached police officers in a supermarket car park and told them he had murdered his father . The court heard that Cordingley’s condition led to poor judgment in finding a solution to his situation. Detective Inspector Steve Snow, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'It is hard to imagine what must have been going through Robert Cordingley’s mind when he ultimately decided to end his own father’s life. 'The evidence suggested that this was not a sophisticated plan, but one seemingly prompted out of desperation. 'A thorough and professional investigation was undertaken which clearly presented the facts and culminated in a guilty plea. 'Cordingley will now have to reflect on his decision, not only to take another life, but to subsequently ruin his own.'

chatgpt: In a shocking case heard at the Newcastle Crown Court, Robert Cordingley, 57, from Bradford, has admitted to murdering his own father, George Cordingley, in January earlier this year. The court was told that Cordingley, who was his father’s main carer, suffers from Asperger’s syndrome. According to the prosecution, Cordingley killed his father by covering his face with a pillow that was wrapped in a bin liner. After the murder, he went on to feed his pet cat and even took a shower before calling the police to report the incident. During the trial, Judge Simon Bourne-Arton revealed that Cordingley had growing frustrations which led to the decision to end his father’s life. He stated that "Robert Cordingley had particular difficulties as a result of his Asperger's Syndrome disorder, notably with a growing frustration which simply escalated in January of this year." The defense counsel acknowledged the tragic circumstances of the case and argued that Cordingley had been under immense stress while taking care of his father. Additionally, the defense noted that Cordingley had no previous criminal history and had co-operated with the police. The court also heard that George Cordingley had been suffering from medical conditions that required his son to provide constant care. Despite being a hardworking and devoted son, Robert Cordingley had, over time, become overwhelmed with the responsibility of being a sole carer. In a statement issued after the court hearing, the National Autistic Society highlighted the importance of providing meaningful support for caregivers looking after individuals with autism. The organization emphasized the need to improve access to respite care, social activities, and therapies for caregivers to help prevent cases like this. This case is a tragic reminder of the pressures and difficulties faced by those caring for loved ones with complex medical needs. While there are no excuses for Cordingley's actions, it is possible to understand the immense pressure and stress he must have been under. The court has now adjourned the case and a sentencing hearing is set to take place at a later date. Regardless of the sentence, this case highlights the importance of providing adequate support and resources to caregivers so that they can cope with the immense pressure of their responsibilities without reaching a breaking point.
