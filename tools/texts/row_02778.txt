Won: A jury awarded former Hodgekiss student Cara Munn, now 20, more than $40million after a tick-borne illness left her brain damaged and unable to speak . A former student of a prestigious Connecticut boarding school was awarded $41.7million by a jury after she said she contracted a tick-borne illness on a school trip to China that left her brain damaged and unable to speak. Cara Munn, now 20, was 15 at the time of the 2007 Hotchkiss School class trip to China. Her attorney said that she was bitten in a remote part of the Asian country. However, the college preparatory school announced today that it intends to appeal the jury award. Munn, of New York City, was a ninth-grader at Hotchkiss when she joined a school-supervised trip to China during the summer of 2007, according to her lawsuit. The then-15-year-old suffered insect bites that led to tick-borne encephalitis, her attorneys said. The school failed to ensure that the students take any precautions against ticks and allowed them to walk through a densely wooded area known to be a risk area for tick-borne encephalitis and other tick- and insect-transmitted illnesses, her attorneys said. 'Hotchkiss failed to take basic safety precautions to protect the minor children in its care,' Munn's attorney Antonio Ponvert III said. 'I hope that this case will help alert all schools who sponsor overseas trips for minors that they need to check the CDC for disease risks in the areas where they will be traveling, and that they must advise children in their care to use repellant and wear proper clothing when necessary. â€˜Cara's injuries were easily preventable.' Prestigious: The Hotchkiss School in Connecticut is a college prep boarding school, costing more than $45,000 per year in tuition . Attorneys for the school argued that tick-borne encephalitis is such a rare disease that it could not have foreseen a risk and could not be expected to warn Munn or require her to use protection against it. Hotchkiss officials said they remain very saddened by Munn's illness and hope for improvements to her health. 'We care deeply about all our students,' the school said in a statement. 'We make every effort to protect them, whether they are here or participating in a school-sponsored activity off-campus. 'We put great care and thought into planning and administering off-campus programs, and we extend the same care to students on these trips as to students on campus.' Historically, Hotchkiss students have undertaken study, service projects and travel in the United States and throughout the world and derived great benefit from the opportunities, the school said. The case lasted eight days, and the jury deliberated for about eight hours before returning their verdict. Room and board for the college preparatory school was $46,775 for the 2012-2013 school year, not including laundry, health, and technology fees. It has one of the largest endowments in the country.

chatgpt: The Hotchkiss School in Connecticut has stated that it intends to appeal a recent decision by a jury to award $41.75 million to a former student who contracted tick-borne encephalitis while on a school trip to China. Cara Munn, who was 15 when she traveled to China in 2007, was bitten by a tick and contracted the serious disease, which left her with permanent brain damage and an inability to speak. The verdict by the jury was delivered last week after a month-long trial. The jurors were asked to determine whether the school had been negligent in its precautions against tick bites during the trip. Munn's legal team argued that the school had failed to provide adequate protection against disease-carrying ticks, despite being aware of the risks. During the trial, Munn's parents testified that their daughter had been extremely ill after the trip, and that her condition had deteriorated rapidly. They said that it had become clear that she was suffering from a serious neurological condition, and that she had since been left with permanent damage to her brain. She now requires round-the-clock care and is unable to communicate verbally. In their defense, the school argued that it had taken reasonable steps to protect its students against tick bites, including providing them with insect repellent and encouraging them to wear long sleeves and pants. They also said that they had not been advised by Chinese officials of the risk of tick-borne diseases in the area they visited, and that they had followed relevant guidelines at the time. The jury ultimately found in favor of Munn, ruling that the school had been negligent in its duty of care to the students on the trip. They awarded her $41.75 million in damages, including $31.5 million for future medical expenses. The school has now announced its intention to appeal the decision. In a statement, it said that it was "disappointed" by the outcome of the trial and that it believed it had acted responsibly in its preparations for the trip. It added that it would continue to provide support for Munn and her family. The case is likely to raise questions about the responsibility of schools and other organizations to protect their students when traveling overseas. With the rise of global travel and the increasing threat of diseases such as Zika and malaria, organizations are under growing pressure to ensure that they take adequate precautions to safeguard the health and well-being of their travelers. For the Munn family, the verdict is a bittersweet victory. While they are relieved that justice has been done, they are aware that no amount of money can undo the damage that has been done to their daughter. However, they hope that the verdict will send a message to other schools and organizations that they must take their responsibilities seriously when sending young people overseas.
