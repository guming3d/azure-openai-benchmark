chatgpt: An elderly woman from Newark had a harrowing experience as she travelled to Denver. Alice Vaticano, who is 85 years old, was left stranded at her departure gate after the airline forgot about her. Vaticano had checked in at the Newark airport and had been wheeled to her departure gate. However, once she arrived there, the airline staff forgot about her, and she was left alone at the gate without any assistance. The incident has sparked outrage among passengers and the public, who are calling for better treatment of elderly travelers. Some have even suggested that the airline should face consequences for their neglect. The airline has since issued an official apology for their mistake, and they have offered compensation in the form of vouchers worth £120 to Vaticano. However, many believe that this is not enough, and that the airline should do more to make up for their failure to care for their customers properly. This incident has highlighted the need for better training and awareness of the needs of elderly travelers. It is not enough to simply provide a wheelchair and leave the passenger to their own devices. Airlines must ensure that they have proper protocols in place to ensure that all passengers are treated with dignity and respect, especially vulnerable and elderly individuals. Many airlines have policies in place to assist elderly and disabled passengers, but it is clear that there is still much work to be done. It is hoped that incidents like this will serve as a wake-up call to the industry and that they will take steps to improve their practices. In the meantime, Vaticano's experience serves as a warning to all passengers, especially those who may be vulnerable, to be vigilant and ensure that they are not forgotten about by airline staff. It is important to speak up and seek assistance when needed, and to hold airlines accountable for their actions. In conclusion, Alice Vaticano's experience highlights the need for better care of elderly travelers. While the airline has apologized and offered compensation, it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure the safety and dignity of all passengers. It is hoped that this incident will lead to positive change in the travel industry and better treatment for all travelers, regardless of their age or vulnerability.
