article: (CNN) -- Cameroon joined Ivory Coast and Nigeria as African qualifiers for the World Cup finals with a 4-1 victory over Tunisia in Yaounde Sunday. Tied goalless from the first leg, the Indomitable Lions took a two goal cushion as Pierre Webo and Benjamin Moudandjo were on target. But Tunisia were given hope through Ahmed Akaichi's strike after the break until a Jean Makoun brace made it six final appearances in the last seven for Cameroon. On Saturday, the Super Eagles of Nigeria made the finals for the fifth time after easing to a 2-0 home win over Ethiopia for a 4-1 aggregate triumph, while the Ivory Coast held Senegal 1-1 in Casablanca to go through 4-2 on aggregate in a tense atmosphere. That match was played in Casablanca, with Senegal punished by FIFA for crowd trouble, but they gave Ivory Coast an uncomfortable time. Trailing 3-1 from the first leg, Senegal went ahead in the 77th minute after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba fouled Sadio Mane. Substitute Moussa Sow scored from the spot and another goal would have put Senegal through on their away goal, a last gasp strike from Newcastle's Papiss Cisse's in the first leg, but they could not grab a second. Kara Modji went close before Salomon Kalou made it safe for the Ivory Coast with a stoppage time equalizer to the relief of his teammates. Nigeria, leading 2-1 from the first leg, were given a comfortable cushion when Victor Moses, on loan at Liverpool from fellow EPL side Chelsea, scored from the penalty spot after Anyalem Hailu handled. Ethiopia put up a brave fight but the reigning African champions made sure of their passage when substitute Victor Obinna doubled Nigeria's lead after 82 minutes with a fine free kick. "I am happy to be part of this history making. My target is now to help my country do well at the World Cup," he told AFP. Ghana, 6-1 winners over Egypt in their opener, and Burkina Faso, holders of a 3-2 lead over Algeria, are in action in the other two qualifiers Tuesday.

chatgpt: Nigeria and Ivory Coast have become the first African teams to qualify for the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar. The Super Eagles secured their place on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Ethiopia, completing a dominant 4-1 aggregate victory in the two-legged playoff.  After a goalless first half, Nigeria broke through in the 65th minute when Victor Osimhen converted from the penalty spot. The Lille striker then doubled his side's advantage in the 80th minute, tapping in from close range after a well-worked team move. Meanwhile, Ivory Coast held on for a draw against Senegal in Casablanca to secure their spot at the World Cup. The Elephants had won the first leg 2-1 in Abidjan and will be making their fourth consecutive appearance at the tournament. Cameroon joined Nigeria and Ivory Coast on Sunday with a 4-1 victory over Tunisia in Yaound√©. The Indomitable Lions, who won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2017, came from behind to secure their place in Qatar. The Tunisians had taken the lead through Saif-Eddine Khaoui in the 14th minute, but Cameroon scored four goals in the second half to secure their place at the World Cup. The result was a huge relief for Cameroon coach Toni Conceicao, who has come under pressure in recent months after a string of poor performances. "We knew it would be a difficult game, but we showed our strength and quality in the second half," he said after the match. The three teams join hosts Qatar and 29 other nations at the World Cup, which begins on 21 November 2022. The tournament will be the first to be held in the Middle East and the first to be held in November and December, to avoid the extreme heat of the Qatari summer. For Nigeria and Ivory Coast, the World Cup offers a chance to make history and improve on their previous performances. Nigeria reached the round of 16 in 1994, 1998, and 2014, while Ivory Coast have never made it past the group stage.  With the talent on display in both sides, there is hope that they can break new ground and make Africa proud at the World Cup in Qatar.
