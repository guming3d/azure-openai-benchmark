article: Arsenal vice-captain Mikel Arteta has hit back at Jose Mourinho for the ‘specialist in failure’ jibe he aimed at Arsene Wenger. Ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup final against Hull, Arteta strongly defended the Arsenal manager and insisted the Chelsea boss’s scathing comments in February were baseless. ‘If you analyse everything he has done for this club, if he is a failure — I have a different opinion. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose bites back: Wenger is a specialist in failure . Defensive midfielder: Arteta has spoken out in defense of his manager Arsene Wenger . Specialist in failure: Mourinho has criticised Wenger this season, but Arsenal could have the last laugh . ‘I don’t like it when someone criticises any of my team-mates, the staff, the manager, the club. ‘When they are right, maybe you can accept that everybody makes mistakes. But when he (Mourinho) comes in a certain way, I don’t like it. We don’t need to answer to anybody.’ However, Arteta has questioned Arsenal’s policy of offering only 12-month contracts to players over 30. The 32-year-old, who will discuss his future with Wenger after the final, has a year left on his contract but was not part of the renewal drive that led to Per Mertesacker, Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny signing new deals. Arteta said: ‘I don’t value players by age, whether it is Tomas Rosicky or Jack Wilshere. ‘I analyse many other things before age. For the club, age can be an asset. For me, a much bigger asset is someone who has played over 125 games in three years, compared to someone who has played 25 and is 20. Worrying times: Arsene Wenger has come under pressure for Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought . Age doesn't matter: Arteta says he judges the likes of Rosicky and Wilshere the same, despite age differences . ‘I understand the club’s point of view: “Mikel is not a £25million player because he is not 22 any more”. But I know what I can give.’ Meanwhile, Samuel Eto’o has called time on his career at Chelsea after labelling Mourinho a ‘fool’ for a  jibe about his age. In February, Mourinho was filmed by French TV saying: ‘Eto’o is 32 years old, maybe 35, who knows?’ Mocking: Eto'o reacted to his manager's suggestion that he is old by using the corner flag as a walking stick . Rival strikers: Ba (right) and Torres (left) have been competing with Eto'o for a place in the starting line-up . But Eto’o, whose contract expires next month, hit back yesterday, saying: ‘I am 33 years old. And it is not because a fool called me an old man that you must believe it. ‘And you may have noticed that the old man was better than the youngsters.’

chatgpt: Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta has hit back at Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho after he referred to Arsenal as 'specialists in failure'. Mourinho's comments came after Arsenal were knocked out of the Champions League in the round of 16, for the fourth consecutive year. Arteta spoke out in defense of his manager Arsene Wenger, saying that Mourinho should keep his thoughts to himself. Arteta, who has had a difficult season with injuries, also defended his own role at the club, stating that he should not be judged on his age. The 31-year-old midfielder has been a valuable asset to Arsenal since joining the club from Everton in 2011. Despite his struggles with injury this season, Arteta has remained a key member of the Arsenal squad and is highly regarded by his peers. Meanwhile, Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o has hit back at his own critics, stating that people should ignore those who have referred to him as an 'old man'. Eto'o, who joined Chelsea in the summer, has been in excellent form this season and has outperformed many of the younger forwards at the club. Mourinho has been full of praise for the veteran striker, stating that his experience and professionalism make him an invaluable member of the Chelsea squad. Eto'o has been a key player for Chelsea this season, scoring crucial goals in the Premier League and Champions League. The Cameroonian striker has been a regular starter for Mourinho, ahead of fellow strikers Fernando Torres and Demba Ba. His performances on the pitch have silenced his critics, who had initially questioned his age and ability to perform at the highest level. The animosity between Mourinho and Wenger has been well-documented over the years, with the two managers engaging in a number of heated exchanges. Mourinho's recent comments about Arsenal were the latest in a long line of jabs that he has aimed at Wenger. Despite this, Wenger has remained dignified in his response, stating that he would rather focus on the positive aspects of his team's performances. Arsenal are currently competing for the Premier League title, and have already secured their place in the FA Cup final. In conclusion, the rivalry between Arsenal and Chelsea continues to provide plenty of drama both on and off the pitch. Mourinho's comments about Arsenal have once again caused controversy, but Arteta's response and Eto'o's performances for Chelsea have shown that experience can be just as valuable as youth. As the season reaches its climax, both teams will be hoping to prove themselves as the top team in London, and cement their place in footballing history.
