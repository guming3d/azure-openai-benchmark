The Health Service Board became concerned by comments made by a coroner about local health services and commissioned a review by Vanguard Health. That review highlighted three cases of negligence by Dr Vega Vega –including him removing a healthy testicle in one patient, the wrong kidney in another, and nicking an artery in a third. Board chairman Charles Ware said one of the patient’s involved had to be transported to Brisbane for follow-up care after surgery by Dr Vega Vega. ‘It would appear that an artery was nicked during surgery but not detected, and (the patient) later re-presented to hospital with quite substantial blood loss,’ Mr Ware told Fairfax Radio. A fourth case occurred late last month, before the urologist was stood down. Dr Vega Vega has also voluntarily stood aside from his private work at the Mater Hospital following the allegations. He could not be contacted by the MailOnline. Malpractice: Dr Vega Vega allegedly cut out a man's healthy testicle and the wrong kidney in another patient.
