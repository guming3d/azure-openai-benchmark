article: A three-year-old was fatally shot on Monday after picking up her father's loaded gun he left out in the living room where he was cleaning it earlier in the day. Alexis Mercer, 3, of LeBleu Settlement  died at a local hospital on Monday night following the accidental shooting at her home on Arsene Road. 'This is a moment as a Sheriff that I have to tell people, you have got to protect our children,' said Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Tony Mancuso in an interview with KLPC. Accidental shooting death: Alexis Mercer, 3, was fatally shot on Monday after picking up her father's loaded gun left out in the open in the living room where he was cleaning it earlier in the day . Mancuso said the father had been cleaning his guns in the living room that day, while his wife and children were gone, and he did not put them up before leaving for work. When the mother returned home with the three children, ages 1-3, the 3-year-old girl was able to get one of the loaded guns, accidentally causing the gun to fire. 'It makes me angry,' said Mancuso. 'It makes my heart hurt. It's just something that shouldn't happen.' Sheriff's office spokeswoman Kim Myers said the other children were not injured. She says the assortment of guns included a rifle and two handguns and said the child most likely used the hand gun. Mancuso said incidents like this could have easily been avoided. 'Lock your guns, and keep them out of reach of children,' he said. 'They can't do it on their own. They're curious. They're going to go look. They're going to show a friend. If you can't afford a gun safe, every single gun that's sold in America comes with a gun lock. Lock your guns and keep them out of reach of children.' Myers said when the investigation is complete, the case will be turned over to the District Attorney's Office to determine if any charges will be filed. Services for Mercer will be handled by Johnson & Brown Funeral Home. Visitation for Mercer will take place from 3-9 p.m. on Friday at the funeral home, followed by a mass at 10 a.m. on Saturday. Father Bennie Wego will officiate. Burial will follow the mass at LeFranc Cemetery.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck in Louisiana on Sunday when a 3-year-old girl, identified as Alexis Mercer, accidentally shot herself with her father's gun. The incident occurred in the living room of the family's home in Moss Bluff, Louisiana. According to Parish Sheriff Tony Mancuso, the father had been cleaning his guns in the living room that day and had left them out unsecured. When the mother returned home with their three children, all under the age of 3, the 3-year-old girl was able to get her hands on one of the loaded guns. The gun reportedly fired, hitting the child in the head. The mother immediately called 911, and the child was transported to a local hospital. Unfortunately, she passed away a short time later. Sheriff Mancuso called the incident a "horrible tragedy," and stated that the father had been cooperative with the investigation. Mancuso emphasized the importance of securing firearms in the home, stating that "guns are not toys, and they need to be locked up." The investigation into the incident is ongoing, but Sheriff Mancuso stated that the case will be turned over to the District Attorney's Office to determine if any charges will be filed. Louisiana has a child access prevention law that imposes criminal liability on adults who fail to secure firearms in a manner that would prevent unauthorized access by children. The incident has sparked renewed debate about gun safety and the need for stricter gun control measures. Many advocates have called for increased education and training on gun safety, as well as stronger laws to prevent the unauthorized access to firearms by children. This is not the first time that a child has accidentally shot themselves or others with an unsecured firearm. According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, nearly 300 children in the United States gain access to a firearm and unintentionally shoot themselves or someone else each year. The tragedy in Louisiana serves as a grim reminder of the importance of responsible gun ownership and the need for stronger laws to prevent unauthorized access to firearms by children. As the investigation into the incident continues, our thoughts are with the Mercer family during this difficult time.
