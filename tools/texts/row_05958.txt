Tendinosis is caused by the long-term wear and tear of tendons which are put under consistent pressure without enough recovery time between periods of activity.

chatgpt: Real Madrid clinched the UEFA Super Cup with a 2-0 win over Sevilla in Cardiff on Tuesday, courtesy of two goals by their talismanic striker Cristiano Ronaldo. The victory was a significant milestone for manager Carlo Ancelotti, who has now won the competition four times in his illustrious career.  The match started in a cagey fashion, with both teams unwilling to take too many risks early on. However, Real Madrid gradually began to assert their dominance as the match wore on, and Ronaldo opened the scoring in the 30th minute with a low shot that beat the Sevilla goalkeeper at his near post. It was a typical Ronaldo goal, showcasing his incredible power and precision in front of goal. Sevilla tried to respond with a few half-chances of their own, but their efforts were thwarted by a resolute Real Madrid defence led by Sergio Ramos. The Spaniard was a tower of strength at the back, making numerous timely clearances and interceptions to keep Sevilla at bay. The turning point of the match came in the 49th minute when Ronaldo scored his second goal of the night, this time smashing a blistering shot past the goalkeeper from just inside the box. It was a stunning strike that left the Sevilla defence and their goalkeeper rooted to the spot.  Despite suffering from a long-standing knee injury, Ronaldo showed no signs of discomfort throughout the match. This was a welcome sign for Real Madrid supporters who have been desperate to see their star player back to his best after a difficult few months.  Ronaldo suffered the injury during the latter stages of last season and it had led some pundits to question his fitness ahead of the World Cup. However, he managed to play through the pain barrier and even scored a hat-trick in Portugal's opening group game against Spain. During the World Cup, Portugal's team doctor had revealed that Ronaldo was suffering from tendinosis, a condition that requires plenty of rest to heal properly. It seems that Ronaldo has taken heed of this advice and has been carefully managing his fitness in recent weeks. Real Madrid will be hoping that Ronaldo can maintain his fitness for the entire season, as he will be crucial to their quest for success in both domestic and European competitions. With the likes of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric also in good form, Real Madrid look like a formidable force this season, and they will be hoping to add more silverware to their already impressive trophy cabinet.
