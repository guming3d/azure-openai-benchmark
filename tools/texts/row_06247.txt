chatgpt: Shrewsbury Town will take on the current Premier League leaders Chelsea at New Meadow on Tuesday in the fifth round of the League Cup. This will be a daunting task considering there are 72 places between these two teams in the four football leagues, but the hosts have already shown their prowess by beating Blackpool, Leicester, and Norwich in the cup. The last time Shrewsbury Town played against Chelsea was in 1986 when they drew 1-1 at home.

Chelsea has been extremely dominant in recent weeks and has won both their Premier League and League Cup games convincingly. With a squad full of world-class players, the Blues have been relentless in their pursuit of success this season. Despite their status as underdogs, Shrewsbury Town has been a formidable force in the League Cup this campaign. The League One team has put in some impressive performances so far and have beaten higher-ranking teams to reach this stage of the competition. Their attacking prowess, combined with a solid defense, has been the core strength of Shrewsbury's cup run. However, they will face their biggest test yet, with Chelsea boasting a defense that has kept eight clean sheets in their last 13 away games in the League Cup.
