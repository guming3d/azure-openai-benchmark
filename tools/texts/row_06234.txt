chatgpt: Two 18-year-old girls from Florida are facing aggravated battery charges after an incident in which they were accused of hitting a dementia patient. Chemyra Barnett and Jacqueline Santos allegedly assaulted the patient who was under their care in February. According to the police report, the pair were seen hitting the elderly woman on the head and arms on multiple occasions. Shortly after, the victim reportedly began to decline in health and was no longer able to perform basic tasks without assistance. As a result, Barnett and Santos were arrested and charged with aggravated battery on an elderly person. They were later released on bond. In addition to the charges, the girls have also been banned from having cell phones. This comes after claims were made that the two were taking pictures and video of the victim while they were allegedly assaulting her. The decision to ban cell phones is part of a larger effort to prevent abuses of power and maltreatment in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. It is also meant to prevent individuals from sharing potentially incriminating evidence and spreading it on social media. The victim's family expressed shock and disappointment at the incident. They had trusted Barnett and Santos to care for their loved one and were appalled by the allegations. The case highlights the importance of proper training and background checks for those working in elder care. It also serves as a reminder that abuse of any kind, especially against vulnerable groups such as the elderly, will not be tolerated. Barnett and Santos are currently awaiting trial and could face significant jail time if convicted. Their defense attorneys have not yet released a statement on the matter.
