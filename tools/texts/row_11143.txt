article: (CNN) -- A Texas actress in a troubled marriage was arrested and charged Friday in connection with ricin-tainted letters that were mailed last month to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, authorities said. Shannon Richardson, 35, also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess, initially told the FBI that her husband, Nathaniel, sent the ricin-laced letters, but a polygraph exam found her to be "deceptive" on the matter, court papers said. Investigators found that her computer storage devices contained the text of threatening letters sent to the president, but the couple's computer records show her husband couldn't have printed them out because he was at work at the time, an FBI arrest affidavit said. On Thursday, Shannon Richardson told investigators she mailed the ricin-tainted letters, but she claimed that her husband typed the letters and forced her to print and mail them, the affidavit said. New poison letters put ricin under microscope . Her husband denied involvement and claimed his wife wanted to end their marriage and leave him, the affidavit said. He told investigators that his wife was "intentionally misleading" them, the court papers said. Shannon Richardson is accused of mailing a threatening communication to the president and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney John M. Bales' office in Texas. Also on Thursday, Nathaniel Richardson filed for divorce. His wife is pregnant, and the anticipated birth date and sex of the fetus is not known, the divorce lawsuit said. The couple married on October 8, 2011, the suit said. Shannon Richardson allegedly also mailed a third letter with the toxin ricin to Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which was founded and co-chaired by Bloomberg, the FBI arrest affidavit said. The group's office is in Washington. She made an initial appearance Friday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Caroline Craven in Texarkana, Texas, the prosecutor said. She was arrested in Mount Pleasant, Texas, authorities said. The three letters were mailed from Shreveport, Louisiana, last month, federal authorities say. The FBI found "very low concentrations" of ricin on the letters, a spokesman said last month. Richardson has had minor roles in TV series, including "The Walking Dead" and "The Vampire Diaries." A law enforcement official told CNN that investigators believe Richardson sent the letters herself. She was angry at her husband, the official said. CNN reported early in the investigation that the FBI considered Richardson to have serious credibility issues when they began interviewing her. What is ricin?

chatgpt: Shannon Richardson, a 35-year-old Texas woman who initially claimed that her husband sent ricin-tainted letters, has been arrested for allegedly mailing the letters herself, according to the FBI. Richardson had failed a polygraph test, and her husband told investigators that Richardson had wanted to end their marriage. Richardson eventually admitted to sending the letters but claimed that her husband had forced her to do it. The letters, which were sent to President Obama, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and gun control advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, arrived in May and contained a substance that appeared to be ricin. None of the recipients were harmed, as the substance was not potent enough to be lethal. Richardson's husband has filed for divorce, and court records show that she is also pregnant. The divorce filing cites "discord or conflict of personalities" as the reason for the divorce, but it does not mention the ricin incident. The case has drawn attention to the dangers of ricin, a highly toxic substance that can be made from common castor beans. Ricin poisoning can cause respiratory failure and other serious health problems, and there is no known antidote for the toxin. Authorities say that the ricin letters were part of a wider conspiracy by anti-government groups to attack government officials and agencies. The case has prompted renewed calls for increased security measures to protect public officials and other potentially vulnerable targets. Richardson's case highlights the complex issues surrounding domestic abuse and coercion. Experts say that domestic violence can take many forms, and that victims may feel trapped or unable to leave abusive situations. It is important for victims of domestic abuse to seek help and support from trusted friends, family members, or professionals. The case also highlights the importance of transparency and accuracy in criminal investigations. While polygraph tests are commonly used by law enforcement agencies, they are not foolproof and can be subject to interpretation. It is important for investigators to consider all available evidence and to be open to new information that could change their initial conclusions. Richardson faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted on charges of mailing a threatening communication. Her husband has not been charged with any crime in connection with the incident. The investigation into the ricin letters remains ongoing, and authorities say that additional arrests are possible.
