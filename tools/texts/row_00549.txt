chatgpt: A Florida couple has been charged with child neglect after their two-year-old son was found wandering around a trailer park wearing only a soiled diaper and covered in Magic Marker. Nikkie Hinkle, 26, and Joseph Rupp, 23, were charged with child neglect after police located the boy and discovered his parents were nowhere to be found. Police say it took them 15 minutes to locate Rupp, who eventually led them back to the home he shares with Hinkle. When police arrived at the home, they found Hinkle inside along with marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Both Hinkle and Rupp were taken into custody and face charges for child neglect, possession of marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. The boy has since been released into the care of a relative. It is unclear how long the child had been left unsupervised or how he managed to wander away from his parents' trailer. The Department of Children and Families has also been notified and is investigating the incident. This is not the first time Hinkle and Rupp have had run-ins with the law. Both have prior arrests for drug-related charges, and Rupp also has a history of violence. The incident has sparked outrage among residents of the trailer park, many of whom are families with small children. "It's just heartbreaking," said one resident. "How could anyone neglect their child like that?" Child neglect is a serious offense and can result in severe consequences for both the child and the parents. The incident serves as a reminder to all parents to prioritize the safety and well-being of their children above all else.
