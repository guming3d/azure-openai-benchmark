article: As Liverpool crashed out of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday evening, a familiar scapegoat emerged. Mario Balotelli took much of the immediate blame for failing to properly mark Branislav Ivanovic, allowing the Serbian defender a free header from seven yards out. As Willian prepared to whip in a free kick in the first period of extra-time, Balotelli was seen grabbing Ivanovic's shirt as Liverpool got in to their defensive shape. Branislav Ivanovic rises to head Chelsea 1-0 in front against Liverpool on Tuesday night . Ivanovic was initially being marked by Mario Balotelli but lost him to get a free header in the box . A few seconds later, however, Ivanovic had drifted behind his marker and fired in what turned out to be the winning goal in Chelsea's 1-0 victory. But was Balotelli solely to blame? Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher disagrees, instead highlighting faults in Liverpool's zonal marking system. Steven Gerrard, Lucas, Balotelli all line up in front of Chelsea's first attacker Ivanovic . As Willian takes his free-kick, Ivanovic moves behind his original marker Balotelli . Gerrard and Lucas are marking 'zones' with no Chelsea players in them due to poor positioning . Balotelli moves forward as Diego Costa goes into his 'zone' 'It's not Mario's fault the goal! In zonal defence you attack the space in front of you! Costa goes in front of him so he goes with him,' Carragher wrote on kicca. 'The fault initially is Gerrard, Lucas & Mario should all come back 3 yards so Stevie is in Lucas position etc. 'As Willian takes it there are 3 Chelsea players between Mario & Johnson/Skrtel that's the problem those 2 are wrong side so there's too much space for them to run into.' Indeed, replays of the goal seem to back up Carragher's assertions as Steven Gerrard and Lucas's starting position mean Willian's ball drifts completely past them into an area where Chelsea's players have plenty of room to run in to. As Liverpool line up to to defend the free-kick, Jordan Henderson is marking Diego Costa . But as the ball comes in to the box, Henderson fails to track Costa's run . Henderson's is left back near the penalty spot, while Costa has moved into Balotelli's zone . Balotelli jumps with Costa, leaving Ivanovic with a free header to score . In effect, Gerrard and Lucas were defending 'zones' they did not need too as Chelsea had no players in or attacking that space. Therefore, as Carragher says, Liverpool's line should have moved three yards back. Balotelli, meanwhile, can be seen stepping forward and challenging Diego Costa as the Chelsea striker moves into his 'zone' after losing his marker Jordan Henderson. Had Henderson stayed with Costa then Balotelli may not have had to step forward and may have been better positioned to challenge Ivanovic. Balotelli must take responsibility for his lack of movement during his brief cameo at Stamford Bridge, but to blame him for the goal - is that really fair?

chatgpt: Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli came under fire after he appeared to have lost his man during a free-kick, leading to Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic scoring the winning goal in the team's recent match. However, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher believes that the problem may lie with the team's zonal system. Balotelli had initially been tasked with marking Ivanovic during the free-kick, but it appeared that he became distracted and lost track of his man, allowing the Chelsea defender to score the winning goal. Balotelli's poor performance during the game was further criticized by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, who substituted him off the field in the second half. However, Carragher defended Balotelli, suggesting that the blame should not be solely placed on the striker. Instead, he believes that the problems lie in Liverpool's zonal marking system, which may require a complete overhaul. "I think we need to change the zonal system because there are too many things happening in the zone," Carragher said in a post-match analysis. "I think Balotelli lost his man but I don't think it was his fault. I think there are too many things happening in that area, and it's making it difficult for players to mark their men." Carragher's comments highlight a growing concern among Liverpool supporters and pundits, who have criticized the team's defensive performances this season. Liverpool has conceded a total of 35 goals in the English Premier League so far, and their defensive frailties were once again exposed in the recent Chelsea match. Despite Liverpool's loss, Rodgers remained optimistic about the team's prospects, particularly after their impressive win against Manchester City in the previous match. "We're disappointed we didn't get the win but the performance level was outstanding," he said. Liverpool will have to regroup quickly as they prepare for a crucial period of fixtures, including the Europa League quarterfinals against Borussia Dortmund and Premier League matches against Stoke City, Bournemouth, and Everton. Chelsea, meanwhile, booked their place at Wembley with the 1-0 win over Liverpool in the second leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, which saw them progress 2-1 on aggregate. The team will now face Tottenham in the final on March 1. The win was also a morale-booster for Chelsea, who have struggled to replicate the same form that saw them win the Premier League last season. Despite their troubles, Blues' manager Guus Hiddink insisted that his team is still capable of winning major trophies this season. "Chelsea is still Chelsea, and still a team that in big games can perform," Hiddink said after the game. "Everyone needs to be on top of their game to win the competition, but we are still in it." Overall, the match showcased the continuing struggles of Liverpool's defense, while also revealing the determination and resilience of a struggling Chelsea side. Moving forward, both teams will need to address their weaknesses if they hope to achieve success in the remainder of the season.
