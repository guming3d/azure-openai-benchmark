article: (CNN) -- The remains found last week on the bank of an Illinois river and near a blue barrel are not those of Stacy Peterson, Illinois state police said Wednesday. Partial skeletal remains were found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River near Channahon, Illinois. Many people speculated that the remains, found near the Des Plaines River less than 30 miles from the homes of Peterson and another missing woman, Lisa Stebic, meant one of their disappearances would be solved. But testing done on the remains showed they belonged to a male, police said. Officials had to conduct further testing on the "partial skeletal remains," consisting of a rib cage, spinal column and partial left and right femur, after a preliminary autopsy did not reveal any identifying information. A marine cleanup crew discovered the remains in Channahon, Illinois, last week along with shreds of blue jeans and a small amount of money. Stacy Peterson, 23 when she was last seen in October 2007, was former police officer Drew Peterson's fourth wife. They lived in Bolingbrook, Illinois, 20 miles from where the remains were discovered. Her husband has been named a suspect in her disappearance, but he has maintained his innocence, saying she left him for another man. The ex-officer's stepbrother told police he helped Drew Peterson move a heavy blue barrel shortly after his wife's disappearance. Police uncover skeletal remains Â» . So when news came that a few days before the remains were discovered a woman named Michelle Williams found a blue barrel in the same area, many people expected Stacy Peterson had been found. Though her case still remains a mystery, her family remains hopeful there will be a solution. Drew Peterson was indicted May 7 on charges he killed his third wife, Kathleen Savio. Savio died while the two were in the midst of a nasty divorce. The death was originally deemed an accident, but authorities took a second look at the case after Stacy Peterson's disappearance. Drew Peterson has pleaded not guilty. Others had suspected the remains could be those of Lisa Stebic. Channahon is 15 miles from Plainfield, Illinois, where Stebic was last seen in April 2007. On the day she disappeared, she petitioned a court to have her husband, Craig, evicted from their Plainfield home. Craig Stebic told police he was working in the backyard when his 37-year-old wife left home about 6 p.m., taking her cell phone and purse. Authorities have said they believe that Lisa Stebic was the victim of foul play and have named Craig Stebic a suspect.

chatgpt: Chicago, IL - Officials have confirmed that the remains found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River belong to a male. After conducting testing on the remains, authorities have discovered that the rib cage, spinal column, and partial left femur bones were among the body parts that were found. The area where the remains were discovered is near the homes of both Stacy Peterson and Lisa Stebic, two women who went missing in 2007. Although it is still unconfirmed whether the remains belong to either of the two women or somebody else, authorities have indicated that they are not ruling out any possibilities at this point in the investigation. The discovery of these remains has brought new hope to the families of both Peterson and Stebic, who have been searching for answers for over a decade. It's a bittersweet moment for the families who have been waiting for clues about their loved ones' whereabouts for years. Lisa Stebic went missing in April of 2007. At the time of her disappearance, she was living in Plainfield, Illinois, with her two children and her husband, Craig Stebic. Her husband has since been named a person of interest in her disappearance but has maintained his innocence. Stacy Peterson, on the other hand, went missing in October of 2007. She was married to Drew Peterson, a former police officer, who was later convicted of murdering his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2012. Peterson has been named a suspect in his fourth wife's disappearance but has not been charged in connection with her case. The discovery of these remains has sparked renewed efforts among law enforcement officials to investigate both cases. Authorities are asking anyone with information related to the disappearance of either Peterson or Stebic to come forward and provide any evidence that could help in identifying the remains found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River. While the discovery of these remains is a milestone in these two cases, it's important to remember that there are families who are still searching for loved ones who have gone missing. According to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, there are approximately 90,000 people currently reported missing in the United States. The identification of these remains is just one step in a long and often frustrating journey for the families of missing loved ones. Even with advances in technology and forensic science, there are still cases that remain unsolved, leaving families with more questions than answers. As the investigation into these remains continues, authorities have emphasized that they are committed to pursuing every lead and following every trail until the truth is uncovered. The families of both Stacy Peterson and Lisa Stebic are hopeful that after so many years of searching, they may finally have the closure they deserve.
