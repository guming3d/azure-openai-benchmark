chatgpt: Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson has issued a stern warning to fans who attend their home games only to criticise. The 52-year-old manager made the statement following his team's 3-1 loss against Liverpool.  Speaking to reporters during the post-match press conference, Pearson expressed his frustration with the negative attitude of some supporters. "I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn't like what he sees, then don't bother coming," Pearson stated. "People who come to our stadium, who have got no better encouragement than that, I'd rather they stayed at home." Pearson's comments came after his team's disappointing performance against the Reds at the King Power Stadium. The Foxes dominated possession early in the game but failed to convert their chances. Liverpool seized control of the match in the second half, with goals from Roberto Firmino, James Milner and Christian Benteke. The loss was Leicester's eighth defeat of the season, leaving them with just 10 points from 14 games. The result has raised fears that the team could become embroiled in a relegation battle if their fortunes do not improve. Pearson was keen to stress that he remained confident in his team's ability to turn their season around, despite the poor start. "I'm genuinely quite pragmatic about where we are. We've got 24 games to go and there's a lot of things we've done well this season," he said. Leicester City supporters have not responded well to Pearson's comments, with many taking to social media to express their disgust. Some have argued that Pearson's criticism of the club's own fans is unwarranted, while others have called for him to be sacked. Despite the backlash, Pearson's message is clear: if you're not at the King Power Stadium to support the team, stay away. His stern warning to fans may be just what the club needs to galvanise the players and turn their season around.
