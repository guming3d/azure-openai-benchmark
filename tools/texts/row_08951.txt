article: More than 100 Vietnamese mail-order brides have vanished after marrying Chinese bachelors from the same poor rural area. Police are investigating the mass disappearance from Quzhou county, Handan, in the central province of Hebei, with reports saying that an 'organised ring' could be involved. Poor bachelors from the area, which is mainly a farming community, had paid tens of thousands to a Vietnamese matchmaker who vanished along with the brides. Runaway brides: Chinese police are seeking more than 100 Vietnamese mail-order brides who vanished after marrying bachelors from a poor rural area. It is thought a people smuggling ring may be involved . After decades of family planning policies and a traditional preference for boys, the male population now far outnumbers women in China, making it difficult to find a wife. The area's bachelors were introduced to the women by Wu Meiyu, a Vietnamese bride who had lived in the area for 20 years, China Daily reported. She received payments of more than 100,000 yuan ($16,000, Â£10,300) if the introductions were successful. She also disappeared with the women, it added. The state-run newspaper cited an unnamed local official saying an organised ring may have been involved in the mass disappearance. 'With the advanced communication techniques of today, it's easy for all the brides to leave at the same time,' he told the newspaper. The BBC, citing local media, reports that Ms Wu had earlier this year travelled around rural parts of Hebei drumming up customers for Vietnamese mail-order brides. Then on November 20, after she'd made more than 100 matches, the wives are said to have told their new husbands they were having a meal with other Vietnamese brides. They then disappeared. At least one bride has since returned, according to the BBC report citing Jinghua Daily. She said she had 'lost consciousness' after eating and woke up in a small house far from Quzhou. Someone in the house was said to have told her she would be going somewhere else to 'find another husband'. Instead she left and returned to Quzhou where she filed a police report. Buying wives from abroad has become increasingly common in some of China's poor rural areas, where a gender imbalance has developed due to a traditional preference for sons and the country's family planning policies. Across China, 118 males are born for every 100 females, according to government statistics. In some rural areas men can be expected to own a house, car and have considerable wealth before they can attract a Chinese bride, a cost the China Daily said could reach 400,000 yuan. But with many unable to do so the trade in overseas brides, which is often linked to human trafficking, has grown in China.

chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, a matchmaker has disappeared after taking money from several Vietnamese women to arrange introductions. The women were promised a meal with potential suitors and eagerly awaited their chance at finding love. However, the night turned into a nightmare when all of the women vanished without a trace. Despite efforts from authorities to locate the women, it was only recently that one of them returned. The woman, who requested anonymity, recounted a harrowing tale of falling unconscious and waking up in a faraway house. According to her, she was told that she was being taken "somewhere to find a new husband". The incident has sent shockwaves across the Vietnamese community, leaving many women fearful for their safety. It has also raised questions about the dangers of relying on third-party matchmakers who may not have their clients' best interests at heart. One of the women who spoke to local media talked about how she had paid the matchmaker $1,000 for the chance to meet potential suitors. She described the woman as "charming and friendly" but now feels betrayed and angry. She went on to say that until the women are found, her community will be fearful of trusting anyone that they do not already know. The police are currently investigating the matter and have urged anyone with information about the missing women to come forward. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese community has also rallied behind the families of the missing women, with some organizing search parties to try and locate them. The incident has highlighted the need for caution when seeking love through non-traditional channels. While matchmakers can provide valuable assistance in finding the right partner, it is important that potential clients thoroughly research their background and credentials before engaging their services. The Vietnamese government has also promised to crack down on fraudulent matchmakers who take advantage of people's desires for love and companionship. It has called on the public to report any suspicious activity and to be vigilant when dealing with individuals who claim to be professional matchmakers. For now, the fate of the missing Vietnamese women remains unknown. Their families and loved ones are left praying for their safe return, and hoping that justice will be served for this heinous crime.
