article: Mali has refused to accept the body of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly in a sudden U-turn the day before he was expected to be buried in the soil of his birth country. The gunman who murdered four hostages in a Kosher delicatessen as well as a policewoman was due to be buried in Bamako today; instead he remains in a fridge in the Forensic Institute in Paris. Malian authorities have reportedly given no reason for the change of heart, which means Coulibaly is now likely to be buried somewhere in France. Scroll down for video . Nowhere to go: The body of French jihadi Amedy Coulibaly has been rejected by his birth country, Mali. Coulibaly killed four customers of a kosher supermarket as well as a policewoman . 'If Mali refuses to bury him on its territory, he will be buried in France,' said government spokesman Stéphane Le Foll this morning, without elaborating. The 32-year-old small-time dope dealer-cum-terrorist was gunned down by police as they raided the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in east Paris on January 9, the day police tracked down Charlie Hebdo massacre gunmen Chérif and Saïd Kouachi. A day earlier he had shot dead a policewoman in the street and critically injured a street sweeper. The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris - last weekend. Both were interred at night in unmarked graves, as authorities feared their resting places could become places of pilgrimage for extremists. The brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which they killed 12 people. Charlie Hebdo killers: The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris . Neither brothers' hometown wanted the terrorists, but were forced to find graves for them by a French law that grants a right to be buried in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed. French media reports that no request for a grave has been made in Grigny, the impoverished south Paris suburb where Coulibaly grew up and where his mother and sister still live, nor in Viry-Chatillon, where he was registered to vote. So it seems most likely Coulibaly will be buried in Fontenay-aux-Roses, the Paris suburb where he had rented a safe house. A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.'

chatgpt: A West African country has decided to reject the body of a killer that was recently killed in Paris. The country has yet to provide any reason for their decision, leaving many wondering what could be behind their choice. The killer, who had been living in Paris, was killed in an altercation with police officers earlier this month. Following his death, his body was transferred to the Forensic Institute in Paris, where it has remained on ice ever since. Despite attempts to contact the authorities in the West African country, no reason has been given for their decision to reject the body. As a result, it seems likely that the killer will now be buried in Paris, where he lived prior to his death. Many have been left to speculate about the reasons behind the West African country's decision. Some have suggested that it may be related to political tensions between the two nations, while others think that it could be a matter of religious or cultural differences. Whatever the reason may be, the rejection of the killer's body has caused frustration and confusion for those involved. The French authorities have been left to deal with the situation, which has further strained relations between the two countries. This is not the first time that West African countries have been involved in controversies surrounding the bodies of deceased individuals. In some cases, families have been forced to leave loved ones behind and return home without closure. In other cases, bodies have been held in limbo for months or even years while disputes are resolved. This latest incident highlights the need for greater understanding and cooperation between nations when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of violent incidents. Without clear guidelines and protocols in place, situations like this can quickly spiral out of control, causing unnecessary pain and suffering for those involved. As the killer's body remains on ice in the Forensic Institute in Paris, the people of both France and the West African country are left to wonder what will happen next. Will the body be buried in Paris, or will the West African country reconsider their decision and accept it? Whatever the outcome may be, one thing is clear: the rejection of the killer's body has raised important questions about the relationship between nations and the role that protocol and procedure play in international affairs.
