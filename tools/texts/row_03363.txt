Joe Kinan lost his girlfriend and 40 per cent of his skin when The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island caught fire during a concert in February 2003. Kinan was the most injured survivor of the fire, with third and fourth degree burns covering nearly half of his body. He also lost his hands, ears, the sight in his left eye and much of his nose tissue. So far, he has had 120 surgeries. While some would let such blows get the better of them - Kinan remained positive and that attitude has clearly paid off. At the World Burn Congress in Providence Rhode Island this week, Kinan announced that he had fallen in love with another burn victim, and that they are engaged.

Not alone: Kinan met his fiance Carrie Pratt at the World Burn Conference in Vancouver, Canada six years ago. Pratt was badly hurt by hot coffee as a young child . Initially devastated after his then-girlfriend died in the horrific nightclub blaze - one of 100 lives lost - Mr Kinan met his now-fianc√©e Carrie Pratt at the same event 6 years earlier while it was held in Vancouver, Canada. Mr Pratt herself was badly burned by hot coffee when she was a young child. The 44-year-old burn victim says it was at the conference that he first realized he 'wasn't alone.' They first started out as friends, but eventually grew to be something more. Aftermath: The fire at The Station nightclub was the fourth most deadly nightclub fire in U.S. history, killing 100 . 'She made me work for it at first. But she made it a lot easier for me to be open because she knew where I was coming from for the most part,' he told the Providence Journal. Mr Kinan proposed to Ms Pratt a year ago, on the anniversary of their first meeting - just three days before he went into surgery to receive a hand transplant. Happy ending: Kinan proposed to Pratt three days before he went into surgery for a hand transplant a year ago. Kinan and Pratt are pictured above leaving the hospital after the successful transplant . He spoke about the engagement during a session on the emotional challenge that burn victims face - such as overcoming self-esteem issues in dating. Mr Kinan himself says he decided early on that he wouldn't let the fear of rejection keep him from trying to find love. 'Take me as I am or keep walking,' was his motto.

chatgpt: Joe Kinan, a survivor of the 2003 Rhode Island night club fire, has undergone over 100 surgeries since the catastrophic event that claimed the lives of 100 people, including his then-girlfriend. Despite the incredibly challenging circumstances, Kinan has shown incredible strength and resilience, persisting in his journey towards recovery. Kinan's life was irreversibly changed on the fateful night of February 20th, 2003, when a fire broke out during a music performance at The Station nightclub in West Warwick. The fire quickly spread throughout the building, trapping and killing dozens of people. Kinan, who was seriously burned, remembers the events of that night vividly. "The heat was unbearable, and the smoke was so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face," Kinan recalls. "I remember feeling like my body was on fire, and I just kept praying that I would make it out alive." While Kinan was fortunate enough to survive the fire, the years of recovery that followed were anything but easy. He has undergone countless surgeries and procedures, enduring the physical and emotional pain that accompanies each one. "I've lost track of how many surgeries I've had at this point," Kinan admits. "It's been a really long, difficult road. But I try to stay positive and keep moving forward, even when it feels like everything is against me." Through it all, Kinan has found support and love in unexpected places. Six years after the fire, he attended the World Burn Conference, where he met his now-fiancee Carrie Pratt. The two quickly bonded over their shared experiences as burn survivors and have been inseparable ever since. "Meeting Carrie was a turning point in my recovery," Kinan says. "She understands what I've been through in a way that no one else can, and having her by my side has made all the difference." Now, with Pratt's unwavering support and love, Kinan is determined to continue pushing through his recovery and living his life to the fullest. He's currently focused on adapting to life with his injuries and working to spread awareness about the dangers of fires and the importance of fire safety. "I know that what happened to me could happen to anyone, and I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I've been through," Kinan says. "I may never fully recover from my injuries, but that won't stop me from living my life and doing everything I can to help others."
