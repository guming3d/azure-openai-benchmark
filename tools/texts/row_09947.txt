article: By . Adam Duggan . While most Australians were spending Good Friday settling in for the Easter long weekend, one group of committed drinkers spent their day loutishly terrorising a Perth neighbourhood instead. A video uploaded to YouTube last Wednesday by University of Western Australia student Ben Fromson, 22, shows the men drunkenly cycling from house to house in an event they called the ‘Tour de Fridge’. Visiting seven houses on their all-day drinking endeavour, the almost 80 men reportedly consumed 1,600 beers – an average of 20 each. Scroll down for video .

Unconcerned with the unsightly behaviour neighbours were subjected to, the men spent the warm day engaged in a public display of inappropriateness. Their 'tour' started with the men converging on their bicycles at one participant’s house, where they poured wine from a cask into one anothers mouths. At another early point in their tour, a smaller group of men can be seen pouring beer onto one participant’s hairy breasts and drinking it from his bare skin.

As the day progressed, some of the men began removing their clothing and jumping into swimming pools. Being so intoxicated that they were vomiting wasn’t even enough to deter some of them – merely serving as an opportunity to empty their stomachs so they could drink more. It might seem like harmless fun to some, but the group appear to be showing no concern for the safety of local residents who may have come across the group.

chatgpt: Dozens of men who were reportedly binge-drinking took part in a Good Friday cycling tour. Reports indicate that participants of the event consumed over 1,600 beers during the course of the day. While cycling tours have become increasingly popular in many parts of the world, this particular event quickly became known for its excessive alcohol consumption. According to some reports, participants were seen drinking beer while riding their bikes on public streets, causing alarm among other cyclists and pedestrians. The Good Friday cycling tour is an annual event that draws participants from all over the country. For many, it's a chance to get together with friends, explore new areas on their bikes and enjoy the camaraderie that comes with a shared experience. However, this year's event was different. Many participants reportedly showed up to the event with large quantities of beer and other alcoholic drinks, and throughout the day they proceeded to consume them. Witnesses reported seeing participants visibly intoxicated cycling on public streets, some of them swerving and veering as they tried to navigate their way through the crowds. The Good Friday cycling tour has always been a largely unregulated event, with participants typically responsible for their own safety and well-being. However, as concerns grow over the impact of excessive alcohol consumption on public health and safety, many are calling for tighter restrictions on events like this. Some participants of the event were filmed drinking beer while riding their bikes on public streets. The footage, which was widely circulated on social media, has sparked outrage among many who see this behavior as irresponsible and dangerous. "I couldn't believe what I was seeing," said one witness who saw participants drinking while cycling. "It was like they had no regard for anyone else's safety or well-being. It was just all about getting drunk and having a good time, whatever the cost." The Good Friday cycling tour organizers have not commented on the reports of excessive drinking at this year's event. However, many are calling for the event to be cancelled or restructured to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. In conclusion, the Good Friday cycling tour in this year's edition became a worrying spectacle due to the excessive amount of alcohol consumed by participants. The footage of participants drinking beer while riding their bikes on public streets has prompted widespread concern and calls for more stringent regulations on such events. It remains to be seen whether organizers will take these concerns seriously and take appropriate action to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
