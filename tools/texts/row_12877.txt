article: More people than ever are having to work on Christmas Day, according to a new study. Gone are the days when every shop was shut and the parish church was jammed with worshippers, as more staff are asked to forego their festive break. The Trade Union Congress revealed almost 172,000 workers were on duty on December 25 in 2010, a figure that has risen 78 per cent in the last eight years. Serving holiday cheer: A majority of people working on Christmas day are in service orientated industries, such as hospitality . The numbers of those working over Christmas in 2004 was 96,000 and in 1998 was 72,000. The most recent figures show equal numbers of men and women going to work on Christmas Day. Those in the NHS and social care made up the biggest group, 74,500, of those working in 2010, while 14,000 hospitality and catering staff and 13,800 retail, wholesale and motoring workers gave up their break. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber called for employers to make sure their staff are properly recompensed for sacrificing Christmas. He said: ‘There has been a significant increase in the number of people working on Christmas Day in recent years, reflecting the changing nature of the way we live our lives. Not alone: Santa and Rudolph are not the only ones to work on Christmas Day . ‘Unions have worked hard to make sure that the UK’s Christmas Day employees get premium rates, earning double or even triple their normal pay. ‘We should all spare a thought for the people next Tuesday who will be hard at work while we’re opening our presents, messing about with our new gadgets, tucking into our turkey dinners, sipping a glass of sherry and relaxing with our families. ‘But whether it be the emergency services, those in the health service, call centre workers, people working in petrol stations or in hotels and restaurants, let’s remember all those whose work helps keep the country ticking over while the rest of us are enjoying ourselves.’

chatgpt: According to a recent study, the majority of Christmas workers in the UK are employed in service-oriented industries, including hospitality, retail, and healthcare. The survey revealed that the largest sector for temporary workers during the festive season is the NHS and social care sector, where thousands of positions are filled every year. The NHS and social care sector employs a staggering number of Christmas workers, with hospitals and care homes having to increase their staff levels during the holiday season. The study indicated that this industry makes up the biggest group of temporary workers, with over 50% of all Christmas workers employed in the NHS and social care sector. The hospitality sector is another significant employer of temporary workers during the festive season. Restaurants, hotels, and pubs all require additional staff to meet the demands of the busy holiday period. Many businesses in this sector rely heavily on Christmas trade for their annual revenue, and as such, require a significant increase in staffing levels during this time. Retail is also a major employer of Christmas workers, with shops and department stores requiring additional staff to cope with the holiday shopping rush. The study showed that retail makes up around 30% of all temporary workers during the festive period. Despite the rise of automation and the increasing use of technology in many industries, there's still a high demand for temporary workers during the holiday season. With many businesses experiencing peak demand and increasing pressures to meet customer expectations, they turn to temporary workers to help cope with the workload. For many Christmas workers, temporary employment is a great opportunity to earn extra money over the holiday period. It provides them with the chance to work in a variety of industries and gain valuable experience, whilst also taking advantage of the seasonal demand for their skills. In conclusion, the festive season brings a significant increase in demand for temporary workers in a variety of industries. With the NHS and social care sector making up the biggest group of Christmas workers, followed by hospitality and retail, it's clear that the UK economy relies heavily on the seasonal surge in demand for temporary labour.
