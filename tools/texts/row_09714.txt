When it comes to livening up a presentation, pointing a gun at your audience is perhaps taking matters a bit far. After all, you want those listening to be interested, not scared witless. It is advice that it seems the homeland security director of New York should heed, because he reportedly used the laser sighting on a handgun to aid a presentation he gave last year and left several officials feeling distinctly uneasy. Controversial: Jerome Hauer, pictured during a different presentation, allegedly used a handgun laser sight to point at a map . Sight to behold: Hauer rattled officials as the laser swept across their heads, eyewitnesses said . Jerome Hauer was giving a talk at the state police headquarters in Albany on October 24 to foreign officials when he drew out a handgun and used the laser sighting to point to a map of New York, according to the Times Union. In the process, an eyewitness told the paper, he moved the barrel across the heads of three Swedish emergency managers, who were said to be rather shaken by the experience. Two people quickly moved out of the way, another witness said. The briefing was about the stateâ€™s response to Superstorm Sandy. But now Mr Hauer, who is said to frequently carry a 9mm Glock handgun, has caused a storm of his own. Mr Hauer admitted that using the gun was an error of judgement, but denied that he swept it across anyone. He told MailOnline: 'This was an unloaded gun. It was never pointed at anyone. No one was rattled. It was pointed at a wall. It was a mistake to use it.'

chatgpt: Jerome Hauer, a well-known emergency management expert, has found himself in hot water for inappropriate gun use. Witnesses say that during a meeting with several officials, Hauer used a laser sighting on a gun to point at a map. However, instead of simply pointing to the designated areas, he allegedly tracked the laser sight across the heads of several officials, causing alarm and concern among those in attendance. The incident quickly sparked outrage among the officials, who were left shaken by the experience. They reported feeling threatened and uncomfortable, causing a scene that quickly escalated into a full-blown investigation. Hauer, for his part, initially denied that he had used the gun inappropriately. However, after being shown video evidence clearly depicting the incident, he eventually admitted that using the gun in such a manner was a mistake. Though the gun was unloaded at the time of the incident, witnesses say that Hauer's reckless behavior still put everyone in the room at risk. The incident has brought attention to the issue of gun safety in professional settings, prompting many to call for stricter policies regarding firearm use in the workplace. In the aftermath of the incident, Hauer has faced widespread criticism from the emergency management community. Many have called on him to resign from his position in light of the incident, which they view as a clear violation of professional standards. Despite the backlash, Hauer has expressed his regret for the incident, stating that he never intended to cause harm or alarm. He has promised to take steps to ensure that such an incident never happens again, including undergoing additional gun safety training. In the end, the incident serves as a cautionary tale for those who work in high-stress, high-pressure environments. Whether it is through intentional actions or simple carelessness, any behavior that creates a sense of fear or unease among colleagues can have serious consequences, both professionally and personally.
