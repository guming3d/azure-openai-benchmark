article: (CNN) -- Two national police officers were wounded Sunday when a gunman shot at officers outside the Italian prime minister's office, authorities said. The gunman, described as a 49-year-old man, fired six shots at police before being taken into custody, said a national police officer who was not authorized to speak to the media. The officers didn't suffer life-threatening wounds, and the shooter was also hospitalized -- though not wounded, the source said. Francesco Puglisi, a journalist for Il Tempo newspaper, heard the shots from his office, then saw police tackle the man. He ran to the scene and said the face-down suspect appeared calm and was complying with police. The gunman wanted to commit suicide after the attack but ran out of bullets, Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said in a televised statement. The shooting took place in front of the prime minister's office, but Enrico Letta was being sworn in as prime minister at the time at the president's palace a short distance away, state-run news agency ANSA said. The agency also reported that prosecutor Pierfilippo Laviani said the shooter had confessed and was hoping to shoot politicians but found none so he struck out at police. Security at key government buildings was strengthened after the attack, though officials said they thought it was an isolated incident. The shooter, who is unemployed, lives in the southern region of Calabria, officials said. On Saturday, Letta, a center-left politician, accepted a mandate to form a government from President Giorgio Napolitano. The 46-year-old former deputy prime minister and his ministers were sworn in Sunday, and parliament is expected to confirm his government through a vote of confidence Monday. Letta's acceptance of the leadership role is expected to limit the uncertainty that has gripped the nation since February when elections left none of the candidates with enough support to form a government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Letta a trusted friend of Washington. "We wish him the best as he promotes reform at home and ensures continued Italian leadership abroad, and we look forward to continuing our close cooperation with Italy on many pressing issues all over the world," Kerry said.

chatgpt: The United States administration has sent its congratulations to Italy's newly appointed Prime Minister Enrico Letta. The gesture comes amidst a series of events that have taken place in Rome's vicinity today. As the appointment of the new Prime Minister was being announced at the President's Palace in Rome, a gunman opened fire on a group of police officers stationed nearby. According to an official statement, the gunman was hoping to end his own life but was unable to do so due to the exhaustion of his ammunition. The attack left two police officers with non-life-threatening injuries and sent Rome into a state of high alert. The officers were immediately rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, while the gunman was taken into custody for further questioning. The incident has sent shockwaves throughout Italy, especially given its timing, which coincided with the swearing-in ceremony of the country's new leader. The motive behind the attack remains unknown, however, authorities have been quick to reassure the public that this was a lone wolf attack and there is no reason to believe it was part of any larger plot. In light of the attack, the U.S. administration has issued a statement expressing its solidarity with Italy and congratulated PM Letta on his new position. The statement read, "The United States congratulates Prime Minister Letta on his appointment and stands in solidarity with the people of Italy during this difficult time." The incident highlights once again the ongoing security concerns in Europe amid a surge in attacks across the continent. It also serves as a reminder of the need for countries to work together in combating terrorism and ensuring the safety of their citizens. Prime Minister Letta has yet to make a statement on the attack or on his new role, but he is expected to address the nation in the coming days. The incident comes at a critical time for Italy, which is grappling with a myriad of issues ranging from a struggling economy, to a growing social divide, to an ongoing refugee crisis. Despite these challenges, however, the appointment of a new leader has brought renewed hope for a brighter future in Italy, and the country remains determined to overcome its difficulties and emerge stronger than ever.
