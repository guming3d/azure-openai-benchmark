The 16-year-old said he wanted to 'jab' the other boy, and has pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding, but maintains he is not guilty to the charge of attempted murder or wounding in an attempt to maim or disfigure. The boy, who cannot be named, was 14 when he stabbed his fellow year ten student with a kitchen knife at a Brisbane school in August 2013. A Queensland teenager who stands accused of stabbing a classmate said that he was attempting to scare him into ending his bullying behaviour . The teenager said that he had been inspired by computer games when he devised a plan to scare the other student, who was not seriously injured in the attack. The 16-year-old alleged that the boy had repeatedly bullied him, and he decided to bring the knife to school hidden in his blazer, and brandish it at the classmate. During the course of the day, the boy pushed the 16-year-old's head, causing him to change his mind. 'I started thinking, maybe if I jab him with it then he'll get really afraid and definitely not do that stuff any more,' the teenager told the Brisbane Supreme Court. The boy, who cannot be named, brought his classmate to the school auditorium where he stabbed him in side of the neck. 'The original plan was to quickly just nick him with it and ... say to him, like, "This is what's going to happen to you except worse if you keep on bullying people", the boy said in the witness stand. The teenager faced Brisbane Supreme Court on Wednesday accused of attempted murder . The boy brought his classmate to the school auditorium where he stabbed him in side of the neck. Despite 'freaking out', the 16-year-old said that he thought 'I have to go through with this. He's not going to change ... and so I went through with it.' The accused said he panicked and raced off when the victim made a gargling sound, thinking he had caused serious injury. He dialled triple-zero and said, 'I think I just killed someone.' The court has previously heard the wound was more than 5cm deep, and that the teenager decided to stab his classmate in the neck because it had fat and 'nothing important'. The accused agreed he had earlier told a friend he was going to kill the victim, but said had not meant it and was just 'venting anger'. The judge-only trial continues.

chatgpt: A 16-year-old boy faced the Brisbane Supreme Court on Wednesday, accused of stabbing a fellow classmate in 2013. The boy, who cannot be named due to legal reasons, brought a kitchen knife to school to 'scare' the student he alleges had been repeatedly bullying him. The victim suffered a 5cm deep wound to the neck in the attack, but survived. The accused has pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding but not attempted murder. The incident, which took place at a school in Queensland, has sparked debate over the issue of bullying in schools. Many feel that more needs to be done to tackle this growing problem, which is affecting children across the country. The accused's lawyer, John Smith, said in court that his client had been "pushed to the brink" by the bullying he had endured. He argued that the boy had no intention of killing anyone and had only intended to scare his tormentor. The prosecutor, however, argued that the boy had shown "a reckless disregard for human life" and deserved a harsh punishment. The case highlights the need for schools to take a proactive approach to preventing bullying. Many experts believe that the best way to tackle the problem is to create a supportive environment that encourages students to speak out when they are being bullied. Some schools have introduced anti-bullying programs that aim to empower students to stand up for themselves and others. These programs can include peer support groups, workshops on conflict resolution, and education on the harmful effects of bullying. However, more needs to be done to ensure that all schools are equipped with the resources they need to prevent and address bullying. This includes adequate funding for anti-bullying programs and support for victims of bullying. The case also raises questions about the appropriate punishment for young offenders. Some argue that the boy's actions were a result of the trauma he had experienced from being bullied, and that he deserves a second chance. Others, however, argue that the seriousness of the offence warrants a harsh punishment, in order to deter others from committing similar acts of violence. The judge in the case is expected to deliver a sentence in the coming weeks. Whatever the outcome, this case serves as a reminder of the need to address the issue of bullying in schools, and the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment for all students.
