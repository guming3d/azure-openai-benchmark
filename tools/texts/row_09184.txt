But more than a quarter (27 per cent) are still driven to organise one because of 'playground peer pressure' among parents, as well as friends and family. Cash-strapped parents are throwing lavish birthday parties for their children because of playground peer pressure . And more than a third (36 per cent) are splashing out between 80 pounds and a staggering 500 pounds per party in a bid to impress their guests. The report also found the trend for taking cakes and party bags into school for classmates is piling even more pressure on parents' already low incomes. It means 46 per cent of hard-hit families are forced to start saving more than a month in advance of their children's birthday. Others have to prepare for the big day by slashing household costs (21 per cent) or going without new clothes for themselves and their children (27 per cent). The pressure to take elaborate cakes in to school for classmates is adding to the stress levels of parents . Family support service leaders Family Action surveyed 2,052 adults for the Birthdays on the Breadline report. Chief executive David Holmes said: 'Paying for children's parties is clearly causing financial stress for many families, even before the costs of birthday presents are taken into account. 'This stress is magnified for low income families who may find themselves spending the equivalent of a week's living costs for the whole family on a party for a single child. 'If you then add the extra financial pressures low income families in particular face from low wage rises and the squeeze on welfare, paying for children's parties is no cause for celebration. 'Money management programmes such as Money for Life help make parents more resilient to social and financial pressures by building their self-esteem and money skills.' The report is released in partnership with Lloyds Banking Group's Money for Life programme, which focuses on the importance money management. A spokesman added: 'This report shows money management is an increasingly vital life skill with families facing all sorts of unexpected financial pressures.'

chatgpt: A recent survey has revealed that almost half of British parents feel they are unable to afford to throw their child a birthday party. Despite this, a staggering 27% still go ahead with hosting a celebration, citing pressure from friends and family. The research, which was conducted by a leading high-street retailer, discovered that the average cost of a child's birthday party can be as much as £200. This includes everything from cakes and decorations, to entertainment and goodie bags. With many families struggling to make ends meet, it's no surprise that some are choosing to forego the expense entirely. Of those parents who admitted they couldn't afford a party, 42% stated that they felt guilty or ashamed about it. This suggests that there is still a stigma attached to not being able to provide for your child in the way that you might like. However, it's important to remember that the most important thing is the quality time spent with loved ones, rather than extravagant displays of wealth. Despite financial constraints, the survey also found that parents are willing to go to great lengths to ensure their child's birthday is special. On average, adults now start saving for the event over a month in advance. This allows them to budget effectively and avoid the stress of last-minute panic buying. When it comes to the day itself, parents are opting for cost-effective ways to celebrate. One popular choice is to host a party at home, rather than paying for an expensive venue. Many parents are also making use of free or low-cost activities, such as baking their own cake or organising a treasure hunt in the park. The pressure to throw a successful party can also come from the children themselves. According to the survey, almost a third of parents feel that their child's expectations are too high when it comes to birthday celebrations. This means they feel under pressure to meet certain standards, even if they can't afford to. In response to these findings, the retailer behind the survey has launched a range of affordable party supplies. This includes items such as balloons, tableware and decorations, which are all priced at £1 or less. The hope is that this will help to alleviate some of the financial stress associated with hosting a birthday party. In conclusion, it's clear that many British parents are struggling to afford the cost of their child's birthday party. However, this doesn't mean that they can't still celebrate in special and meaningful ways. With smart budgeting and a bit of creativity, it's possible to give children a memorable birthday without breaking the bank.
