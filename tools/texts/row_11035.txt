chatgpt: Caroline Wozniacki, the World No 9 in women's tennis, added another feather to her cap by running the New York Marathon on Sunday. The Danish tennis star completed this 26.2-mile race before heading to an awards ceremony with her friend and fellow tennis colleague, Serena Williams.  Wozniacki's participation in the marathon was for an excellent cause. She spearheaded a fundraising campaign for children's charity "Team for Kids." She has managed to raise over $81,000 for the charity, which will go towards providing opportunities for kids to participate in sports programs. Wozniacki gave it her all during the challenging marathon race, and she completed it in a phenomenal time of three hours, 25 minutes and 33 seconds. Despite being her first-ever marathon, Wozniacki put in an impressive performance, considering she's never run a distance like this before.  The Danish star looked elated as she crossed the finish line, and her long-time friend, Serena Williams, met her to congratulate her. Williams, who has played against Wozniacki multiple times and has formed a close bond over the years, hugged her friend and praised her achievement. Speaking to the press after the race, Wozniacki spoke about the inspiration behind her decision to run the marathon. She said, "I'm very lucky to be healthy and do what I love for a living. I want to give something back, especially to kids who don't have these opportunities that I've been blessed with. Running a marathon is one of the ways I can do that, and I'm delighted to have been able to raise this sum for 'Team for Kids." This marathon was yet another successful venture for Wozniacki, who has had an impressive career in tennis. She won 30 singles titles and spent a total of 71 weeks as the world number one, and she retired from the sport earlier in 2020. Since then, she's been focused on various other interests outside of tennis. Her participation in the New York Marathon will no doubt inspire her fans to push themselves to achieve their goals, both on and off the court. Wozniacki has proved that with dedication, determination, and hard work, nothing is impossible.  In conclusion, Caroline Wozniacki running the New York Marathon has been a fantastic achievement, and her decision to raise money for children's charity 'Team for Kids' is another example of her benevolence. The fact that she managed to complete the race in an impressive time shows that she's still got the drive and determination she was known for in tennis. Her friend and colleague's sweet embrace at the finish line adds to the story's genuine and heartfelt nature, showing once again that sports and charity can bring people together in the most touching ways.
