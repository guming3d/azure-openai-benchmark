article: Twitter users have complained the service has been resending their direct messages and notifications. Users of Tweetdeck and the firm's apps say when they log in, they are being shown all of their notifications from the last 24 hours. Some also say their private messages have been resent. Hundreds of users have taken to the social network to complain abut the 'groundhog day' issue . The firm has admitted to the problem, tweeting 'Some users may be receiving delayed or duplicate notifications.' 'We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix.' it said. The problem is affecting both direct messages and the notifications Twitter sends users if they are mentioned in a tweet. For some users of the app, the are bombarded with all of these mentions when they first log on. It is believed the problems may even have affected Twitter's staff. An official Twitter account for the company's chief financial officer unleashed a barrage of spam posts on Tuesday in what may have been a hack or a glitch. Anthony Noto's account @anthonynoto for a brief time fired off terse, slangy missives inviting people to click on a link that promised funny video or other reward, depending on the post. The posts were quickly removed by Twitter. 'His account was sending spam Tweets,' a Twitter spokesperson told AFP. 'We've locked the account down and deleted the Tweets.' There was no indication any of Noto's account information was accessed, according to the spokesperson. Rogue posts in Twitter accounts could be the work of hackers, but they could also be caused by bugs in third-party applications intended to work with the one-to-many messaging service, according to the San Francisco-based company. Noto has been vexed before by his Twitter account. Late last year he accidentally shot off a public tweet about an acquisition the company was considering.
