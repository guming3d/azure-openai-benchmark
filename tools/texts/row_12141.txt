Learning curve: Zoo keepers said that despite the recent scare, the one-year-old cub is 'perfectly fine' The National Zoo is one of only four zoos nationwide to have pandas, which are on loan from China. The zoo's first pair of pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, were a gift from China following President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to the country. The pair had five cubs while living at the zoo but none survived. The zoo's current adult pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, arrived in 2000. They welcomed a male cub named Tai Shan in 2005 but he was returned to China five years later for breeding.

Their second infant Bao Bao - whose name means 'precious' or 'treasure' - was born August 23, 2013. Panda keeper Nicole MacCorkle says Bao Bao has been a different baby from her brother, including a little more stand-offish with keepers.

Her favorite activities include sleeping, exploring and munching on treats such as sweet potato and bamboo.

chatgpt: It was a scary moment at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. yesterday afternoon when a one-year-old fell victim to a charged barrier. According to zookeepers, the child touched the barrier and was immediately jolted into the air. Fortunately, she was propelled to safety and suffered no injuries from the fall. The incident occurred in the late afternoon as visitors to the zoo were making their way out. The child, whose identity has not been released, was with her parents at the time of the incident. A video captured by a visitor shows the moment when the child is sent flying into the air, to the amazement of onlookers. The National Zoo's management has stated that the barrier was well-maintained and had been regularly tested to ensure its safety. Nonetheless, officials have launched an investigation to determine what caused the barrier to become charged. While the incident may have been frightening for the child and her parents, zookeepers have reassured the public that the girl is "perfectly fine" and showing no signs of harm. "These animals are powerful, and their enclosures are designed to keep them in and people out," said Chief Veterinarian, Dr. Nancy B. Thompson. "However, we have taken this incident seriously and will take steps to further improve our safety protocols." Many visitors to the zoo have expressed concern about the incident, particularly in light of recent events at other zoos where similar issues have arisen. In 2016, a child fell into a gorilla exhibit at the Cincinnati Zoo leading to the death of Harambe, the zoo's resident gorilla. The National Zoo has been quick to assure the public that the incident has not compromised the safety of any of its animals, nor that of its visitors. The zoo, one of the most popular attractions in the nation's capital, has reassured the public that the safety of all visitors to the zoo remains its top priority. In the end, this harrowing experience serves as a warning that even places designed for fun and leisure can be dangerous. Nonetheless, the National Zoo team continues to work hard to ensure that its visitors are as safe as possible while enjoying their time at the zoo.
