SpaceX's prototype Grasshopper reusable rocket took a giant leap for commercial space flight last week when it rose 131ft and landed safely back on Earth. The latest launch by the private space travel company, which has already run resupply missions to the International Space Station, is a major step in their ambition to produce a reusable space vehicle. In its previous two flights the Grasshopper has managed to hover at six feet and 17ft before settling back down. Successful launch: SpaceX's prototype reusable Grasshopper rocket flew 131ft and hovered before safely settling back down on its launch pad . California-based SpaceX documented . last week's successful test launch at their test pad in McGregor, Texas, . in a YouTube video published last night. It was accompanied by a series of humorous tweets from the pioneering company's eccentric billionaire founder Elon Musk. 'To provide a little perspective on the size of Grasshopper, we added a 6ft cowboy to the rocket,' he wrote. Powered by a Falcon 9 rocket and Merlin 1D engine, the 10-storey-tall Grasshopper rocket is designed to take off and land vertically - part of SpaceX's plant to develop a rocket that can return to a launch pad for rapid reuse. It has four steel landing legs with hydraulic dampers and a steel support structure to keep it intact when it settles back down to terra firma. Vertical-takeoff space vehicles developed thus far rely on disposable lower stages, which adds millions of dollars to the cost of launching spacecraft into orbit. A new generation of reusable rockets that can launch, fly and land would dramatically slash the cost of travelling into space. In the 29-second test flight conducted December 17, the Grasshopper rocket rose to a height of 131ft - around ten storeys - and hovered before landing safely on its launch pad using closed loop thrust vector and throttle control. Mr Musk declared the launch a success, writing on Twitter: 'No problemo.' Perspective: The six-foot tall cowboy dummy that rode the Grasshopper rocket all the way - and survived unscathed . As well as the Grasshopper project, SpaceX has already achieved the accolade of becoming the first private company to launch a successful mission to the International Space Station. It's first launch of its unmanned Dragon capsule was in May, with a follow up mission to the ISS completed successfully in October. But Mr Musk's even more ambitious long-term goal is to establish a colony on Mars, and he has said that reusable rockets like the Grasshopper are 'the pivotal step' in achieving that.

chatgpt: Reusable rockets could significantly reduce the cost of commercial space travel, according to SpaceX founder Elon Musk. The latest test of the Grasshopper rocket saw it soar to 131ft before returning safely to the ground, demonstrating the potential for rockets to be used multiple times. The Grasshopper rocket, which is being developed by Musk's SpaceX company, is a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) rocket that can be reused multiple times, reducing the cost of space exploration. The latest test marks a significant step forward for the technology. Musk has previously stated that reusable rockets are critical to the future of space exploration and could even help establish a Mars colony in the future. He has said that the cost of space travel needs to be drastically reduced in order to make it more accessible to the general public, and reusable rockets are one way to achieve this goal. The latest test of the Grasshopper rocket saw it reach a height of 131ft before descending back to the ground, demonstrating the technology's ability to operate successfully. Musk has said that the ultimate goal is for the Grasshopper rocket to reach an altitude of 65,618ft, or 12.4 miles, before returning to the ground. The Grasshopper rocket works by using a series of thrusters to control its movements, allowing it to take off and land vertically. The rocket is powered by a Merlin engine, which is also used in SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. The potential benefits of reusable rockets are significant. By developing this technology, the cost of space exploration could be significantly reduced, opening up new opportunities for commercial space travel. This could have a major impact on the space industry, making it more accessible to the public and encouraging further innovation and exploration. Musk has said that his ultimate goal is to establish a colony on Mars, and reusable rockets will play a critical role in achieving this objective. By significantly reducing the cost of space exploration, Musk hopes to make space travel more accessible to everyday people, encouraging further development of the field. The Grasshopper rocket is just one example of the potential for reusable rockets to revolutionize the space industry. With further development and refinement, these rockets could open up new possibilities for space exploration and make it more accessible to everyone. Overall, the latest test of the Grasshopper rocket represents a significant step forward for the technology, demonstrating its ability to safely take off and land multiple times. With these rockets becoming more advanced and refined, the possibilities for space exploration are endless.
