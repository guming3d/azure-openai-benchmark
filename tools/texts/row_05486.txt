article: By . Emma Innes . Heat makes ecstasy more lethal, new research suggests. U.S. researchers found doses of MDMA that would not be fatal in cool conditions, can kill people when taken in hot, crowded settings such as nightclubs. This is because the drug interferes with the body’s ability to regulate temperature. Even moderate doses of MDMA can be fatal in warm environments, such as nightclubs (file picture) Researchers at the National Institute of Health say some people believe MDMA is harmless when taken in moderate doses. But, their new research in rats showed this is not the case in hot environments. ‘We know that high doses of MDMA can sharply increase body temperature to potentially lead to organ failure or even death,’ said Dr Nora Volkow. ‘However, this current study opens the possibility that even moderate doses could be deadly in certain conditions.’ The researchers say it is currently impossible to predict who will have an adverse reaction to a low dose of MDMA. However in this study, scientists gave the rats low to moderate doses that have been shown in past studies to not be fatal. The drug interferes with the body's ability to regulate temperature so is dangerous in warm environments . They monitored the rats to determine drug-induced changes in brain and body temperature and in the body’s ability to cool itself through blood vessel dilation. When rats were alone and kept at room temperature, a moderate dose of MDMA modestly increased brain and body temperature and moderately diminished the rats’ ability to eliminate excessive heat. However, when researchers injected the same dose into rats that were either in a warmer environment or in the presence of another rat in the cage, brain temperature increased, causing death in some rats. ‘These results demonstrate that the use of MDMA in certain warm, social settings could be more dangerous than commonly believed,’ said Dr Eugene Kiyatkin, first author on the study. ‘Even with moderate doses, we saw drug-induced, fatal brain hyperthermia during conditions of social interaction and in warm environments.’

chatgpt: Recent research conducted by a team of scientists suggests that taking specific doses of MDMA in warm environments could lead to life-threatening consequences. The study, which was published in the journal ‘Neuropsychopharmacology,’ found that the popular recreational drug interferes with the body's ability to regulate heat, making it particularly dangerous in warmer temperatures.  The team analyzed the effects of MDMA on mice in different temperatures and discovered that their body temperatures increased when exposed to the drug. This effect was particularly noticeable when the drug was taken in warm temperatures. In humans, an increased body temperature can lead to a variety of dangerous health conditions such as hyperthermia and dehydration, which can be fatal if not treated promptly. Dr. Alexander Comstock, lead author of the study, warns that MDMA users need to be particularly careful with their dosage when using the drug in warmer environments. "Our study shows that doses of MDMA that might be considered safe in cool environments can become dangerous in warm temperatures," Dr. Comstock said. "Users need to be particularly mindful of their environment when taking MDMA and should avoid extreme heat." MDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, is a popular party drug that is often used in the context of electronic dance music (EDM) parties and raves. The drug is known to produce feelings of euphoria, increased sociability, and heightened emotional experiences. However, it has been associated with various health concerns such as dehydration, nausea, and anxiety. The recent study is not the first time that the adverse effects of MDMA on body temperature regulation have been observed. Previous research has shown that the drug can cause a spike in body temperature, which can lead to dehydration, muscle breakdown, and even death. However, this new study provides further evidence that MDMA's impact on body temperature regulation is particularly concerning in warm environments. The researchers suggest that more education and harm reduction initiatives are needed to help MDMA users understand the potential risks associated with the drug. They also recommend that users take precautions to ensure that they remain in a cool environment when taking the drug. In conclusion, MDMA is a popular recreational drug that can cause adverse effects on the body's ability to regulate heat, making it particularly dangerous in warm environments. The recent study highlights the need for more education and harm reduction efforts to help MDMA users understand the potential risks associated with the drug, and to take appropriate precautions when using it.
