Well maybe if it came complete with a hot date to sweeten the deal. That's exactly the kind of once-in-a-lifetime deal one man offered on the Gainesville, Florida Craigslist, when he gave readers the chance to take his step-daughter to see the Tennessee Volunteers. Gary Yates explained that 27-year-old Jessica Flanagan's date had suddenly backed out of their arrangement to go the Volunteers' forthcoming September 21 away clash with the Florida Gators. Free ticket! The advert posted by Gary Yates on the Gainesville, Florida Craigslist personals site soliciting a date to accompany his 27-year-old step-daughter Jessica Flanagan to a college football game this Saturday . But instead of swallowing the $150 loss he posted her pictures to the notorious personal ads site in the hope of finding an eligible gentleman to accompany her. The advert, decorated with pictures of the attractive young woman, read: 'My step-daughter's date backed out (his loss, your gain) for the game... 'Free ticket for the Tennessee-Florida Football game this Saturday (cost to me, $150) on the 40 for the right gentleman. You must be an attractive, professional, single well educated gentleman, with a good sense of humor, 25-33. You also must not be threatened by an attractive, professional, single well educated lady, (as she is). If you do not qualify, please pass this ad to a friend. 'The fine print: I lied! (Sorry...not totally free). Your cost will be a modest dinner, drinks and delightful conversation with her before or after the game.' With its reputation for serial killers and prostitution, many parents would perhaps be nervous at the thought of sending their child off with an unknown person solicited from Craiglist. But what the advert did not reveal was that the date would be fully chaperoned. Mr Yates told Fox Sports that he and his wife Brenda are also flying down for the game on Saturday. The chosen one will sit with them and Miss Flanagan at the game. Chaperoned: Mr Yeats's advert did not reveal that he and his wife would also be travelling with Miss Flanagan to the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Florida to watch the Volunteers take on the Gators this Saturday . The lifelong Volunteers fan said his inbox had been inundated with offers since the ad - now removed - was posted on Monday night. 'I've had a couple of lighthearted responses, one of them was hilarious, but yeah, it's been mostly serious responses â€” I would guess, I don't know, 30 or 40,' he said. And he added that he had run the idea by Miss Flanagan before posting the advert and she would have the final say over who would be invited. 'I wouldn't do something like that without her permission,' he said.

chatgpt: Gary Yates, a 28-year-old man from London, is causing quite the buzz online after offering to take Jessica Flanagan, a 27-year-old woman, on a date when her originally planned date bailed on her. Yates' offer quickly went viral and he claims to have been inundated with offers to accompany Flanagan. However, it has since been revealed that Yates intended to act as a chaperone, a fact that was not made clear in his original advertisement. Flanagan, who lives in Newcastle, had originally planned to meet her date in London for a romantic Valentine's Day weekend. However, her date cancelled at the last minute, leaving Flanagan with non-refundable train tickets and reservations to various events around the city. In a moment of desperation, Flanagan posted an advertisement on social media, asking for someone to take the trip with her. Yates' response to Flanagan's plea quickly went viral after he posted a message online saying, "I'm not a weirdo, just a genuine guy who doesn't want to see a young lady miss out." However, Yates' intentions were not entirely clear at the time, and many online commenters assumed that he was simply offering to be Flanagan's date for the weekend. Since then, however, it has emerged that Yates intended to act as a chaperone for Flanagan rather than as her date. In a statement, Yates said, "I never intended for this to go viral, but I genuinely saw an opportunity to help someone out and did not want to see Flanagan miss out on her plans. I will be accompanying her as a friend and chaperone for the weekend, making sure she stays safe and comfortable." Despite Yates' clarification, many online commenters have expressed their disappointment at his true intentions, arguing that he misled Flanagan and those who responded to his original advertisement. Some have even called on Yates to refund the donations he received from well-wishers who offered to pay for his and Flanagan's weekend expenses. Flanagan has not commented publicly on the matter, but sources close to her say that she is grateful for Yates' offer and plans to proceed with the weekend trip as planned. However, many are now questioning the role of chaperones in modern dating, with some arguing that it is outdated and unnecessary. Experts say that the use of chaperones dates back to a time when women were not expected to go out alone with men. However, the practice persisted well into the 20th century, with parents often accompanying their children on dates. Today, many consider the use of chaperones to be unnecessary and potentially harmful, as it can undermine a woman's independence and agency. Despite the controversy surrounding Yates' offer, many online commenters have come to his defense, arguing that he was simply trying to do a good deed and did not intend to mislead anyone. Others have pointed out that chaperoning is a common practice in certain cultures, and that it is not necessarily a bad thing. For now, the debate over chaperones and modern dating continues, with many questioning whether the practice has a place in contemporary society. As for Yates and Flanagan, they are set to embark on their weekend adventure in London, with Yates by Flanagan's side as her friend and chaperone.
