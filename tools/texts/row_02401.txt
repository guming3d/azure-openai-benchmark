All that is missing is a grizzly bear trying to catch these flying salmon, but this is not the wilds of Canada or North America, it is the River Tyne. The annual spectacle of salmon battling upstream has been captured in these stunning photographs. Every year thousands of salmon battle upstream as they return home to spawn, and together with sea trout, the fish are currently negotiating the dangerous journey. An amazing natural spectacle is played out along the River Tyne, Northumberland where thousands of salmon have migrated from as far afield as Greenland and Norway to return to their spawning grounds .

Phil Rippon, fisheries technical specialist for the Environment Agency, said: 'They are returning to spawn. They will be spawning in the upper reaches of the North and South Tyne, probably in December or January. 'Obviously on their way up stream they are prone to get caught by fishermen. The impressive fish are known to return to the place where they spawned to lay their eggs . The amazing feat of nature will continue until the fish spawn in December or January .

'We are talking in excess of 30,000 salmon and sea trout migrating up the Tyne ever year. They are inclined to migrate when extra fresh water flows - after rain. 'We had a lot of rain a few days ago. This is the best time, the peak time.' The area has come a long way since the 1950s, when Mr Rippon says that the river was so heavily polluted that it had virtually no salmon at all. He added: 'The Tyne is the best salmon river in England and Wales in terms of the number of salmon caught by fishermen. It has come back from almost nothing to being the best.'

chatgpt: Massive migrations of Atlantic salmon and sea trout are currently taking place in the River Tyne, Northumberland. This marks a huge change since the 1950s when pollution caused a decline in the fish population, leading to virtually no salmon living in the river.  However, in recent years, thanks to protection and the efforts made to clean up the river, the fish have returned in large numbers. According to the Environment Agency, around 30,000 fish have descended upon the River Tyne this year alone, resulting in a massive surge of excitement for the fishermen in the area. For many years, the River Tyne was subject to heavy industrialization, pollution, and overfishing. It wasn't until new regulations were implemented by governmental agencies, like the Environment Agency, that the quality of the water began to improve, and the fish returned. The River Tyne now boasts one of the highest salmon populations in England, attracting millions of tourists every year. This year's salmon and sea trout migration has been remarkable. As the fish travel up the River Tyne, local fishermen can be seen lining the riverbanks, eagerly anticipating the arrival of the fish. Many of these fishermen have been fishing for salmon for generations and always remember that salmon fishing was once a distant memory. It's a joyous moment for fishermen who spend months waiting for the migration to occur. They set their nets and fishing lines with bated breath, waiting to catch the perfect fish. Their efforts pay off as they reel in dozens of fish every day, with some weighing over 15 pounds. “The river is really packed this year, and it's great to see so many fish," says Tom Brown, a local fisherman. “I had to wait until midnight last night to catch a big one, and it was worth it! It's a great time to be a fisherman on the River Tyne." The significance of this change in the river's ecosystem cannot be overstated. Salmon and sea trout play an essential role in the local ecosystem, providing a source of food for predators like otters and seals. This bountiful food supply has helped these animals thrive in the region again. According to the Environment Agency, the abundance of fish also provides vital commercial benefits to the local economy. The salmon industry has a value of around £100 million, and many businesses rely on it for their livelihoods. The increase in salmon in the River Tyne has brought new life to Northumberland and provided a welcome boost to the local economy. As the salmon and sea trout migration continues, the excitement among fishermen in the area has reached new heights. They eagerly anticipate the next big catch, and are grateful for the change that has taken place in the River Tyne.
