article: (CNN) -- Liverpool's dramatic week ended in disappointment as Everton claimed a 2-0 victory in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Sunday to leave their rivals second from bottom of the Premier League table. Roy Hodgson's Liverpool side came into the match on the back of a tumultuous last seven days which saw the club finally sold to the owners of the Boston Red Sox baseball team. And all the disruption off the pitch continues to transmit into poor results on the pitch, as goals either side of half-time from Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta gave Everton a deserved win. Both teams came into the match struggling near the foot of the table, with Everton 17th and Liverpool 18th in the 20-team division. However, the home side dominated throughout and took a deserved lead when Tim Cahill thundered home a shot after good work on the right from Seamus Coleman. And the points were secured five minutes after the interval when Spanish midfielder Arteta was given too much space on the edge of the area to fire home through a crowd of players. The result lifts Everton up to 11th place but only goal difference now separates Liverpool from lying bottom of the table, their lowest-ever Premier League position. Meanwhile, Manchester City are up to second place in the table after a hard-fought 3-2 win at newly-promoted Blackpool. After a goalless first half, City took the lead whan captain Carlos Tevez flicked home a cross from substitute David Silva. Blackpool levelled when Marlon Harewood glanced home a Charlie Adam free-kick, but City immediately went down the other end and Tevez fired home a deflected shot to restore the visitors' lead. Silva then scored a delightful third goal, skipping past a couple of challenges before curling home a superb strike, before the home side pulled one back in injury time through Gary Taylor-Fletcher to set up a nervy final two minutes. Chelsea continue to lead the table with 19 points from their eight games, but big-spending City are now just two points behind the defending champions on 17 points. Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham are all level in third place on 14 points, with the Gunners ahead on goal difference.

chatgpt: Everton secured a well-earned 2-0 win over their local rivals Liverpool in a thrilling Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. The Toffees' victory was highlighted by goals from Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta, with both players finding the back of the net in the second half. The first half saw Everton start brightly as they piled on the pressure on Liverpool's defence, but were unable to find the breakthrough. The Reds had their own chances to take the lead, with Sadio Mane going close, but the half ended scoreless. The second half, however, saw a rejuvenated Everton side take the lead in the 68th minute as Cahill headed in a James Rodriguez corner with precision, giving Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker no chance. Liverpool tried to respond, but it was Everton who scored again five minutes later. Arteta, who came off the bench in the second half, scored with a coolly taken penalty after a handball from foul-kicking Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold, putting the game beyond the reach of the Reds. The win for Everton keeps them in contention for a top-four finish, while Liverpool find themselves in a precarious position in the Premier League table. Jurgen Klopp's side has slipped to second bottom of the standings, with only Fulham below them. Meanwhile, Manchester City moved up into second place, after a comprehensive 3-1 win over Blackpool. Goals from Riyad Mahrez, Ilkay Gundogan and Ferran Torres secured the three points for Pep Guardiola's side. The result sees Manchester City leapfrog their cross-town rivals Manchester United, who have slipped down to third place after their defeat to Leicester City on Tuesday. Manchester City now trail league leaders Leicester by just a point. In conclusion, Everton's victory over Liverpool in the Merseyside derby has shifted the balance of power in the English Premier League. While the Toffees have their sights set on a top-four finish, Liverpool will be looking to turn things around in the coming weeks if they are to avoid a relegation battle this season.
