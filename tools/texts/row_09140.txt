If you like to drive fast you may want to avoid a village in Ohio where more than 6,000 drivers are caught speeding each month. Nearly $1.5 million worth of fines have been issued to motorists since two traffic cameras were installed in Elmwood Place, near Cincinnati, last September. But a judge ruled yesterday that the devices, which issue 6,600 fines a month - at $105 each - violated drivers' constitutional rights. Complaints: Two speed cameras installed in Elmwood Place, Ohio, (pictured) have been issuing fines at a rate of 6,600 a month, or three times the number of people who live in the village . Ruling: Judge Robert Ruehlman has ruled that the fines violate the constitutional rights of drivers who he said are unable to effectively appeal against them . Village officials first approved the speed cameras last July. The firm controlling the cameras gets 40 per cent of the revenue, while the rest goes to the village. But opponents of the cameras - which issue 'civil penalties' and do not add points to driver's licences - said they were just a money making scheme, and launched a legal challenge against them. And their campaign appears to have paid off, after a judge ruled yesterday that the devices 'violate drivers' rights under the state constitution.' Hamilton County Judge Robert Ruehlman's . said the cameras violated 'due . process guarantees' under the Ohio Constitution, Fox News reports. Victory: Attorney Mike Allen - who represented opponents in their legal fight against the fines - said the ruling is the first of its kind in the US . He said hearings held for drivers to contest the fines, are 'nothing more than a sham' as they would effectively be arguing against a written report 'produced by the company that owns the speed monitoring unit.' Attorney Mike Allen, . whose firm brought the case, said this is the first time such a ruling has been made on speed cameras in the US. Up to 18,000 vehicles a . day pass through the village, police said. The cameras' supporters claimed they are effective helping cut speeding in the area. Local police chief William Peskin said last year that the cameras have been installed in the interests of public safety. A spokesman for Optotraffic, the firm which owns and operates the speed cameras, told ABC News in January that the devices are an 'efficient and accurate way to control speed.'

chatgpt: A recent ruling by a judge in the US may change the way speed cameras are used by authorities. According to the ruling, the cameras violate drivers' rights under the state constitution. This is thought to be the first ruling of its kind in the US. The ruling comes after opponents of the cameras launched a legal battle, claiming that they are nothing but a money-making scheme. Since the cameras were installed, nearly $1.5 million worth of fines has been handed out to drivers. Critics have long opposed the use of speed cameras, arguing that they are not effective at reducing accidents and instead only serve as a way for governments to generate revenue. Supporters, on the other hand, argue that the cameras are an effective tool for improving road safety. However, with the recent ruling, it seems that the use of speed cameras may now be in jeopardy. Those who oppose the cameras are hailing the ruling as a victory for driver's rights. The ruling is likely to have far-reaching implications, not just in the state where the ruling was made, but across the entire country. It could set a precedent for other states where speed cameras are currently in use. Opponents of the cameras have been quick to point out that the ruling does not mean that all speed cameras will be removed. However, they are hopeful that it will lead to a wider debate about the use of these devices. There is no doubt that the ruling will be closely watched by both supporters and opponents of speed cameras. It is likely to spark a heated debate about road safety and the role that speed cameras play in improving it. While the ruling is a setback for those who support the use of speed cameras, it is important to remember that road safety should always be the top priority. It remains to be seen what impact the ruling will have on road safety and whether other measures will be put in place to compensate for any potential decrease in the use of speed cameras. For now, the ruling marks a significant victory for opponents of speed cameras and a blow for those who believe that they are an effective tool for improving road safety. The debate about the use of these devices is likely to continue for some time to come.
