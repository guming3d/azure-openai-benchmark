article: By . Mark Prigg . Scientists have uncovered a mysterious structure that surround the earth rather like a giant zebraprint jacket. The strange structure has never been seen before, and initially baffled scientists. Stripes extend through the inner radiation belt, moving as the Earth rotates. Scroll down for video . The stripes that surround Earth: Two giant belts of radiation surround Earth. The inner belt is dominated by electrons and the outer one by protons. The radiation belts are dynamic doughnut-shaped regions around our planet, extending high above the atmosphere, made up of high-energy particles, both electrons and charged particles called ions, which are trapped by Earth's magnetic field. Radiation levels across the belts are affected by solar activity that causes energy and particles to flow into near-Earth space. Scientists discovered the new, persistent structure in one of two radiation belts surrounding Earth. NASA's twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft spotted the pattern, which that resembles slanted zebra stripes. The structure is produced by the slow rotation of Earth, previously considered incapable of affecting the motion of radiation belt particles, which have velocities approaching the speed of light. Scientists had previously believed that increased solar wind activity was the primary force behind any structures in our planet's radiation belts. However, these zebra stripes were shown to be visible even during low solar wind activity, which prompted a new search for how they were generated. 'It is because of the unprecedented resolution of our energetic particle experiment, RBSPICE, that we now understand that the inner belt electrons are, in fact, always organized in zebra patterns,' said Aleksandr Ukhorskiy, lead author of the paper at The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, or APL, in Laurel. Because of the tilt in Earth's magnetic field axis, the planet's rotation generates an oscillating, weak electric field that permeates through the entire inner radiation belt. The stretching and folding process results in the striped pattern observed across the entire inner belt, extending from above Earth's atmosphere, about 500 miles above the planet's surface up to roughly 8,000 miles. 'The RBSPICE instrument has remarkably fine resolution and so it was able to bring into focus a phenomena that we previously didn't even know existed,' said David Sibeck, the mission scientist for the Van Allen Probes at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. 'Better yet, we have a great team of scientists to take advantage of these unprecedented observations: We couldn't have interpreted this data without analysis from strong theoreticians.'

chatgpt: Scientists studying the inner radiation belt of the Earth have discovered a fascinating pattern created by the movement of electrons. The pattern, which is being referred to as a giant zebra pattern, is caused by the rotation of the Earth. The inner radiation belt is a part of the Earth's magnetosphere, which traps charged particles from the solar wind and cosmic rays in a doughnut-shaped region around the Earth. This region contains high-energy electrons, protons and ions that can potentially damage spacecraft and satellites. Researchers at the University of Alberta in Canada have been studying the inner radiation belt using data from the Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) mission. They noticed that the electrons in the belt were arranged in a unique pattern of parallel stripes, similar to a zebra's stripes. The researchers believe that the stripes are created by the rotation of the Earth. As the Earth rotates, it creates an electric field that causes the electrons to move in a specific direction. The stripes are formed when the electrons move in this direction, bunching up in certain areas and leaving other areas empty. The zebra pattern is not usually visible, as it is hidden by other electromagnetic waves in the radiation belt. However, the RBSP mission was able to detect the pattern using a special instrument called the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS) instrument. The discovery of the zebra pattern is important, as it could help scientists understand more about the inner radiation belt and how it interacts with other parts of the Earth's magnetosphere. It also has implications for satellite communication and space exploration. Satellites and spacecraft that pass through the inner radiation belt can be damaged by the high-energy particles contained within it. Understanding the zebra pattern could help scientists predict where the electrons are most likely to be concentrated, allowing satellites to avoid these areas and reducing the risk of damage. The zebra pattern could also help scientists understand more about the dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere. By studying the movement of the electrons, researchers can learn more about the electric fields and currents that flow through this region of space. In conclusion, the discovery of the giant zebra pattern in the inner radiation belt is a significant step forward in our understanding of the Earth's magnetosphere. The pattern, created by the rotation of the Earth, has implications for both satellite communication and space exploration. By studying the zebra pattern, researchers may be able to develop better ways to protect satellites from damage and learn more about the dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere.
