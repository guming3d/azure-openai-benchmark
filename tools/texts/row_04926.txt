He then walked over to the counter and handed the female teller a note demanding all of the money in her cash drawer.

In the first robbery, the man targeted the Wells Fargo bank onÂ Girard Avenue in La Jolla, California, pictured, where he demanded money from the teller but continued to chat her up while robbing the branch . He carried on talking to them while he was given the cash and then exited the store before making his getaway on a small green BMX bicycle. No injuries have been reported at either of the robberies and no weapon has been displayed. The FBI are now chasing down the man and are offering a $1,000 cash reward.
