Kevin Bate received a 'positive reply' from One Stop after he asked the company if they could take him on as a security adviser . A convicted shop raider who was jailed after carrying out more than 20 burglaries and thefts in a year-long crime spree is heading for a new career as a security consultant for a company he targeted. Kevin Bate, from Sunderland, and his gang were responsible for stealing cash, cigarettes and tobacco from One Stop shops and other small stores across the country after causing distractions and knocking out the CCTV. Following his arrest, the 43-year-old wrote to bosses at One Stop to apologise and asked if he could be employed by them to help improve security. Teesside Crown Court yesterday heard how the company was considering recruiting the career criminal as a security adviser. However, Bate must first serve a four year jail sentence after admitting conspiracy to steal. His barrister Stephen Rich told the court how Bate wrote to the company, while he was on remand, offering his services, the Northern Echo has reported. He said: 'Astonishingly enough, he has received a reply which is positive. Unfortunately, he is going to be unavailable for consultation for some considerable time.' Six of the company's stores were hit by the gang across the country during the £30,000 spree which included One Stop shops, Co-ops, Spar stores and a number of small independent traders in areas including Northumberland, Norfolk, Cumbria and Cornwall. Bate and fellow team member Andrew Pickering, 38, from Stanley, County Durham, were jailed for four years. John Ramsay, 33, received 33 months, and John Wallis, 39, and John Carney, 42, also all from Sunderland, got five-and-a-half years. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told them: 'If you take part in a professional conspiracy, you should expect this sort of sentence. That's part of the risk you take.' The men, who all admitted conspiracy to steal, were caught in September last year after an investigation by nine police forces. Shops in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, Scarborough and Wallsend and Whitley Bay in North Tyneside were among those targeted. Teesside Crown Court yesterday heard how the company was considering recruiting the career criminal as a security adviser .

chatgpt: After being responsible for numerous raids across the country, Kevin Bate, along with his gang, is now in police custody awaiting trial. However, while on remand, Bate has made an unusual request to the company that he previously targeted – One Stop. Bate reportedly wrote an apology letter to the company, expressing remorse for his past actions and asking for their forgiveness. What's more surprising is that he also included a proposal in the letter, offering to assist the company in improving its security measures, and even pitching his services as a potential security adviser. It appears that One Stop has taken his proposal seriously, as the court heard during Bate's trial that they are currently considering taking him on. During the hearing, Bate's legal team argued that his offer to help One Stop improve their security is proof that he is genuinely remorseful for his past behavior and is actively trying to make amends. The lawyer presented the letter to the court as evidence of Bate's good intentions, and claimed that his client is willing to do anything to prove that he is a changed man. Bate has already admitted to being involved in over 20 raids across the country, and the police have linked him to several other similar cases. His offer to help One Stop has raised eyebrows, with many questioning whether it's a smart move for a company to consider employing a person with such a criminal background. However, One Stop has defended their decision, stating that they are open to the idea of hiring someone with Bate's expertise in criminal activity to help them improve their security measures. They have also assured the public that they have stringent background checks and vetting processes in place to ensure that they hire only the most qualified candidates. Bate's case has sparked a debate on whether individuals with a criminal past should be allowed to turn their lives around and contribute positively to society. Some argue that it's a slippery slope to start hiring convicted criminals, while others believe that everyone deserves a second chance. Only time will tell if One Stop decides to hire Bate as a security adviser. In the meantime, his case serves as a reminder that even those who have committed crimes in the past should be given the opportunity to make amends and turn their lives around.
