chatgpt: Residents in Swansea, South Wales were left startled on Saturday afternoon after an unusual and enormous visitor went missing. A five-foot lizard had disappeared from a garden in the area, leaving its owners and members of the public concerned for its welfare.  Though not deemed dangerous, the lizard is still large enough to alarm anyone who might accidentally stumble upon it. As a result, the police have issued a picture of the animal and have urged anyone who might spot it to contact them immediately. The disappearance of the lizard has caused a stir in the local community, with many people expressing their shock at the animal's size. The owners of the animal are also understandably concerned for its safety and well-being. They are urging anyone who might have seen the lizard to come forward and help locate it. The missing lizard is believed to be a monitor lizard, which is native to Asia and can grow up to three meters in length. These lizards are known for their speed and agility, and can be difficult to catch if they are on the move.  Despite the potential danger of such a large animal roaming around a residential area, the lizard is not considered to be a threat to humans. Monitor lizards are primarily carnivorous and feed on insects, rodents, and small mammals. They are also relatively docile and will only attack if they feel threatened. Police and officials are currently undertaking a search operation to locate the missing lizard. They are asking residents in the area to remain vigilant and to report any sightings of the animal immediately. Overall, it remains unclear how the lizard managed to escape from the garden, though officials suspect that it may have crawled through a gap in the fence. For now, locals are being urged to stay alert and to keep an eye out for any signs of the missing lizard.
