article: Jailed: David Messom, 29, was convicted of fraud and handed a two-year jail term . An aggressive conman was branded 'the lowest of the low' by a judge after tricking pensioners into thinking their mobility scooters and stair lifts needed servicing. David Messom, 29, pocketed more than £400 in August last year by duping vulnerable and fragile old people into paying for pretend repair works. The crook, already in prison for fraud, was handed a two year concurrent jail sentence yesterday after admitting two counts of fraud at Derby Crown Court. Judge Stuart Rafferty QC said: 'These offences are the most despicable kind. 'You have previous similar offences and others of using aggressive sales techniques. 'People who prey on the elderly are the lowest of the low. 'You have had more justice than you deserve. 'If you come back before a court you will be waving goodbye to a very large part of the next chapter of your life. 'If you come before me with an offence like that, the starting point will be four years.' Sarah Slater, prosecuting, told the court an 81-year-old woman received a phone call saying her mobility scooter needed a service. She said: 'She queried it because she said she had just had her mobility scooter serviced. She was told the law had changed and they now required two services a year.' The pensioner, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, was quoted a figure of £120 and replied: 'I'm 81, I can't afford it.' But after Messom offered her a price of £80, the elderly woman alerted the authorities because she thought it was a scam. In the second offence, an 84-year-old woman received a phone call from a female saying her stair lift needed a service. Messom turned up at the woman's home saying he was going to carry out the service. Slammed: Judge Stuart Rafferty QC told Messom: 'People who prey on the elderly are the lowest of the low' at Derby Crown Court (above) He gave her a bill and suggested she should add an extra £300 as a guarantee which would provide free breakdown repairs. A cheque for £410 was found in Messom's pocket when he was arrested. Emma Coverley, defending, said Messom was already serving a prison sentence of two years and nine months. He is likely to be released in June next year but the latest sentence will extend this for a few months.

chatgpt: David Messom, a 29-year-old crook, has been sentenced to two and a half years in jail for pocketing hundreds of pounds by conning elderly victims in their 80s. His sentence comes on top of a previous fraud charge for a similar crime. The victims were misled into thinking that their bank accounts had been compromised, and were instructed to transfer funds into designated bank accounts. However, these accounts were controlled by Messom, and he siphoned off the money for his own gain. The court heard how Messom had already been jailed for six months in 2018 for a similar offence against elderly victims. In sentencing Messom, Judge Charles Byers was highly critical of the defendant, telling him that he had "had more justice than he deserved." The judge elaborated: "I have seen the pain and confusion in the faces of these elderly victims as they struggle with the consequences of your actions. They should not have to suffer this way, and it is entirely your fault." The case has raised concerns about the vulnerability of elderly citizens to financial scams. The National Crime Agency recently reported that fraud targeting the elderly costs the UK economy an estimated £10bn each year. Many organisations have called for greater protection for elderly people from such scams. Age UK, a charity that supports the needs of the elderly, has called for tougher penalties for those who commit such crimes. They have also called for elderly people to be given better education about how to protect themselves from scams. Responding to the case, a spokesperson for the charity said: "It is crucial that all of us, including banks and businesses, work harder to protect the elderly from financial scams. We also need to educate the elderly about the risks and signs of scams, and ensure they feel confident to seek advice and help if they need it." The case has also raised questions about the effectiveness of the justice system in dealing with financial fraud. According to analysts, the conviction rate for fraud crimes is relatively low in the UK, with cybercrime and online fraud representing some of the biggest challenges for law enforcement agencies. Despite these challenges, prosecutors have reiterated their commitment to cracking down on financial fraud. Following the verdict, a spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said: "We are determined to bring those who engage in financial fraud to justice, and will work hard to bring cases like this to trial."
