article: Oscar Garcia's reign as Watford head coach has come to an abrupt end following health concerns, with the club confirming Billy McKinlay has taken over. The former Fulham assistant, 45, has stepped in as Garcia stepped down after a sustained period of time in hospital over the past fortnight. The Spaniard was released from hospital last Sunday after undergoing tests on his heart and was at Watford's game against Blackburn on Saturday, albeit watching from the directors' box. Billy McKinlay has been appointed as Watford's head coach and was a former Fulham assistant . Oscar Garcia was undergoing tests on his heart and wasn't able to continue as manager . McKinlay was brought in as first team coach last week and the latest developments mark a sad end for Garcia after such promise when he arrived in August. 'I was closely involved with the appointment of Billy McKinlay, because I was aware that I may not be able to return,' Garcia said. 'I always wanted an experienced British coach within our set-up, because it's important to have that mix of cultures and experience with this squad. 'I would like to thank Watford's fans for their kindness during my time here at the club. I will be hoping to see you all as a Premier League club next season.' Hornets' CEO Scott Duxbury added: 'Everyone feels it is important that there is continuity in the coaching structure. Ruben Martinez and Javier Pereira will therefore continue as Billy McKinlay's assistants. 'We appreciate Oscar's candour in placing the best interest of Watford FC ahead of his own personal thoughts and we wish him well for his future in football. The ex-Watford boss joined a month ago as a replacement for Beppe Sannino . 'In Billy McKinlay, we have someone with the qualities and significant experience to build further on the foundations already laid for a successful season ahead.' Garcia, who only took over at Vicarage Road just over three weeks ago, has  missed the Hornets' 1-0 win at Blackpool and last Saturday's 1-1 draw against Bournemouth, which should have been his first home match in charge. McKinlay was close to being appointed Blackburn manager two years ago but Rovers' global adviser Shebby Singh was warned to change his mind by supporters who protested against the plan.

chatgpt: Watford Football Club has made a new addition to their backroom staff, as Billy McKinlay joins the team. The announcement was made on Monday, as McKinlay has joined the team with immediate effect.  McKinlay brings a wealth of experience to the Hornets, having previously worked with clubs such as Fulham, Sunderland and Norwich City. He has also worked under some of the game's most recognisable managers, including Roy Hodgson and David Moyes.  The appointment comes at a time when Watford's first team coach Oscar Garcia has been hospitalised over the last fortnight due to some medical complications. Garcia was in attendance at Saturday's game against Blackburn Rovers, where he watched the match from the directors' box.  The club's statement regarding McKinlay's appointment reads, "We are pleased to welcome Billy McKinlay to the club. Billy has a wealth of experience at the highest level of the game, and we believe he will be an invaluable asset to the team." Watford has been performing impressively in their recent fixtures, having won four out of their six games since the start of the season. The team currently sits second in the overall standings, with just two points behind Bournemouth.  Therefore, McKinlay's appointment could provide an additional boost to the squad as they look to maintain their impressive performances. Furthermore, having a respected football figure working in the background ensures the team remains grounded and focused for the long run.  As for Oscar Garcia's recovery, the Watford football club has not provided an update on the coach's medical condition. However, it is speculated that the club will support him throughout his recovery process, and he may return to his duties as soon as he is healthy enough to do so.  We hope a speedy recovery for Oscar Garcia, and we look forward to seeing how the Watford team performs with their new addition to the backroom staff in the upcoming fixtures.
