article: The heartless thug who kicked a squirrel into the Grand Canyon in a Youtube clip has a £10,000 bounty on his head thanks to furious animal activists. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), famous for its shock tactics and ads containing scantily clad women, are on the hunt for the man shown in the video. The charity pointed to notorious criminals such as Jon Venables, Ian Brady and Ian Huntley, who all abused animals in the past, as reasons why the act should not go unpunished. At least one of them deserves a kicking: After luring the adorable rodent to the edge he takes aim . Gone: The tiny animal flies off the edge of the canyon after the man kicks it into the abyss . The video shows two men in boxer shorts at the Grand Canyon as one of them lays out treats for the squirrel  (seen bottom right) The video has had nearly 105,000 . views and shows a shirtless man wearing boxers and a straw hat laying . out breadcrumbs for a squirrel near a cliff top. As the squirrel gets close to the edge of the cliff one man, thought to be French, sneaks up on it and boots it off the cliff. PETA UK spokesperson Ben . Williamson said: 'It is imperative that any community faced with a . sadistic and violent act such as this take measures to find the culprit . or culprits and bring them to justice. 'Animal . abusers are a danger to everyone - they take their issues out on . whomever is available to them, human or non-human, and must be caught . before they act again.' The reward will be paid to anyone who gives information leading to the arrest and conviction of the man responsible. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact Grand Canyon Chief Ranger Bill Wright on +1 928-638-7888. The 15-second video was uploaded to YouTube by a user claiming he was only just a witness and had no part in the evil joke. ‘I . did not realize what was happening until it was too late,’ Jonathan . Hildebrand wrote in his defence. ‘I do not know who they are. All I know . is that they were French.’ Danger ahead: The man walks off as the little squirrel dashes towards the treacherous trail of treats . If found, the man could face a charge that falls into a category of disturbing or harassing wildlife — a federal petty offense that carries a maximum six months in jail and/or a $5,000 fine. However it is unlikely Rangers would pursue animal cruelty under a state statute because that would require them to retrieve the squirrel and prove that it was injured or had died. Squirrels are an everyday sight at the Grand Canyon and have become accustomed to visitors, climbing on their laps, begging for food and ransacking backpacks. Park officials discourage visitors from petting or feeding wildlife because the animals can bite or attack. Do you know the person responsible? Contact corey.charlton@mailonline.co.uk .

chatgpt: A man, reportedly French, has been captured on film kicking a squirrel off the edge of the Grand Canyon. The incident has caused outrage among animal lovers and has prompted animal rights non-profit organization PETA to offer a £10,000 reward for his arrest. The video shows a topless man luring the squirrel towards the edge of the canyon using a trail of breadcrumbs. As the animal approaches the edge, the man can be seen kicking it off the cliff. The video has since gone viral, with many condemning the man's cruel and senseless act. The identity of the man remains unknown, but PETA is urging anyone with information to come forward. In a statement, the organization called for the man's arrest and for him to be charged with animal cruelty. "Anyone who would kick a defenceless animal off a cliff clearly has no regard for the welfare of living beings," said Elisa Allen, Director of PETA UK. "We are calling on anyone with information to come forward and help bring this man to justice." The incident has also sparked a wider conversation about the treatment of animals in tourist hotspots. The Grand Canyon is known for its natural beauty and attracts millions of visitors every year, but the impact of tourism on the local wildlife has raised concerns. Some have called for better regulations to protect animals from harm, while others have pointed to the need for education and awareness around animal welfare. "We need to be more responsible when we travel," said Dr. Jane Goodall, renowned primatologist and animal rights activist. "We need to make sure that we are not causing harm to the animals and their habitats. It's up to all of us to make a difference." The incident has also drawn attention to the importance of respecting wildlife in natural environments. While the Grand Canyon may be a popular tourist destination, it is also home to a diverse range of wildlife species and ecosystems that must be protected. Animal rights organizations are urging visitors to be mindful of their impact on the environment and to follow responsible tourism practices. This includes refraining from feeding or interacting with wild animals and being respectful of their habitats. In the wake of the incident, the National Park Service has issued a statement condemning the man's actions and reminding visitors of the need to respect wildlife. "The behaviour shown in the video is unacceptable and goes against everything we stand for as a national park," the statement read. "We encourage all visitors to the Grand Canyon to enjoy the park responsibly and to show respect for the natural environment and the animals that call it home." The incident may have caused outrage, but it has also served as a reminder of the importance of protecting animals and their habitats. As visitors to natural environments, we have a responsibility to act with care and consideration, and to ensure that our actions do not cause harm to the wildlife we encounter.
