article: New York (CNN) -- A Bosnian immigrant accused of plotting to bomb New York's subway system as an "al Qaeda terrorist" has been found guilty on all counts, including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit murder and supporting a foreign terrorist organization. Adis Medunjanin, wearing a black suit with a gray shirt and tie, gazed at family members as the verdict was read aloud in court Tuesday. His sentencing is scheduled for September 7. "I want to commend prosecutors for the conviction of Adis Medunjanin," Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. "His conviction stands as a stark reminder of terrorists' desire long after 9/11 to return to the city to kill more New Yorkers." During the trial, prosecutors said Medunjanin traveled to Pakistan's tribal region with two high school friends, Pakistani-born Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan. His friends have pleaded guilty to planning the attack with Medunjanin, testified against him and are awaiting sentencing. Prosecutors said Medunjanin sought to join the Taliban, but ended up being recruited by al Qaeda to perform a suicide mission back in the United States. Upon their return, Medunjanin and his two friends hatched a plan to rig backpacks with explosives and blow them up, prosecutors said. "As this case has proved, working against sophisticated terrorist organizations and against the clock, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies can detect, disrupt and destroy terrorist cells before they strike, saving countless innocent lives," U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement on the verdict. Robert Gottlieb, Medunjanin's attorney, said his client "was always realistic about the environment in which the case was tried," referring to U.S. court proceedings in a post-9/11 America. Gottlieb added that Medujanin told him, "Tell my family to be strong." In closing arguments last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Berger said the defendant was willing "to strap a suicide bomb to himself, walk into a New York City subway and blow it up." Berger told jurors that al Qaeda leaders assigned the mission to Medunjanin in 2008, while he was in Pakistan's tribal region with his friends. Gottlieb had denied that account, insisting that his client traveled there "not to join al Qaeda but to join the Taliban in fighting foreign troops in Afghanistan." He said Medunjanin wanted to join the Taliban to stand up for Muslims and defend Islam, calling all three young men "immature, naive and clueless" when they set out. "They wanted to fulfill some romantic version of jihad," Gottlieb said.

chatgpt: New York - Sentencing for Adis Medunjanin, a Bosnian immigrant who was convicted of terrorism charges, has been set for September 7. Medunjanin was found guilty of planning a bombing attack on the New York City subway system in 2009, along with two of his friends, both of whom are already serving life terms. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Prosecutors argued during the trial that Medunjanin traveled to Pakistan's tribal region with his friends to receive training from al Qaeda, with the intention of launching a suicide attack on the subway system. They presented evidence that Medunjanin had received bomb-making instructions and that he had written a farewell note to his family, anticipating his own death. Medunjanin's attorney, Robert Gottlieb, argued that his client went to Pakistan "not to join al Qaeda, but to join the Taliban," and that he had been motivated by his opposition to the US presence in Afghanistan, rather than a desire to commit acts of terrorism. Gottlieb also pointed out that Medunjanin had not actually carried out an attack, and that the legal doctrine of mens rea required prosecutors to prove that Medunjanin had intended to kill or injure people. The jury rejected Gottlieb's argument, however, and found Medunjanin guilty of all charges, including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, receiving military training from a foreign terrorist organization, and conspiring to commit murder abroad. The case has been closely watched by counterterrorism officials, who see it as an example of the ongoing threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates. It has also raised questions about the effectiveness of US counterterrorism policies, particularly in preventing the radicalization of young Muslims. Speaking after the verdict, US Attorney Preet Bharara praised the jury for their "careful consideration of the evidence" and said that the verdict sent a clear message that "those who seek to harm Americans will be brought to justice." Gottlieb, meanwhile, expressed disappointment with the verdict and said that he planned to appeal. He argued that the government's case had been "built on a foundation of assumptions and speculation," and that the evidence presented at trial did not establish that Medunjanin had intended to carry out a terrorist attack. The sentencing hearing is expected to be a tense affair, with Medunjanin's family and supporters likely to plead for leniency, while prosecutors argue for the maximum sentence. Judge John Gleeson, who presided over the trial, has a reputation for being tough on terrorism defendants, and is expected to hand down a harsh sentence.
