Yahoo has adopted a new logo for the first time since shortly after the Internet company's founding 18 years ago. The redesigned look unveiled early this morning is part of a makeover that Yahoo has been undergoing since the Sunnyvale, California, company hired Google executive Marissa Mayer to become CEO 14 months ago.

'We wanted a logo that stayed true to our roots (whimsical, purple, with an exclamation point) yet embraced the evolution of our products' a statement on the website said.
