This week's earlier report that the owners have slashed office rents nearly 10 per cent comes as little surprise then. The Wall Street JournalÂ  reported that rents have been cut to $69 a square foot for larger tenants on the building's middle floors. Developer Douglas Durst says that is down from $75 a square foot. 'The market's not there,' Mr Durst told The Wall Street Journal. He bought a stake in the 1,776-foot tower from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2011. 'When we started in 2011, everybody expected the economy to take off, and obviously that hasn't happened.' All told, the construction of the 1,776-foot building cost $3.9billion . Major tenants in the building include magazine publisher Conde Nast and the government's General Services Administration. The skyscraper, the nation's tallest building, is scheduled to open later this year. Filling the floors: The developer has cut the asking rent for the middle floors of the World Trade Center from $75-per-foot to $69-per-foot . Competition: Rent in some of the middle floors of the World Trade Center have been knocked to $69-per-foot but neighboring buildings cost closer to $53-per-foot so that makes it tough for businesses to swallow . 'We have a lot of people looking at the space, but because of the asking rent, we are not able to really put anything over the finish line,' Mr Durst told The Journal. Part of the problem is that while there is a great deal of interest in real estate downtown- with Time Inc and the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. among the list of companies looking to move their operations south- the neighboring buildings are able to charge far cheaper rental rates. For instance, average downtown office rents were $53.87 in the first three months of this year, making the 1 World Trade Center rates more difficult to accept.

chatgpt: Less than half of the available office space in Manhattan's One World Trade Center has been rented out, despite the tower's prestige and prime location. The building, which was completed in 2014 and stands at a towering height of 1,776 feet, has struggled to attract new occupants due to competition from cheaper neighboring buildings. One World Trade Center's largest tenant is magazine publisher Conde Nast, which has claimed an impressive 24 floors of the building. The remaining tenants include the General Services Administration, a Chinese communal office space, and a hospitality management company. However, with so much vacant space in the tower, the developer has been struggling to sign on new occupants. In an attempt to entice new tenants, the price-per-foot of the middle floors of the building has been reduced from $75 to $69. While this reduction may seem significant, nearby buildings are offering rates as low as $53 per foot. This has made it difficult for One World Trade Center to compete with other, more affordable office spaces in the area. The construction of the new tower cost an estimated $3.9 billion, making it one of the most expensive buildings in the world. Many expected the tower's prestigious location and landmark status to attract a significant amount of tenants. However, with so much vacant space still available, it's clear that the developer is facing some significant challenges. While the developer has been struggling to attract new occupants, they've managed to secure some high-profile tenants. Conde Nast, for example, is one of the most prestigious and sought-after tenants in the publishing industry. The company's decision to move its headquarters to One World Trade Center was seen as a huge win for the tower and its developer. Despite this major victory, the fact that less than half of the building's office space is still empty is cause for concern. With neighboring buildings offering lower rates and similar amenities, it's unclear what the future holds for One World Trade Center. The developer may need to make some significant changes to their pricing strategy in order to fill the remaining vacant space. Overall, while One World Trade Center may be one of the most impressive and iconic buildings in New York City, it's clear that the developer is facing some significant challenges. With so much competition from neighboring buildings, the developer will need to come up with a new strategy to attract more tenants and fill the remaining office space. Whether or not they'll be successful remains to be seen.
