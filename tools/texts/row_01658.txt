Married murderers: The couple kidnapped the 16-year-old son of a wealthy family and demanded a ransom - but when their scheme started to go wrong, they killed the boy to stop him identifying them . The bizarre ruling allowing the murderers to have sex was handed down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court - which accepted it was a fundamental human right to have progeny. When the couple first filed their petition, the court rejected that it was a human right to have sex. But it accepted that if it was purely for the purposes of having children, whether through conjugal visits or artificial insemination, it should be allowed. Justice Surya Kant of the high court said that authorities at the Central Jail in Patiala should make arrangements for the couple's wish to be carried out. Wants children: Sonia Singh hopes to have a child with her husband Jasvir before their death sentence is carried out . Lawyers for Jasvir argued that he is the only son of his parents, and that he and his wife had only been married eight months when they were arrested. Indian justice officials had originally rejected the plea because of the seriousness of the crime. But they overturned the earlier ruling in the broader public interest saying that the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right of convicts and jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination in order to have children.

chatgpt: Jasvir and Sonia Singh, a notorious couple known for their criminal activities, were recently granted conjugal visits by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in India. The couple, who are currently serving life sentences for the brutal murder of a teenage boy, had filed a petition asking for the visits to enable them to have children. The story of Jasvir and Sonia Singh's crime is a shocking one. The couple had kidnapped the son of a wealthy family with the intention of extorting a large ransom. However, when their plan went awry and the teenager tried to escape, they panicked and killed him to prevent being identified. The murder was a heinous crime that shocked the nation, and the couple was quickly apprehended and sentenced to life in prison. However, their recent request for conjugal visits has left many people stunned. According to reports, the Singh's argued that their fundamental right to procreate was being infringed upon by the denial of conjugal visits. They presented their case before a bench of judges who, to the surprise of many, granted their request. The decision has sparked widespread outrage, with many people questioning the judgment of the court. Some have pointed out that the Singh's had committed a heinous crime and should not be given any privileges, while others have criticized the court for not taking into consideration the feelings of the victim's family. Despite the criticisms, the court's decision was final, and the Singh's were granted regular conjugal visits starting from August of this year. It is not yet clear whether the Singh's will be successful in their attempts to have children, but their story has definitely caused quite a stir in India. The question that many people are asking now is whether the court's decision was just or not. While some argue that it is important to protect the rights of prisoners, others point out that such privileges should be reserved for those who have not committed heinous crimes like murder. It remains to be seen what the ultimate outcome of this case will be, but one thing is clear: the story of Jasvir and Sonia Singh has captured the attention of the nation and will continue to do so in the weeks and months ahead.
