chatgpt: The West Indies cricket team has parted ways with head coach Ottis Gibson with immediate effect. The decision has been mutually agreed between the two parties, following a series of discussions. The team manager, Richie Richardson, will take over the reins on an interim basis until a permanent appointment is made. Gibson had taken on the role in January 2010, following his stint as England's bowling coach. He had several notable successes in his tenure, chief among them leading the West Indies to the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 title. However, the team's overall performance has been less than satisfactory during his time in charge. Under Gibson's leadership, the West Indies won just nine of the 36 Tests they played and only four series in total. This record was not strong enough, and the team's management decided it was time for a change. In a statement released by Cricket West Indies, the board acknowledged Gibson's contributions to the team over the years. "We thank Ottis for his efforts and hard work in his time with the West Indies. His dedication and commitment to the team are appreciated, and we wish him well in his future endeavors." The statement went on to say that Cricket West Indies would be conducting a search for a permanent head coach, and that Richie Richardson would take charge of the team until a new coach is appointed. Richardson has previous experience as West Indies captain and has been involved with the team in various capacities over the years. He is expected to bring his leadership skills and cricketing knowledge to the role and keep the team focused on improving performance. The West Indies cricket team has a rich history of success, and fans will be hoping that a new coach can lead the team back to its former glory. As the search for a permanent replacement continues, the team will be looking to Richardson to provide the stability and direction needed to get back on track.
