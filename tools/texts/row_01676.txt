article: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Iran has condemned the kidnapping of one of its diplomats in northwest Pakistan on Thursday, calling it an "act of terrorism," an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said. Pakistani policemen inspect a bullet-riddled car of a kidnapped Iranian diplomat on Thursday. "Pakistan should do its best to protect foreign diplomats and their residential places," the spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency. At least four gunmen abducted Heshmatollah Attarzadeh near his home in Peshawar as he headed to work at the Iranian consulate, according to Pakistani police and Iranian diplomatic officials. His bodyguard, a Pakistani police officer, was shot and killed when the two men tried to resist, a Peshawar police official said. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also "strongly condemned" the attack, and informed Iran that the government "will take all necessary measures for his safe and early recovery." Attarzadeh is a commercial attache for the Iranian consulate in Peshawar. It is the second attack targeting a foreign worker in Peshawar in two days. An American aid worker was shot and killed outside the Iranian consulate in Peshawar on Wednesday. Stephen Vance worked for a non-profit foundation funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development that helped find jobs for people in Pakistan's tribal regions, according to a statement from his employer, the Cooperative Housing Foundation International. "Stephen had fully immersed himself in the community in which he worked," the statement said. "He dressed traditionally and even sent his children to local schools." Vance, 52, a native of California, is survived by his wife and five children -- all of whom lived with him in Peshawar -- CHF International official Bill Holbrook told CNN. The attacks come less than three months after gunmen opened fire on a vehicle carrying the senior U.S. diplomat in Peshawar, Lynne Tracy. She escaped unharmed. Peshawar is the capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, an area rife with Islamic extremists and the site of recent clashes between security forces and militants. In late June, Pakistan's military launched an offensive in the province -- the biggest push against extremists in the tribal region since the civilian government took power in March. Islamic militants vowed to retaliate. Since then, militants have launched several deadly attacks. Pakistan's new government has tried to negotiate a deal with militants as part of its efforts to bypass military might and achieve peace through talks.

chatgpt: A diplomat was kidnapped and his bodyguard killed in Peshawar, northwest Pakistan, local authorities reported on Thursday. The incident occurred on the previous day, as the diplomat was reportedly heading from his home to the consulate. At the time of writing, authorities had not yet released the name or nationality of the diplomat. The killing occurred in the wake of another tragedy in the region. Just a day before, on Wednesday, gunmen shot and killed an American aid worker in Peshawar. The victim was an employee of a non-governmental organization called Roots of Peace, which focuses on agricultural development in conflict zones. The motive for the killing remains unknown, and no one has claimed responsibility. It remains unclear whether the two incidents are connected, but they both highlight the ongoing security challenges faced by foreigners in Pakistan, particularly in the northwest region. Foreign aid workers and diplomats have long been targets of violence in the country, where extremist groups like the Taliban and the Islamic State continue to operate. In recent years, Pakistan has stepped up its security measures in response to such threats, but incidents like these demonstrate that the risks remain high. Diplomats and aid workers often have to travel in convoys or with bodyguards, and yet they are still vulnerable to attack. The kidnapping of the diplomat is a particularly alarming incident, as it suggests that the perpetrators were able to plan and execute a sophisticated operation. The identity of the kidnappers is yet to be confirmed, but authorities are likely to investigate whether any extremist group is behind the abduction. The government of Pakistan has condemned both incidents and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. However, the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in the region are enormous, as they have to contend with not only extremist groups but also criminal gangs and other actors. The international community has also expressed its concern over the incidents. The US embassy in Pakistan issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the killing of the American aid worker and offering condolences to the victim's family. The embassy did not comment on the kidnapping of the diplomat. The incident is likely to further strain the already fragile relations between Pakistan and the US. The two countries have had a rocky relationship in recent years, with the US often accusing Pakistan of harboring terrorists and not doing enough to combat extremism. The killing of an American citizen is likely to increase tensions between the two nations further. In conclusion, the incidents of the last few days are a reminder of the precarious security situation in Pakistan. Foreigners continue to be at risk in the country, and the government and international community will need to work together to address this issue.
