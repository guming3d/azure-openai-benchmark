Staff at a zoo in South Africa are watching their step after a highly dangerous snake escaped from its enclosure. Pretoria Zoo's black mamba - one of the fastest and most venomous snakes in the world - is believed to be hiding somewhere in the zoo grounds after it was reported missing over a week ago. Now, desperate staff at the zoo in South Africa's capital are using infra-red cameras in a bid to find the six-and-a-half foot (two metre) missing reptile - before it finds one of them. South Africa's most feared snake: Pretoria Zoo's black mamba is missing from its enclosure . Marketing manager Craig Allenby said he hoped the snake was hiding in the roof of a service building behind its terrarium. Staff have placed snacks of rats, mice and chicks in the service area in a bid to tempt the snake out, but it has yet to bite. Mr Allenby's team is using cameras which can pick up radiation emitted by bodies and even objects as cold-blooded as killer snakes. Another theory is that the snake may have been stolen.  Zoo staff say there is a trade for indigenous reptiles such as Houdini, as they have named the missing mamba. However despite the uncertainty over the snake's whereabouts, a Friday night zoo tour and sleepover at the attraction are still going to go ahead - albeit at a distance from the snake enclosure, and with guards on hand. Mr Allenby told Sowetan Live: 'We would like to assure the public of our utmost commitment to resolving this issue as quickly as possible. Black mambas can kill lions with just one bite thanks to the powerful venom in their fangs . 'There is no additional threat to the public.' The Easter Egg hunts planned for Easter weekend will also go ahead.  Hundreds of children are expected to flock to the zoo to hunt for 20,000 chocolate eggs. Bites from the black mamba nearly always result in the victim's death. Black mambas are known as Africa's most feared snakes, and with good reason.  Just two drops of their venom can kill a human, and they have up to 20 drops in their fangs. The venom contains a fast-acting neurotoxin that paralyses and kills it prey.  Such is its strength, black mambas can kill a lion with just one bite.

chatgpt: A massive search is underway at the Pretoria Zoo in South Africa for a six-and-a-half-foot-long snake that has been missing from its enclosure for the past week. The reptile is believed to have escaped from its confinement and is either hiding in the roof of the zoo or has been stolen. The snake is a Taiwan Beauty, a common species of snake that is not venomous but can become aggressive if cornered. Its disappearance has sent ripples of fear through Pretoria Zoo, as staff members are aware that a missing snake in a public space can be particularly dangerous. In an effort to locate the missing reptile, experts have been deployed to the zoo to comb through every inch of the premises. They are using a range of tools, including infrared cameras and snake traps, to try and locate the missing Taiwan Beauty. Despite the zoo's best efforts, the snake has yet to be found. The staff at the zoo are now convinced that the snake has either gone into hiding in the roof or has been stolen by someone. Adding to the urgency of the situation is a planned sleepover at the zoo tonight. A group of intrepid enthusiasts are still set to spend the night at the zoo in a special sleepover event that was planned before the snake went missing.  The zoo has confirmed that the sleepover will still go ahead, but with an extra layer of security thrown in for good measure. Visitors will be accompanied by trained zookeepers throughout the night, ensuring their safety while searching for the missing reptile. The Taiwan Beauty is a popular attraction at the zoo, and staff are hopeful that it will be found safe and well. The snake is not venomous but can give a painful bite if provoked. The South African Police Service has been notified and is investigating the possibility of theft, but with no leads so far. As the search for the missing snake continues, zoo staff are urging visitors to be vigilant and to report any sightings of the snake to staff immediately. Overall, the situation at Pretoria Zoo is tense as the search for the missing snake continues. Staff members are working around the clock to find the Taiwan Beauty and ensure the safety of zoo visitors.
