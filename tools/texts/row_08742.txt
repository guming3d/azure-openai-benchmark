chatgpt: Queen Elizabeth II has long been an icon of style and fashion, inspiring countless designers and fashion aficionados alike. Perhaps one of the most surprising ways in which she continues to impact the fashion world is through her choice of handbag - specifically, her affinity for the brand Launer. In a recent interview, Launer owner Gerald Bodmer shared that the Queen's use of their handbags has played a significant role in keeping the company afloat. According to Bodmer, the Queen is seen as a "fashion icon" and her continued patronage of the brand is a testament to Launer's enduring appeal. While the Queen is often seen carrying black handbags, Bodmer noted that she has also used bags of various colors this year, demonstrating her willingness to experiment with her style.  Launer, a British luxury brand founded in 1941, has long been associated with royalty, having been appointed A Royal Warrant in 1968. The brand is known for its classic, elegant designs and use of high-quality materials, making it the perfect match for the Queen's refined taste. The Queen's love of Launer handbags is well-documented, with the brand now having supplied her for over 60 years. Queen Elizabeth II's collection reportedly contains over 200 Launer handbags, including their iconic "Traviata" style which she has owned in numerous colors over the years. Launer is not the only brand that the Queen has helped to elevate through her sartorial choices. Other brands that have benefitted from the "Kate effect" or "Meghan effect" include L.K. Bennett, Jenny Packham, and Burberry, among others.  Being one of the most influential women in the world, the Queen's choice of brands often sparks buying trends and inspires loyal followers around the world. A tweet from Kensington Palace detailing the outfit worn by the Duchess of Cambridge on her recent tour of Pakistan caused the brand to sell out within hours, as fans clamored to copy Kate's iconic style. In a world where fashion trends come and go in the blink of an eye, Launer's longstanding relationship with the Queen is a testament to the enduring appeal of classic, timeless style. As Gerald Bodmer noted in his interview, "We’re very lucky to have such a loyal customer. She’s one reason we still exist." It seems evident that, as long as the Queen continues to carry Launer handbags, this classic brand will continue to thrive for years to come.
