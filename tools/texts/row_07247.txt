High-flier: Former BBC director-general Mark Thompson was among executives who clocked up over £1million on flights to the U.S. over a seven-month period . The BBC spent more than £1 million on flights to America in the space of seven months this year, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, . Executives including former director-general Mark Thompson clocked up the massive bill flying both business and economy class for meetings and to make programmes. In total, the Corporation’s U.S. flights bill came to £1,135,726 between April 1 and October 31. That works out at an average of £162,246 per month, or around £40,000 per week. The new figures show 1,026 tickets were bought, though the BBC has admitted that final total could be even higher. With around 20,000 BBC employees in total, an average of one member of staff in every 20 flew to the U.S. at some point during the seven-month period. The figures do not include the cost of sending 94 assorted staff to the U.S. for last month’s presidential election. In its FoI response, the BBC said the bill covers tickets booked for staff, contributors and equipment — but doesn’t include any flights that may have been booked directly by staff or guests and then claimed back. As the BBC is not legally obliged to reveal full details of how it spends the £3.7 billion it is given each year through the licence fee, it is not possible to name every staff member who flew to the U.S. between April and October. Big spenders: The corporation's flights averaged £162,246 per month, or around £40,000 per week . However, last week the BBC released details for the first quarter of the financial year for its best-paid 100 employees. This showed that Thompson, who quit in September to become chief executive of The New York Times, took a return business-class flight to San Francisco in June for £5,789. Also flying to California in June was American-born Ralph Rivera, the £309,000-a-year BBC director of future media, whose return ticket cost £6,213.09. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has offices across the UK and all over the world. In addition, staff have to represent the organisation at international conferences and events that happen worldwide. ‘Fuel and flight costs are rising, but we continue to try and reduce our expenditure in this area wherever possible.’

chatgpt: A Freedom of Information (FoI) request has revealed that top executives at the BBC, including former Director-General Mark Thompson, ran up a huge bill on international travel. The corporation reportedly spent an average of £162,246 a month on flights to the United States alone, adding up to a significant amount over the course of a year. According to the FoI data, Mark Thompson, who served as Director-General from 2004 to 2012, was responsible for the largest amount of spending on U.S. travel. During his tenure, he reportedly spent nearly £104,000 on 10 trips to the States, including flights, hotels, and other expenses. Other BBC executives also contributed to the high travel expenses, with one individual spending over £60,000 on flights to the U.S. alone. In total, the BBC spent over £8 million on international travel between 2010 and 2013, with the United States ranking as the top destination. The revelations have sparked criticism from some who argue that this level of spending is excessive, particularly for a publicly funded organization. Others have defended the travel expenses, arguing that international travel is necessary for conducting business and cultivating relationships with partners and stakeholders. While some may question the value of such expenses, it is important to note that the BBC operates on a global scale, with an extensive network of partners and correspondents around the world. International travel is therefore a necessary component of the organization's operations. Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, the FoI request has shed light on the spending habits of top BBC executives and raised questions about transparency and accountability. The revelation comes at a time when the public broadcaster is already facing scrutiny over its funding model and role in a rapidly evolving media landscape. In response to the FoI request, a BBC spokesperson defended the spending, stating that "International travel is an essential part of the BBC's work, from covering major news events to building partnerships with broadcasters and audiences in other countries." As the media landscape continues to shift and the role of public broadcasters is debated, it is likely that questions about the BBC's spending habits will continue to be raised. The extent to which this scrutiny will impact the organization remains to be seen, but the recent revelations have certainly added fuel to the fire.
