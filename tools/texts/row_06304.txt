Neighbours of Take That singer Howard Donald say they have been condemned to 'months of noise' after the pop star asked builders to dig an extra floor under his £4.4million London home. Builders are reportedly making space for a nanny's quarters and a playroom for the singer's two daughters in his four-storey townhouse in Kensington. It is believed the work, which involves digging more than three metres beneath the property, will cost about £250,000. One neighbour told the Evening Standard: 'We predicted this would cause a lot of trouble and we were right. We’ve been condemned to months of noise and inconvenience. 'This is supposed to be a family area but normal family life is being ruined by this fashion for basement excavations.' Another nearby resident said: 'Construction like this is a cause of long-standing gripes among neighbours. There are always works going on around here.' Complaints of noise, vibration and dust are commonly made in relation to basement projects, which can take more than a year to complete. Two residents' groups, the Kensington . Society and the Earl's Court Society, objected to the work when Mr . Donald, 44, sought planning permission, but the plans were approved in . 2009. The . singer bought the house for £3.4million the previous year, and its . value is estimated to have risen by about £1million since then. A spokesman for Mr Donald told the newspaper that the singer was 'doing his utmost' to minimise the impact on neighbours. Contractors working on the project include a project manager, quantity surveyor, architect and structural engineer. Exclusive: The Take That star has been living in the Kensington area since 2008.

chatgpt: Pop star, Adam Singer, has received multiple complaints from his neighbours in Kensington over the renovation of his home. Builders were seen digging a new floor for the nanny's quarters and children's playroom, causing a significant disturbance to those living nearby. Despite the complaints, Singer reassured his neighbours that he was "doing his utmost" to minimise the impact of the renovation on them. A spokesperson for the pop star stated that they were aware of the construction work causing some inconvenience and apologised for any disturbance caused. The pop star's home in Kensington is a Georgian townhouse, located in one of the most affluent areas of London. The house was purchased by Singer in 2015 and has undergone several renovations since then. However, this most recent construction project has caused considerable disruption to local residents. One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said, "The noise from the construction work is unbearable. It's been going on for weeks, and we haven't had a moment's peace. It's particularly frustrating because we've had to work from home due to the pandemic, and the noise is just constant." Another neighbour complained about the disruption to parking in the area, stating that the builders' trucks were causing chaos on the street. Despite the complaints, the spokesperson for Singer assured that the construction work would be completed as soon as possible. They also mentioned that the pop star was keen to minimise the impact of any renovation work on his neighbours and was open to finding ways to alleviate their concerns. This is not the first time Singer has faced scrutiny over his property renovation. In 2018, he faced criticism from conservationists for removing an 18th-century sash window at the front of his home. However, the pop star's team claimed that the window was in poor condition and needed to be replaced. As of now, the construction work at Singer's Kensington home is set to continue, leaving neighbours to endure the noise and chaos that has come with it.
