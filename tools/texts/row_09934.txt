article: The first official portrait of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, has been unveiled at London's National Portrait Gallery -- but has met with a mixed reaction from art critics and the public. Award-winning artist Paul Emsley, who spent three-and-a-half months painting the Duchess's likeness, said he had tried to portray her warmth and personality in the picture. "The Duchess explained that she would like to be portrayed naturally -- her natural self -- as opposed to her official self," he said in a video posted on the gallery's website.

"She struck me as enormously open and generous and a very warm person, so after initially feeling it was going to be an unsmiling portrait I think it was the right choice in the end to have her smiling - that is really who she is." Both Catherine, who is expecting her first baby, and her husband Prince William, are said to be pleased with the finished painting, with the Duchess reportedly telling Emsley at a private viewing on Friday that it is "amazing... brilliant."

However, reaction from art critics and the public has been more mixed, with many taking to social media, including Twitter, to share their thoughts, claiming the picture is unflattering and ages the Duchess beyond her years. Writing in the UK's Guardian newspaper, Charlotte Higgins claimed the painting transformed "a pretty young woman... into something unpleasant from the 'Twilight' franchise." In the Independent, art critic Michael Glover wrote that the portrait was "catastrophic," combining "hamsterish" cheeks and "hair whose featheriness has been borrowed from an advert for shampoo." Emsley, who was born in Glasgow but grew up in South Africa before returning to Britain in 1996, won the prestigious BP Portrait Award in 2007. He has previously painted portraits of Nelson Mandela and author VS Naipaul. Royal waxworks of William and Catherine revealed . He created the work from a series of photographs taken during two sittings, at Kensington Palace in London and at his studio in South West England, in May and June last year. "I'm always worried about the sitter -- are they cold, are they hot, are they comfortable -- and photography today is so accurate and so good that it is really so much easier just to take photographs and work from that," he said. Catherine's portrait joins centuries-worth of official paintings and photographs of the British royal family in the NPG's collection. The duchess is a patron of the gallery. NPG director Sandy Nairne said revealing the portrait, which he described as "a captivating contemporary image," was "an exciting moment." In a statement, Stephen Deuchar, director of the Art Fund, said: "The unveiling of a first official portrait of a royal sitter is always an important and intriguing moment, defining and enshrining their public image in a new way."

chatgpt: London, UK - The first official portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine, has been unveiled in London by artist Paul Emsley. Catherine, who is expecting her first baby with Prince William, posed for the painting last year, which will be displayed at the National Portrait Gallery in London, of which she is a patron. The portrait depicts Catherine wearing a soft smile and looking directly at the viewer, dressed in a dark velvet dress with a simple background. However, reaction to the portrait has been mixed, with many taking to social media to claim the painting is unflattering. Some Twitter users described the portrait as "a bit of a letdown," while others criticized Emsleyâ€™s choice of lighting and the overall composition of the painting. Many compared the portrait unfavorably with previous ones of the young royal. However, the National Portrait Gallery defended the portrait, saying that it was a "compelling image" that captured the Duchess as she is, natural and relaxed. According to gallery director Sandy Nairne, the portrait is a contemporary image of Catherine that conveys her personality, as well as her position within the royal family. The artist, Paul Emsley, said that he was trying to create a painting that would capture Catherine's spirit and personality in a way that was both modern and respectful of tradition. He spoke about his approach to creating the portrait, saying, "I worked from a number of photographs and sketches, but my primary source material was the Duchess herself. I wanted to create a painting that would not just be an accurate representation of her physical appearance, but would also convey something of her inner self." Despite the mixed reaction to the portrait, the National Portrait Gallery is expecting a high demand for tickets to see the painting. The gallery has already reported a significant increase in online bookings, with thousands of visitors expected to view the portrait over the coming weeks and months. As a patron of the National Portrait Gallery, the Duchess of Cambridge has regularly visited the gallery and has been involved in supporting its work. In 2012, she launched the gallery's fundraising appeal to mark its 160th anniversary, and since then, has remained involved with the gallery and its activities. The unveiling of the portrait comes at an exciting time for the royal family, as Catherine is due to give birth to her first child in the summer. The new arrival will be the third in line to the British throne after Prince Charles and Prince William. In conclusion, the unveiling of the official portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge has sparked a mixed reaction from the public. While some have praised it for its contemporary feel and ability to capture Catherine's personality, others have criticized it as unflattering. Nonetheless, the portrait will undoubtedly attract significant interest from the public and will be a valuable addition to the National Portrait Gallery's collection.
