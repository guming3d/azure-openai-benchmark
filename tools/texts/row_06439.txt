Andy Murray punches the air in celebration after winning a point in his second-round match in Vienna . The Scot is making his tournament debut after revising his schedule in order to make a late push for a spot in the ATP World Tour Finals next month, following defeat to David Ferrer in the Shanghai Open. The 27-year-old took a wild card entry into the Vienna competition, where he is seeded No 2, to try to move from 11th-place in the rankings to inside the top eight, so he can compete at the season-ending showpiece in London. Pospisil had 27 aces in his first-round win over Daniel Brands of Germany but just three against Murray. Murray plays Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany next, who won the last seven points in the third-set tiebreaker to beat Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine 7-6 (6), 2-6, 7-6 (3). Canadian Vasek Pospisil returns the ball during his straight-sets defeat to second-seed Murray . David Ferrer advanced to his 15th quarter-final of the season after defeating Tobias Kamke of Germany 7-5, 6-1. The fifth-ranked Ferrer, the top seed, avoided service breaks and converted his second match point with a forehand winner. 'It was tough in the first set but in the second I played better, more solid, more consistent,' said Ferrer, who plays No. 6 Ivo Karlovic of Croatia in the quarter-finals. The Spaniard needs to reach Sunday's final to improve his chances of qualifying for the ATP Finals.

Also, Benjamin Becker of Germany defeated last year's finalist, Robin Haase of the Netherlands, 6-3, 6-3, winning six straight games to lead by a set and 2-0.

chatgpt: British tennis star Andy Murray secured a comfortable straight-sets victory over Canada’s Vasek Pospisil to reach the third round of the European Open in Antwerp. The win marked Murray's first appearance at the tournament, as he seeks to accumulate ranking points in his bid to qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals in London next month. In a confident display, the three-time Grand Slam champion outclassed his opponent, breaking serve twice in the opening set before serving out the match. With a superb blend of power, guile and accuracy, Murray was too good for Pospisil, who never really looked like mounting a comeback. The win was especially significant for Murray as it marked his 470th career victory. Despite a succession of injury setbacks in recent years, the former world number one has endured and appears to be working his way back to full fitness. The Scot hopes to force his way into the top eight in the rankings in time for the ATP World Tour Finals, which would be a remarkable achievement given his injury concerns. After the match, Murray acknowledged that he was pleased with his performance and the progress he has made in the past few months. "It was a tough match against a good player," he said. "I felt like I moved well and didn't make too many errors." Having missed most of the 2019 season with a hip injury, Murray has made an impressive comeback in recent weeks, reaching the quarter-finals of the China Open earlier this month. With each victory, the former Olympic gold medallist is looking more and more like his old self, much to the delight of his fans around the world. Looking ahead, Murray faces a stern test in the third round, where he will take on Romania’s Marius Copil. Copil, a big-serving player, is ranked 92nd in the world and will be looking to cause an upset against the British star. Should Murray progress to the quarter-finals, he could face a potential clash against Swiss star Stan Wawrinka, who is also making his debut at the European Open. Wawrinka, a former Australian Open champion, has been in good form of late and could pose a serious challenge to Murray's bid for glory. Despite the tough road ahead, Murray will be buoyed by his performances in recent weeks and will be looking to build on his success in Antwerp. With his sights firmly set on the ATP World Tour Finals, the Scottish star will be hoping to maintain his momentum and continue his impressive run of form.
