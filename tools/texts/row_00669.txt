article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- Fighter jets and other combat aircraft used Taiwan's main highway as a makeshift airstrip Tuesday as part of a dawn drill that simulated an attack from China. Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) said the aircraft practiced emergency take-offs and landings near the city of Chiayi, on a section of the main north-south route that runs along the island's west coast. Ground crews practiced refueling and re-loading ammunition, CNA said. The drill is part of Taiwan's annual "Han Kuang" exercises that last five days and test the military's combat readiness in the event of an attack from China, said J. Michael Cole, a correspondent for IHS Jane's Defense Weekly and a fellow of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham in the UK. "Taiwan is a small place with a limited number of air bases," he told CNN. "China has 1,500 to 1,600 short and mid-range missiles targeted at Taiwan and it's understood that the first phase of a missile attack would target these air bases so they would have to find an alternative." The aircraft involved included an F-16 A/B jet fighter, a Mirage 2000-5 and an Indigenous Defensive Fighter, as well as an E-2K airborne early warning aircraft, a CH-47 Chinook helicopter, an OH-58D reconnaissance helicopter and two AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters, CNA reported. The military exercises also involve live-fire maritime drills on Taiwan's east coast and near the island of Penghu in the Taiwan Strait. Breakaway province . Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. Relations between the two sides have improved since the Kuomintang party came to power in Taiwan's 2008 election. In February, Taiwan and China held their highest level talks for more than six decades -- the first government-to-government contact since the pair's acrimonious split in 1949 amid civil war. Cole said that while relations have improved in some respects, with more exchanges in terms of tourism, investment and education, the underlying cause of the conflict has yet to be resolved. "People here see themselves as Taiwanese but at some point Beijing will want them to move nearer (to reunification) and the military option remains on the table. In my view, it's a distant probability but it remains an option." Small plane makes forced landing on Bronx highway .

chatgpt: In a bold move, fighter jets and combat aircraft utilized Taiwan's main highway as a makeshift airstrip during the country's annual military drills. The simulation, which was based on a potential attack by China, aimed to enhance Taiwan's defense capabilities in the face of continued pressures from Beijing to reunify with the mainland. Beijing has long considered Taiwan a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. This has led to a tense relationship between the two nations, with Taiwan striving to maintain its sovereignty and independence. The use of a highway as an airstrip during military drills highlights Taiwan's resourcefulness in the face of adversity. The decision to make use of the highway was made to simulate a situation where runways may be destroyed during an attack, forcing pilots to use alternative landing sites. Taiwan's military personnel demonstrated their expertise by successfully using the highway as a makeshift airstrip. While the drills were primarily focused on improving Taiwan's military capabilities, they also served as a significant show of force to Beijing. By utilizing the highway as an airstrip, Taiwan demonstrated its ability to adapt to various scenarios and to defend its territory from potential threats. Taiwanese officials have emphasized the importance of maintaining their country's sovereignty in the face of continued threats from China. The drills represent a crucial part of this effort, as they allow for the development of effective defense strategies against Chinese aggression. In recent months, China has increased its military presence near Taiwan, including conducting numerous military exercises and sailing their aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's decision to use the highway as an airstrip during military drills is a clear message to China that they are prepared to defend their sovereignty in any scenario. The use of a highway as an airstrip during military drills may seem unconventional, but it underlines Taiwan's resourcefulness and commitment to defending its territory. As tensions between Taiwan and China continue to escalate, the drills serve as a reminder to Beijing that Taiwan will not back down in the face of threats to its sovereignty.
