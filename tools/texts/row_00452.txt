chatgpt: A Californian company called Because We Can has developed a revolutionary new feline transport system. The system includes cat-size doorways, bridges, and tunnels that allow cats to move around easily and safely. The company is now selling the systems after initially making one for their own office cat. The new feline transport system has been designed to make life easier and more accessible for cats. The system is made up of a series of tunnels, bridges, and doorways that are perfect for cats to use. These pathways are designed to give cats the freedom to move around their home or office space easily without risking their safety. The creators of the feline transport system initially made the design for their office cat, Smudge. They noticed that Smudge had trouble moving around the office and needed a safe space to explore. After creating the system, they noticed a significant difference in how happy and comfortable Smudge was in the office. This sparked the idea to make the same system available to all cat owners. According to the company's website, the system is easy to install and can be customized to fit any living space. The feline transport system includes an array of tunnels, bridges, and doorways that can be easily adjusted to fit any cat's size and breed. The tunnels are wide enough to accommodate cats of all sizes, while the bridges are sturdy enough to ensure safety while still allowing cats to jump and climb. Because We Can has received positive feedback from cat owners who have already installed the system in their homes. Many owners reported that their cats were more relaxed and active, as they felt safer and more comfortable with the system in place. Owners who previously kept their cats in a single room were able to give them the freedom to explore and move around more, resulting in happier and healthier cats. The company's co-founder, Jeffrey McGrew, said that their goal is to help cats live their best lives. "Cats are curious animals and they need the freedom to explore and move around," he said. "We believe that our feline transport system gives cats the space and safety they need to live happy and healthy lives." While the feline transport system is currently only available in California, Because We Can plans to expand its availability to other states and eventually globally. The company is confident that their innovative design will revolutionize how cat owners care for their pets. In conclusion, the feline transport system developed by Because We Can is changing the way cat owners view their pets' mobility and safety. With its customizable design and easy installation, the system has already made a positive impact on the lives of many cats and their owners. As the system becomes more widely available, more cats around the world will experience the freedom and safety they deserve.
