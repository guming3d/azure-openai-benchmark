article: By . Mark Duell . Missing British guns that were being stored in the US consulate in Libya could have been seized by extremists after the site was destroyed. An attack last month on the consulate in Benghazi - which killed US Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans - followed Foreign Office diplomats’ withdrawal from the city in June. The officials departed after an assassination attempt on the British ambassador, but left weapons and vehicles at the lightly-guarded US compound after an agreement was struck with the Americans.

One month after the attack, the equipment is still unaccounted for - and Libyans have been walking through the site’s remains, so guns could have already been seized, reported the Daily Telegraph. The revelations came during a U.S. congressional hearing on Wednesday, which heard evidence from Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood, who headed a 16-member U.S. military force in Libya. He said the British could ‘leave their weapons and vehicles on our compound in Benghazi’ and would ‘come back and at times withdraw their weapons and vehicles and then return them and leave’. Politicians at the hearing asked why the US stayed in the city even after the British pulled out as they thought it was no longer safe. Lt Col Wood said the withdrawal should have been a warning sign.

chatgpt: After an assassination attempt on British diplomats in June, the Foreign Office withdrew from the Libyan city of Benghazi, leaving behind a compound filled with weapons and vehicles. This decision, which was made in an effort to avoid further violence in the region, ultimately proved to be fatal when an attack last month claimed the life of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens. It has since been revealed that an American-British agreement had been made to leave the weapons and vehicles at the compound, a decision which has been heavily criticized in light of recent events. The attack on September 11th, which also claimed the lives of three other Americans, has led to widespread anger and unrest, with many demanding answers as to why such a decision was made. The withdrawal of the Foreign Office from Benghazi had been seen as a significant setback for the Libyan government, which has struggled to maintain stability in the wake of the country's revolution. The decision to leave weapons and vehicles behind was apparently made in an effort to support local security forces, but has now been seen as a grave error in judgment. One of the most pressing concerns now facing the U.S. and British governments is the question of who was responsible for the attack on the consulate in Benghazi. While some have accused Islamic extremist groups of carrying out the attack, others have suggested that it was a coordinated effort by various factions within the country's political establishment. Regardless of who is ultimately found to be responsible, the incident has highlighted the ongoing instability in Libya and the challenges faced by the country's government as it seeks to establish itself in the wake of the revolution. Many observers have expressed concern that the country may be descending into a protracted period of civil strife, with potentially devastating consequences for both the Libyan people and the wider region. For their part, U.S. and British officials have vowed to bring the perpetrators of the attack to justice, while also acknowledging the need for a broader strategy to address the challenges posed by the ongoing instability in Libya. It remains to be seen what steps will be taken in the coming months to try and prevent further violence in the country, but there is no doubt that the events in Benghazi have cast a long shadow over the prospects for peace and stability in Libya. In conclusion, the assassination attempt on British diplomats in June resulted in the Foreign Office withdrawing from Benghazi and leaving behind a compound filled with weapons and vehicles. American and British officials have been heavily criticized for this decision in light of the recent attack in which U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. The instability in Libya remains a pressing concern, and the events in Benghazi serve as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by the country's government as it seeks to establish itself in the wake of the revolution.
