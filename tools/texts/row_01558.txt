article: By . Belinda Robinson . An illuminated American flag which is attached to the top of a tree in an Idaho park will be left there because officials don’t know how to get it down. The flag was affixed to the top of a tall pine tree in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest near milepost 27 of the I-90 on the Fourth of July Pass in northern Idaho. It is thought that it was put up about a month ago but it is too dangerous to remove, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Stars and stripes: An American flag is secured with duct tape to the top of a tall pine tree in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest near milepost 27 of I-90 on Fourth of July Pass . Jay . Kirchner a spokesman for Idaho Panhandle National Forest told the Coeur . d'Alene Press: ‘We have no idea how it got up there.’ ‘It's on the tip-top of the tree and I can't imagine it would hold the weight of a person holding onto it.’ The flag, which becomes illuminated at nights is easily visible from the I-90 highway. However, it is not known how it got there or who put it onto the tree. Mr Kirchner said the agency sent professional tree climbers to remove it but it was so high and attached to such a small part of the tree that it was difficult to get it down.

He added: ‘It's just too dangerous for them. To get up on that skinny part of the tree that high up would just be too risky. ‘Since it's not hurting anything, we are going to leave it up there for now. It's not worth the risk.’ Mr Kirchner said he would prefer that the flag and light be taken down at some point. ‘We applaud and respect this individual's display of patriotism,’ he said. ‘But they did this on public land and we don't want more people putting up displays on public land.’ Mattias Wermke, 35, left, and Mischa Leinkauf, 37, claimed responsibility for the stunt . There have been other incidents involving American flags on public buildings in recent months. Last month, two German artists replaced the flags on top of the Brooklyn bridge with white flags they had hand-stitched stars and stripes onto.

chatgpt: In Idaho's scenic wilderness, an unusual situation has arisen that has piqued the interest of passersby driving along the I-90 highway. A United States flag, illuminated at night, has been attached to a treetop with duct tape. While the display has undoubtedly served as a patriotic tribute, the unexpected attachment and its location in a forested area has presented a unique challenge for authorities. The U.S. Forest Service has confirmed that efforts to take the flag down have been unsuccessful. Professional tree climbers made a valiant attempt to remove the flag, but their efforts were impeded by the height of the tree. The tree's location on a steep incline has also made it difficult for climbers to maintain a safe foothold and reach the treetop. Officials are still deliberating on a strategy of how to remove the flag from the treetop before it causes any damage or harm. The priority is to ensure the safety of climbers while also minimizing any impact on the environment. The situation is delicate, primarily because the tree's height and location mean that removal is a hazardous endeavor, and there may be no clear or safe method that would achieve the removal of the flag without causing damage to the tree. The Forest Service has extended a warning for those people who may be tempted to try and retrieve the flag themselves. The location, combined with the height of the tree and the density of vegetation, make it unsuitable and potentially life-threatening for people to attempt to climb the tree. The flag, perched high on its treetop, is a visible and uplifting reminder of patriotism for drivers travelling along the busy highway. Its presence has sparked an outpouring of support and admiration from people across Idaho, some even suggesting the flag should remain in place as a symbol of American pride. Despite the calls for the flag to stay, Forest Service officials have remained resolute in their efforts to bring it down. It's not only important to uphold the integrity of the American flag, but it's also critical to ensure that hazardous situations, like this one, are handled to prevent any harm or damage to the surrounding community. Officials are endeavoring to find a way to remove the flag from the treetop safely. That could mean employing a different climbing tactic or finding alternative methods of accessing the tree's apex. Whatever the final strategy may be, officials are taking every precaution to ensure that it's done safely, efficiently, and with respect to the environment in which the tree resides. In the meantime, the illuminated American flag remains aloft atop its treetop, serving as an inspiring sight for the travelers passing along the I-90. However, the authorities are committed to addressing the situation and having the flag removed from its current location as soon as possible while maintaining public safety and preserving the surrounding ecosystem.
