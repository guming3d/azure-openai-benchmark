article: (CNN) -- President Obama took his renewed jobs push beyond the Washington beltway again Tuesday, heading to the politically critical state of New Hampshire for a town hall meeting. The president used the event to spotlight his call for a $30 billion investment in a new small-business lending fund. Obama's initiative would recycle $30 billion of the remaining Troubled Asset Relief Program funds into a government lending program offering cheap capital to community banks that boost their small-business lending this year. This measure will help ensure "small businesses are once again the engine of job growth in America," Obama said in the city of Nashua. It's "absolutely critical that Congress acts" to help pass this and other job creation legislation. While credit conditions for large businesses have improved over the past year, small companies are still widely reporting problems finding the capital they need to fund their operations. Since small businesses employ about half of American workers, policymakers worry that the ongoing credit crunch they face is contributing to the nation's high rate of job losses. Under Obama's plan, banks with assets of less than $10 billion would be able to borrow money from the Treasury at a dividend rate as low as 1 percent if they use the cash to make more small-business loans this year than they did in 2009. Obama's visit to New Hampshire, several political analysts said, was part of the White House's ongoing effort to recapture sorely needed political momentum. The state, which is home to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, is considered in many ways to be a political bellwether for an administration struggling to maintain the support of independent voters. More than 40 percent of the state's voters were registered as independents as of last November, according to the New Hampshire secretary of state's office. Obama easily carried the state in the 2008 general election, but a slight plurality of New Hampshire voters disapproved of his job performance in a December 2009 American Research Group survey. Tuesday's trip was Obama's second visit to New Hampshire since becoming president. While the town hall participants gave his small-business proposal a warm reception, they also raised questions about a series of other issues, including education, energy independence, government transparency and health care reform. "We're in the red zone. We've got to punch it through," Obama said about the stalled health care legislation. "I do not quit. We are going to get that done." Obama said supporters of the legislation "have to move methodically and [ensure] the American people understand exactly what's in the bill." Efforts to pass a comprehensive reform bill have been frozen since Massachusetts GOP Sen.-elect Scott Brown won the seat previously held by Ted Kennedy, who died last August. Brown's victory stripped Democrats of their 60-seat Senate supermajority and gave Republicans enough votes to block most bills. CNN's Catherine Clifford and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a town hall meeting held in Manchester, New Hampshire, participants responded positively to a small-business lending fund plan proposed by the Obama administration. The meeting was an opportunity for residents to engage with the administration on a range of issues, including education, energy, government transparency, and healthcare. The small-business lending plan would use funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to lend to community banks that increase small-business lending. This is seen as a potential solution to the ongoing difficulty that small businesses face in securing loans from banks, which has hampered their growth and job creation. The administration's proposal was met with strong support from the town hall participants, who welcomed the focus on supporting small businesses. Several attendees shared their own experiences of struggling to obtain funding for their small businesses, highlighting the urgent need for a solution. However, the town hall discussion was not solely focused on small-business lending. Attendees also raised concerns about education, with some expressing frustration about the high cost of college tuition and the burden of student loan debt. Others questioned the administration's policies on energy and climate change, calling for greater investment in clean energy technologies. The topic of government transparency also came up, with participants asking about efforts to increase openness and accountability in government. Some expressed concern about the influence of money in politics and the need to reform campaign finance laws. Healthcare was also a major topic of discussion, with several attendees sharing personal stories of struggles with the healthcare system. Some called for the implementation of a single-payer healthcare system, while others suggested alternative solutions to improve access and affordability. The town hall meeting was held in New Hampshire, a state that overwhelmingly supported Obama in the 2008 general election. However, some have suggested that support for the administration may be slipping, particularly among independent voters. Despite these concerns, the small-business lending fund plan is seen as a potentially popular proposal that could win support across the political spectrum. The plan addresses a pressing issue for small businesses and has the potential to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Overall, the Manchester town hall meeting provided an opportunity for residents to connect with the Obama administration and discuss a range of pressing issues. While there are concerns about slipping support in New Hampshire, the small-business lending fund plan was met with a warm reception and could prove to be a popular proposal.
