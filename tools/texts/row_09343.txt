Premier League clubs held a minute's silence a week early at the weekend ahead of Remembrance Weekend . This year marks a particularly special landmark with the centenary of the First World War being  commemorated. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'This is a very significant year in the history of our nation and football has had a prominent part in wartime, whether it was supporters and players volunteering to fight for their country or the famous football matches played in the trenches by soldiers from both sides during the Christmas Truce in 1914.' Tickets For Troops forms part of the Premier League's Football Remembers celebrations, which also include an Under 12s Christmas Truce tournament in Ypres, a permanent memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum and other events bringing together football fans to honour the history of 1914. Chelsea captain John Terry is a longtime supporter of Tickets For Troops and commended all clubs for getting involved. Military personnel carry giant poppies on The King Power Stadium on November 1 - Remembrance Sunday this year is this weekend and every Premier League club has given tickets to Armed Forces members . 'At Chelsea we have been providing 50 tickets for every home game at the Bridge for five years and although it's a very simple gesture it goes some way to showing our admiration and respect for these incredibly brave men and women,' Terry said. 'These amazing people serve our country and give us the opportunity to live our lives the way we do today, they are true heroes.' Lord Marland, Chairman of Tickets For Troops, was delighted to see all clubs joining the initiative in 'this very special year'. 'Their generosity recognises the sacrifices and courage of all those men and women who work on our behalf and make us so proud,' Lord Marland said. Premier League clubs will have combined to give away more than 5,000 tickets this season by the end of the weekend, about a quarter of the 20,000 Tickets For Troops given out since 2009. The charity has given out more than 600,000 tickets to its 140,000 registered members of the military to a range of sports.

chatgpt: Premier League clubs have rallied behind the Tickets for Troops initiative, which provides free tickets for members of the Armed Forces and their families to attend sporting events across the United Kingdom. Since its inception in 2009, the scheme has enjoyed a strong following from many football clubs in the top tier of English football.  This weekend, November 8th and 9th, marks the first time that all the clubs have simultaneously taken part in supporting the Tickets for Troops scheme. The reason for this united front is to coincide with Remembrance Weekend, a time when the nation pays tribute to its fallen soldiers and recognizes the contributions of its veterans.  Chelsea captain John Terry spoke about the importance of this initiative and its significance in honoring the military. "The men and women of the Armed Forces allow us to live our lives the way we do today. They are true heroes," he said.  Terry's remarks have been echoed by many in the footballing community, as well as members of the public. The Tickets for Troops scheme has been lauded for its role in supporting service members and their families, providing them with respite from the stresses and strains of military life.

The Tickets for Troops scheme is just one of many initiatives that have been launched in support of the Armed Forces.

The scheme encourages people to show their support by offering a tangible and meaningful way to express gratitude for their sacrifices.  Overall, the Premier League clubs' support for the Tickets for Troops initiative has been welcomed by military personnel and football fans alike.
