article: By . Paul Bentley . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is among five shadow cabinet members who feature on the list of MPs vulnerable to voters in private rented accommodation . Ed Balls was yesterday named on a hit list of MPs warned they face losing their seats in parliament if they neglect private home renters. Research suggests the nine million Britons forced to rent because they cannot afford to buy a home will have a crucial sway at next year's general election. Campaigners have now identified 86 MPs who stand to lose if they alienate 'Generation Rent' and fail to crack down on high rents, poor conditions and abuses by landlords and estate agents. More than half of the politicians listed are Tories or Lib Dems - suggesting the issue could directly impact the coalition's ability to hold on to power. The most senior MPs under threat individually, however, are from the Labour Party. Shadow chancellor Mr Balls is among five shadow cabinet members who feature on the list. Also at risk are Mary Creagh, Chuka Umunna, Sadiq Khan and Gloria de Piero. The study, produced by ComRes for the campaigning organisation Generation Rent, found 35 per cent of the nine million people in the private rented sector describe themselves as floating voters, who could sway at the next election. Mr Balls, MP for Morley and Outwood, holds a majority of just 1,101. Some 5,222 voters in his constituency rent their homes privately and the research suggests almost 2,000 of them could switch their vote as the undecided 35 per cent. Ms De Piero, Labour MP for Ashfield and shadow minister for women and equality, is particularly at risk with a vote margin of just 192 and more than 5,000 private renters in her constituency. According to the ComRes poll, 46 per cent of those in privately rented homes said they would currently support Labour based on its policies and 23 per cent would vote Conservative. One in ten who voted Tory at the 2010 General Election said they would now vote Labour. The study found 35 per cent of the nine million people in the private rented sector describe themselves as floating voters . Researchers found 12 per cent would vote Liberal Democrat and 11 per cent would vote for the UK Independence Party. Alex Hilton, from Generation Rent, said: 'After years of being ignored by Westminster, Britain's private renters will decide whether MPs will keep their jobs. 'The election won't be about Mondeo Man, Worcester Woman or Basildon Man. Anyone who wants to move into Downing Street in 2015 needs to win over Generation Rent.' Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'We are taking action against the small minority of rogue landlords and letting agents, but avoiding excessive red tape, which would force up rents and reduce choice for tenants.'

chatgpt: In a recent report by housing charity Shelter, it has been highlighted that as many as 86 Members of Parliament could face being ousted from their positions if they fail to tackle the issues of high rents and landlord abuses. The report states that these MPs represent constituencies where private renters make up a significant portion of their electorate and that these voters are becoming increasingly disillusioned with their current living situations. The report is particularly worrying for the coalition government, as half of the MPs identified as at risk are from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties. This could potentially weaken the government's power base and lead to a loss of their already slim majority in parliament. According to the report, over 35% of private renters are currently undecided voters, who have voiced their frustration with the lack of action on the housing crisis. With the general election looming, these voters could play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the election. Many private renters are struggling with the ever-increasing cost of rent, with some being forced to spend up to 50% of their pay on housing costs alone. This leaves them with little disposable income to cover other essential expenses, such as food and bills. Furthermore, the report highlights the issue of landlord abuses, which are rampant in the private renting sector. These range from landlords failing to carry out repairs or maintenance work, to illegally evicting tenants. The lack of regulation in this sector has only exacerbated the issue, leaving renters feeling helpless and at the mercy of their landlords. One of the proposed solutions put forward by the report is the introduction of rent controls, which would limit the amount that landlords could charge for rent. This would help to ease the financial burden on renters and prevent them from being priced out of their own homes. Other measures suggested include improving the quality of rented accommodation and increasing the power of local authorities to regulate the sector. This would help to prevent landlords from exploiting their tenants and ensure that renters have access to decent, safe and affordable housing. The government has been criticised for their lack of action on the housing crisis, with many accusing them of prioritising the interests of landlords and property developers over those of renters. With the election just around the corner, it remains to be seen whether the government will take concrete steps to tackle the housing crisis and protect the rights of private renters. In conclusion, the report by Shelter highlights the urgent need for action to be taken to address the issues facing private renters. With a significant number of MPs at risk of losing their positions in parliament, it is clear that these issues are a high priority for many voters. It is time for the government to listen to the concerns of private renters and take decisive action to ensure that everyone has access to safe, decent and affordable housing.
