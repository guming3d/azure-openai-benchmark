article: By . Sara Malm . The Norwegian ‘Slow-TV’ movement has been a surprising success in its home country, and the concept is now being taken across the pond. Norway has developed an international reputation for its series of 'Slow-TV' programmes, including a live-broadcast of a seven-hour train journey and the creation of a sweater, from sheep to knitted garment. Los Angeles-based production company LMNO Productions, has bought the U.S. rights to the concept and is set to start making ‘ambiance shows’ for the American audience this year. The Scandinavian way: A U.S. production company has bought the rights to Norwegian 'Slow TV' which has seen shows such as a seven-hour broadcast of a train journey from Oslo to Bergen (pictured), knitting TV and a live feed from a bird house . LMNO Productions, which also makes TLC's The Little Couple', are hoping to adapt the concept to reflect American past-times such as wildlife observing and cross-country travel, and hope to be premiering their first shows as early as this summer. ‘It doesn’t compete for your attention,' Lori Rothschild Ansaldi of LMNO said. 'In a world where we have this many channels and every channel has a docu-soap about some outrageous personality who lives unapologetically and sort of yells at us, as television viewers... This was just the opposite. 'This one allows you to watch and just sit back and relax. Not in a boring way but in a really "that’s different" sort of way. It allows you to breathe.’ The Norwegian ‘Slow TV’ was born on state broadcaster NRK in 2009 with centenary of the Bergen railway line. Americanized 'Slow TV': LMNO Productions will now attempt to make their own versions of success concepts such as the 134-hours journey of a Norwegian ship . Well pitched: Norwegian reality TV show Piipshow sees birds hang out in their coffee shop-themed bird feeder . Rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line, NRK instead decided to stick a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven-hour trip from Oslo to Bergen, interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme. Remarkably, it was a roaring success, with 1.2 million viewers, nearly a quarter of the population of Norway, tuning in for at least part of the trip. Since then, the network has broadcast a cruise journey, a fire being slowly built and burned, and more recently, the knitting of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came. Earlier this month, the tax-funded channel began the online broadcast of Piipshow, a live stream of birds and squirrels hanging out in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop. The show is due to air until June 2014, with the best action usually taking place during daylight hours. Fans can watch live via NRK's website.

chatgpt: The concept of 'Slow TV' has had a significant impact on television viewership in Norway and is now set to arrive in the United States. For those who may not know, 'Slow TV' is a format popularized by Norwegian broadcaster NRK, which features long, uninterrupted and unedited broadcasts of everyday activities. The 'Slow TV' shows include live-streams of train journeys, knitting, fishing, and more. While it may sound strange to some, the format has become extremely popular in Norway, with some shows attracting up to 2 million viewers - nearly 40% of the country's population. Now, an American production company, LMNO, has bought the rights to bring the format to the US. LMNO is known for producing shows such as 'The Little Couple' and 'The Secret Life of Kids.' The company has bought the rights to remake four of Norway's most popular 'Slow TV' shows for American audiences. While it's unclear what the exact shows will feature, it's likely they will follow a similar format to some of the Norwegian shows. The idea behind 'Slow TV' is to give viewers a break from traditional broadcast television, which is often filled with quick cuts and jarring advertisements. Instead, viewers can relax and watch everyday activities for hours on end, often accompanied by calming music, narration, or just the natural sounds of the activities on-screen. While some may find the idea of 'Slow TV' boring, others appreciate the unique experience it provides. For some, it's a way to unwind and de-stress after a long day, while others find it to be a form of meditation or mindfulness. Some even describe it as a way to travel without leaving home, as shows such as the train journeys often showcase Norwegian landscapes and scenery. The arrival of 'Slow TV' in the US is notable, as it represents a departure from the traditional, fast-paced nature of American broadcasting. While 'Slow TV' has existed in other countries, such as Austria and Australia, the format has yet to gain a foothold in the US. However, with LMNO's acquisition of the format, that could soon change. The 'Slow TV' format is not without its challenges, however. The lack of cuts and edits means that even minor mistakes or mishaps can be magnified on-screen, which could deter some potential viewers. Additionally, the lengthy run-times of 'Slow TV' shows mean that advertisers may be wary of purchasing ad time, which could have an impact on revenue. Overall, the arrival of 'Slow TV' in the US is an interesting development in the world of television. While the format may not be for everyone, it represents a departure from traditional broadcast television and offers a unique viewing experience. With LMNO's acquisition of the rights, it will be interesting to see how the format is adapted for American audiences and whether it catches on in the same way it has in Norway.
