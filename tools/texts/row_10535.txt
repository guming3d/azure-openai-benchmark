chatgpt: A 72-year-old grandfather from China has become an unlikely fashion model sensation after his granddaughter invited him to model for her online clothing store. Liu Qianping has set social media ablaze with his inspirational story and eye-catching photos showcasing his unique style. The octogenarian from the central province of Hunan has become a fashion icon in China's fashion world and beyond, thanks to his daring fashion choices. Liu, now known as "grandpa fashion icon," has become a fixture on China's own eBay-style shopping sites, modeling women's clothes, including flowy blouses, tights, and skirts. Liu's journey began after his granddaughter, Ms. Lv, asked him to help out with her online women's fashion business. Initially reluctant, Liu gave it a go and tried on one of his granddaughter's hot pink cloaks. Wearing a bright pink cloak, tights, sunglasses and a casual handbag slung over his shoulder, the grey-bearded Liu now appears in advertisements for Yuekou, his granddaughter's online store. His unconventional looks and fearless attitude towards fashion have gone viral, with photos of him modeling the latest trends posted everywhere online. He has more than 900,000 followers on China's Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like platform. "I never dreamed of being famous. I only wanted to find something to do to keep me busy after my wife died," Liu said in a recent interview. "I'm wearing women's clothes, but I'm not trying to be a woman. I'm just wearing the clothes. The clothes have no gender label." Liu's granddaughter, Lv, is ecstatic that her grandfather has become an internet sensation. She describes him as kind-hearted and youthful, and says that he was initially hesitant to model the clothes she had chosen for him. "I came up with the idea of him putting on women's clothing as a gimmick," she said. "Then, one day, he put on a piece of clothing and started walking, and I couldn't believe it, he was so full of life." And the public has similarly been taken with Liu. His photoshoots have gone viral, and social media users have praised the grandfather for his willingness to break gender norms and for proving that true style knows no age limits. "Who said older people can't have fashion or wear colorful clothing? Grandpa, you are really cool," praised one Weibo user. This newfound fame has taken Liu by surprise, but he says he is delighted to bring happiness to others around the world. "I'm happy to bring joy to so many people," he said. It's clear that Liu's unique style and positive attitude have won him a loyal fan base. As he continues to model and inspire, Liu has proven that age is just a number and that fashion truly can be for anyone.
