article: (CNN) -- The father of three missing Michigan boys has no "established relationship" with a mystery woman that he claimed he left his sons with before unsuccessfully trying to commit suicide, a police chief investigating the boys' disappearance said Monday. John Skelton, the father, told police that he dropped the boys off Friday morning with a woman he identified as Joann Taylor, in part to ensure that they did not witness his suicide. Authorities said Skelton's suicide attempt was not successful, and he is being held at a mental health facility. "There is no established relationship between he and the person that he described to us as Joann Taylor," Chief of Morenci Police, Larry Weeks, told reporters. The police chief asked for the public's help with information regarding Skelton's blue 2000 Dodge Caravan, later discovered by police, that was believed to be carrying the boys between 2:30 p.m. Thursday to 1:30 p.m. Friday. Skelton told police that Taylor was supposed to take the boys to the boy's home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, Ohio, around 3 p.m. Friday. But the boys -- 5-year-old Tanner Skelton, 7-year-old Alexander William Skelton and 9-year-old Andrew Skelton -- never arrived and police aren't sure whether John Skelton's story is true. They say they don't know whether Taylor is real. "We remain hopeful," Weeks said Monday. "That's why we're doing what we're doing, and hope to bring these boys home." Authorities issued an Amber Alert on Friday. The last nonfamily member saw the boys at 5 p.m. on Thursday, according to the chief. The alert notes that Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, has strawberry blond hair, blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The oldest brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds. Kathye Herrera, a family spokeswoman, spoke to reporters Sunday, thanking neighbors who have searched for the boys and prayed for their safe return. "We've got three great little boys out there, and we're going to get them back," she said. Authorities asked the public Sunday for help in locating three young boys missing for several days. "We need calls. We need tips. Anything that's out there, no matter how incredible you may think it is, call. Let us know," said Andy Arena, a special agent with the FBI.

chatgpt: Michigan State Police have confirmed that John Skelton, the father of three missing boys, has no known relationship with the woman he claimed he left his sons with before attempting suicide. The mystery woman's existence remains unverified at this time. Tanner, Alexander, and Andrew Skelton have been missing since Thanksgiving Day, and their father's claims have left authorities searching for answers. In the days following the boys' disappearance, John Skelton was found alive in a Toledo hospital after an attempted suicide. He told investigators that he dropped his children off with a woman who he had been in contact with over the internet. However, police have found no evidence to suggest that this woman is real or that John Skelton had any prior relationship with her. Michigan State Police First Lt. Dave Kaiser said, "We've searched electronic devices and residence, and we're making extensive efforts to try to locate this woman, but thus far, we've been unsuccessful." The lack of information regarding the alleged woman has stalled the investigation into the boys' whereabouts. However, Lt. Kaiser assured the public that authorities are continuing to search for any leads. "We are going to investigate every lead and every tip that comes in to search for those boys," he said. The community of Morenci, where the Skelton family resided, has rallied together in the search for Tanner, Alexander, and Andrew. Volunteers have combed the streets, parks, and surrounding areas in the hopes of finding any clues to their disappearance. A candlelight vigil was also held in honor of the boys, with friends and neighbors coming together to pray for their safe return. The Skelton family has a history of turmoil. John Skelton has reportedly been in a long-standing custody battle with his ex-wife, Tanya Skelton, who currently resides in Florida. The children were visiting John for the Thanksgiving holiday. The disappearance of Tanner, Alexander, and Andrew has rocked the small town of Morenci and left a sense of unease in its wake. Many are hoping for a Christmas miracle, and the safe return of the boys. However, police are urging caution and asking anyone with information to come forward. "Our goal is to bring those boys home safely," Lt. Kaiser said. "And we're going to do everything in our power to make that happen." As the search continues, the community is banding together in support of the Skelton family and praying for the return of Tanner, Alexander, and Andrew.
