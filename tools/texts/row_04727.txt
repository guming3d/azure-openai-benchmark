article: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An attack in which the Taliban claimed to have infiltrated key government sites in downtown Kabul killed at least five people Monday morning, hospital and government officials said. Among the five were two policemen and one national security staff member, Interior Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar said at a news conference. Seventy-one others were injured, 36 of whom were police or security officers, he said. His report of the death toll conflicts with those of Defense Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi, who said 13 died, and the Taliban, which claimed even more were slain. Seven attackers' bodies were recovered, with two or three of them burned beyond recognition, Azimi said. The Taliban said only five were killed. Four explosions and gunfire shook downtown Kabul about 9:15 a.m. Monday, with the Taliban saying it was conducting a militant operation. The attack started as 14 members of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's Cabinet were to be sworn in, said Parliament member Fawzia Koofi. About 20 Taliban insurgents entered the presidential palace; the ministries of Finance, Mines and Justice; and the Serena Hotel, said spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. NATO-led forces said "several small explosions" and gunfire were reported near the Feroshgah e Afghan Shopping Center and the Serena Hotel, and later added that "numerous" suicide bombers had attacked government buildings close to the presidential palace and the Ministry of Justice. Atmar said that the coordinated attacks struck the city over a span of two hours and 45 minutes and that they targeted civilians. And the threat continued at 1 p.m., when three attackers took over Bayman Hotel, Atmar said. More than two hours later, Afghan security forces killed the men, he said. At least two insurgents were killed at the shopping center, NATO-led forces said in a news release, which also said that Afghan national police had secured all roads in the area. A separate news release condemned the attack, which NATO-led forces said took place amid many civilians. Atmar, the Minister of Defense and chief of the National Security Department also condemned the violence. The Taliban claimed that they killed 31 officials and injured 31 people. Their account could not be immediately independently verified. The terrorist group also disputed the government on the number of its militants killed. Five militants had died and 13 had returned to their safe houses, the Taliban's Mujahid said, adding that two were still fighting. But Zmaray Bashari, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said security forces had restored Kabul to normalcy by Monday afternoon. Monday's assault followed weekend violence that killed at least three international troops and 14 militants in Afghanistan, authorities said. CNN's Dan Rivers and Atia Abawi contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a violent attack on a shopping center in Kabul, five innocent people lost their lives, while two insurgents were killed by NATO-led forces. The attack occurred shortly after reports emerged that Taliban insurgents had gained entry into multiple buildings, including the presidential palace and ministry buildings. According to government officials, the insurgents entered the buildings as Karzai Cabinet members were preparing to be sworn in. The attack occurred despite heightened security measures put in place in anticipation of the ceremony. Eyewitnesses at the shopping center reported hearing gunshots and seeing people running in panic. The attackers reportedly opened fire on shoppers and passers-by, leading to the tragedy of five lives lost. Security forces were quick to respond to the scene and exchanged gunfire with the perpetrators. Meanwhile, the Taliban insurgents breached the high-security perimeter of the presidential palace and multiple other government buildings. The attack is widely viewed as an attempt to destabilize the government and create chaos in the capital city. Despite these attacks, Afghan officials have emphasized their commitment to the democratic process and the rule of law. Speaking to reporters, a Parliament member expressed his condolences for the victims and vowed to move forward with the swearing-in ceremony for Cabinet members. The Taliban, for their part, have claimed responsibility for the attacks, calling them acts of "jihad" against the "corrupt" Afghan government. They have also accused the U.S.-led coalition forces of supporting the Afghan government and vowed to continue their efforts to destabilize the country. The attacks have once again highlighted the fragile security situation in Afghanistan, which has been plagued by ongoing violence and instability since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Despite the presence of thousands of U.S. and NATO troops, the country remains a hotbed of insurgent activity, with the Taliban continuing to control significant portions of the countryside. As Afghan officials work to investigate the attacks and improve security measures, the international community has pledged its support for the country's ongoing efforts to build a stable and prosperous future. While progress has been slow and at times uncertain, the hope remains that Afghanistan will one day emerge from the shadow of violence and achieve lasting peace.
