These days, however, it appears the Osmonds has become two acts rather than one. While Donny and his sister Marie enjoy a run of sell-out shows in Las Vegas, the rest of their siblings were performing in this country – at Butlins in Bognor Regis. The Osmonds, who had a string of number one hits in the early 70s, performed at a nostalgia weekend at Butlins in Bognor . Merrill, 60, Jimmy, 50, and Jay, 58, played two lunchtime shows at the holiday camp. Missing, along with Donny and Marie, were the brothers’ bell-bottoms and, not surprisingly, much of their youthful glamour. They sang to a room full of merry middle-aged women fans who sang along to the hit Crazy Horses and screamed as the trio attempted some of their old dance routines. Many fans had travelled from all over Britain to West Sussex to see the brothers. Watching them for the seventh time, Belinda McLacklan, 52, from Kent, said: ‘We used to bunk off school to try to catch a glimpse of them.’ Dressed in Osmonds memorabilia, Sarah Best, 61, said she felt embarrassed for the group. She added: ‘I remember them wearing bell bottoms but now they look like a bunch of politicians with instruments.’ Take it from the top: Wayne Osmond, Jay Osmond, Merrill Osmond, Alan Osmond, Donny Osmond and Jimmy Osmond . The three-night Seventies event at Butlins cost £80 per night and featured passes to themed events, including the Osmonds’ American Jukebox. As the show ended Jimmy told the fans: ‘We have been all over the world but Butlins you have been one of the best.’ In Vegas, fans have been paying up to £100 for Donny, 55,  and 53-year-old Marie’s shows at the Flamingo Club. The Osmonds, a Mormon family from Utah, began as a barbershop quartet in the late 1950s with Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay. They were joined by Donny and Jimmy and in the 1970s. Marie began her solo career in 1973.
