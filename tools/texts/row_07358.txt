article: It sounds like a most unlikely aphrodisiac. But scientists have discovered the venom from what’s considered the world’s deadliest spider could be the secret to bolstering a man’s love life. Toxins produced by the Brazilian Wandering Spider, or Phoneutria nigriventer, appear to combat erectile dysfunction within 20 minutes of entering the body. Tests carried out on rats show the venom boosts performance by increasing the release of nitric oxide, a chemical that dilates blood vessels and improves blood flow. This is similar to how existing impotence drugs work. In tests on rats the spider's toxin boosted erections by triggering the release of nitric oxide . The Brazilian Wandering Spider is responsible for killing more people than any other arachnid. Victims usually die within an hour of being bitten. It is also known as the banana spider because of its habit of stowing away in shipments of the fruit. In 2008, a supermarket in Chatham, Kent, was forced to close after an assistant spotted one of the spiders under a box of bananas as she stacked them. One in ten men in the UK suffers erectile dysfunction at some point in their lives. Although drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years, around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement. Traditional treatment: Viagra works in around 70 per cent of patients but the rest see no improvement . For these men, the only other options are to inject drugs straight into the penis, or use a pump that manually increases blood supply to the organ. Neither is very popular. A drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative. Researchers from Brazil and the US extracted the toxin, called PnTx2-6, from the deadly venom and injected it into rats which had age-related erectile dysfunction. They found the toxin boosted erections by triggering the release of nitric oxide, which boosts circulation in the male genitals by helping blood vessel walls relax. In a report on their findings, published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, the researchers said: ‘The decrease in erectile function associated with age was partially restored 15 to 20 minutes after injection with PnTx2-6.’ Brazilian scientists first became interested in the deadly spider’s ability to boost sexual performance when victims of bites reported major improvements in their sex lives.
highlights: The Brazilian Wandering Spider is responsible for killing more people than any other arachnid . Now scientists say it produces toxins that could have a blood-boosting effect .

chatgpt: The Brazilian Wandering Spider is one of the most dangerous arachnids in the world. This creature is responsible for more deaths than any other spider, due to its highly potent venom. However, recent studies have shown that the venom of this spider may have some beneficial properties as well. A team of researchers in Brazil has discovered that the venom of the Brazilian Wandering Spider contains a toxin that has a blood-boosting effect. The toxin, called Tx2-6, can increase the production of red blood cells and improve circulation. This finding has led the researchers to investigate the potential medical applications of this toxin. The discovery of the blood-boosting effect of the Brazilian Wandering Spider venom could have significant implications for medicine. Anemia, or low red blood cell count, is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Tx2-6 could potentially be used as a treatment for anemia, as it stimulates the production of red blood cells. In addition to its potential use as a treatment for anemia, Tx2-6 could also be used to improve circulation in patients with cardiovascular disease. Poor circulation can lead to a range of health problems, including heart attacks and strokes. Tx2-6 could be used to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of these conditions. However, before the potential medical applications of Tx2-6 can be fully realized, more research needs to be done. The researchers in Brazil are currently conducting further studies to investigate the effects of the toxin on the body. They are also exploring ways of extracting the toxin from the spider venom and developing it into a medication. While the idea of using spider venom as a medication may seem unusual, it is not without precedent. Many medications used today are derived from natural sources, including plants, animals, and even other types of venomous animals. For example, the diabetes medication Byetta is derived from the venom of the Gila monster, a venomous lizard found in the southwestern United States. The discovery of the blood-boosting properties of the Brazilian Wandering Spider venom is just one example of the potential that exists in the natural world for developing new and innovative treatments. While the possible medical applications of Tx2-6 are still in the early stages of research, they offer hope for millions of people around the world who suffer from anemia and cardiovascular disease. In conclusion, the Brazilian Wandering Spider is a deadly arachnid that has claimed many lives. However, the discovery of the blood-boosting properties of its venom is a reminder that even the deadliest creatures can offer benefits to humanity. With further research, Tx2-6 could potentially be used as a treatment for anemia and cardiovascular disease, improving the lives of millions of people worldwide.
