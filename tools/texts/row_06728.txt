These new ice cubes will not water down or change the taste of a drink - because they are made from stainless steel. The inert metal cubes will suit connoisseurs who prefer their liqueur on the rocks but cannot stand their drinks being watered down by ice. The stainless steel cubes, known as a 'Puc', also let the drinker more accurately control the temperature as they become colder the more are added. The stainless steel cubes are designed to cool drinks without watering them down like ice cubes . The stainless steel is inert meaning it will not add anything to the drinks or change the taste . Designer Dave Laituri, 51, from Wayland, Massachusetts, said he was inspired by the former trend of using cold ball bearings to 'ice' drinks. He said: 'Early in my design career, I heard a . story that famous designer Raymond Loewy used to drink scotch with . chilled with ball bearings. 'He was quite the classy guy and I've . heard of other famous people from that era using ball bearings to chill . their drink of choice. 'By using ball bearings, it doesn't . dilute the drink with excess water, and that image has always stuck with . me for some reason.' However, he changed the shape because he said the balls would move around too much as the drinker sipped. He said: 'The ball bearings were too mobile and would often take a leap for freedom and roll across the floor when given the chance. 'But with the marshmallow-like "puck" shape, they tend to stay put, live at the bottom of the glass for the . duration of the drink and are easier to manage. The designer was inspired by a trend in the early 20th century to cool drinks with ball bearings . 'They are a classy, non-diluting alternative to ice.' Each Puc weighs 70 grams and are 25mmm by 19mm. Stainless steel is 100 per cent inert and therefore will not absorb anything around it and will not add or subtract from the drink. The size of the Pucs has been chosen to allow the customer to add them to suit their liking. Mr Laituri, who set up the company with his son Calvin, said it is up to people to choose how cold they have their drinks when using the cubes. He continued: 'If people want their drink cooler faster, they can simply add another Puc, and after, they can rinse them off and put them back in the freezer. 'Pucs not only chill room temperature drinks, but can also bring blazing hot coffee to a more manageable drinkable temperature for those on the go.'

chatgpt: Designer Dave Laituri has created a revolutionary way to cool down drinks without diluting them. His invention, a set of metal pucks, is inspired by the trend of using ball bearings instead of ice. The stainless steel pucks can be inserted into any drink without adding any unwanted flavor or odor. This innovative solution to the age-old problem of melting ice cubes in drinks is a game-changer for those who want to savor the taste of their beverage without any dilution. Unlike traditional ice cubes, the metal pucks provide a consistent and reliable cooling effect, thanks to their high thermal conductivity. According to Laituri, the inspiration for the metal pucks came from the trend of using ball bearings as a substitute for ice cubes. He realized that ball bearings were not practical for drinks due to their small size and potential health hazards. Therefore, he decided to create a larger and safer alternative that could provide the same cooling effect but without any unwanted consequences. The stainless steel pucks are easy to use and are suitable for any drink, whether hot or cold. Simply place them in the freezer for a few hours and then add them to your drink whenever you wish. And the best part? The pucks won't water down your drink, eliminating the need for disposable straws or stirrers. Many people are excited about this invention as it solves a long-standing problem. One drink enthusiast said, "I love my drinks chilled, but I always hated how the ice cubes melt and dilute the drink. With these metal pucks, I can finally enjoy my drink as it was meant to be." Moreover, the metal pucks are environmentally friendly, reducing the use of single-use plastics and helping to reduce waste. Because they are reusable, they are a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional ice cubes. Dave Laituri's metal pucks are gaining popularity among people who love their drinks but hate dilution. This innovative product has already received positive feedback from early adopters who appreciate its convenience, sustainability, and style. The pucks are not only practical but also elegant, adding a touch of sophistication to any drink. In conclusion, the metal pucks are a game-changing invention that is here to stay. They offer a practical and sustainable solution to the problem of diluting drinks with melting ice cubes. So, if you want to keep your drink chilled without sacrificing taste, try out these metal pucks, and you won't be disappointed.
