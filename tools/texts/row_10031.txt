Your family's weekend trip to see The Great Gatsby, with all of it's depictions of boozy flapper parties, might be more costly than the already pricey tickets. A new study published this week inÂ JAMA Pediatrics found that exposure to alcohol in PG-13 and lower films is on the rise, and it may lead to a rise in underage drinking. The study tracked appearances of both cigarettes and alcohol on TV and in the movies and found some surprising results. Down with tobacco: A graph from the study shows that instances of smoking in movies hit a high in 1999, and them completely plummeted by 2006 since tobacco companies were banned from product placement . In 1998, the state attorney generals signed the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) which banned tobacco brands from paying for product placement on TV and in films. What happened next was extraordinary. The Dartmouth study tracked the top 100 grossing movies each year and found that tobacco brand appearances went from an all time high of near 100 in 1999 to the rock bottom of about 20 in 2006. From there it plateaued, reflecting a changed American view on tobacco use. TV vices: The characters on Mad Men are known for their indulgent boozing and smoking, but overall tobacco depictions on TV and in movies has decreased dramatically since 1999 . But the study also focused on alcohol depictions, and in that department found quite a different story. Because there never was a MSA-equivalent agreement on alcohol product placement in the media (and likely won't be due to First Amendment challenges), overall depictions of alcohol have stayed the same. What is most troubling though is the number of appearances in youth-rated films. For films rated PG-13 and lower, alcohol appearances are actually on the rise. Starting young: Heavy drinking portrayed in PG-13 movies such as The Great Gatsby is the most troubling aspect of the study, since there is a correlation between adolescents seeing alcohol in the media and wanting to drink in real life . This isn't good news, since several studies suggest that, like cigarettes, there is a link between media portrayals of drinking and adolescents subsequently drinking. A rise in underage drinking could mean more drinking-related accidents and even deaths. When states took a hard line on tobacco advertising with the MSA, it correlated with U.S. teen smoking hitting a record low last year. Adult smoking is also on a steady decline. The authors of the study however, don't believe a similar agreement will happen with alcohol companies. Instead, they advocate self-regulation.

chatgpt: Smoking in movies has declined significantly over the years, thanks to a landmark agreement that banned tobacco companies from product placement. A study by the University of California, San Francisco has found that the number of smoking scenes in top-grossing films decreased from nearly 100 in 1999 to around 20 in 2006.  The tobacco industry has long been associated with Hollywood, and for decades smoking was a common element of many films. However, the Master Settlement Agreement, reached in 1998 between the four largest tobacco companies in America and 46 states, put an end to this practice.  The agreement, which was the result of a series of lawsuits by the states against tobacco companies for the health costs associated with smoking, banned tobacco product placement in movies, television shows, and music videos. The agreement also required the tobacco companies to pay billions of dollars to the states over a period of 25 years. The decline in smoking scenes in movies has been welcomed by public health advocates, who have long argued that on-screen smoking influences young people to start smoking. Studies have shown that adolescents who are heavy consumers of movies with smoking scenes are more likely to try smoking themselves. However, the study by the University of California, San Francisco, also found that appearances of drinking in PG-13 and under films are on the rise. This trend is worrying, as there is a correlation between adolescents seeing alcohol on TV or in films, and wanting to partake in drinking themselves.  Alcohol is the most commonly used substance among young people in America, and underage drinking is a major public health concern. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, underage drinking is responsible for more than 4,300 deaths per year, and costs the US economy billions of dollars in healthcare, criminal justice, and lost productivity. The rise in on-screen drinking scenes is a concerning trend, as it may lead to an increase in underage drinking. Hollywood has a responsibility to ensure that its films do not feature excessive drinking that could influence young people. While it is important to depict the reality of alcohol use in films, filmmakers must also be mindful of the impact their work may have on young audiences. To address this issue, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has introduced new guidelines to help filmmakers portray drinking responsibly. The guidelines recommend that filmmakers depict the negative consequences of excessive drinking, and avoid glamorizing alcohol use.  It is important for Hollywood to understand the influence its movies can have on young people, and to take steps to ensure that its films do not glamorize unhealthy behaviors. While the decline in smoking scenes in movies is a positive development, the rise in on-screen drinking is a cause for concern. By following the MPAA guidelines, filmmakers can help to promote responsible drinking and reduce the risks associated with underage drinking.
