chatgpt: Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand and current Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero have teamed up for a promotional tour with SingTel in Asia. Ferdinand, who recently announced his departure from Manchester United after 12 years at the club, and Aguero, who has been touring with Manchester City in Abu Dhabi, have been visiting various countries in Southeast Asia as part of their promotional tour with Singaporean telecommunication company SingTel. The two footballers made an appearance in Singapore last weekend, where they met with fans and media. They also attended a SingTel event, which aimed to promote the company’s football offerings. According to reports, Ferdinand and Aguero were both thrilled to be part of the tour and were impressed with the turnout of fans who greeted them in Singapore. Both players expressed their gratitude towards the SingTel team and the fans for their warm welcome. Ferdinand, who played for Manchester United from 2002 to 2014, was one of the most successful defenders in the club's history. He won six Premier League titles, two League Cups, one Champions League and one Club World Cup during his time at Old Trafford. He announced his departure from the club earlier this month, saying that he felt it was the right time to move on and pursue other opportunities. Aguero, on the other hand, has been a key player for Manchester City since joining the club in 2011. Known for his speed and agility on the pitch, the Argentine striker has helped his team win four Premier League titles, one FA Cup and one League Cup during his time at the Etihad Stadium. However, his participation in the promotional tour with SingTel means that he will miss Manchester City's friendly match against Al Ain in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Aguero is expected to rejoin his team for their next Premier League match against Everton on March 31. SingTel, who has been a long-time partner of the English Premier League, has been actively promoting the league in Asia through various initiatives. The company recently launched a new mobile app called "Watch Premier League on SingTel TV", which allows users to watch live matches and highlights on their mobile devices. Ferdinand and Aguero's promotional tour with SingTel is just one of the many ways the company is promoting football in the region. With the English Premier League being one of the most popular football leagues in Asia, SingTel's partnership with the league has been instrumental in helping the company reach out to a larger audience. Overall, Ferdinand and Aguero's appearance in Singapore has been a huge success, and their presence has further cemented the popularity of the English Premier League in Asia. The SingTel team has expressed their gratitude towards the two footballers for their contribution to the tour and hopes to work with them again in the future.
