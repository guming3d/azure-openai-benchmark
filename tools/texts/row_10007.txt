Tens of thousands of elderly patients could be sent to hotels to recover from illnesses under plans being considered by the Government to free up hospital beds. New mothers and stroke patients could also use such services, which would be run by private hotel chains and allow more flexible visiting hours. The model, based on a system widely used in Scandinavia, will be reviewed formally by NHS England, the body responsible for recommending how local doctors' groups should provide for their patients, at the request of health minister Earl Howe. Elderly patients could be sent to hotels to recover from illnesses under plans being considered by the Government . The 'patient hotels' would be built in the grounds of hospitals and would be staffed by nurses. Relatives would be able to stay in a nearby room, and patients would benefit from en-suite facilities, televisions and room service. Patients who would use such a service would be those who no longer require the specialist medical attention that a hospital provides but who need more support than can be given at home. This applies to many elderly people who may have suffered a fall, have dementia or are waiting for a place in a nursing home. An estimated 30,000 patients each year are kept in hospital despite being well enough to be discharged . An estimated 30,000 patients each year are kept in hospital despite being well enough to be discharged. The problem – known as bed-blocking – happens when support from social care or district nursing is not available in the community for vulnerable patients. According to government estimates, such a patient costs the NHS about £260 a day. Advocates of the plan say the cost of accommodating a patient in a hotel, even one staffed by trained carers and fitted with medical equipment, would be significantly lower. Lord Howe said he was studying the proposals because the care of older people in the community was an 'issue of vital importance to our society'. In a letter to Baroness Greengross, a crossbench peer who has investigated the issue, he said he was examining whether 'the Scandinavian model of hospital hotels' could provide care to the elderly in England. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Proposals for health hotels were submitted to the Department by Baroness Greengross. Ministers have forwarded the proposals to NHS England so they can review them.'

chatgpt: A system widely used in Scandinavia may soon benefit new mothers and stroke patients in other parts of the world. The model, based on remote health monitoring, has shown to be effective in improving health outcomes for those who use it. The system, known as "telehealth," allows healthcare professionals to monitor patients' health from a remote location through the use of technology such as videoconferencing, remote monitoring devices, and secure messaging systems. This means patients can access healthcare services from the comfort of their own homes without having to travel to clinics or hospitals. In Scandinavia, telehealth has been widely used for several years and has shown to be particularly effective for managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, researchers have now identified that the system could also have benefits for new mothers and stroke patients. New mothers often face a number of physical and mental health challenges after giving birth, and accessing healthcare services can be difficult due to the demands of caring for a newborn. Telehealth could make it easier for them to access care when they need it, without the added strain of travel and long waiting times. Similarly, stroke patients may face challenges with mobility and accessing healthcare services. Telehealth could make it easier for healthcare professionals to monitor their recovery and provide appropriate support and advice. The benefits of telehealth are not limited to patients. Healthcare professionals can also benefit from the system as it enables them to manage their workload more efficiently and provide more personalised care to their patients. In the United States, telehealth has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare services can be limited. The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated the adoption of telehealth as a way of providing healthcare services while maintaining social distancing measures. As the benefits of telehealth become increasingly apparent, more and more healthcare providers are likely to adopt the system. This could have significant implications for the future of healthcare, particularly in terms of improving access to care and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. However, there are still some challenges to be addressed in terms of ensuring that telehealth services are accessible to all, particularly those who may not have access to the necessary technology or who may have limited internet connectivity. Additionally, there are concerns around data privacy and security that need to be addressed before telehealth can be widely adopted. Overall, the potential benefits of telehealth are significant, and as the system continues to be refined and improved, it could play an increasingly important role in the future of healthcare. Whether it is used to manage chronic conditions, support new mothers, or help stroke patients on their road to recovery, telehealth has the potential to transform the way we access and deliver healthcare services.
