article: By . Hannah Roberts . Silvio Berlusconi’s fiancée has claimed that the billionaire politician is with her, not for her looks, but because she has cut wasteful spending at his home. Francesca Pascale, who first met Berlusconi as a teenage activist in his party, says that before her arrival, his staff were paying absurd sums for food that would never be eaten. The 28-year-old, who has been dating Berlusconi, 77, for two and a half years, told Italian gossip weekly Oggi: ‘They were paying 80 Euros a kg for beans. Can you believe it?’ Silvio Berlusconi and Francesca Pascale attend a Champions League match between AC Milan and Zenit St Petersburg in Milan last December . Garlic and onions were also in the house even though Silvio can’t stand he presence of them, raw or cooked, she said. ‘Crates of fish would arrive when everyone knows that the prime minister hates fish and won’t even tolerate the smell of it cooking.’ She added: ‘In short there was no woman in the house.’ The Neapolitan claimed Berlusconi, who has a personal fortune estimated at £4.75billion could be with someone much more glamorous than her, but likes her because she stops people taking advantage of his generosity. She said: ‘People always think why is Prime Minister Berlusconi with her and not with someone much more beautiful. 'Not all that': Francesca Pascale says Berlusconi could easily attract a more beautiful girlfriend . ‘Physically, I’m not all that. But I use my head, I say what I think, I sort the house out. He likes that.’ Miss Pascale first met Mr Berlusconi when she joined his Forza Italia party as a teenager but had to keep her feelings hidden because he was married. Even after his divorce she had to watch the 77-year-old media mogul become entangled with a succession of prostitutes, showgirls and actresses before finally convincing him to settle down. Eventually she got his attention by starting a fan club in Naples called ‘We miss you Silvio’ sending a plane with a banner with the club’s logo over his house every day for a week. In a recent interview he promised to make he an honest woman. But Miss Pascale said he is reluctant to set a date because of his experience in the divorce courts. Berlusconi pays £19million a year in alimony to his ex wife Veronica Lario. She said: ‘I kick him under the covers when we are in bed at night. ‘But he just says ‘no’, sometimes quite fiercely, because of the all the money he is paying his ex wife. ‘In which country a man is sentenced to pay €3million a month to his ex-wife and there is no public outcry?’

chatgpt: Francesca Pascale, a 28-year-old Italian actress, has recently announced her engagement to Silvio Berlusconi, one of the wealthiest men in Italy at the age of 77. While the relationship has raised eyebrows due to the significant age gap between the couple, Pascale claims that it is genuine and based on more than just money. Pascale has been a longtime supporter of Berlusconi, and the two have been dating for several years. She credits her relationship with the former Italian Prime Minister to her ability to organize his household and utilize her intelligence to help him navigate the business world. In a recent interview, Pascale explained that Berlusconi appreciates her because of her practical skills, stating: "He likes me because I sort out his house, keep him informed on what's going on, and use my brain to help him with various things."
