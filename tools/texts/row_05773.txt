The unidentified individual reportedly ran to a dark car parked out the front of Byrd's home and fled the scene after being attacked by Mamma. Commenting on his trusty pet, Byrd told The Blade: 'She met him right there at the door. She did her job.' Along with being a security guard, Mamma works as a service dog for Mr Byrd's 11-year-old daughter, Zahara, who has cerebral palsy. The youngster was apparently upstairs sleeping when the attempted break-in took place. She was joined by the daughter of one of Byrd's friends. He says Mamma is normally 'sweet' and 'playful' so she must have sensed something bad about the person at the door.
