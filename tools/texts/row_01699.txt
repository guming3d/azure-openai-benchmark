article: It's lucky most visitors to this week's Davos conference are billionaires - because Switzerland has been named the most expensive place in the world to buy a Big Mac. The famous burgers cost 6.50 Swiss francs in the Alpine country - that works out at more than £5 ($7.50) for the McDonald's sandwich alone. Norway has the second most expensive Big Mac in the world at £4.40($6.50), followed by Denmark, Brazil and the US, according to the so-called Big Mac index. Scroll down for video . A Big Mac in Switzerland now costs the equivalent of nearly $8 - around £5 in British money, it emerged today . The  index was created by The Economist magazine in 1986 as a way of comparing the relative values of different currencies. By comparing a product which is almost perfectly identical and on sale around the world, experts hoped to show the 'purchasing power' of each nation's money. The price of Big Macs is compared against the standard US price for the product - which is currently $4.79, about £3.19 in sterling. The relative price of the iconic burger in Britain - now £2.69 in sterling - has fallen compared to other currencies in recent months. Meanwhile in Russia - whose currency has plummeted amid a fall in the price of oil and sanctions over the annexation of Crimea - Big Macs are cheaper than ever. Consumers in Vladimir Putin's country can now pick one of the burgers for the equivalent of $1.36 - just 91p, which is cheaper than a basic McDonald's hamburger in the UK. A fall in the rouble means Russia is one of the  cheapest places to buy the burgers - which cost just 91p there . The prolonged crisis in the Eurozone means the relative cost of a Big Mac on the Continent has also fallen in recent months and is now worth $4.26, or £2.84. The index's latest results were released as business and political leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Switzerland's Big Mac price has risen in the last six months and looks set to increase further as the country's currency continues to boom. The Swiss franc rose nearly 30 per cent to 0.81 against the euro last week following the Swiss National Bank's decision to remove a three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs per euro. It means Swiss ski resorts are being forced to cut prices by up to 20 per cent in a desperate bid to lure back holidaymakers. The currency surge means a British visitor now has to pay £80 more for their week-long lift pass bringing the total to £380, while a single day pass went up to around £60. The cost of enjoying just a small glass of beer while taking in the majestic view of the Matterhorn mountain jumped by around £1.30 to £4.60. The Big Mac was chosen for the 'purchasing power' index because it is almost identical around the world (pictured: A McDonald's in Bangkok, Thailand)

chatgpt: The Big Mac index, a unique way in which economists measure the relative price of currencies around the world, has revealed that the Swiss franc remains the most expensive currency worldwide. According to the index, the iconic McDonald's burger now costs the equivalent of nearly $8 in Switzerland and £5 in sterling, making it the most expensive place in the world to buy a Big Mac. The index is known for using the price of the McDonald's burger to compare the purchasing power of currencies across the globe. The study is conducted annually and is based on the principle of purchasing power parity, which suggests that the same goods should cost the same amount in different countries. The Swiss franc's continued lead in the Big Mac index comes as no surprise. Switzerland has long been known for its high cost of living, with its citizens enjoying some of the highest wages in the world. The country is also known for its high taxes, which contribute to the higher prices of everyday goods and services, such as fast food. Following Switzerland in the index is Norway, where a Big Mac costs the equivalent of around $7.50, and Denmark, where the iconic burger costs just over $6. These figures illustrate the continued dominance of the Scandinavian countries in the indices, which have generally been known for their high cost of living. The Big Mac index, however, is not just a tool to measure currency values, it is also a reflection of global consumer trends. It highlights the popularity of fast food as a global phenomenon and the impact of the chains that dominate the fast food industry worldwide. The index also highlights the impact of external factors on currency values. For example, Switzerland's recent removal of the Euro cap has had a profound effect on the Swiss franc's value, with the currency soaring to new highs. This move, which was made in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, has also served to drive up the cost of living in Switzerland, further adding to the cost of a Big Mac for Swiss citizens. It is also interesting to note that the affordability of the Big Mac varies greatly across the globe, with countries such as South Africa and Russia boasting some of the lowest prices for the burger. In South Africa, a Big Mac costs the equivalent of just over $2, while in Russia, it is priced at just over $1.50. While the Big Mac index is not a perfect measure of economic principles, it remains a useful tool for economists and researchers alike. It helps to provide insight into global consumer trends and the purchasing power of different currencies, while also highlighting the impact of external factors on currency values. In conclusion, the Big Mac index serves as a fascinating insight into the global economy and consumer trends. While the Swiss franc remains the most expensive currency worldwide, the affordability of the iconic burger varies greatly across the globe, reflecting the economic differences between countries. The Big Mac index is a testament to the enduring popularity of fast food as a global phenomenon and an iconic symbol of the fast food industry.
