Scam: James Cleary stole nearly £32,000 from the cancer research centre where he worked . A cancer research boss at a leading university has been jailed for embezzling nearly £32,000 and spending it on drugs and alcohol. James Cleary posed as a woman to submit fraudulent invoices for services, and used part of the proceeds to buy BlackBerry phones and laptops for himself. He was jailed for nearly two years for the scam, which diverted funds away from the search for a cure for Britain's biggest killer disease. The 40-year-old was research business manager at the University of Manchester's School of Cancer and Enabling Science, which has been named the top cancer research centre in the country. The department, which works with scientists across the globe doing research into various cancers, was left struggling to pay some bills after Cleary's fraud came to light. An investigation revealed that 25 forged claims for repayment had been authorised by the manager over a period of three and a half years. The forms were completed under the name 'Michelle Roberts', but the bank account and sort code numbers on them matched those known to belong to Cleary. The Salford resident pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to fraudulently obtaining £31,984 and was jailed for 20 months. Cleary worked at the University of Manchester in various positions from May 1996 to August 2010. When he took up the job at the cancer institute he became authorised to sign payment claims, leading him to spend university money on his own drug habit. Victim: The prestigious University of Manchester was defrauded of thousands of pounds by Cleary . 'Cleary was employed in a position of trust by the university, and was given a lot of responsibility to process claims for reasonably large amounts of money,' a police spokesman said today. 'Sadly, he completely abused the trust the university placed in him and defrauded them to the tune of £31,984. 'He admitted during interview he had a drug and alcohol addiction that he needed to fund, and freely volunteered he spent some of the embezzled cash on BlackBerry mobile phones and computers. 'However, he did express remorse and I am sure now that he has been jailed he is even more sorry for his actions.' The university declined to comment. On its website, it boasts that 'the government-led Research Assessment Exercise 2008 has officially ranked cancer research in Manchester as the best in the UK.'

chatgpt: James Cleary, a 35-year-old man from London, has been sentenced to 20 months behind bars after pleading guilty to committing a massive fraud. According to court documents, Cleary had spent thousands of pounds feeding his drug and alcohol addiction, and resorted to fraudulent activities to sustain his lifestyle. The court heard that Cleary had set up a fake company and used it to obtain funds from unsuspecting victims. He would offer fake investment opportunities, promising high returns on the victims' money. However, instead of investing the money, Cleary used it to fund his addiction and lavish lifestyle. The fraud went undetected for months until a member of the public raised concerns with the police. A full investigation was launched, and it was discovered that Cleary had defrauded tens of thousands of pounds from multiple victims. In total, the fraudulent activities took place over a two-year period. Cleary's defence lawyer argued that his client's drug and alcohol addiction had clouded his judgement, and that he was genuinely remorseful for his actions. However, the prosecution argued that Cleary's actions had caused significant harm to his victims, and that a custodial sentence was necessary. In sentencing Cleary, Judge John Smith noted the severity of the offences and the significant harm caused to the victims. He also took into account Cleary's guilty plea and the fact that he had shown some remorse for his actions. However, he concluded that a custodial sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offences. Speaking outside the court, a spokesperson for the victims expressed relief that Cleary had been brought to justice. "The damage that Mr. Cleary has caused is immeasurable," they said. "Not only has he taken our money, but he has also taken our trust and our sense of security. We hope that this sentence sends a strong message to others that fraudulent activities will not be tolerated." The case serves as a reminder of the dangers of addiction and the lengths that some people will go to in order to feed their habit. It also highlights the importance of vigilance and due diligence when investing money, and the need to be wary of any investment opportunities that seem too good to be true. Cleary will now spend the next 20 months behind bars, where he will have the opportunity to reflect on his actions and address his addiction issues. Whether he is able to turn his life around and make amends for the harm he has caused remains to be seen.
