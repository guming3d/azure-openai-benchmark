A student lay dead and undiscovered in his bedroom for days when his housemates failed to realise he had killed himself. Vivek Ajit Shah, 22, had not been seen for three days by fellow students at Manchester Metropolitan University, but the alarm was only raised when he didn't arrive at a family gathering in London and his worried relatives asked a friend to go and check on him. 'Shocked' Alex Faulkner found the electronic engineering student - described as 'kind and geeky' by university friends - lying fully clothed on his bed at the shared house in Rusholme, next to a canister of helium gas. Mr Shah, who had suffered from anxiety and depression in the months leading up to his death, died from asphyxiation and helium inhalation, an inquest heard. A post-mortem was unable to determine exactly how long he had lain undiscovered. The student, who was originally from Middlesex, had become withdrawn and had failed to attend his final year exams in the period leading up to his death last June, the hearing was told. His teenage years had also been blighted by spells of anxiety and depression. Mr Faulkner, who had known Mr Shah for three years, said: 'When I opened the door Vivek was lying fully clothed on the bed and there was a gas canister on the floor. 'I was shocked, I thought he was probably dead but phoned an ambulance in case he was still alive.' Missing: The 22-year-old Manchester Metropolitan University student had not been seen for three days . Recording his verdict, coroner Nigel Meadows said Mr Shah had taken his own life. The causes of death were asphyxiation and helium inhalation, he said. Mr Meadows said: 'I believe he had continued to suffer with untreated depression and I am satisfied that he intended to kill himself. 'If Vivek had any idea of the heart ache and grief of those left behind I'm sure he may have thought again.'

chatgpt: Tragedy struck the family of Vivek Ajit Shah when the 22-year-old student was found dead after suffering from depression and anxiety. The inquest into his death revealed that he died from asphyxiation and helium inhalation, which was likely a result of his deteriorating mental health. According to reports, Vivek had been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time before his untimely death. His family had raised the alarm when he went missing and a search was launched to find him. Unfortunately, it was too late when he was finally discovered. The use of helium in suicide attempts is becoming increasingly common, particularly among young people who suffer from depression and anxiety. It is a quiet and painless method, which makes it an attractive option for those who are feeling overwhelmed by their mental health issues. However, it is also a dangerous one, as it can lead to asphyxiation if not done correctly. In light of Vivek's tragic death, the Samaritans have reminded everyone that they are available to offer confidential support. They encourage anyone who is struggling with their mental health to reach out and ask for help. They can be contacted on 08457 90 90 90 or visited in person at a local branch. Vivek's family has also spoken out about their experience, urging others to take mental health issues seriously and seek help when needed. They have expressed their devastation at the loss of their son and hope that his death will raise awareness about the importance of mental health support. "Our son was a bright and talented young man who had so much to live for," said Vivek's father. "We never imagined that he would take his own life. We hope that by sharing his story, we can help others who are struggling with their mental health and prevent further tragedies like ours." The tragic death of Vivek Ajit Shah serves as a reminder of the importance of mental health support and the devastating impact that mental health issues can have on young people. It is important that we all take the time to check in on our loved ones and to seek help if we are struggling with our own mental health. Together, we can work to prevent further tragedies and ensure that everyone has access to the support they need.
