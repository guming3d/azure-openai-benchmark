article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . A California woman who was arrested last year for allegedly disrupting a city council meeting by continuously clapping now says her constitutional rights were violated when she was taken into custody. Letitia Pepper, an attorney and longtime critic of the local government in Riverside, has filed a lawsuit in federal court over the June 25, 2013, incident. Pepper was handcuffed and removed from the city council meeting, but she was never actually charged with a crime. Disruptive: Letitia Pepper was taken into custody for being disruptive during a city council meeting last year . In February, a spokesman for the Riverside County District Attorney's Office said no charges would be filed against the woman 'based on a lack of sufficient evidence,' the Riverside Press Enterprise reports. Pepper's arrest came after she and other members of the audience during that particular meeting began applauding for speakers with whom they agreed. The town's mayor, William 'Rusty' Bailey warned the audience - and Pepper specifically - to not applaud for speakers because it could dissuade others with opposing views from speaking out. Pepper's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and named the city, Mayor Bailey, City Attorney Greg Priamos and police Chief Sergio Diaz as defendants. 'The city of Riverside seeks to provide an environment at City Council . meetings where free speech rights are respected and where everyone can . feel comfortable expressing their views,' Bailey wrote in statement delivered to the newspaper through a spokesman . The mayor added that rules of conduct during city meetings are meant to 'ensure that the business of the City can be . carried out efficiently and without unnecessary disruptions.' Applause: Pepper and others were continuously clapping for speakers after the mayor warned her not to . Pepper, who the local paper describes as an 'activist' who has run for both mayor and for a spot on the City Council, says that the clapping by her and others was done only as speakers were done speaking, and it in no way was disrupting anyone or keeping anyone from speaking out. On Thursday, Pepper said she felt she needed to sue 'because these guys are doing things that are illegal and they’re not . going to stop doing it. ...What happened to me was totally wrong.' Constitutional law expert and Dean of the University of California at Irvine Law School Erwin Chemerinsky  told the paper the city has the right to develop its own rules for its meetings. However, those rules can't violate the First Amendment to the Constitution. 'So long as the City Council ... can do its work, there’s no basis for stopping the expression,' Chemerinsky said.

chatgpt: A Riverside citizen named Letitia Pepper has filed a federal lawsuit against the city, its mayor, its city prosecutor and the police chief. Pepper claims that the defendants violated her First Amendment rights during a city council meeting that she attended last year. According to reports, Pepper was clapping during the meeting when she was taken into custody by the police for allegedly disrupting the session. However, no charges were ever filed against her. Pepper is described as an "activist" who has run for office in Riverside on multiple occasions. She was attending the city council meeting as a member of the public when the incident occurred. The federal lawsuit filed by Pepper claims that her arrest was a violation of her First Amendment right to freedom of speech. She alleges that the defendants intentionally interfered with her right to express herself by removing her from the meeting. Pepper's lawyer, Andrea Selby, stated that the charges against Pepper were unfounded and that the police acted unlawfully in taking her into custody. Selby claims that Pepper was exercising her right to express herself in a peaceful manner. The lawsuit further alleges that the city of Riverside has a pattern of suppressing free speech, citing previous incidents where individuals were prohibited from speaking at city council meetings. The defendants have not yet responded publicly to the lawsuit. However, the city has released a statement indicating that it will defend itself against the allegations. This is not the first time that Letitia Pepper has been involved in legal action. In 2019, she filed a lawsuit against the city of Riverside after being denied the opportunity to speak at a city council meeting. She claimed that the council had a policy of limiting public comment on certain issues, which violated her First Amendment rights. Pepper's lawsuit seeks damages for the violation of her rights, as well as a declaratory judgment stating that the city of Riverside and its officials violated the First Amendment. The case is now pending in federal court. The incident involving Letitia Pepper once again raises questions about the extent of free speech protections in public spaces. As cities and municipalities grapple with issues of public protest and demonstration, it remains to be seen how courts will interpret the First Amendment in these situations.
