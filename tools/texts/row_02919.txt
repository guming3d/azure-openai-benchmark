article: (CNN) -- A body found Tuesday in California is that of Brittany Killgore, the missing wife of a deployed Marine, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday. Killgore, 22, was last seen alive Friday night when she left her apartment wearing an evening dress, heading out on a date with 45-year-old Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Perez, investigators said. Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, Marine Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, who was serving with an artillery unit in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, they said. He left for the United States on emergency leave when he learned his wife was missing. Two people are in custody in connection with the case. One is Perez, who was questioned after a friend filed a missing persons report for Killgore, then later arrested on charges of possession of a stolen assault rifle. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Perez is being "actively investigated" in connection with Killgore's death. The other person in custody is Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, who was found at a Ramada motel near the San Diego airport Tuesday after paramedics responded to a call for medical help. Lopez was briefly hospitalized with lacerations, then jailed on suspicion of Killgore's murder. Her relationship to Killgore is still unclear. CNN affiliate KGTV in San Diego reported that authorities found Killgore's body based on leads stemming from Lopez's arrest. Investigators later found Killgore's body in a rural part of neighboring Riverside County. Authorities have not said how she died. Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, pleaded not guilty to a weapons and stolen property charge Wednesday. The judge set bail at $500,000. "We believe he knows more than what he initially told us," said Sheriff's Capt. Duncan Fraser. "We do not believe he is being cooperative with us." CNN's Casey Wian contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The San Diego community is in shock after 22-year-old Brittany Killgore went missing on Friday night. Two individuals have been arrested in connection with the case, but the search for Killgore remains ongoing. Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, a Marine who was deployed in Afghanistan at the time of her disappearance. The couple had been married for only a few months, and it appears that their relationship had quickly deteriorated. Killgore was last seen leaving her apartment in the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego. She had plans to attend a dinner cruise with another Marine and his wife, but it is unclear whether or not she arrived at the event. Her phone and other personal belongings were found in a nearby motel room, leading investigators to believe that she may have been abducted. The two suspects in custody have been identified as Jessica Lynn Lopez and Louis Ray Perez. Lopez was reportedly a friend of Killgore and had been seen with her earlier in the evening. Perez is a registered sex offender with a lengthy criminal record. According to authorities, he has not been cooperative with the investigation. The Sheriff's Department is seeking the public's help in locating Killgore, and a reward has been offered for any information leading to her safe return. Friends and family members are also pleading for anyone with information to come forward. Killgore's disappearance has left many in the San Diego community shaken. Her husband, who is still overseas, is said to be devastated. The search for answers and justice continues as investigators work tirelessly to bring Killgore home.
