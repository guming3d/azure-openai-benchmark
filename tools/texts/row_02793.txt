A care home for elderly people has been criticised by a government health watchdog because most of it staff spoke poor English - and for playing Bhangra music to residents. The owners of the Parkview Nursing and Residential Home in Bolton could face a financial penalty if they do not make improvements, inspectors for the Care Quality Commission (CQC) have warned. The caution comes following a surprise inspection carried out by the CQC, which uncovered a catalogue of failures. Penalty: The owners of the Parkview Nursing and Residential Home in Bolton could face a fine if they do not make improvements . Bhangra music - Punjabi pop often featured in Bollywood films - was played in one residentâ€™s room and, then later, an Asian language radio station - despite their first language being English, and the care plan indicating they liked classical music. And some residents said the majority of staff were hard to understand as their first language was not English. Despite the manager insisting that staff had been informed of English language classes to improve their communication, no member of staff had shown any interest. Inspectors also found some residents looking dehydrated and could find no evidence of staff recording their fluid or food intake. Bhangra music was played in one resident's room - despite English being his first language . Assessors also said no system was in place to monitor the quality of care and the service provided and that they found loud pop music 'blaring out' in the lounge areas. The CQC's report has now been published and a formal warning to protect the safety and welfare of the residents has been issued to owners Jewelglen Limited. It has been ordered to improve standards by July 16 or face a possible suspension or cancellation of services, which the CQC can do in serious cases. It could also face a financial penalty. Despite the concerns highlighted in the report, the inspectors found positive elements to the care home. The home contained cards and letters thanking staff for their care and support and no residents made any negative comments about the attitude or care of the staff. Staff were also observed speaking in a polite manner when addressing the residents and a district nurse said the home always followed instructions. The home, which was inspected on May 14, cares for up to 41 residents with physical difficulties. Mahendra Raja, the home's owner, said the concerns raised had been addressed and solutions would be in order before the next inspection.

chatgpt: A care home has come under scrutiny after residents complained about language barriers and cultural insensitivity. One resident, whose first language is English, reported that staff played loud Bhangra music in their room despite their objections. The incident highlights wider concerns about communication difficulties between care home residents and their carers. Several residents have reported that staff at the home had difficulty understanding and communicating with them due to language barriers. The residents also felt that they were not receiving culturally appropriate care, with meals and activities not tailored to their needs and preferences. The home's owners have been warned that they could face a financial penalty if improvements are not made. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), the regulatory body that oversees care homes in the UK, has issued a formal notice demanding that the home make improvements to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its residents. The CQC report found that the home fell short of standards in several areas, including staffing, safety, and quality of care. The report also noted that staff turnover was high, with many staff members leaving within a few months of starting their jobs. The home's director has acknowledged the concerns raised by residents and the CQC report. He has promised to take steps to address the issues, including hiring more English-speaking staff, improving training for existing staff, and introducing cultural sensitivity training for all staff. In a statement, the director said: "We take the concerns of our residents very seriously and are committed to making the improvements needed to ensure that they receive the best possible care. We will be working closely with the CQC to implement their recommendations and improve the quality of our service." The incident has sparked wider debate about language and cultural barriers in care homes, with many calling for more support for vulnerable residents and their carers. The Care Quality Commission has indicated that it will be increasing its focus on the issue of cultural sensitivity in care homes, with a view to improving standards across the sector. Overall, the incident at the care home highlights the importance of effective communication and cultural sensitivity in the provision of care. It also highlights the need for greater support and oversight for vulnerable residents, particularly those who may be at risk of experiencing language or cultural barriers.
