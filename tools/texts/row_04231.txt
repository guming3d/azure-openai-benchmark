Sandeep Rani and his wife Khushboo were killed by her relatives who disapproved of their marriage, despite police being ordered to provide them with protection . But Mr Rani's mother, Udham Kaur, said when the couple then went back to the police to seek protection they 'refused to honour the court order'. After returning to their village in Hoshiarpur district the couple continued to receive death threats, so they went to stay with friends. When they later briefly returned to their home in Mugowal village, some 77 miles from the Punjabi capital of Chandigarh, the couple were attacked and killed by five masked men carrying swords and knives. Mr Rani's family said their son was targeted first, and when his father, Parkash, tried to protect him he was also stabbed. He is currently in intensive care.

Police said despite the fact that the couple had applied and successfully won a High Court order for police protection, they had then decided that they didn't need it . The couple, who were neighbours, had eloped and got married about three months before they were killed, against the wishes of Khushboo's family. Ms Kaur told police that the mask of one assailant came off during the attacks. She claimed to have recognised the attacker as being Khushboo's father, Sodhi Ram. Hoshiarpur district police chief Rajjit Singh Hundal said the matter was being investigated, but denied the police were at fault. He said that despite the fact couple had applied for a High Court order for police protection, they had then decided that they didn't need it. Mr Hundal said the couple had then travelled home without notifying officers. India's untouchable class known as Dalits comprise almost 17 per cent of Delhi’ s population.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident in India, a couple who had defied their parents to get married were violently attacked by a group of men. Sandeep Rani and Khushboo had wed against the wishes of the latter's family, prompting the couple to seek police protection. However, their newfound safety was short-lived, as they returned to their home in the city of Faridabad to find themselves faced with a group of five men. Mr Rani's father, Parkash, tried to protect his son from the attackers and was brutally stabbed in the process. Although the couple's ordeal has garnered widespread attention in the media, the identities of the perpetrators remain unknown. Khushboo's wife, however, has claimed that her father was among the attackers. Speaking to reporters, Khushboo expressed her shock at the incident, saying, "We thought that getting the order for police protection would keep us safe. But when we came home, some men attacked us, and my father-in-law was stabbed. It was a terrifying experience." The couple's marriage had been a contentious issue with Khushboo's family, who were vehemently opposed to the union. However, Sandeep and Khushboo remained steadfast in their love and had even filed a petition seeking protection from the authorities. Despite this, it appears that there is still a long way to go before the couple and their family can truly be safe. The attack has sent shockwaves across the community, with many speaking out against the violence. It is not yet known whether the authorities will be able to apprehend the attackers and bring them to justice. However, the incident has once again brought to light the important issue of safety for couples who marry against the wishes of their families. In a society where familial ties are often prioritised above all else, it is crucial that we recognise the individual rights of those who choose to pursue love and happiness in their own way. Only by doing so can we hope to create a safer, more inclusive society for all.
