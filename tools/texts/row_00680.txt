chatgpt: Australia Ranks 7th in the World for Porn Consumption: Study  The United States has been revealed to watch the most amount of porn in the world, with Australia following behind at 7th place for page views per capita and 8th overall, according to a new study by the popular adult entertainment site, Pornhub. With over 130 million visitors a day, Pornhub has gathered data that reveals insights into global porn consumption. The report found that the most popular search term in Australia was “lesbian”, followed closely by “teen”, “milf”, “massage” and then “squirt”. The average length of time an Australian spends on the site is 9 minutes and 33 seconds, with most people choosing to view the material on their smartphones. The study also found that Fridays see a peak in visitors, but public holidays were recorded to significantly interrupt Australians' viewings. The report identifies that the most common search terms correlated with holidays in Australia were ‘Christmas’, ‘New Year’s Day’ and ‘Easter’. The data also shows that porn viewing habits in Australia vary from state to state. The site is most popular in the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and the Northern Territory is the least active when it comes to porn viewing. Despite the stigma associated with porn consumption, research shows that it has a number of benefits for individuals, including stress relief, improved sexual satisfaction and better relationships. However, concerns have been raised about the industry’s association with exploitation and abuse, with many performers having reported negative experiences while working within it. There have also been concerns around the lack of regulation around the industry, particularly around the age of performers and the content being produced. Despite these concerns, the porn industry continues to grow, with many people turning to it as a source of entertainment and pleasure. With the rise of the internet and the ubiquity of smartphones, many people are now able to access porn in the privacy of their own homes, leading to a significant increase in the number of people consuming porn around the world. In response to these developments, many governments have sought to regulate the industry more closely, with some countries banning access to porn altogether. However, this has led to concerns around the impact of such restrictions on individual freedom and the potential for censorship. Ultimately, the issue of porn consumption remains a contentious and complex one, with many different viewpoints and opinions to consider. While some see it as harmless entertainment, others raise concerns about exploitation and abuse, and the wider social and cultural impacts.
