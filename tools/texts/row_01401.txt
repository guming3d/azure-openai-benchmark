article: (CNN) -- Big Ben, arguably the world's most famous clock, celebrates on Sunday 150 years of keeping London on time. The British landmark has lived through war, bad weather and disasters. Big Ben's distinctive bongs have been a part of the London scene for 150 years. Big Ben is the 14-ton bell inside the world's largest four-faced chiming clock, although most people use the name to describe the tower that houses it. The clock is perched on a 96-meter (310-foot) elegant tower at the Westminster Bridge end of the Palace of Westminster. The Victorian masterpiece, which provides distinctive chimes known as bongs, was voted Britain's favorite monument in 2008. It has been featured in films such as "101 Dalmatians" and "Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix." Big Ben has been disrupted a few times over the years for various reasons, including weather and breakages. Its bongs went silent for about two months in August 2007 to allow a crew to repair its mechanism system. During that time, the rest of the clock was running on an electric system. It was fully restarted again October 1. The clock pays tribute to Britain's royal history: It has a Latin inscription of the phrase: "O Lord, save our Queen Victoria the First." The ornate masterpiece has some quirky features. The hour hand, which weighs 300 kilograms (661 pounds), is made of gun metal while the minute hands are made of copper sheet. The minute hands would not work when they were first made of cast iron because they were too heavy. The clock started working on May 31, 1859, after the lighter copper hands were installed. The origins of the landmark's name are obscure. Some say it was named after the 1850s heavyweight boxer Ben Caunt while others suggest it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, a former member of parliament. Hall, the commissioner of works in 1859, was responsible for ordering the bell. Alan Hughes, the director of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry that made the bell, prefers the latter. "I suppose I like it chiefly because it was a nickname of a man who was big and loud and pompous, and never used one word if 27 would do," he said in a 2008 interview. Hughes' company also made America's Liberty Bell and a number of others for cathedrals and churches around the world.

chatgpt: London's iconic Big Ben clock tower is celebrating its 150th birthday on Sunday, capping off a milestone year that saw the Victorian masterpiece named Britain's favourite monument. First unveiled on July 11, 1859, the clock tower quickly became a symbol of London and one of its most-visited tourist destinations. Despite its popularity, the origins of the clock tower's name remain a mystery. Some historians believe it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw its construction, while others point to the clock's massive size and stature as the reason for its moniker. Regardless of its name's origin, there is no denying the cultural significance of Big Ben. Over the years, it has been the subject of countless photographs, paintings, and songs, and has become an integral part of London's skyline. Its instantly-recognizable silhouette is etched in the minds of people all over the world and serves as a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of Victorian-era architects and builders. But Big Ben is more than just a work of art. For centuries, it has played an important role in keeping London running on time. Its four faces, each measuring more than 20 feet in diameter, are some of the most accurate timepieces in the world, and its signature chime has become a hallmark of British culture. To mark the occasion of Big Ben's 150th anniversary, a series of celebrations are planned for the coming days. On Sunday, the clock's famous bell will toll out 150 times, and visitors will be treated to special tours of the clock tower's interior. Over the next week, a series of concerts and events will take place around London, showcasing the best of British culture and highlighting the importance of Big Ben to Londoners past and present. But despite its monumental stature, Big Ben is not without its faults. In recent years, the clock tower has suffered from a number of technical and structural issues, leading to calls for a major overhaul. Last year, the UK government approved a Â£61 million renovation project to address these issues, with work expected to begin in the near future. As Big Ben celebrates its 150th birthday, it is clear that its legacy will continue to endure for generations to come. Whether it's the clock tower's timekeeping prowess, its towering presence on the London skyline, or its place in the hearts of millions of people, Big Ben remains one of the architectural wonders of the world.
