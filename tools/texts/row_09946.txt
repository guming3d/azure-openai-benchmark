article: NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A recent college graduate is suing her alma mater for $72,000 -- the full cost of her tuition and then some -- because she cannot find a job. Trina Thompson has sued her alma mater, Monroe College of New York. Trina Thompson, 27, of the Bronx, graduated from New York's Monroe College in April with a bachelor of business administration degree in information technology. On July 24, she filed suit against the college in Bronx Supreme Court, alleging that Monroe's "Office of Career Advancement did not help me with a full-time job placement. I am also suing them because of the stress I have been going through." The college responded that it offers job-search support to all its students. In her complaint, Thompson says she seeks $70,000 in reimbursement for her tuition and $2,000 to compensate for the stress of her three-month job search. As Thompson sees it, any reasonable employer would pounce on an applicant with her academic credentials, which include a 2.7 grade-point average and a solid attendance record. But Monroe's career-services department has put forth insufficient effort to help her secure employment, she claims. "They're supposed to say, 'I got this student, her attendance is good, her GPA is all right -- can you interview this person?' They're not doing that," she said. Thompson said she has fulfilled her end of the job-search bargain, peppering companies listed on Monroe's e-recruiting site with cover letters, résumés and phone calls. But no more than two employers have responded to her outreach, and those leads have borne no fruit. Her complaint adds, "The office of career advancement information technology counselor did not make sure their Monroe e-recruiting clients call their graduates that recently finished college for an interview to get a job placement. They have not tried hard enough to help me." She suggested that Monroe's Office of Career Advancement shows preferential treatment to students with excellent grades. "They favor more toward students that got a 4.0. They help them more out with the job placement," she said. iReport.com: "Don't sue your alma mater" Monroe College released a statement saying that "while it is clear that no college, especially in this economy, can guarantee employment, Monroe College remains committed to working with all its students, including Ms. Thompson, who graduated only three months ago, to prepare them for careers and to support them during their job search." Thompson says she has not hired an attorney to represent her because she cannot afford one. When she filed her complaint, she also filed a "poor person order," which exempts her from filing fees associated with the lawsuit. Asked whether she would advise other college graduates facing job woes to sue their alma maters, Thompson said yes. "It doesn't make any sense: They went to school for four years, and then they come out working at McDonald's and Payless. That's not what they planned." CNN's Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Monroe College, a well-known institution based in New York, is facing a lawsuit from a former student who claims that the school's career office failed to provide adequate job placement assistance after graduation. The graduate, who has requested not to be named, is seeking $70,000 in tuition compensation and an additional $2,000 for stress caused by the lack of support. According to the graduate, the career office showed preferential treatment to students with better grades, leaving her feeling ignored and marginalized. "It was like they only cared about the students who had the best GPAs," she said. "I felt like I was being punished for not being a straight-A student." The graduate claims that she visited the career office several times in the months leading up to her graduation, but that she received little help or guidance in finding a job. "They just gave me a bunch of generic advice, like 'spruce up your resume' and 'network more'," she said. "But they never actually connected me with any employers or job openings." In contrast, she said, she knew several students with higher GPAs who received regular email updates from the career office about job openings and networking events. "It was really frustrating and demoralizing," she said. "I felt like they didn't care about my future." Monroe College has issued a statement in response to the lawsuit, saying that it is "committed to working with all its students, regardless of academic performance, to help them achieve their career goals." The college notes that its career office offers a range of services, including resume critiques, job fairs, and one-on-one counseling sessions. The college also notes that job placement rates for Monroe College graduates are high, with more than 90 percent finding employment within six months of graduation. "We take pride in the success of our graduates and the support we provide to help them achieve their goals," the college said. However, the graduate's lawsuit highlights the challenges that many students face when trying to navigate the job market after graduation. In today's competitive economy, a college degree is often seen as a prerequisite for many jobs, but simply having a degree is not always enough to secure meaningful employment. As a result, many students rely on their college's career office to provide guidance and support as they search for jobs. If these services are not up to par, it can have serious consequences for students' career prospects and financial well-being. It remains to be seen how the lawsuit against Monroe College will play out, but it serves as a reminder of the importance of effective career counseling services for college students. As the economy continues to evolve, it is essential that colleges and universities provide their graduates with the tools and resources they need to succeed in today's job market.
