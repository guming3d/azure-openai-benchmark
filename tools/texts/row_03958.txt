article: The boom in beekeeping may be doing our countryside more harm than good. For a surge in the number of bumblebee hives means thousands of colonies are being imported. And many of these are riddled with parasites that pose a threat to native species, a study has found. Essential pollinator: But many of the bee colonies currently being imported from the continent are riddled with parasites . With British bees already in peril, scientists say the trade must be tightened up. Commercial gardeners have long kept bumblebees to boost the pollination of their crops. But recently home owners have joined the trend, to do their bit for the environment. As a result, the number of bumblebee colonies imported from the continent each year has soared to between 40,000 and 50,000. However, research from Leeds, Stirling and Sussex Universities found that many of the foreign colonies harbour dangerous bugs. The study of 48 bumblebee colonies . bought from three European suppliers found 77 per cent to be infected. Eight different parasites were found and some colonies contained several . different diseases. Passed . to our native bees, these parasites could deform their wings, leaving . them unable to fly, shorten their life or even kill. Risk: A study of 48 bumblebee colonies bought from three European suppliers found 77 per cent to be infected with parasites . Sussex University researcher William Hughes said: ‘Some of the parasites damage fat stores, many reduce lifespan. They can also affect the ability of the insect to learn and can be lethal.’ One of the bugs found on the bumblebees can be passed to honeybees, where it deforms wings to such an extent the insects cannot fly. Some strains may be new to Britain and there are fears that having high numbers of these bees near plants visited by native insects will speed up the spread of disease. Britain’s bumblebees are already in peril, with intensive farming, changing climate, pollution and disease blamed for two of the 25 native species going extinct and many others struggling to survive. Commercial gardeners use the foreign colonies to boost production of crops such as tomatoes and strawberries in greenhouses and polytunnels. In recent years, home gardeners have also started to buy them and pay up to £100 for a cardboard box of bumblebees to be delivered to their home. The colony, with a queen and up to 100 worker bees, can be used to pollinate lavender and other plants. The researchers, whose study was published in the Journal of Applied Ecology,  want tighter import controls, with bees checked for disease on arrival in the UK. Professor Hughes said: ‘If we don’t act, then the risk is that tens of thousands of parasite-carrying colonies may be imported in the UK each year.’

chatgpt: According to a recent study, a growing number of beekeepers are importing colonies from the European continent, with an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 colonies imported each year. However, the study also found that a high percentage of these imported colonies are infected with parasites. The study, which was conducted by researchers at three universities in the UK, examined 48 bee colonies that had been purchased from three European suppliers. The results showed that 77% of the colonies were infected with at least one species of parasite. Among the parasites found in the imported colonies were Varroa destructor, a mite that has been shown to weaken bees and make them more susceptible to diseases, and Nosema ceranae, a fungus that infects the gut of bees and can lead to population declines. The researchers note that the high prevalence of parasites in imported colonies is likely due to the fact that many European beekeepers rely heavily on chemical treatments to manage their colonies, which can lead to the development of resistant strains of parasites. Importing bee colonies has become increasingly common in recent years, as beekeepers seek to replenish their hives and introduce new genetic material into their local populations. However, the practice has also raised concerns about the introduction of new diseases and parasites into local bee populations. The researchers behind the recent study say that their findings highlight the need for better monitoring and regulation of the importation of bee colonies. They also recommend that beekeepers take steps to minimize the risk of introducing parasites into their hives, such as quarantining newly purchased colonies and using non-chemical methods for managing pests and diseases. In response to the study, the British Beekeepers Association has called for more rigorous testing of imported colonies and better regulation of the beekeeping industry as a whole. The association notes that the importation of bees and other bee products is a significant contributor to the spread of diseases and pests in the UK, and that more needs to be done to protect the country's native bee populations. The study is just the latest to highlight the threats facing the world's bee populations, which are crucial for pollinating crops and maintaining ecosystems. In recent years, bee populations have been devastated by a combination of habitat loss, pesticide use, and disease, raising concerns about the long-term viability of the world's food supply. Efforts to address these issues have ranged from promoting organic agriculture and reducing pesticide use to encouraging the planting of bee-friendly flowers and habitats. However, the continued importation of bee colonies threatens to undermine these efforts by introducing new disease and parasite strains into local populations. As such, the recent study serves as a reminder that beekeepers and policymakers alike must remain vigilant in monitoring and regulating the beekeeping industry in order to protect these vital insects and the ecosystems that depend on them.
