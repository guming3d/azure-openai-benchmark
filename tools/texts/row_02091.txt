article: A New Jersey school bus driver who left two special needs children alone on a bus for nearly an hour in 90-degree weather has been sentenced to three years of probation. Kimberly Moumblow, 47, of Highland Lakes reportedly left two special needs boys, age seven and nine, on a school bus for 45 minutes in July 2013 with the door shut and the windows rolled up, authorities say. The bus was reportedly not running. Sentenced: Kimberly Moumblow, 47 (photographed), allegedly left two special needs children alone on a bus for nearly an hour in 90-degree weather and has now been sentenced to three years of probation . Judge Thomas J. Critchley also ordered Moumblow to pay various fines and undergo a mental health evaluation, The New Jersey Herald reports. In November 2014, Moumblow pleaded guilty to cruelty and fourth-degree neglect of a child in the incident. Moumblow reportedly skipped two of her three planned stops that July 23 day and, after driving the school bus to the Hamburg-based private bus company Macnova parking area, she left the vehicle without realizing the two boys were still inside, according to the Herald. According to NJ, Moumblow backed the bus into the company owner's home before leaving the children unattended in the vehicle in the 90-degree weather. Authorities have said the children were overheated and distressed, but were not seriously injured. Found: Police reportedly found the bus parked in front of the Macnova bus company owner's home (photographed here) The boys were found after their parents contacted the school, asking where the boys were, the Herald reports. The school board called the bus company, contracted to transport summer program students, and, when they couldn't reach the company, they contacted the police, CBS reports. Officers found the bus outside of the company owner's home, and CBS reports, that the company told school district officials that the children were on an air-conditioned bus and being attended to by an adult. Authorities soon learned that was not the case. Unacceptable: Charles Maranzano (photographed) described the situation as 'complete neglect,' saying Moumblow's actions were 'unacceptable and incomprehensible' 'I just want to say that I am sorry to the families, Moumblow said before her sentencing. 'Anything I say will sound like an excuse, but what happened was inexcusable.' Charles Maranzano, superintendent of Vernon Township schools, described the situation to CBS as 'complete neglect,' saying Moumblow's actions were 'unacceptable and incomprehensible.' Though Moumblow said what happened was 'inexcusable,' the woman, who had a special license to drive a bus for nearly a decade, said she could offer no explanation other than personal issues involving her own children and a prior marriage, according to the Herald. Moumblow will face the probation, evaluation, and fines although the fourth-degree crime of neglect of a child carries a potential weight of up to 18 months in jail, NJ reports. The school district has since fired the Macnova bus company, according to the Herald, and Moumblow is no longer allowed to work with children.

chatgpt: Kimberly Moumblow, a 47-year-old school bus driver, has been sentenced to three years of probation, various fines, and a medical health evaluation after leaving two special needs children alone on a hot bus for 45 minutes. According to authorities, on the day of the incident, the temperatures outside soared to over 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Moumblow, who was responsible for transporting the two special needs children to and from school, left the children alone on the bus after dropping off the other students. The children, who were locked inside the bus, were discovered by a passerby who noticed them sweating heavily and screaming for help. The concerned individual immediately called 911, and the police arrived shortly thereafter to free the children. Upon examination, it was discovered that the children were slightly dehydrated and overheated, but otherwise unharmed. The incident has raised concerns about the safety and wellbeing of special needs children who rely on the school bus system. During the hearing, Moumblow expressed her regret for her actions and recognized the severity of her mistake. "I am deeply sorry for what happened," she said. "It was a terrible lapse in judgment and I will never let anything like this happen again." In addition to her probation and fines, Moumblow has now been ordered to undergo a medical health evaluation to determine if there are any underlying health issues that may have contributed to the incident. The incident has sparked outrage among parents of special needs children in the community, who fear that their children may not be safe while riding the school bus. "This is unacceptable," said one concerned mother. "My child deserves to be safe, and I expect the school district to take immediate action to ensure that this never happens again." Some parents are calling for stricter regulations and protocols for school bus drivers, including mandatory safety training and regular health check-ups. As of now, the school district has not announced any new safety measures in response to the incident. However, they have released a statement expressing their commitment to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all students. "We take this incident very seriously and we are committed to making sure something like this never happens again," the statement reads. "We will work closely with our transportation department to review our policies and procedures, and we will take any necessary steps to ensure that our students are safe at all times." In the meantime, parents are advised to remain vigilant and to report any concerns about their child's safety while riding the school bus. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of proper training and regulations for school bus drivers, and the need for continued efforts to ensure the safety of all children.
