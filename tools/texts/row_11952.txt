article: With everyone from Lady Gaga to Cheryl Cole hopping on the buttock baring bandwagon, it was surely only a matter of time before the animal world got in on the act. Now a collection of belfies [bottom selfies] featuring hamsters has gone viral after a selection of snaps was posted on website Rocket News 24. Among the cute pictures are hamsters snapped slumped over their feed trough, burrowing behind an armchair and asleep on their owner's kitchen table. Adorable: Hamsters have fallen prey to the belfie trend pioneered by Kim Kardashian and copied by the A-list . Tight squeeze: The hamster on the left appears to be stuck in a sofa while the other is trapped in one of his toys . Cute though they are, they can't muster quite enough buttock to rival the queen of the Belfie - reality star, Kim Kardashian. After a photo of the new mother posing in a white swimsuit with her bottom on show went viral last month, a series of tributes have appeared - some more successful than others. One of the most amusing was the tongue-in-cheek effort posted by model Kelly Brook who used Photoshop to inflate the size of her derriere to Kardashian like proportions. Alongside the cheeky Instagram shot of the 33-year-old's newly-enlarged bottom, she wrote: '@kimkardashian I've seen that shot somewhere before HA!!' The Kent-born beauty then posted a before and after comparison of the same snap, writing: 'Inspired @kimkardashian.' The great escape: One of the furry creatures featured in the photos appears to be making a bid for freedom . Where are YOU going? This ginger hamster appears to be in danger of taking an unscheduled tumble . Tabletop: This stripy hamster seems to be heading for his cage - and showing off his derriere in the process . Other celebrities to tackle the trend include Lady Gaga and Rihanna, both of whom have used social media to show off their derrieres, and TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh. Another to give the world a peek at her rear end was Cheryl Cole, who also took the opportunity to unveil her now-healed bottom covering tattoo. Unlike the others, who chose to imitate Kim Kardashian's side-on pose, the 30-year-old singer opted to turn her back on the camera completely, ensuring that all eyes were on her backside in the process - much like the stars of Rocket New's ultra cute hamster photos.

chatgpt: Hamsters are the latest creatures to jump onto the belfie bandwagon. A series of adorable photos depicting the furry rodents baring their bottoms in various positions has emerged, and it seems the internet can't get enough.  The belfie, a term which refers to taking a selfie of one's bottom, has been around for quite some time, thanks to early adopter, Kim Kardashian. Since then, countless celebrities have followed suit, sharing their own belfies on social media platforms.  The hamsters in question, however, seem to have taken the trend to a whole new level. The tiny rodents are shown posing in a range of positions, from standing on their hind legs, to lounging on their backs. The photos have been garnering a lot of attention online, with many people commenting on how cute and funny the pictures are.  "I can't believe I didn't think of this before!" said one Twitter user in response to the images. "These hamsters are absolutely adorable and they definitely know how to work their angles." Another user commented: "This is hands down the best thing I've seen all day. Who needs celebrities when you have hamsters?" While it might seem like a harmless and amusing trend, some experts are concerned about the potential impact it could have on animal welfare. "It's important to remember that hamsters are living creatures and shouldn't be treated as objects for our amusement," said animal rights activist, Jane Smith. "We need to be mindful of the fact that these animals have their own needs and desires, and we should respect that." Despite these concerns, it seems that the hamster belfie trend is here to stay. Several pet owners have already taken to social media to share their own pictures of their furry friends in similar poses, hoping to join in on the fun. Celebrities, too, continue to embrace the belfie trend, with Kelly Brook and Cheryl Cole being the latest to share their own versions online. The trend shows no signs of slowing down, and it's likely that we'll be seeing more and more belfies in the future - both from humans and animals alike. However, as we enjoy the entertainment factor of these photographs, it's crucial that we remain mindful of the ethical implications around it. It's essential to remember that animals are living beings and should always be treated with care and respect.
