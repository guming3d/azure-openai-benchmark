Ecclestone also said a decision on whether or not to hold the race at the country's Bahrain International Circuit could not have been made any sooner. The grand prix was officially axed on February 21. "Shortly before the crisis I had lunch with the Crown Prince (HRH Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa) and there was absolutely no indication of what would come just days after. "He asked what I would do if I were him, and I answered, 'You are there. We in Europe are hardly in the situation to make a serious judgment of the conditions. Decide what is best for your country.' "He then cancelled the race and I think it was the right decision."
