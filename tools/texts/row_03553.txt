article: If you’ve ever found yourself browsing for online bargains in the middle of the night then don’t worry, you’re not alone. Because according to John Lewis, Britain’s 24-hour culture has created a new breed of ‘inshopniacs’, with the store reporting a 31 per cent surge in the number of people shopping online during the small hours. The retailer has found that an increasing number of parents kept awake by a crying baby, late-night gamers and shift workers are shopping online after dark. The trend was revealed in their How We Shop, Live & Look report, which charts changes in spending habits over the past year using data from its stores and website. It shows how major events shaped which products became bestsellers. In came lap trays, the sort used by families eating in front of the TV on Channel 4’s Gogglebox series, while the Prince George effect started a trend for children’s sailor suits. The wet winter prompted a surge in searches for wellies, while the spring heatwave led to a run on barbecues. On their way out in 2014 were adult onesies, napkin rings and black socks, in favour of pink socks – a change apparently inspired by the Wolf of Wall Street. Changes in technology also saw the demise of camcorders and photo albums as people use their phones to record videos and store images on their computer hard drives or Apple’s ‘cloud’. And it seems those who are struggling to get to sleep have given up on counting sheep and are using their smartphones or tablets to go shopping instead. The managing director at John Lewis, Andy Street, said: ‘Sales through our website between the hours of midnight and 6am have increased by 31 per cent over the past year, thanks in no small part to the fact that more customers are choosing to do their shopping using a smartphone or tablet.’ He went on to say: ‘The change also reflects the need for instant gratification. For example, late-night gamers who might be sitting up at 1am are no longer thinking about buying something when they go into town in two days’ time. ‘Instead they look to buy things online, there and then. And we see that parents who have woken up at some unearthly hour thinking I need that for my son or daughter. When they can’t get back to sleep, they just go online and order it.’ The report also revealed that Sunday is the busiest day of the week for purchases on the John Lewis website. Mr Street said: ‘You are seeing families spending the weekend thinking over what they might buy and then sitting down with their iPad on Sunday evening and making the commitment.’

chatgpt: John Lewis, one of Britain's leading department stores, has revealed that the country's 24-hour culture has created a new type of shopper: the "inshopniac". This is someone who stays up late into the night, scrolling through websites or browsing stores until the early hours in search of the latest products and deals. According to a recent report by the store, there has been a 31 percent rise in people shopping online during the early hours of the morning. John Lewis attributes this trend to the fact that people are now working longer hours or have busier lifestyles, leaving them with fewer opportunities to shop during the day. The report also delved into which products have become popular due to recent events. For instance, sailor suits inspired by Prince George were one of the "in" products of the year. Prince George, the son of Prince William and Kate Middleton, is well-known for his classic and stylish wardrobe, which often inspires parents across the UK to buy similar outfits for their own children. Another popular product is lap trays, which are similar to those used by the households featured on the Channel 4 show "Gogglebox". These trays provide a convenient place to put food and drinks while watching TV, and can be easily stored away when not in use. However, John Lewis also reports that some products are on their way out. Camcorders, black socks, and adult onesies have all seen a decline in popularity, and are no longer in high demand. The report also showed how major events, such as the birth of the Royal Baby or the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, can shape which products become bestsellers. As retailers like John Lewis continue to observe and analyze consumer shopping habits, the rise of the "inshopniac" is expected to grow. This trend could be good news for e-commerce websites, as shopping outside of traditional hours becomes more common. Despite changing consumer behaviors, John Lewis remains a popular destination for shoppers. With over 50 stores across the UK, the retailer offers a broad range of products including clothing, electronics, furniture, and kitchenware. As the UK's 24-hour culture continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see how retailers like John Lewis adapt to meet the needs of the "inshopniac".
