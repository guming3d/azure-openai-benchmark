article: At the 1982 World Cup the only way Italy managed to stop Diego Maradona was to task their hard-nosed centre-back Claudio Gentile with man-marking the diminutive star. Gentile committed 23 fouls on Argentina’s No 10 in Spain, as Italy triumphed 2-1 and left their opponents needing to beat Brazil in their next match to advance - something they failed to do. Thirty-two years later there were echoes of that famous hatchet job during Brazil’s match against Colombia in Fortaleza, as Fernandinho thundered into James Rodriguez at every opportunity to disrupt the Colombian’s rhythm.

In the 14th minute the Manchester City midfielder flew into a challenge on Rodriguez in the centre circle, making little attempt to win the ball and clearly catching the Monaco man. The referee gave Colombia a free-kick, buts somehow Fernandinho avoided a booking. It has been suggested already during the tournament that the hosts have been getting more than their fair share of refereeing decision, and this was a clear example of leniency towards Brazil trumping reason.

chatgpt: In Brazil's recent match against Colombia, midfielder Fernandinho made headlines for all the wrong reasons, as he committed a series of violent fouls that went unpunished by the referee. In the 14th minute, Fernandinho committed a horrible tackle on a Colombian player, which left his opponent writhing in pain on the field. Shockingly, despite the severity of the challenge, the referee didn't show Fernandinho a yellow card. Just ten minutes later, Fernandinho committed another foul on an attacker, but once again, the referee decided not to book him. As the first half drew to a close, Fernandinho charged straight through Rodriguez, leaving him injured and requiring medical attention. The Brazilian midfielder was finally booked for this challenge, but it was little consolation for his opponent, who had been on the receiving end of Fernandinho's aggressive behavior. This is not the first time that Fernandinho has been guilty of violent fouls in recent matches. In fact, he has already committed a total of 10 fouls in Brazil's last two matches, causing concern among fans and pundits alike. While some argue that Fernandinho's aggressive style of play is simply a part of his game, others insist that his behavior is unacceptable and puts other players at risk. The Colombian team, who were on the receiving end of Fernandinho's early tackles, expressed their frustration at the referee's failure to punish the Brazilian midfielder. "It's not fair that our players are subjected to such violent challenges without any consequences for the other team," said one Colombian player after the match. Meanwhile, Brazilian fans took to social media to defend Fernandinho and argue that his tackles were simply a part of the game. However, many others expressed concern about the impact that his behavior could have on the team's overall performance, particularly if he continues to make reckless challenges in future matches. For Fernandinho himself, the fallout from his aggressive behavior is likely to be significant. While he escaped serious punishment in this match, he may face disciplinary action from the governing body of football, FIFA, which takes player safety very seriously. In any case, he will need to be much more careful in future matches, both to protect his own future in the sport and to avoid causing harm to others on the field.
