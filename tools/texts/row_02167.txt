The 23-year-old said the organisers of the 86-year-old competition informed her it is against their policy to accept entrants who have children. Miss Tyler, who is a full-time mother to Annelise and has taken part in some modelling projects, said: ‘I had started to get really excited about the competition. I was really upset when I found out, it’s a disgrace. 'I am a proud young mum and I even said in my application that my biggest achievement was having my daughter. ‘It was only when a friend mentioned their “no children” policy I decided to question it and that is when I was notified by email that I could no longer take part – despite having been accepted two weeks before.

Stunning: Modelling shots of Danielle, who has qualified for Miss Great Britain after being shunned from Miss England on account of being a mother . Director of Miss England Angie Beasley said: ‘Miss World and Miss England are both run by mothers who value highly normal family values. It is unfair on the child and her family to take the mother away for the year while she travels the globe. ‘It raises issues about who would take care of the child. Surely it seems obvious to anyone that for a mother to devote herself fully to a role such as Miss England it would be unfair on any child.’ Miss Tyler, from Belper, Derbyshire, has not let the experience discourage her and has qualified for the Miss Midlands final of Miss Great Britain, which does allow mums. She added: ‘I am delighted Miss Great Britain has a positive attitude towards mothers.’

chatgpt: A young mother from Derbyshire, Danielle Tyler, has expressed her disappointment after being excluded from a competition due to the organizers' 'no children' policy. The 23-year-old was initially accepted for the competition, which sought to recognize the achievements of young professionals in the UK. However, just two weeks later, Danielle received an email from the organizers stating that she could not take part in the competition because of their strict 'no children' policy. "I was devastated when I received the email," said Danielle. "My biggest achievement in life was having my daughter, and to be told that I couldn't take part in this competition because I had a child felt like a slap in the face." Danielle's story has drawn attention to the issue of discrimination against parents and caregivers in the workplace and in public life. Her experience highlights the challenges faced by many parents who struggle to balance work and family responsibilities while still pursuing their career goals. According to a recent study by the Trades Union Congress, one in five mothers and one in ten fathers are forced to leave their jobs due to inflexible working arrangements. The study also found that women are more likely to experience discrimination in the workplace than men, particularly during pregnancy or following the birth of a child. The organizers of the competition have defended their 'no children' policy, stating that it is in place to ensure the safety of all participants and to create a professional environment. However, Danielle and other parents argue that such policies are discriminatory and limit opportunities for those with children. "I understand the importance of safety and professionalism, but I don't see how my child would have been a hindrance to anyone else in the competition," said Danielle. "I think it's time for organizations to recognize that parents and caregivers are capable of achieving great things, both in their personal and professional lives." Danielle's experience has received widespread support on social media, with many parents and advocacy groups calling for greater flexibility and understanding in the workplace. Some have even suggested that Danielle should be nominated for a parenting award, recognizing the strength and determination required to balance motherhood and career aspirations. As for Danielle, she is determined to continue pursuing her dreams and setting an example for her daughter. "I won't let this setback hold me back," she said. "I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire other parents to keep striving for their goals, no matter what obstacles they may face."
