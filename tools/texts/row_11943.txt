article: (CNN) -- A swarm of poisonous spiders has wreaked havoc in a remote town in northeast India, scaring its inhabitants and possibly killing two people. According to a report Sunday in The Times of India, a large number of spiders descended on the town of Sadiya in Assam as a local festival came to end on May 8 and sparked panic as residents tried to avoid the swarm. The report said that scores of people later visited the town's hospital with spider bites and a middle-aged man and a teenage boy died after being bitten by the spiders. The incident alarmed local officials who told residents to stay indoors and considered spraying the town with insecticide, the report said. Jintu Gogoi told The Times he felt excruciating pain and nausea after being bitten by one of the spiders and his finger was black and swollen. However, the attack has puzzled spider experts. Last month, LR Saikia and a team of researchers from Dibrugarh University visited the town to investigate what had happened. Saikia told CNN that he believed the man may have died from a snake bite, while the boy may not have suffered any bite at all. "The evidence that we gathered does not support the claim that they died after being bitten by spiders," Saikia said. Saikia added that the man's relatives appeared to have taken him to traditional spiritual healers instead of qualified doctors when symptoms appeared. He confirmed that about 12 people have visited hospitals in the area recently, complaining of spider bites. "Only two of them were confirmed bitten by spiders. But they were ordinary spiders," Saikia said. Investigators drew their conclusions from questioning relatives of the two dead people about the type of bite marks and symptoms, Saikia said. Some 20 spiders resembling tarantulas from the incident were handed over to investigators during their week-long stay. Tarantulas indigenous to the region are not known to be fatally venomous, but about five of the recovered spiders are currently undergoing tests. When asked if spiders were likely to have swarmed the town of just under 1,000 people, Saikia said, "This is just a story ... based on rumors."

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a remote town in India recently became the victim of a spider attack. According to reports in a leading newspaper, two people lost their lives while scores of residents were bitten by tarantula-like spiders. The attack has left the town in a state of shock and chaos. Despite initial suspicion that the deaths may have been caused by spider bites, experts have raised questions over this theory. The spiders collected from the town are currently undergoing tests to establish their toxicity levels and determine whether they were responsible for the deaths. In the meantime, authorities are advising the residents of the town to take necessary precautions to avoid getting bitten. The incident took place in a remote town, far from the bustling metropolises of India. Local residents were going about their daily lives when they suddenly noticed a swarm of spiders descending on their area. Panic and confusion ensued as people tried to protect themselves and get away from the spiders. It is reported that two people, a man and a woman, lost their lives in the incident. They were rushed to the hospital, but unfortunately, doctors could not save them. Scores of other residents were also bitten by the venomous spiders, causing them immense pain and discomfort. But the incident has left experts with more questions than answers. The cause of death of the two victims is yet to be determined, and some are questioning whether it was the spiders that were responsible for their deaths. The bodies of the deceased have been sent for post-mortem examinations, and the results are awaited. Meanwhile, the spiders that were collected from the town are being tested to determine their toxicity levels. Experts are trying to establish whether the spiders belong to any known species and whether they pose a threat to humans. Authorities have also advised the residents of the town to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to avoid getting bitten. The incident has sparked concerns about the safety of remote towns in India and the presence of deadly insects and animals in these areas. Many residents are demanding better healthcare facilities and access to anti-venom medicines in case such incidents occur in the future.

The incident has left a deep impact on the residents, and they are hoping that answers will soon emerge about the cause of the deaths and the danger posed by these spiders.
