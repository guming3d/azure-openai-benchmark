Police have not said whether they are investigating foul play or if they are treating the death as a medical incident . 'So many emotions. So many thoughts. Right now, we have to leave up to the police and for the investigation,' she told KCTV. 'Never imagined I would get this phone call especially on the day he turned 11 months.' Ms Sembler says she trusts the daycare operators, but an examination of state inspections records shows some troubling violations.

A state audit also found that at least five employees did not have certifications for pediatric first aid and CPR on file. KCTV5 .

chatgpt: Tragedy struck a family in Riverside County as their baby boy, Giovanni Jaraleno, died in his sleep. The one-year-old was put down for a nap by daycare workers but was discovered to be unresponsive upon their attempted wake-up. Emergency responders were quickly called to the scene, but sadly, the child could not be revived. The incident occurred exactly one month before Giovanni's first birthday. As is often protocol in such circumstances, police are now investigating the death. Authorities have not yet determined a cause of death, but informed sources revealed that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is suspected. The family is reportedly devastated and has been receiving support from loved ones and the community. The daycare center where Giovanni was being cared for has been cited by state inspectors for not properly training staff to prevent SIDS deaths. Daycare staff are taught to follow strict protocols to prevent SIDS, including putting infants down to sleep on their backs and keeping crib areas clear of soft bedding and suffocation hazards. It is not yet clear if these guidelines were followed in Giovanni's case. Since SIDS is often difficult to predict or prevent, proper training is critical to minimize the risk. Unfortunately, this may not have been the case at Giovanni's daycare, leading to potential liability for the daycare center. The loss of a child is a devastating experience for any family, and the Jaraleno family is no exception. The community has rallied around the family to offer support and condolences. A vigil was held to honor Giovanni's life and mourn his passing. Friends, family, and loved ones have shared memories of his joy and energy, a bright light that was taken too soon. Local authorities have promised a thorough investigation into Giovanni's death, and the family has expressed their desire for answers. They would like to understand how this could have happened and to ensure that it never happens to another family. This incident highlights the importance of quality training and employee competency at childcare facilities. Parents trust daycare providers with their children, and it is essential that providers take their responsibilities seriously, including proper education and training. The family is calling for justice and accountability for their son's untimely death. State regulators will continue to investigate and enforce citations if necessary. Our hearts go out to the Jaraleno family during this time of unimaginable loss.
