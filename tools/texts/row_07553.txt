article: Holland coach Guus Hiddink blamed Kazakhstan's early goal for the problems his side faced breaking down the visitors before three goals in the last half-hour secured their first win of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Holland dominated possession but surprisingly fell behind when Renat Abdulin's diving header from a corner in the 17th minute gave goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen no chance. The Kazakhstan defence was like a brick wall that held firm until goals by substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Ibrahim Afellay and a Robin van Persie penalty earned victory in Group A.

After the opening goal they lined up in a (wall-like) defence,' Hiddink told reporters. 'Then it is up to you to break through by executing a high-speed passing game, but that didn't always work. It is important not to panic. If you keep playing like that the goals will come sooner or later.' The final 30 minutes proved Hiddink right after a tactical change that was the turning point in the match. The hosts started with a traditional 4-3-3 after the 5-3-2 system former Holland coach Louis van Gaal successfully used at the World Cup in Brazil did not work in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against the Czech Republic which they lost 2-1.

Hiddink added another striker when Huntelaar came on for defensive midfielder Nigel de Jong in the 55th minute. The Schalke captain paired up with national team skipper Robin van Persie up front and rewarded the coach by heading in a free kick six minutes after coming off the bench. Moments later Kazakhstan were reduced to 10 men when striker Baurzhan Dzholchiyev was dismissed for a tackle from behind on Afellay, who put the Dutch ahead with only eight minutes left to cap his return to the national team after 23 months. The Olympiakos Piraeus midfielder had been plagued by injury in the previous two seasons Which kept him out of the team. 'Afellay has had a difficult time. It is good to see he has found the way back up. I think he played with a great drive today,' said Hiddink. Van Persie wrapped up the win with a penalty in the 89th. Hiddink has only four days to determine whether he will stick to a 4-3-3 formation with their next European Championship qualifier against Iceland scheduled for Monday. (Editing by Ken Ferris)

chatgpt: Guus Hiddink, the manager of the Dutch national football team, has praised Kazakhstan's defence for being "like a brick wall," after their recent match in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying rounds. Despite the strong defensive effort, the Netherlands were able to secure a much-needed win with a well-placed goal. Hiddink's team had struggled to break through Kazakhstan's defence for much of the match, with their opponents putting up a staunch resistance. It was not until the second half, when Hiddink made a tactical substitution, that the Dutch team found a way to penetrate their opponent's back line. In the 55th minute, Hiddink brought on striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who proved to be the difference-maker in the match. With his fresh legs and sharp instincts, Huntelaar was able to find the opening he needed, scoring the winning goal in the 62nd minute. When reflecting on the match, Hiddink spoke highly of Kazakhstan's defence, saying that they had played "like a brick wall." He also acknowledged that his team had struggled to find a way through until Huntelaar's crucial goal. Despite the difficulties they faced on the field, the Dutch team was able to pull off an important victory. After a string of disappointing results, their win against Kazakhstan has helped to reinvigorate their campaign to qualify for the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament. The importance of the win was not lost on the Dutch players, who celebrated enthusiastically after Huntelaar's goal. It was a relief for the team, who had been under intense pressure to perform well in the qualifying rounds. The Netherlands will now look to build on their win against Kazakhstan and continue their march towards the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament. With talented players like Huntelaar on their side, they will undoubtedly be a team to watch in the coming months. As for Kazakhstan, their strong defensive display should be applauded, even if it ultimately fell short. They will no doubt take some positives from the match and look to improve on their performance in the rest of the qualifying rounds. In conclusion, the Dutch victory over Kazakhstan was hard-won, with the opposition's defence proving to be a formidable obstacle for much of the match. Nonetheless, Hiddink's tactical changes paid off, and the Netherlands secured the victory they needed to stay in the running for the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament.
