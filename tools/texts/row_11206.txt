article: Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, has tried to win over a sceptical public claiming the crops are safe . Eighty-five scientists have joined forces to challenge the claims of biotech giants and the UK government that GM food is safe for humans. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who has responsibility for food and farming, and the industry have embarked on a huge public relations exercise to win over a sceptical public to genetically modified food. The campaign is built on an assurance that the food is safe to eat and could defeat a host of ills from malnutrition in the Third World to blindness in children. GM supporters also insist crops are safe for the environment and to be used as animal feed. However, these assurances have been questioned by the scientists, who warn there is a serious lack of independent research into the health effects of GM food. Studies involving feeding trials with animals suggest eating GM food could cause real harm, such as allergies, inflammation of internal organs and even breast cancer. The group has signed a joint statement which concludes: ‘The claimed consensus on GM organism safety does not exist.’ They warn that most of the positive . research has been run and paid for by biotech companies such as .

He argues that the fact people have been eating these foods for almost 20 years demonstrates they are safe and last week he dismissed opponents as ‘wicked’.

chatgpt: In a rare move, a group of scientists has banded together to challenge the claim that genetically modified (GM) foods are safe for consumption. The move comes as the UK's Environment Secretary launches a campaign to convince the sceptical public otherwise. The scientists who have raised concerns argue that there is a “serious” lack of research into the health effects of GM foods, pointing out that much of the studies conducted so far have been funded by the biotech industry itself. Their worries are not unfounded. GM crops are created by inserting genes from one organism into the DNA of another in order to create a new strain of plant with a particular set of desirable traits. This process can lead to unintended consequences, such as the creation of new allergens or the development of resistance to antibiotics. Despite these concerns, the biotech industry has long claimed that GM foods are safe for consumption. However, with the public becoming increasingly sceptical of such claims, the UK's Environment Secretary has launched a campaign to win over hearts and minds. The government’s campaign aims to reassure the public that GM foods are subject to strict safety checks and regulation, and that they have been approved by independent experts. It will also highlight the potential benefits of GM foods, such as the ability to create crops that are resistant to pests and diseases, and that require less water and pesticides. However, the group of scientists who are calling for more research into the health effects of GM foods say that the government’s reassurances are not enough. They believe that long-term studies need to be conducted to fully understand the potential health risks associated with consuming GM foods. The debate over the safety of GM foods remains a contentious issue, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. However, one thing is clear: with the world’s population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, there is an urgent need to find sustainable ways to feed everyone. GM crops could play a key role in achieving this goal, but only if their safety can be fully verified. Until then, the debate rages on, with scientists, the food industry, and the public all grappling with the complex issues involved. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it’s clear that GM foods will continue to be a hotly contested topic for years to come.
