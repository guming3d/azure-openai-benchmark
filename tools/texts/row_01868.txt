article: As temperatures rise across the U.S. and send people scurrying indoors to their air-conditioned homes, one man is doing things a little differently. Stan Cox of Salina, Kansas, where it is currently a boiling 109F, does not use air-conditioning even though he has got it in his home. Mr Cox, 54, says he saves money and the environment by keeping the air-conditioning switched off - and he rarely breaks into a sweat. Cool: Stan Cox of Salina, Kansas, where it is currently 109F, does not use air-conditioning at the home he shares with his wife even though they've got it . Mr Cox and his wife, Priti, use tricks in their home taught to them by older generations that help them to avoid overheating, reported ABC News. Mr Cox grew up without air-conditioning in Georgia and claims people have lost the social interaction on summer evenings they had in the past. ‘You'd see kids playing up and down the streets, people visiting one another on their front porches,’ he told ABC News. ‘Now the only sounds you hear are compressors running. Neighbourhoods look like they've been evacuated.’ More than 140 million Americans across 32 states are currently under heat advisories as the U.S. experiences a widespread heatwave. But agricultural scientist and author Mr Cox claims that by turning on your air-conditioning you’re actually making things worse. Not in my house: Mr Cox claims home air conditioning accounts for 60 per cent of electricity use in the South and he saves around $150 per month by not using it . ‘The headline irony here is that the hotter it gets in summer, the more we're using our a/c,’ he told ABC News. ‘The more we're doing that, the greater the emissions from power plants and probability we'll have even more intense heat waves in the future.’ He has already put forward this view in a piece for the Washington Post last July, which resulted in a postbag of hate mail and even death threats. Mr Cox claims home air conditioning accounts for 60 per cent of electricity use in the South and he saves around $150 per month by not using it. The average U.S. household spends more than $275 per year on air-conditioning although local costs vary significantly. He also believes there would be a fall in obesity if children and adults were to spend more time outdoors and be more active. Mr Cox claims a Japanese study found air conditioning cuts down on cortisol production by the adrenal glands, which gets you out of bed.

chatgpt: As temperatures in Kansas soar above the 100-degree mark, one man is determined to stay cool without air conditioning. Stan Cox, a resident of Salina, Kansas, has been living without air conditioning for several years despite the scorching heat. Cox, who is committed to saving money and the environment, believes that air conditioning is not just an unnecessary luxury, but a major contributor to climate change. In an interview, he explained that air conditioning is responsible for a significant portion of the energy consumed in the country, and it has a major impact on the environment. But Cox's decision to live without air conditioning is not just about environmental concerns. He is also convinced that air conditioning is destroying social interaction in the evenings. According to him, air conditioning has made people more isolated and less likely to interact with each other in public spaces. "In the past, people used to spend time outside in the evenings, enjoying the cooler temperatures, interacting with their neighbors and friends. Nowadays, people simply retreat into their air-conditioned homes, and that has led to a decline in social interaction," Cox said. Cox also believes that the use of air conditioning is contributing to even hotter summers in the future. He argues that the increased use of air conditioning is causing cities to become hotter, as air conditioners release a large amount of heat into the atmosphere. This, in turn, leads to a vicious cycle of increased energy consumption, higher temperatures, and a greater need for air conditioning. Despite the challenges of living without air conditioning, Cox says he has found ways to stay cool during the hottest months of the year. He relies on natural ventilation, shading, and other passive cooling techniques to keep his home comfortable. And while he admits that it can be challenging at times, he believes that the benefits of living without air conditioning far outweigh the inconveniences. "Living without air conditioning has allowed me to save money, reduce my environmental impact, and stay connected with my community in ways that I wouldn't have thought possible," Cox said. In conclusion, as the debate over the use of air conditioning continues, Cox's decision to live without it serves as a reminder of the importance of environmental stewardship and connectivity with one's community. As temperatures continue to rise, it is up to all of us to find sustainable and effective ways to live comfortably without contributing to climate change.
