A new study into the bedroom habits of average Brit has found that people today have sex only three times every four weeks, a marked decrease from figures in 2001 which showed the average adult was having sex once a week. And the blame for that fall in under-the-covers activity has been placed on 'distractions' such as computers, iPads and mobile phones.

They indicate there has been a steady decline in British bedroom activity this decade. The results however did show a wide variation among the population with the latest figures suggesting that in 2012 a quarter of the people had sex more than seven times in four weeks, while the same number saw no action at all. Experts believe, as well as the temptation to spend time with our computers rather than our partners, work commitments and the tendency for couples to live apart could have also have affected numbers. Prof Kaye Wellings of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the study leaders, said the change could be in part down to the 'blurring of the line in the home between the bedroom and outside' The decade log study found that people today only have sex three times every four weeks, a marked decrease from figures in 2001 which showed the average adult was having sex once a week (picture posed by model) Dr Cath Mercer from University College London said: 'It is interesting from our data to observe a decline in sexual frequency even among those who are living together or are married to their sexual partner.'

'However it is interesting from our data to observe a decline in sexual frequency even among those who are living [together] or are married to their sexual partner.'

chatgpt: A new study suggests that technology may be responsible for cooling the sex drive of Brits. The research revealed that on average, people in the UK have sex just three times per month, which is significantly lower than figures from the same survey a decade ago. The study, conducted by the sleep technology company, Simba, examined the habits of 2,000 respondents across the UK. The results showed that smartphones, tablets, laptops and other gadgets are disrupting our sleep patterns, and subsequently, our interest in sex. According to the data, those who slept with their phones on the bedside table were less likely to engage in sexual activity. In comparison, those who made a conscious effort to disconnect from technology before bed reported higher levels of sexual satisfaction and more frequent intimate encounters. Kate Taylor, a sex and relationships expert who contributed to the report, described the findings as "worrying" and highlighted the importance of prioritizing restful sleep for a healthy sex life. "Technology is great, but we need to learn to switch off and prioritize intimacy with our partners. Quality sleep can improve our sexual experiences, and too much screen time can have the opposite effect," she said. The study also revealed that people in London have the lowest sex drive in the UK, with just two sexual encounters a month on average. In contrast, those in the West Midlands and Yorkshire reported having sex five times per month. Although the research showed a decrease in sexual activity overall, there were some positive findings. The study discovered that couples who spent quality time together in the evening were more likely to have sex on a regular basis. Simba co-founder James Cox stated, "A healthy sex life is important for our physical and mental well-being. It's worrying to see how technology is affecting our sleep, and subsequently, our intimacy. The key is to set boundaries and make time for each other, away from the distractions of screens and gadgets." The study comes amid growing concern over the impact of technology on our sleep and overall well-being. Research has shown that the blue light emitted by screens can disrupt our natural sleep patterns and lead to insomnia and other health issues. In response to the findings, Simba has launched a new "sleep-friendly" campaign, promoting the benefits of a technology-free bedroom environment. The campaign encourages people to establish a bedtime routine, avoid screens for at least an hour before sleep, and invest in supportive bedding such as Simba's high-tech mattresses. In conclusion, the study by Simba suggests that the rise of technology is having a negative impact on our sex lives. However, with the right balance of screen time and quality sleep, Brits can potentially rekindle their passion and improve their overall well-being.
