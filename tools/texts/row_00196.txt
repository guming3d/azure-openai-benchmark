chatgpt: A 21-year-old man identified as Awang Yao attempted to take his life in the Malaysian town of Bintulu. Yao was said to have been battling depression after his family told him to get a job. His attempt at suicide was dramatic and happened in two phases- first, he climbed a high voltage line, hoping to be electrocuted. However, the line was not connected to the live wire, and so he didn't get electrocuted. Undeterred, Yao then attempted to jump in front of a passing train. Unfortunately, he misjudged the timing and landed on the roof of the train, but then tumbled to the ground. The incident happened on November 17, which was a Wednesday morning. According to eyewitnesses at the scene, Yao had graduated from college, but he was yet to find employment. The pressure from his family to find work had affected him, leading to his decision to take his life. The incident caused significant disruption to train services running through the area, as passengers were advised to take alternative means of transport. According to local authorities, efforts to revive Yao were made, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The news of Yao's suicide has sparked discussions about the increasing rate of depression and suicide among young adults and graduates in Malaysia. Many netizens have taken to social media to express their condolences to Yao's family and to call on the government to create more job opportunities for graduates. In an interview, a mental health expert, Dr. Rosnah Mohd Desa, emphasized the need for society to focus more on mental health, especially as the country routinely reports high suicide rates among young adults. She advised that creating job opportunities is vital, but it is equally important to address the psychological and emotional well-being of graduates in the country. In conclusion, the tragic incident involving Awang Yao highlights the need for a more robust mental health support system in Malaysia. While creating more job opportunities is essential, addressing the root cause of the rising cases of depression and suicide demands a multi-layered approach that involves more than just job creation.
