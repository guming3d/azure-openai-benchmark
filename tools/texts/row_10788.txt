article: By . Vanessa Allen . Large oil deposits have been discovered under southern England which could equal a third of the North Sea reserves but would need fracking to extract it . Scientists have discovered potential onshore oil resources in South East England, a new report is expected to confirm. Oil-bearing shale rocks in the Weald area spanning parts of Sussex, Hampshire, Kent and Surrey are believed to be as rich in oil as the North Sea fields. The area could hold reserves to equal a third of those under the North Sea, which would offer Britain greater energy security and could help to drive down prices. But it would have to be extracted by fracking - the controversial technique which uses high-pressure water to split rocks - and attempts to exploit it risk an angry response from campaigners. A report into the ‘Jurassic Weald Basin’ reserve has been prepared by the British Geological Survey and passed to the Department for Energy and Climate Change, and could be made public within weeks. A similar study in the North of England estimated there may be more than 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas and experts said it could power Britain for 50 years. The new study also looked for shale gas in the South, but was reported to have found that oil was the biggest potential resource under the Weald. Richard Selley, professor of petroleum exploration at Imperial College London, who will advise the DECC on the report, told The Sunday Times: ‘The discovery of oil in the Weald should not be a surprise because there is already a number of small oilfields around the North and South Downs and also oil seeps. ‘The amount is likely to be less than under the North Sea, which is a far larger area, and it is not yet possible to be clear about the figures because we don’t know how much of what is down there. But it is clear that these rocks have a high oil content.’ Large deposits of oil-rich rock have been discovered across Kent (pictured), Surrey, Sussex and Hamps. Plans for energy firm Europa Oil & Gas to sink exploratory wells in an area of outstanding natural beauty near Dorking, Surrey, have already prompted legal protests by the Leith Hill Action Group. Cuadrilla faced protests by environmental campaigners when it tried to drill exploratory wells at Balcombe in West Sussex. Campaigners say drilling could scar the countryside, pollute water supplies and clog roads with hundreds of lorries. The Weald Basin spans traditionally Conservative areas and the Government faces a dilemma between Britain’s energy needs and a community backlash ahead of next year’s election. Southern England already has Europe’s biggest onshore oil field at Wytch Farm in Dorset, where 400million barrels of oil have been extracted since the 1970s.

chatgpt: Oil-rich rock deposits have been found in areas of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire, according to new reports. The total reserves of this oil could equate to a third of North Sea oil, which could be beneficial for the UK's industry. However, the extraction of the oil will involve the highly controversial fracking technique. Fracking involves drilling into rock and injecting high-pressure fluid to extract the oil or gas caught within it. The controversial technique has been criticised for causing earthquakes, contaminating water supplies and promoting global warming. However, supporters of fracking believe that it is vital for energy security and for reducing the UK's reliance on imported oil and gas. The discovery of these oil-rich rock deposits could be a significant opportunity for the UK's energy industry. It is estimated that the oil deposits could create around 5,000 new jobs and could lower energy costs for consumers. Additionally, the oil discovered in these deposits is of high quality and could be used for fuel, plastics and other materials. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of fracking in these areas has met with significant environmental opposition. Environmental groups have voiced concerns that the extraction of oil through fracking could harm the environment and people's health. There are also concerns about the impact of fracking on local communities, such as increased traffic, noise pollution, and the devaluation of property prices. Scientists have stressed the importance of ensuring that any fracking activities are carried out safely and with appropriate safeguards in place. The UK government has announced that it will offer grants to local authorities to ensure that fracking operations are monitored and regulated properly. Many people in the affected areas have expressed concern about the impact of fracking on their communities. There has been widespread protest against fracking, with campaigners holding demonstrations and rallies across the UK. Some local councils have also voiced their opposition to fracking, with some imposing bans on the practice. The government argues that fracking is necessary for the UK's energy security, and that it can be carried out in a safe way. However, critics believe that the risks associated with fracking outweigh the benefits, and that investments should be made in renewable energy sources instead. The discovery of oil-rich rock deposits in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire presents a significant opportunity for the UK's energy sector. However, the extraction of oil through fracking remains a highly controversial and divisive issue. Public opinion about fracking is divided, and it is likely that there will be ongoing debate about the balance between energy security and environmental protection in the UK.
