article: (CNN) -- An asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier passed within the moon's orbit Tuesday, the closest approach by an object that large in more than 30 years. Asteroid 2005 YU55 passed within 202,000 miles of Earth -- about four-fifths of the distance to the moon -- at 6:28 p.m. Tuesday, NASA said. Marina Brozovic, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said the space agency was able to train a great deal of high-powered instruments -- including the massive radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico -- on the asteroid as it approached. "This is a rare event, and we learned a lot," Brozovic told CNN. Follow space and science news on Light Years . Though the space agency classified the asteroid as a "potentially hazardous object," it posed no threat of a collision, according to NASA's Near Earth Object Program. If the asteroid had crashed into Earth, it could have caused a 4,000-megaton blast and a magnitude 7.0 earthquake, according to scientists at Purdue University. If it fell into the ocean, it could have caused a 70-foot-high tsunami within 60 miles of the crash site, the experts said. The last time a space rock in the same league as 2005 YU55 passed as close to Earth was in 1976, NASA said. The next similar encounter is projected for 2028, Brozovic said.

Goldstone antennas are very sensitive radio telescopes used to investigate quasars, radar mapping of planets and comets. Scientists plan to reconstruct the shape of the asteroid with a resolution as fine as 13 feet (4 meters) using the antennas. Share your view of the asteroid . The approach also provides a rare opportunity for amateur astronomers to directly observe an asteroid with optical telescopes. But because the object is so dark, NASA said stargazers would need a telescope with an aperture of 6 inches (15cm) or larger to see it. "It's visible across North America in the ensuing hours, dim at 11th or 12th magnitude and moving fast," Sky & Telescope magazine said. CNN's Sean Morris contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Tuesday, asteroid 2005 YU55 passed within a relatively close distance of Earth, coming within 202,000 miles. While this might seem concerning, NASA promptly announced that there was no risk of a collision with the planet.  "This is a rare event, and we learned a lot," one researcher said about the asteroid. Indeed, the close approach gave astronomers a unique opportunity to study the object up close. The asteroid is about 1,300 feet wide and is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid. However, despite its classification, there was never any danger of it hitting Earth on this occasion. NASA was closely monitoring the asteroid's trajectory as it approached Earth. One of their biggest assets in this regard was the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, which captured radar images of the asteroid as it passed by. Scientists were able to learn a great deal from these images, studying features of the asteroid's surface in detail. Despite the excitement around the asteroid's close approach, NASA was careful to emphasize that there was no danger of it colliding with Earth. "Asteroid 2005 YU55 poses no threat of an Earth collision over, at the very least, the next 100 years," said Don Yeomans of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office. While the asteroid's trajectory is not a threat to the planet, it is nevertheless being closely monitored by astronomers. 2005 YU55 passes Earth regularly - about every 14 years - and each time it does, scientists have a chance to learn more about it. Even though it wasn't in direct danger of a collision, the asteroid's close approach was still a rare and fascinating event that many astronomers will study for years to come. In conclusion, while asteroid 2005 YU55 made a close pass by Earth on Tuesday, there was never any danger of a collision with the planet. NASA used the opportunity to study the object up close, including taking radar images of its surface. While it remains classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid, there is no foreseeable threat of it colliding with Earth in the next 100 years.
