article: Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese man who admitted to raping and strangling a British teacher has been found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Tatsuya Ichihashi was convicted Thursday of rape, murder and discarding a body after a month-long trial that riveted Japan in much the same way the Casey Anthony trial did the United States. The victim Lindsay Hawker's battered, naked body was found in a bathtub in Ichihashi's apartment in March 2007 -- buried in sand. Ichihashi then went on the run, altering his face through cosmetic surgery several times to elude arrest. After he was arrested two and half years later, Ichihashi acknowledged killing Hawker. But the question at the center of the trial was whether he intended to. Hawker's parents who were in Chiba District Court, east of Tokyo, for the verdict had asked prosecutors to hand down the harshest sentence: death. The case began in March 2007 when surveillance video showed Ichihashi meeting up with Hawker at a coffee shop in the town of Ichikawa in Chiba Prefecture for an English lesson. Later, he told Hawker to follow him to his apartment so he could pay her, prosecutors said. After the killing when police arrived to interview Ichihashi, he fled. He snipped his own lips with a pair of scissors, cut off two moles and -- as he flitted from one construction job to another across the country -- he would drop in at clinics to undergo more cosmetic surgery, prosecutors said. Authorities offered a 10 million yen reward ($127,000) reward for information leading to Ichihashi's capture. They finally caught up with him at a ferry terminal in the western Japanese city of Osaka in November 2009. Ichihashi went on trial in July, amid wall-to-wall coverage in local media. Just as in the case of Casey Anthony -- the Florida mother who was accused and later acquitted of killing her 2-year-old daugther -- television stations offered play-by-play accounts of every development. Before the verdict was read Thursday, hundreds of people lined up outside court to take part in a lottery that would allow 57 of them seats inside.

chatgpt: After years of evading law enforcement, Tatsuya Ichihashi has finally admitted to the rape and murder of British teacher, Lindsay Ann Hawker. The case has received intense media coverage both in Japan and across the world. Authorities have been investigating the case for over a decade, and Ichihashi has been a fugitive since 2007. During this time, he underwent extensive cosmetic surgery in order to change his appearance and evade detection. However, he was finally captured in November 2009 when he was recognized in a local convenience store. The case hinges on whether Ichihashi intended to commit the crime. In his confession, Ichihashi claimed that he had intended to rob and sexually assault Hawker, but had not initially planned on killing her. He then panicked and strangled her when she fought back. Despite this confession, the prosecution argues that Ichihashi had premeditated the rape and murder, pointing to evidence such as the fact that he had purchased rope and other materials before the attack. The defense, on the other hand, has argued that Ichihashi was not of sound mind at the time of the crime and that the cosmetic surgery was evidence of his guilt. The trial has been closely followed by the Japanese public, with many expressing shock and outrage at the heinous crime. Others have criticized Ichihashi for his attempts to evade capture and for his lack of remorse. The verdict is expected to be announced in the coming days. Hawker's family has also been closely involved in the case, publicly expressing their grief and demanding justice for their daughter. They have attended court hearings and spoken to journalists, describing Hawker as a "kind and caring" young woman who had come to Japan to pursue her dreams of teaching. Despite the lengthy investigation and trial, many questions remain unanswered about Hawker's death. However, with Ichihashi's confession and the evidence presented in court, Japanese authorities are hopeful that justice will finally be served.
