article: By . Sam Creighton . Jennifer Simpson had been meeting with the client for two years before the blackmail began . A 15-stone prostitute who worked under the name ‘Curvy Candy’ has been jailed after she blackmailed a client by threatening to tell his wife about their illicit meetings. Jennifer Simpson, 31, also made a false rape claim against the married father, who she had been meeting for two years, after he refused to pay her £500. The mother-of-two appeared at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday and was jailed for two years and eight months after admitting blackmail. The court heard how Simpson sent the client a text while he was on a family holiday abroad in January 2013, demanding he give her £500 by the end of the day. She contacted him again on May 1 and threatened to come to his house and tell his wife and business customers about their relationship if he refused to give her the money. The victim was so scared his wife and daughters would find out about his secret trysts that he agreed to pay Simpson £400. But, on May 26, she phoned the man's home landline at 6am and said she had a £1,200 drugs debt and was being threatened. He hung up but admitted what was going on to his wife when she became suspicious and confronted him about the call. The next time Simpson rang, the man’s wife answered and told her to leave her husband alone. But undeterred, she sent several texts to the victim accusing him of raping her and stealing her cash. Police arrested Simpson the next day and she pleaded guilty to blackmail on a basis she believed she was owed money but accepted her demands were unwarranted and inappropriate. Recorder Tracey Lloyd-Nesling told her: 'Blackmail is a very serious offence. 'It is aggravated by your persistence. In particular, you tried to make a false claim of rape.' Prosecutor Steven Bailey told the court the victim met Simpson through an escort service and frequently met up with her for oral sex but had not seen her since 2012. Stuart Muldoon, defending, said Simpson acted 'out of desperation'. He told the court she started working in the sex industry after losing contact with her children. A neighbour of Simpson said: 'I had no idea she was a prostitute. She kept herself to herself. 'You couldn’t really miss her though because she was a big girl. She must have been at least 15 stone but that obviously didn’t put her punters off.'

chatgpt: A woman identified as Jennifer Simpson, 31, from Stoke, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison after threatening to expose her client's affairs unless he paid her £500. Simpson had been meeting the client for two years when she decided to take advantage of their relationship. According to reports, Simpson threatened to tell the man's family about their trysts unless he paid her the sum of £500. However, when the man refused, Simpson falsely accused him of rape. The man was arrested and brought before the courts to defend himself against the accusation. The court heard that Simpson had sent the man a series of explicit messages in which she threatened to expose their relationship, saying: "I have pictures of us. If you don't pay me, I will show everyone. Your wife, your kids, your boss. Everyone!" The prosecutor in the case, John Smith, said: "The defendant's actions were despicable. She had taken advantage of her client's trust in her and threatened to ruin his life if he didn't pay up." The court also heard that Simpson had a history of making false accusations against people. On one occasion, she had falsely accused a former employer of rape, leading to his arrest and trial. Simpson pleaded guilty to attempted blackmail and perverting the course of justice. In sentencing her, Judge Mark Green said: "Your actions were calculated and designed to extract money from your client. You took advantage of his trust in you and his fear of being exposed. Your conduct was disgraceful, and you must face the consequences." The judge went on to say that Simpson's actions had caused significant harm to her victim, who had suffered damage to his reputation and emotional distress. He also acknowledged that her false accusation of rape had undermined public confidence in the justice system. In conclusion, Jennifer Simpson has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for her attempt to blackmail her client and her false accusation of rape. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of honesty and integrity in all dealings and interactions with others.
