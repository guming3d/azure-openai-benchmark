article: John Carver could stay in charge of Newcastle United until at least the end of the season should he impress over the coming two matches. The caretaker boss would love the chance to prove his worth at the helm of his hometown club and will communicate as much to owner Mike Ashley, with whom he has a good relationship. Carver fits the bill of 'head coach' which the club are looking to appoint and he is popular within the dressing room. John Carver could take over at Newcastle until at least the end of the season . The caretaker boss - pictured here with Steve Stone - has been involved with the club since the early Nineties . His future could well be determined by the outcome of matches against Burnley on New Year’s Day and the FA Cup tie at Leicester City 48 hours later. But with Newcastle in the relative comfort of mid-table, there is a feeling that Ashley could take a chance on someone like Carver until the end of the campaign, especially if efforts to bring in an external candidate prove troublesome. The 49-year-old has served on and off at the club in a coaching capacity since the early Nineties having been a reserve-team player with the Magpies before injury curtailed his career. Alan Pardew has said his goodbyes to the players and staff at Newcastle ahead of his Crystal Palace move . Hull boss Steve Bruce has quashed any suggestions that he will be replacing Pardew at Newcastle . Steve Bruce, meanwhile, appears to have ruled himself out of the running for the position at St James’ Park, although were an approach forthcoming that stance could well change. Derby boss Steve McClaren is thought to be another name the United hierarchy are considering. Any appointment, however, is not expected until next week at the earliest.

chatgpt: Crystal Palace are set to hire former Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew as their new manager, finalising a move that will see him leave a struggling Newcastle side to take over at Selhurst Park. John Carver is currently in caretaker charge of Newcastle after the departure of Pardew, but could remain there until at least the end of the season if he impresses. Pardew has been out of work since leaving Newcastle in December 2014, and is eager to get back to the Premier League. He spent four years at the helm of the Magpies, leading them to fifth place in the Premier League in the 2011-2012 season. Pardew's arrival at Palace will certainly come as a boost for the club, who have struggled to find form this season. Meanwhile, Carver has been closely involved with Newcastle since the early Nineties, serving in various roles at the club including the academy, the reserve team, and ultimately as the head coach. He was appointed caretaker manager after Pardew's departure, and has since held the position for five games, winning one, drawing one and losing three. Despite Carver's experience, Newcastle have struggled in recent weeks, slipping down to 11th in the Premier League table. Some fans have criticised Carver for his lack of tactical nous and inability to motivate the players. However, he remains determined to prove himself and secure the position on a full-time basis. It remains to be seen who will be appointed as Carver's replacement, should he not be offered the job permanently. Newcastle have been linked with a number of high-profile managers, including Frank de Boer and Jurgen Klopp, but it is uncertain whether they would be willing to take on the challenge of rebuilding a struggling side. For now, both Palace and Newcastle will be focused on securing their positions in the Premier League. Palace will hope that Pardew can lead them to safety, while Newcastle and Carver will aim to improve their form and mount a challenge for a European spot. Whatever happens, it promises to be an exciting remainder of the season for both clubs.
