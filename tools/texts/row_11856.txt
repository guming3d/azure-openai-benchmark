article: (CNN) -- Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was rebounding Saturday after hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid during snow and ice that snarled air traffic across Europe, authorities said. Flight delays at de Gaulle were expected to decrease as the day went on. Officials could not give an exact number of flight cancellations. The weather improved Saturday and shipments of de-icing fluid from Charlotte, North Carolina, and Germany, will help alleviate future problems, officials said. Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, minister for transportation and ecology, said she wants more information on the fluid shortage. About 300 people who spent the night at the airport were provided with food and blankets, officials said. Transport ministry official Thierry Mariani paid them a visit and volunteers provided stuff animals for children and gifts of chocolate. Some passengers and others were critical of what happened at de Gaulle, but officials blamed the situation largely on the weather. Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeoan told the news agency AFP the airline had not been informed of the problems. "It is surprising and somewhat [impermissible] that an airport such as Roissy Charles de Gaulle could experience such a supply problem. It is an isolated case in Europe," said Gourgeoan. Meanwhile, the Brussels, Belgium, airport reported that operations were nearly back to normal Saturday, with two of three runways operational. Gatwick Airport and Heathrow Airports in London said airlines were operating, but some delays or cancellations were possible. Airports across Europe are still struggling to get passengers to their destinations after they were snarled by unexpected snow over the weekend. Nearly 2,000 passengers at de Gaulle were moved from Terminal 2E to other parts of the airport on Friday because of the weight of snow on a roof, French authorities said, calling the measure "preventative." Part of the roof of that terminal collapsed in 2004, shortly after the state-of-the-art building was inaugurated. Four people were killed, media reports at the time said. About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said. French authorities earlier Friday asked airlines to cancel half their morning flights to and from the airport because the de-icing fluid was running low. That led to the cancellation of 400 flights Friday morning -- 200 arrivals and 200 departures. Then, early in the afternoon, authorities asked airlines to scrap a third of their flights for the rest of the day. Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London. Paris' second airport, Orly, has not had to cancel flights because it is not running out of glycol, which is using for de-icing, authorities said. CNN's Niki Cook and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Officials at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris are investigating a shortage of de-icing fluid that caused flight cancellations and delays during last week's winter storm. The airport had to cancel and delay hundreds of flights due to the shortage, which left planes stranded on the tarmac and passengers frustrated and angry. On Christmas Day, however, the airport's operations were running more smoothly thanks to a shipment of de-icing fluid that arrived just in time. Despite about a foot of snow falling on the de Gaulle roof, officials were able to keep the runways clear and minimize disruptions. The winter storm caused chaos at many European airports, with flights delayed and cancelled across the continent. However, as the snow has cleared and the holiday period comes to an end, airports are starting to recover from the long delays and closures. At Charles de Gaulle, officials are working to improve their supply chain to ensure that a de-icing fluid shortage does not cause disruptions again. With temperatures continuing to drop and more snow predicted in the coming weeks, it is important that airports have enough de-icing fluid to keep their runways and planes safe. The shortage of de-icing fluid has also highlighted the importance of airport infrastructure and maintenance. Many airports are struggling to keep up with the demands of modern air travel, with aging facilities and equipment in need of upgrades or replacements. As air travel continues to grow in popularity, there is a pressing need for airports to invest in their infrastructure and technology. This includes upgrading runways, terminals, and equipment, as well as investing in new technologies like automated baggage systems and facial recognition software. In addition to improving infrastructure, airports also need to focus on improving their customer service and communication during disruptions. Passengers stranded and delayed during last week's storm reported poor communication from airport officials, and many were left frustrated and confused. Airports must prioritize clear and timely communication with passengers during disruptions, providing regular updates and alternative travel options. This can help to minimize frustration and inconvenience for passengers, and improve the overall customer experience. While the winter storm caused significant disruptions, officials at Charles de Gaulle are confident that lessons have been learned and improvements will be made. With a renewed focus on infrastructure, technology, and customer service, airports can better manage disruptions and provide a smoother, more enjoyable travel experience for passengers.
