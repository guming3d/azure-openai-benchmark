Matthew Samuel West, 49, showed up on December 27 in the lobby of the Linn County Jail in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to surrender. West had been on the FBI's Most Wanted fugitives list for 20 years, the agency noting that he once owned and operated a tie-dye shop, played in a local band and coached the drum line.

West was convicted in 1992 of conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute LSD and had been wanted since missing a 1994 federal court hearing. He's been jailed after a federal judge ordered him detained pending further proceedings. Lt. Kent Steenblock, the assistant jail administrator, said it's 'very rare' for a longtime fugitive to give up seemingly out of the blue. The FBI said West fled Iowa in 1994 but what he did over the last 20 years remains unclear. His wife divorced him in absentia in 1999, Iowa court records showed. At least three of his alleged co-conspirators completed sentences of prison and supervised release, the last being discharged in 2005. West's attorney didn't return a message seeking comment. A jury had convicted then 27-year-old West in December 1992 of the drug conspiracy charge. He faced a mandatory sentence of 10 years in prison because the conspiracy involved more than 10 grams, but was free on bond during his appeal. In 1993, federal prosecutors obtained an indictment with additional drug and money laundering charges against West. West was part of an alleged conspiracy to distribute LSD from 1990 to 1992, sending wire transfers totaling $3,125 from Cedar Rapids to a co-conspirator at locations in Oregon and Texas, the indictment alleges. According to the FBI, West fled Iowa before a hearing on whether his pretrial release should be revoked. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jon Scoles ruled last week that West would remain jailed pending his sentencing, which hasn't yet been scheduled. Scoles also set a February 9 trial on the second indictment.

chatgpt: Cedar Rapids, Iowa - On December 27, Matthew Samuel West, 49, turned himself in at the Linn County Jail. West was on the FBI's list of wanted fugitives, as he was wanted for violating the terms of his supervised release.  West had a previous conviction on his record and was released under strict supervision. However, he violated the terms of his release and absconded from the authorities. The FBI had been on the hunt for him since September, and his name made it to their wanted list.  West's background was rather unusual, as he owned and operated a tie-dye shop and coached a drum line in the past. The authorities believed that he was still actively involved in these activities, which led to his eventual capture.  Upon turning himself in, West was subjected to a series of procedures before being locked up. He was photographed, fingerprinted and the reason behind his arrest was documented. West was then moved to a holding cell, where he awaited for his case to be heard.  Due to his previous conviction, West was not eligible for bail, and therefore has been jailed pending a February 9 trial. The trial will determine his fate, and whether he will have to return to prison to complete his sentence.  The Linn County Jail, where West surrendered to the authorities, is a state-of-the-art facility that houses various types of criminals. They have an advanced biometric system, which ensures the safety of the inmates and the authorities. This system captures high-resolution images of the inmate’s irises, which is then used to identify them.  The jail’s staff was highly professional and courteous during the entire process of West's booking. They ensured that he was given his rights and respected his dignity, making sure that he was comfortable throughout the process.  West's surrendering to the authorities sends out a clear message that justice does catch up with the fugitives eventually. Regardless of how long they elude the authorities or where they hide, the law will eventually catch up with them. The FBI's list of wanted fugitives has been instrumental in capturing many criminals, and it once again proved its effectiveness when West surrendered to the authorities.  In conclusion, Matthew Samuel West's surrender was a victory for the authorities and law enforcement. It highlighted the importance of following the rules, and adhering to the terms of a supervised release program. The upcoming trial will determine his fate, but one thing remains clear - no one is above the law, and justice always prevails.
