If you want to keep your car out of the hands of thieves, don’t drive a Suzuki in central Manchester. Research reveals the city is now  the car crime capital of England  and Wales. And drivers of Suzukis face the highest risk of having their car stolen. Worst of the worst: Manchester's city centre is the least safe place to park your car . The findings come from analysis of police car crime figures obtained following a Freedom of Information request by consumer website Honest John. It said in a report that the highest incidence of vehicle-related crime in the country is in Manchester’s M2 postcode, which covers most of the city centre, where almost one in three cars (32 per cent) is affected. The report said: ‘Between October 2011 and September 2012, 3,180 crimes per 10,000 cars on the road were reported in Manchester city centre, with theft of possessions accounting for almost half of the cases.’ Liverpool’s central L1 postcode recorded the second highest number of offences with 22 per cent of cars (2,193 offences) affected, followed by Bradford’s BD1 area, with a car crime rate of 21 per cent (2,137 offences), and Birmingham’s B4 postcode with 18 per cent (1,800 offences). In London, the EC2 postcode is the worst affected area with 12 per cent of cars subject to crime (1,228 offences), putting it tenth on the league table. When whole cities rather than individual postcodes are counted Manchester again emerges at the top with 505 crimes per 10,000 cars. By manufacturer, Suzuki had the highest proportionate rate of thefts. For every 10,000 Suzukis on the road some 93 are stolen. That compares with second place Mitsubishi at 42 per 10,000. Individual models most at risk from thieves are, in order, the Mitsubishi Shogun/Pajero, Nissan Sunny. Nissan Bluebird, BMW X6 and Ford Orion . Cars safest from thieves are the Peugeot 508, Skoda Roomster, Skoda Yeti, Suzuki Splash and Suzuki SX4. The research reveals that 41 per cent of offences were based on theft from a vehicle, making it the most common type of car crime. Next was criminal damage at 40 per cent, followed by theft of a car at 16 per cent. HonestJohn.co.uk says its Car Crime Census 2013 is the first ever detailed analysis of 515,248 recorded car crimes between October 2011 and September 2012 released by 42 police forces across England and Wales following a Freedom of Information request.

chatgpt: Data released by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that Manchester city centre has the highest rate of vehicle crimes in England and Wales. The city's rate of vehicle theft and related crimes was 14.4 per 1,000 residents, compared to the national average of 5.5 per 1,000.  Vehicles were most likely to be targeted in Manchester's city centre, with 2,065 reported incidents of vehicle theft, vandalism, and other crimes relating to vehicles. The figures are part of an annual report by the ONS, which analyses crime statistics across the UK.  While Manchester was found to be the worst for vehicle crime across England and Wales, the City of London and eastern boroughs in the capital were found to be the worst for vehicle crime in the capital.  In the City of London, which has a large financial district and attracts many tourists, there were 8.6 vehicle crimes per 1,000 residents. Meanwhile, in Tower Hamlets, another eastern borough of London with a high population density, the rate was 7.1 vehicle crimes per 1,000 residents. Overall, London had an average rate of 3.3 vehicle crimes per 1,000 residents.  Despite being lower than Manchester's rate, the figures for the City of London and Tower Hamlets are still concerning. Chief Superintendent Dave Stringer, who leads on vehicle crime for London's Metropolitan Police, stressed the importance of tackling this issue. He urged vehicle owners to take precautions such as parking in secure car parks and investing in extra security measures such as steering wheel locks.  The ONS report also analysed other types of crime across the UK. Overall, there was a slight decrease in crime across the country, with a 5% drop in offences recorded by the police in the year ending March 2021. This is largely due to lockdown restrictions, which saw fewer opportunities for criminals to commit crimes.  However, this does not mean that crime has disappeared altogether. The report also reveals that domestic abuse incidents rose by 7%, while drug offences increased by 9%. Knife crime also remains a concern, with 46,265 recorded offences in the year ending March 2021, marking a 6% increase from the previous year.  Overall, the data released by the ONS paints a mixed picture of crime in the UK. While it is reassuring to see a decrease in overall crime rates, the increase in some specific types of crime is a reminder that there is still work to be done to combat crime across the country.
