article: (CNN) -- The number of people worldwide without access to a toilet -- no public restroom, no outhouse, no latrine, no smallest room -- is a whopping 2.6 billion. That's four out of ten people. The bucket toilet is the only thing on offer for millions of black South Africans. According to the World Toilet Organization, 2.2 million people, predominantly children, die every year from diarrhea -- more than from malaria, from AIDS, from TB. That number dwarfs any casualties related to violent conflict. These figures are intrinsically related. The underestimation of fecal contamination is staggering, sobering -- and unfortunately, silencing. Singaporean social-entrepreneur Jack Sim founded the non-profit World Toilet Organization ("the other WTO") in 2001, as a support network for all existing organizations. It now includes 151 members from 53 countries, which meet once a year to network, discuss sanitation issues and work together toward "eliminating the toilet taboo and delivering sustainable sanitation." Goal number one: Making sanitation speakable. "What we don't discuss, we can't improve," insists Sim. This year, the World Toilet Summit & Expo 2008 was held from November 4-6 in Macau under the theme "Driving Sustainable Sanitation through Market-Based Initiatives." Indeed, not only is sanitation a good idea, it's a good investment. Biosolids can be composted into fertilizer, sewage can be processed into methane biogas, and even simple latrines in India are producing compost and fertilizer. "Globally, if universal sanitation were achieved by 2015, it would cost $95 billion, but it would save $660 billion," writes Rose George in her newly released book "The Big Necessity." Real-world examples follow: "When Peru had a cholera outbreak in 1991, it cost $1 billion to contain but could have been prevented with $100 million of better sanitation measures." Or even more alarming: "Pakistan, for example, spends 47 times more on its military budget than on water and sanitation, though it loses 120,000 people to diarrhea a year." So while 2.6 billion people have no toilet, how many millions of us simply "flush and forget"? Eco-sanitation, or the problem of dealing efficiently and ecologically with sewer systems, wastewater, treatment and purification, is no less a serious one. In the UK alone, the sewage system emits some 28.8 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. As sewers become overloaded with urban development, drought strikes various regions of the earth, and potable water becomes increasingly scarce, even the flush toilet is now put into question. Today, those who care are looking at innovative toilet and waste-disposal solutions from India, China and other parts of the developing world, where attitudes and habits are still evolving and open to change. Don't forget, World Toilet Day is November 19.

chatgpt: 2.6 billion people around the world have no access to a basic human necessity â€“ a toilet. This basic need has become a serious issue that many people and organizations are fighting to address. According to the World Toilet Organization, 2.2 million people die annually from diarrhea caused by poor sanitation. The World Toilet Organization is taking action to address the lack of sanitation facilities around the globe. They currently include 151 members from 53 different countries. Their goal is to provide adequate sanitation facilities such as toilets and waste management systems to those who need it most. Rose George, author of the book "The Big Necessity", estimates that universal sanitation by 2015 would cost $95 billion but save $660 billion in health costs and increased productivity. This illustrates the potential impact that adequate sanitation facilities can have on the well-being of people and economies. However, the problem does not end with simply providing toilets and waste management systems. Flush toilets and sewer systems have been the go-to solution for many countries, but they also pose a problem of their own to ecological sanitation.  As more countries try to address the issue of sanitation, they are now looking at alternative solutions that will not have a negative impact on the environment. Ecological sanitation is one solution that has been gaining popularity. Instead of flushing waste away, ecological sanitation systems aim to use it as a resource.  A popular method of ecological sanitation is composting toilets. These systems turn human waste into compost that can be used as fertilizer for crops. This is a sustainable solution that can provide sanitation and improve food security at the same time. Furthermore, ecological sanitation systems can even be implemented in densely populated urban areas. One example is the eThekwini Municipality in Durban, South Africa. The city implemented an ecological sanitation system that is now providing sanitation services to over 10,000 people in the city. The lack of sanitation facilities is a serious issue facing billions of people around the world. However, there are solutions being implemented that are improving the health and well-being of communities, while also taking into consideration the impact on the environment. As the world continues to address this issue, it is important to consider all possible solutions and weigh their impact on both human health and the environment.
