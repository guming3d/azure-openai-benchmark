The captain of this cruise ship may well be wondering if his clever short-cut was a good idea after all. His vessel had to be dragged creaking and scraping through the Corinth Canal, a man-made waterway that cuts through Greece between the Aegean sea to the east and the Ionian to the west. At 154-feet wide, the jagged passageway is barely the width of a football pitch and is so narrow that most modern ocean freighters are unable to pass through without either getting wedged or severely damaging their paintwork.

The canal is nowadays mostly used by tourist ships as cargo vessels have grown too big over the ages. It was conceived in 620 BC by the Tyrant of Corinth. But he was over-ruled by the Oracle of Delphi who feared upsetting Poseidon, the sea god, and so built a roadway instead. Around 300 years later, Demetrios, the Macedonian king, began building the canal, but it was the Roman emperor Nero who, in 66 AD, moved the work into top gear by importing 6,000 prisoners from Galilee to do the digging. He was sentenced to death two years later, bringing work to a halt. Short cut: The Corinth Canal is a man-made waterway that cuts through Greece between the Aegean sea to the east and the Ionian to the west . Some 1,600 years after that, the Venetians, who then controlled the Peloponnisos, took up the baton. But it was not until 1869 that Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French architect of the Suez Canal, came along and finished it off in 11 years. Part of the problem was that builders had to cut a 250ft-deep channel through rock. Now the canal, 24.6 metres wide and 7.5 metres deep, is used by 12,000 vessels a year.

chatgpt: The Corinth Canal is a remarkable feat of engineering and a significant landmark in Greece. This man-made waterway, which cuts through Greece, connects the Aegean Sea to the east and the Ionian Sea to the west, saving a 430-mile journey all the way around the Peloponnese. The canal operates on a one-way only system. The idea of building the Corinth Canal was conceived by the Tyrant of Corinth back in 620 BC. However, it was not until thousands of years later that the canal was finally completed in 1869. Various rulers through the ages continued digging, but it was not until the modern era that technology finally caught up to make the dream a reality. The construction of the Corinth Canal was undoubtedly complicated. The waterway is 3.2 miles long and only 70 feet wide. Excavation workers had to dig through solid rock, making the task even more challenging. To make matters worse, the project was interrupted multiple times by wars, financial issues, and technical difficulties, making the overall process much longer than anticipated. Despite the challenges, the canal has proven to be a tremendous asset to the Greek economy. Today, the canal is used mainly for tourism and shipping, with approximately 11,000 ships passing through every year. The canal serves as a vital link between the Aegean and Ionian seas, with cargo and passenger ships benefiting from the shortened journey time.  As ships move through the canal, they must adhere to a one-way only system that regulates traffic flow. Due to its length, it takes around 40 minutes for a ship to travel the length of the canal. However, the Corinth Canal is so narrow that it is one of the most dangerous canals in the world, and ship captains have to exercise extreme caution when navigating it. Aside from its practical usage, the Corinth Canal has also become a popular tourist attraction. Visitors can take boat rides along the canal, marveling at the engineering feat that allows massive ships to pass through. The stunning views of the surrounding landscape - including steep cliffs and turquoise waters - make the boat ride an unforgettable experience. In conclusion, the Corinth Canal is one of the most impressive man-made waterways in the world. Its construction was a monumental achievement that took centuries to complete, and it continues to play a crucial role in the Greek economy today. Additionally, its stunning beauty draws visitors from all over the world, making it a must-visit destination for any traveler heading to Greece.
