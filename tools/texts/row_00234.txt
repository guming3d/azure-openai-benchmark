article: By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . Gus Poyet has warned Sunderland to heed their Loftus Road 'wake-up call' in the international break to jump-start their Barclays Premier League campaign. The Black Cats are still searching their first league win of the new season after slipping up 1-0 against QPR on Saturday. Charlie Austin fired the hosts' first goal of the new term, denying Poyet's men the chance to get off the league win mark. Decisive: Charlie Austin scored the only goal of the game to give QPR all three points . Not happy: Poyet says his side need to improve after a slow start to the Premier League season . A frustrated Poyet lambasted Sunderland's defensive lapses and profligacy in possession, admitting he will take his squad to task ahead of their next league clash, at home to Tottenham on September 13. 'To lose that control and momentum, in those 15 minutes before the break; they made us suffer,' he said. 'It's got to be a wake-up call for us really. There's no place for this. 'We put ourselves under pressure, giving the ball away cheaply in our own half.' Adam Johnson produced two perfectly weighted through-balls for Patrick van Aanholt and Steven Fletcher as Sunderland took the early initiative at QPR. Under pressure: Sebastian Larsson goes down under a challenge as Sunderland failed to convert chances . Both men failed to provide a finish to match the approach play, however, and the Wearsiders paid the ultimate price in defeat. Austin blasted home just before half-time to break the deadlock, and despite several further half-chances Sunderland were unable to claim any points. Poyet is still chasing several new recruits ahead of Monday night's transfer deadline, to add to his stand-out summer capture of Jack Rodwell. Once the transfer frenzy subsides, though, the former Chelsea midfielder will relish an extended run with his squad on the training pitch. 'The timing of the goal didn't help,' said Poyet. 'I don't know if it was overconfidence after a decent start, but there's no place for that at all. 'We know the numbers we've got to work with, so we've just got to get on with it now.' Transfers: Rodwell (right) is Sunderland's main signing so far, but Poyet wants more new players .
highlights: Charlie Austin goal enough to beat Gus Poyet's side . Sunderland missed good chances as they seek first league win . Poyet wants to bring in a few new players on Monday . Sunderland face Tottenham next week as they try to kick-star their season .

chatgpt: West Bromwich Albion clinched a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Sunderland at the Hawthorns on Saturday. The only goal of the game came from striker Charlie Austin, who latched onto a cross from Darnell Furlong in the 64th minute to secure a crucial three points for the Baggies.  Sunderland, who are yet to register a league win this season, created several good opportunities to level the scores, but a combination of poor finishing and strong goalkeeping from Sam Johnstone denied them.  Manager Gus Poyet was left frustrated with his side's lack of clinical finishing, and he emphasized the need to bring in new reinforcements in the upcoming January transfer window, with Monday's deadline fast approaching.  "We missed some really good chances today, and we need to be more ruthless in front of goal," said Poyet. "I'm hoping to bring in a few new players on Monday to help us in that department." The Black Cats had started the season brightly, with a hard-fought draw at Tottenham Hotspur followed by a convincing home win over Brighton & Hove Albion. However, a series of disappointing results have left them languishing at the bottom of the Premier League table. Sunderland are next set to face Tottenham Hotspur next week, in what promises to be a tough test for Poyet's side. Despite the difficult start to the season, Poyet is optimistic that his team can turn things around and climb up the table. "We know that we've got a tough game against Spurs next week, but we'll be ready for it," said the Sunderland boss. "We just need to focus on our own game and make sure that we take any chances that come our way." West Brom, on the other hand, will be buoyed by their victory over Sunderland and will look to build on that result in their forthcoming matches. The Baggies currently sit in 11th place in the table, with four points from their opening three games. Manager Slaven Bilic praised his team's performance, particularly that of goalscorer Charlie Austin. "Charlie's a top striker and he showed that today with a fantastic finish," said Bilic. "We're delighted to have him in the team and we'll be looking for more goals from him as the season progresses." Overall, it was a hard-fought win for West Brom and a disappointing day for Sunderland, who continue to search for their first league win of the season. Poyet will be hoping that his team can build on their positive start to the season and start converting their chances into goals, while Bilic will be looking to keep his team's momentum going in the coming weeks.
