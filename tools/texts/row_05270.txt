The event was marked by a colourful parade of 50 Imps which made a 300-mile journey to the car manufacturer's base in Coventry. The Rootes factory in Linwood, Renfrewshire, played an important part in the automobile industry. It was at this factory that the first Imp car was produced. The car was designed to meet the needs of the growing number of families who needed an affordable and efficient car. The Imp, which was a compact car, was designed by Tim Fry and Tim Fry was able to create a car that was both stylish and practical. The car was powered by a 875cc engine which made it capable of reaching a top speed of 90 miles per hour. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first Imp car, scores of enthusiasts brought their cars to the celebration that was held in Linwood. The highlight of the celebration was the parade of 50 Imps which travelled from Linwood to Coventry, a distance of 300 miles.

One Imp owner attending the celebration said, "The Imp was so popular, and it was a car that meant a lot to many families. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first Imp being produced is a great way to mark a car that has left a lasting legacy."
