chatgpt: Swedish insurance company Folksam has turned to a creative solution for their latest advertisement. Instead of hiring a professional advertising firm, they tapped into the creativity of one of their customers. The ad, a hilarious and heartwarming clip, was designed by Maria Grimaldi, a trained dancer who has been a Folksam customer for over 20 years. Maria's idea was to make an ad that would leave a lasting impression on viewers, and that's exactly what she did. The star of the ad is a charming cat named Rolf who gets into all sorts of trouble throughout the clip. Using green screen technology, no animals were actually harmed during the making of this ad. The ad opens with Rolf innocently playing in a garden before he accidentally steps on a rake, knocking himself unconscious. The scene then cuts to Rolf being taken care of by paramedics who rush in to save him. Next, Rolf is seen taking a leisurely bike ride, but he soon takes a spill and ends up in a cast. In the final scene, Rolf is charging towards a group of firefighters, who seem to be trying to save him from a burning building. The final scene is where the green screen technology comes into play. Instead of using real flames and risking harm to the cat, the flames were added in post-production. According to Folksam, they wanted to create an advertisement that was both entertaining and informative. By using Rolf as the star of the ad, they were able to make a strong emotional connection with viewers. The ad has been widely popular with viewers, racking up over 2 million views on YouTube since its release. Viewers seem to love the playful and endearing nature of Rolf, and the fact that the company allowed a customer to create the ad makes it all the more special. Folksam is known for their innovative and customer-focused approach to business. They have been ranked as one of Sweden's most sustainable companies, and their commitment to sustainability is what drove them to use green screen technology in their latest advertisement. In fact, the company has been using sustainable practices for several years. For example, their head office in Stockholm is powered by 100% renewable energy. The use of green screen technology is just one way that Folksam is working to reduce their environmental impact. They have also invested in sustainable investments such as wind power and have implemented several initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint. Overall, the story behind Folksam's latest ad is a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation. By allowing a customer to design their ad, and using sustainable practices during its production, they were able to create an eye-catching, entertaining, and eco-friendly advertisement that has captured the hearts of millions around the world.
