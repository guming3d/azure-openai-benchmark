article: Tom Buchanan never told anyone about the shooting that left him carrying a bullet in his gut for 70 years . A bullet that wounded Tom Buchanan when he was a young man took 70 years to kill him. The Chicago resident died on Sunday from complications from a bullet that he carried in his abdomen for more than seven decades. He was 87 years old. Chicago police detectives now how the task of cracking the coldest of cold cases: Who shot him in the 1940s? Buchanan never talked about the shooting or hinted who did it. His 82-year-old cousin, Mattie Matthews, one of his only surviving relatives, said she only knew he had been shot because she remembers her mother and his mother talking about. Buchanan was admitted to Chicago's Mercy Hospital on Saturday, days after he began feeling pain in his gut. By the time Ms Matthews convinced him to seek medical care, he was holding his stomach and in severe pain. He was pronounced dead shortly after 11am on Sunday. An autopsy by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office determined that 'gunshot ultimately caused the complications to his abdomen that ultimately killed him.' His death was ruled a homicide. His heart disease was listed as a contributing factor in his death. Frank Shuftan, a spokesman for the medical examiner's office, said family members that investigators have spoken to have been able to shed little light on the shooting. 'We don't know anything about it,' he said. Ms Matthews, said Buchanan, a retired steel worker, never served in the military, so he could not have been shot in the war. She said Buchanan, a quiet man who never married or had any children, died without telling her what happened - even though she was probably the closest relative and friend that he had. All she knew about the shooting came from a conversation she overheard among grown-ups when she was a child. 'I was about 10 or 12 years old when I heard my aunt and my mother talking about how he had gotten shot but I never heard anything else and he (Buchanan) never talked about it to me,' she said of the shooting. She believes it must have happened not long after Buchanan and his mother moved from Mississippi to Chicago. Matthews said she recalled that conversation last week when Buchanan started talking about a pain in his gut. She said her cousin was the kind of man who didn't want anybody to make a fuss, and initially wouldn't even consider leaving the independent living facility on the city's South Side to see a doctor. 'But when I went Saturday he was holding his stomach and I told him I was taking him to the hospital because he was getting worse.'
