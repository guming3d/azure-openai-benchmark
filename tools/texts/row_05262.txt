article: Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria postponed its parliamentary election Saturday due to a "terrible unfortunate emergency" caused by the late arrival of voting materials, the head of the election commission said. Nigerians will instead go to the polls Monday, said Attahiru Jega, chairman of the Independent National Election Commission. "We cannot proceed with these elections if we want them to be free, fair and credible if there are no result sheets," Jega said. "We cannot bury our heads and say there are no problems. It is regrettable. It is unfortunate. It should not have happened." Jega said he takes full responsibility for the fiasco but he said a vendor that was supplying results sheets and ballots was unable to deliver them on time. The vendor, said Jega, cited the diversion of planes to carry relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Japan as the reason for the delay. Citizens of Africa's most populous nation were supposed to vote Saturday for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. They are scheduled to vote next Saturday in a presidential election and for state governors the following week. Before the logistical problems, the election, the most expensive in Nigeria's history, had already been marred by riots, bombings and assassinations. "The unprecedented levels of violence that have seen several people either killed, maimed, kidnapped or intimidated for political reasons pose the single most significant threat to the conduct of general elections," warned the Nigeria Elections Situation Room -- a forum of groups focusing on the upcoming elections. Human Rights Watch estimates at least 70 people have been killed in political violence in the run-up to the voting. The European Union described Nigeria's 2007 elections as the worst they had ever seen anywhere in the world, with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. Nigeria had hoped to gain a cleaner image this year. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Nigerians were all set to cast their vote for the presidential candidate they deemed the right one to steer their country in the right direction. However, their plans were thrown off-foot when the elections were postponed from February 16th to February 23rd. The rescheduling, which came as a shock to citizens across the country, was attributed to many factors. The election commission chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, has now come out to apologize for the delay, blaming the late delivery of voting materials from a vendor. In a press conference held on Sunday, Yakubu apologized for the delay and assured citizens that the commission was making every effort to ensure all voting materials were in place for the new election date, Monday, February 25th. Although Yakubu's apology has been accepted by many, some citizens have voiced their frustrations over the uncertainty surrounding the elections, and the inconvenience this has caused them. Speaking to a local Nigerian newspaper, Kemi Adeleke expressed her disappointment, "I took time off work to prepare for the election only to hear that it has been postponed. Itâ€™s not easy to just cancel everything and reschedule for another day. I hope everything goes according to plan on Monday." The election commission, which has been heavily criticized in the past for poorly organized elections, is under immense pressure to get things right this time around. Millions of Nigerians will be flocking the polling booths on Monday to cast their vote for the presidential candidate they believe can take the country forward. Many Nigerians are also hoping that the delay in the election will not lead to violence among supporters of the different political parties. In the past, election violence in the country has been rampant, leading to loss of life and destruction of property. As citizens await Monday's election, the election commission has reassured Nigerians that they are doing everything they can to ensure that the election runs smoothly, and that all eligible voters are given the opportunity to cast their vote without any hitches. Nigerians all over the world are now waiting anxiously for the results of this crucial election.
