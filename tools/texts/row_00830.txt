chatgpt: The trial of former Dallas Cowboys player, Josh Brent, has taken a new turn with the revelation that he was more than twice the legal limit for alcohol when he crashed his car in December 2012. Brent, a former defensive tackle, was reported to have had a blood alcohol level of .18% which is more than twice the legal limit in Texas. During the trial, a toxicologist testified that someone Brent's size, who weighed 320lbs at the time of the accident, would have likely consumed 17 alcoholic drinks in order to reach that level of intoxication. The toxicologist admitted that his calculations were not exact, but stated that it was highly unlikely that Brent had consumed anything less than 10 drinks. Brent is currently facing charges of intoxication manslaughter over the death of his former teammate, Jerry Brown. The pair had been out partying together before Brent got behind the wheel of his car and crashed it. Brown was killed in the accident, while Brent was injured. The prosecution has argued that Brent's actions were reckless and showed a clear disregard for the safety of himself and others on the road. The toxicologist's testimony has been used to strengthen this argument, with the prosecution painting a picture of a man who was clearly too drunk to be driving and yet chose to do so anyway. The defense has argued that Brent did not intend to harm anyone and that the crash was simply a tragic accident. They have also raised doubt over the accuracy of the toxicologist's calculations, pointing out that there are many variables that can affect how quickly alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream. The trial has put a spotlight on the dangers of drunk driving and has sparked a debate about whether professional athletes should be held to a higher standard when it comes to drinking and driving. Many have argued that athletes, who are often seen as role models, should be held to a higher standard of behavior and should be given stricter punishments if they break the law. The trial is expected to continue for several more weeks and the outcome is still uncertain. If found guilty, Brent could face up to 20 years in prison. The tragic accident has brought to light the devastating consequences of drunk driving and serves as a reminder to all of us to never get behind the wheel after drinking.
