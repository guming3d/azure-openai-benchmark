article: Prosecutors were accused of pursuing a vendetta against four Sun journalists yesterday after they announced a retrial in a deadlocked case that has cost millions. After a three-month hearing at Kingston Crown Court, jurors failed to reach verdicts on the journalists, who were accused of paying public officials for information. The Crown Prosecution Service has put a number of journalists on trial after investigations into phone hacking and corruption, but several recent cases have ended in acquittals or hung juries. After a three-month hearing at Kingston Crown Court (pictured), jurors failed to reach verdicts on the journalists, who were accused of paying public officials for information . Concerns have been raised about the millions spent on the cases and the length of delays between arrests and trials, with one journalist waiting more than three years. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said it was ‘deeply disappointing’ that the Sun journalists’ trial was still not completed. The committee would address concerns raised by the case, he added. Tory MP Tracey Crouch said: ‘These journalists have had their lives turned upside down while they awaited trial for over three years, and then after three months of court time and a bill of several million pounds to the taxpayer, the CPS wants to drain millions more from the coffers because they didn’t get the result they wanted. Labour MP Keith Vaz (pictured), chairman of the home affairs select committee, said it was ‘deeply disappointing’ that the Sun journalists’ trial was still not completed . ‘They are a joke and rather than pursue this vendetta, they should concentrate on bringing real criminals to justice.’ Former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman, 51, head of news Chris Pharo, 45, former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll, 38, and reporter Jamie Pyatt, 51, were accused of paying police officers, prison guards and a worker at Broadmoor Hospital. They all deny any wrongdoing over the alleged payments. The newspaper’s picture editor John Edwards, 50, and former reporter John Troup, 49, were cleared of corruption. The jury also cleared O’Driscoll and Dudman of some charges, but failed to reach verdicts on the remaining counts against them. Judge Richard Marks praised the ‘great dignity’ of the defendants and said the retrial must be scheduled this year so their wait for justice was not delayed further. Media lawyer Gavin Millar QC, of Matrix Chambers, said vast amounts of public money would be wasted, but there was ‘no realistic prospect of conviction’. The CPS said it would be inappropriate to comment ahead of a retrial. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: After a weeks-long trial, the prosecution has announced a retrial in a case that has cost millions and has involved allegations of vendettas against journalists at the Sun newspaper. Four journalists from the Sun had been accused of paying public officials for information, but after a three-month-long hearing, the jurors failed to reach verdicts, leading to a hung jury. This case is part of a wider effort by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to investigate and prosecute journalists for phone hacking and other associated crimes. However, several recent cases have ended in acquittals or hung juries, causing some to question the fairness and effectiveness of these investigations. The four journalists in question had been accused of using illicit methods to obtain information, but they argue that they were simply doing their jobs as reporters. The CPS alleges that these actions constitute a breach of the law and that the journalists should be held accountable. The retrial will likely involve the same evidence and arguments as the first trial, but the stakes will be higher this time around. It is possible that the prosecution will bring new evidence to the table, or that they will seek to modify their arguments in response to the defense's case. While this retrial will undoubtedly be expensive and time-consuming, it is important to remember that these cases have real-world consequences for the journalists involved. If convicted, they could face significant jail time or other penalties, potentially jeopardizing their careers and reputations. The case has already raised questions about press freedom and government overreach, with some arguing that exposing government corruption and wrongdoing should be protected under the First Amendment. However, others argue that journalists should be held to account when they break the law, regardless of whether or not they believe their actions were justified. Regardless of where you stand on this issue, it is clear that the decision to retry these journalists underscores the high stakes involved in press investigations and the delicate balance that must be struck between freedom of the press and the rule of law. As this case unfolds, it will be important to pay close attention to the evidence presented and the arguments made by both sides. Ultimately, the outcome of this retrial may have far-reaching implications for the future of investigative journalism in the UK and beyond.
