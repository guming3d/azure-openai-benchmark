'During this time, however, the due diligence process has been completed and we will hopefully soon be in a position to complete the regulatory requirements set by the Football League. 'Mr Mammadov's advisors have been in constant dialogue with the directors of the club and an excellent working relationship has been built between both sides.

Mandaric added: 'I fully appreciate the frustration of our supporters, we all want to see a quick completion so we are in the best shape possible for the start of the new season. 'Despite the delay, I am still committed to fully supporting (manager) Stuart (Gray) in his preparations and this has been demonstrated by the permanent signings of Keiren Westwood and Sam Hutchinson along with the contract extensions agreed with Chris Kirkland, Glenn Loovens and Jose Semedo. 'I have been kept fully informed by Mr Mammadov's advisors during the process and Friday's meeting was very constructive. I continue to believe that he will be a wonderful custodian for this great club and I am very excited at his plans for the future.'

chatgpt: Hafiz Mammadov's proposed takeover of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. has hit a temporary snag causing some uncertainty with regards to the future of the Sheffield-based football club. The Azerbaijani businessman's bid for the Owls had been progressing quite smoothly with indications that the deal was almost finalized. However, the latest reports suggest that there has been a delay in the process for some unknown reasons. Despite the delay, Owls' chairman Milan Mandaric has expressed confidence that the deal will still go ahead, allaying fears among the team's supporters that this delay may have scuppered the hoped for takeover. An announcement confirming the deal is, however, still awaited. The uncertainty that the delay in the takeover process has caused to the financial and football operations of the club is understandable. Fans of the club are, understandably, anxious to know when the proposed takeover will be completed so that they can feel secure in the future of the club. With the deal likely to generate significant funds and resources that many believe can take the Owls to greater heights, it is little wonder that supporters are so keen to learn of any updates. It is important to note that this delay is in no way linked or indicative of any problems with the proposed deal or the transparency of the process leading up to it. The Azerbaijani businessman has, in fact, completed the due diligence and made it clear that the takeover is only being delayed, not cancelled. The proposed takeover of Sheffield Wednesday by Mammadov is expected to bring significant investment to the club, which will allow it to compete more effectively within the English Football League. This would mean significant upgrades to the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, as well as investment in the Owls' youth academy, scouting network, and player recruitment process. The Owls have been languishing in the Championship in recent years and have been desperate for financial resources to enable them to compete against more established teams in both the Championship and the Premier League. With the proposed takeover, there are hopes that finally, the club will have the necessary resources to challenge for a place in England's top flight. Although news of the delay in the takeover process is not the news the fans may have wanted to hear, it is crucial to keep in mind that the process has not been abandoned entirely. Both the club and the proposed buyer remain committed to the deal, with only minor logistical details standing in the way of completion. For now, supporters of Sheffield Wednesday can only wait and hope for good news in the near future.
