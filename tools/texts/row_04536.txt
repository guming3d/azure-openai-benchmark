They are mocked for their frequent fretting but worriers may have the last laugh. Research suggests that being a worrier is a sign of high intelligence. Those who live in constant fear they won’t get everything done and who can’t switch off worrisome thoughts are more articulate. In tests, worriers scored higher in something called verbal intelligence – the ability to understand and work with the written and spoken word. The Canadian researchers said there are clear advantages to being a worrier. The team from Lakehead University in Ontario put 125 students through a battery of tests. This included measures of depression and shyness and a test of verbal intelligence. The verbal intelligence test looked at vocabulary, as well as the ability to categorise words and to understand proverbs. The men and women also filled in a ‘worry questionnaire’ which asked them how much they agreed with statements such as ‘I am always worrying about something’ and ‘I have been a worrier all my life’. Those who admitted to worrying a lot also tended to do better on the test of verbal intelligence – at least when their worries about the experiment itself was taken into account. The researchers said that taking the time to anticipate and plan for potential threats could have helped our ancestors survive. After all, it is better to be overly cautious and live than be too confident and then be struck down by disease or killed by a wild animal. Writing in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, they said: ‘From an evolutionary standpoint, there are fewer costs associated with worrying about a threatening event that does not occur than failing to anticipate, plan for and avoid one that does.’ Scroll down for video .

The study also found links between high verbal intelligence and depression. What is more, the men and women who found it hard not to replay past events in their heads and think ‘what if?’ scored poorly on a test of non-verbal intelligence. This involved completing a series of geometric puzzles and is a measure of observational skills, problem solving ability and abstract reasoning. The researchers said it is possible that those who are good with words find it easier to think in detail about past and future events – raising the odds of them being worriers. In contrast, those with good observational skills may live in the moment and be better at making judgements as things happen and so have less need to dwell on them later.

chatgpt: Canadian researchers from Lakehead University in Ontario have discovered that people who are prone to worrying may possess higher verbal intelligence skills. The team of researchers conducted a study involving 125 students who were subjected to a battery of tests designed to evaluate their verbal intelligence. This covered a range of abilities, such as vocabulary comprehension, categorization skills, and the ability to understand proverbs. Individuals who have a tendency to worry about hypothetical future events, or relive past experiences excessively, are referred to as "worriers." Past studies have associated worry with negative outcomes such as anxiety or depression, but this recent study shows that it may have some benefits. The researchers found that the students who scored higher on the tests of verbal intelligence also displayed higher levels of worry. This link between worry and verbal intelligence is somewhat surprising yet consistent with previous findings, suggesting a possible advantageous aspect of worrying. The team noted that the results might suggest that worriers have an edge in practical social reasoning. Those with higher scores in verbal intelligence may have better communication skills, come up with more effective solutions to problems, and demonstrate an overall greater level of social competence. Dr. Alexander Penney, lead author of the study, cautions that these findings do not imply that worrying is necessarily good, but instead it indicates that there may be some positive aspects to the pattern of thinking associated with worrying. Penney also stated that future studies would be necessary to explore the underlying mechanisms and reasons for the link between verbal intelligence and worrying. Until then, it remains to be seen whether the pattern of thinking characteristic of worriers is truly beneficial or not. The study did not take gender into account, a point which could be significant since past research from Scotland discovered that females tend to be more worrisome. Yet, Dr. Penney said that based on their tests, this study showed no difference in scores between male and female participants. So, what are the implications of this study for those who identify as worriers? Is it worth spending hours fixating over a work presentation or school exam, or stressing out about what may or may not happen in the future?  While the study shows some possible benefits to worry, it is essential to note that excessive worry can still lead to negative consequences for mental health. Anxiety and depression are commonly tied to excessive worry, leading to impaired functioning in everyday life. In conclusion, this study has shown that people who are prone to worrying may indeed be intelligent and might have an edge in practical social reasoning. However, the results should be taken with caution, considering the potential negative side effects of excessive worry. While worrying may have some benefits, it's essential to strike a balance and not let worry take over everyday life.
