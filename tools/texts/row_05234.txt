article: Australians and New Zealanders tend to get annoyed when their accents get mistaken for one another, but there's one thing they do share. Both countries can lay claim to hosting the world's friendliest city, with Melbourne and Auckland jointly taking top honors in a new survey. Another southern hemisphere destination -- South Africa's Johannesburg -- didn't fare quite as well, being named as the most unfriendly. Conde Nast Traveler magazine's annual Readers' Choice Survey says it was "no surprise readers adore Melbourne," calling it Australia's "capital of cool." Aucklanders were praised by readers for their "humor" and a view on life that's "something to aspire to attain." Australia scored a friendly city double, with Sydney also making the top 10 alongside a global scattering that includes Cambodia's "awe-inspiring" temple gateway Siem Reap and "vibrant" Dublin. The United States fielded two cities onto the friendly list, with Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, each winning praise. 'City of crime and contrasts' CN Traveler says its "subjective" survey asked readers to rate cities on a number of factors, including "friendliness." It said the results didn't always reflect the local residents. Such is the case with Beijing, which made number six on the unfriendly list after being dissed for its "terrible pollution" and "dirty streets and hideous traffic." The Chinese capital was joined by the French port of Marseille ("Stay away! Threatening"), "overcrowded and ostentatious" Monaco, "rude" Frankfurt, "forgettable" Cannes and -- to compound French ignominy -- "cold and aloof" Paris. Johannesburg was named most unfriendly because, despite being "one of the most beautiful" cities, "safety still remains a serious concern" with one reader calling it "a city of crime and contrasts." South Africa didn't come home empty handed, however. Its coastal city of Cape Town placed eighth on the friendly list, with one reader describing it as "the most amazing place on Earth" thanks to its mix of nature, beaches and mountains.

chatgpt: Each year, Conde Nast Traveler conducts a survey to determine the world's friendliest and unfriendliest cities. This year's survey results are in, and it's no surprise that Melbourne and Auckland have once again made the cut as the world's friendliest cities. Auckland, New Zealand, was praised for its humor and welcoming atmosphere. The locals are known for their friendly disposition and willingness to help tourists. Auckland's beautiful beaches, stunning harbors, and world-class cuisine make it a popular destination for travelers from all over the world. Melbourne, Australia, was also named as one of the friendliest cities in the world. The residents of this vibrant and diverse city are described as "a friendly bunch." With a thriving cultural scene, world-renowned coffee shops, and delicious food, it's not hard to see why Melbourne is such a popular destination for tourists. However, not all cities on the list had such glowing reviews. In fact, Johannesburg, South Africa, was named as the world's unfriendliest city. Readers in the survey criticized the high crime levels in the city. Despite its reputation as a "crime-ridden" city, Johannesburg still attracts millions of visitors every year. The city's stunning wildlife reserves, vibrant nightlife, and rich history make it a must-visit destination for many travelers. The survey results are a reminder of the importance of tourism for these cities. Friendly locals can make all the difference in a traveler's experience, and cities with welcoming atmospheres are more likely to see repeat visitors. In a year that has seen the travel industry rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic, it's more important than ever for cities to prioritize their tourism industries. The survey results serve as a reminder that friendliness and hospitality are essential ingredients to success in the tourism industry. Melbourne and Auckland may have topped the list of friendliest cities this year, but there are plenty of other cities around the world that are known for their welcoming atmospheres. From Tokyo to Taipei, from Vancouver to Vienna, these cities prove that being friendly is not limited to any one country or culture. As the world continues to navigate the challenges of the pandemic, it's clear that the travel industry will play a vital role in the global economic recovery. Cities that prioritize their tourism industries and focus on creating welcoming environments for visitors will be best positioned to succeed in the years to come.
