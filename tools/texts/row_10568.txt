A New Jersey plastic surgeon is performing breast augmentation surgeries while his patients are still awake. Dr Michael Gartner, who has multiple offices in close proximity to New York, has been performing the procedure for just over four years and says it stemmed from client demand. He is able to do this through the use of local anesthesia, satisfying the concerns of patients worried about not waking up after taking general anesthesia while under the knife, he told MailOnline. Virtually painless: Dr Michael Gartner asserts that the procedure is virtually painless, and that most patients only feel minor discomfort . Dr Gartner said that he believes he is the only board-certified plastic surgeon performing such a procedure in the entire country. Other doctors perform similar procedures, but this is not their primary business, he added. He came to the idea after several patients expressed reservations about going completely under – including a woman who was a heavy smoker and wanted such a procedure but outright refused to be asleep. ‘That was my ‘ahah’ moment,’ he recalled, saying that a similar procedure was performed with local anesthesia as far back as the 1960s, but had fallen out of favor as general anesthesia became more reliable. ‘I didn’t invent this, I never pretended to,’ said Dr Gartner. ‘This is kind of probably the way they did it in the 60s or 70s.’ Fully awake: Patients are awake, talkative and fully alert during the entire surgery . Local anesthesia: The area where the surgery is being performed is made numb through injections . He hasn’t looked back since. A patient shown while having a breast augmentation done during a recent profile on Chasing Jersey was alert, talkative and said she felt very little discomfort. She chose Dr Gartner after viewing his prolific series of YouTube videos. ‘I watched a lot of videos on YouTube and I felt confident that this was the right decision,’ said Rachel Saez. She detailed what it was like to have a procedure done while she was awake. ‘I can feel him working on me,’ she said, ‘I can feel him pulling and tugging but it does not hurt.’ Minor discomfort: Despite being cut open, patients report feeling only a tugging sensation as the doctor goes to work . The procedure takes about half an hour and requires less recovery time than conventional surgeries. The patients experience little to no pain, and sidestep the nausea that can be experienced by patients under general anesthesia. Dr Gartner offers pateints the option of general or local anesthesia, and as much as 40 per cent opt for local. Some come from surrounding states for the unique procedure, he noted. ‘It’s a little niche I’ve developed.’

chatgpt: Breast augmentation surgeries are becoming increasingly popular among women in pursuit of the perfect body. While the procedure may be common, many patients still fear the anesthesia required during the surgery. But now, a new surgical approach is gaining popularity, one that allows patients to undergo the procedure without having to be sedated. The technique, known as "awake breast augmentation," involves performing the procedure while the patient is awake and alert. It may sound daunting, but while patients may feel some discomfort and pressure during the procedure, they don't feel any pain.  According to Dr. Michael Gartner, a plastic surgeon based in New York, almost 40% of his breast augmentation surgeries are now performed with patients awake. "The technique has been around for a while," he said. "A similar procedure was done as far back as the 1960s, but now, advancements in technology have made it more accessible and safe." For many patients, the thought of being sedated during surgery is a major cause of anxiety. The fear of not waking up after the operation is a significant consideration for those considering surgery, particularly for those with existing health concerns. However, with an awake breast augmentation procedure, the patient is conscious throughout the process, so they can communicate with the surgeon and be more involved in the decision-making process. During the surgery, the patient is numbed, and the surgeon uses small incisions to insert the implants under the muscle or breast tissue. Patients are offered sedation to help them relax during the procedure, but many choose not to take this option. One significant advantage of the awake breast augmentation approach is the reduced risk of complications associated with general anesthesia. According to Dr. Gartner, "awake breast augmentation is a safe procedure, and the risks associated with sedation are minimal." While the procedure has been around for quite some time, it is only in recent years, with advancements in medical technology, that it has gained significant attention from patients and surgeons alike. Dr. Gartner says that the procedure has led to more women feeling comfortable undergoing breast augmentation surgery, leading to a significant increase in the number of patients opting for the procedure.  Overall, the benefits of awake breast augmentation include shorter recovery times and the ability to return to normal activities more quickly. Patients can be discharged on the same day and can resume their daily routines after a few days of rest. And with significantly reduced anxiety levels, patients feel more confident about undergoing the surgical procedure and can better manage their expectations. In conclusion, while awake breast augmentation may not be suitable for all patients or all types of surgery, it is an increasingly popular option that can offer significant benefits. With advancements in technology driving improvements in surgical procedures, it's likely that this technique will continue to gain popularity in the coming years.
