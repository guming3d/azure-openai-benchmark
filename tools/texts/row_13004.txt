article: Buras, Louisiana (CNN) -- The sign out front points the way: birds, please enter to the right; humans, enter on the left. Huddled in a pen and covered in brown streaks of oil, a dozen pelicans await treatment after exposure to the pools of crude on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. Increasing numbers of birds are arriving at the Fort Jackson Oiled Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in this coastal Louisiana town as the environmental disaster in the Gulf stretches on. At least 50 birds were treated on Tuesday alone. Wildlife workers say the birds get oiled when diving for fish. Their efforts at preening sometimes worsen the coating of crude on their feathers. The lucky ones are found by state workers and volunteers in time to save their lives. "The animals that are coming in are covered in oil," the center's Rebecca Dunne says. "But they are pretty healthy animals. So that makes us feel like like we have a chance to save them. We have been pretty successful so far." While around 200 birds have been dead on arrival at the center, so far none of the 400 birds brought in alive have died. But not all of them express their gratitude. "If you let 'em loose, they'll bite ya," says one volunteer holding shut the bill of a brown bird tucked under his arm. New arrivals get a physical, and a day to "de-stress." Next, it's time for a scrubbing. They're washed with Dawn soap, rinsed and dried. Finally, it's out to the aviary pens out back -- labeled "pelican island" -- where they are kept for observation and recovery. On Tuesday, top football stars from the Super Bowl-winning New Orleans Saints came out to thank the center's volunteers. "It's all about doing whatever we can down here in south Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, to help these people come back," quarterback Drew Brees told CNN's John King. After rehab, the birds are scheduled for release in Florida, where they are less likely to repeat their run-in with the spilled oil. But not all birds are so lucky. "For every bird they rescue, there are other birds that are oiled, but that they couldn't rescue," Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal says. "That is what is so heartbreaking to the people of Louisiana." The latest Consolidated Fish and Wildlife Collection report says 380 oiled birds and 50 sea turtles have been rescued; 594 birds and 250 sea turtles have been found dead. For better or for worse, more birds are being found and brought in each day. Workers are planning to build eight more receiving pens in the coming days to handle the increasing influx of winged guests. CNN's Brian Todd contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Fort Jackson Oiled Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, located on the coast of Louisiana, has been hard at work rehabilitating the various animals affected by the recent oil spill. On Tuesday, the center received about 50 birds that had been impacted by the spill. The team of dedicated workers spent the day caring for the birds and tending to their injuries. The birds, which had been covered in oil, were carefully cleaned and examined. They were then given time to recover in order to ensure their safety before being released back into the wild. The rehabilitation process for the birds was arduous, but the workers were determined to provide the best care possible. Once the birds have completed their rehabilitation at Fort Jackson, they are scheduled to be released in Florida. This is part of a larger plan to reintroduce wildlife back into their natural habitats. The goal is to give the animals the best possible chance of survival and to help them recover from the effects of the oil spill. In order to handle the increased influx of birds being brought to the center, workers are planning to build more receiving pens. These pens will help to streamline the rehabilitation process, allowing workers to care for more animals at once. The construction of the receiving pens is part of a larger effort to ensure that the center can continue to provide for the animals affected by the oil spill. The workers at Fort Jackson are dedicated to helping the animals recover, and they are doing everything in their power to provide the best possible care. The rehabilitation of animals impacted by the oil spill has been a challenging task for the workers at Fort Jackson. The center has been inundated with animals, and the workers have had to work around the clock to provide for their needs. Despite the challenges, the workers remain committed to their mission and are determined to continue providing the best possible care for the animals. In addition to caring for the animals, the workers at Fort Jackson are also working to prevent future oil spills. They are advocating for stricter regulations and better safety measures to ensure that the devastating effects of an oil spill are not repeated in the future. The work being done at Fort Jackson is crucial in the fight to protect wildlife and prevent environmental disasters. Through their tireless efforts, the workers at Fort Jackson are making a difference, one animal at a time.
