article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sometimes, a T-shirt just doesn't cut it. Allie Tompkins, 19, gets her first tattoo at Fatty's Tattooz on Monday. For those who want a more permanent way to showcase their support for Barack Obama, Washington's tattoo parlors are ready to help. "There's nothing more memorable than a tattoo," said Matt Jessup, better known as "Fatty," the owner of Fatty's Custom Tattooz and Body Piercing. His shop is celebrating what it has dubbed the "Obamathan," where customers can get a free "Obama '08" logo tattoo if they buy another tattoo worth $200. The Obama tattoo, Fatty says, is worth $70. "A lot of people are feeling very inspired and taken by this moment in our nation's history. And for many people, they are in town for this historic event, they want something to remember it by," he said. At Fatty's and other tattoo shops in the area, there have been multiple inquiries about getting inked with an Obama image, they say, but only a few people have actually gone through with. The most popular choices so far have been the Obama logo, the word "hope," and the now iconic red-and-blue Obama hope poster by Shepard Fairey. T.J. Mohler, who works at Jinx Proof Tattoos, said business has been up as people flood the city, but only "about two or three" customers have gotten an Obama tattoo. One of those people is Mohler himself, who opted for a 5 x 7-inch Obama image on his leg. "When I look back in 50 years, it will remind me of the time and how excited everyone is," Mohler said. None of the shop owners reported any history of George W. Bush tattoos. "No such thing," said Jason Anthony, owner of Midtown Tattoo. Fatty says he's hoping the number of people getting Obama art will grow as more visitors arrive and word about the Obamathon gets out. "We're still rolling with it through the week, so I'm hoping that we'll get more interest," he said. On Wednesday, Fatty has plans to tattoo a portrait of Obama's face on one customer. That piece of art is worth $600, but the customer is getting it for free because she was the winner of one of the shop's promotions. But for those wary of permanent ink, there are some alternatives available. Glam Rock Art is a Washington business specializing in airbrush tattoos and body art. Owner and artist Nicole Graves has ordered custom Obama stencils in response to requests from customers. Fatty's also offers a removable option -- the Obama piercing. It's an orbital ring with a blue bead that costs $44, in honor of the 44th president. And if a customer has a change of heart post-tattoo, Fatty says all is not lost. "Come on back and I'll cover it up with something else," he said.

chatgpt: Tattoo parlors across the United States are offering a unique way for people to capture memories of Barack Obama's inauguration - with permanent ink. From simple logos to iconic posters, these tattoos have become a popular way for Obama supporters to commemorate a historic moment in American history. According to tattoo shop owners, the most popular designs include the Obama logo, the word "hope", and the iconic red-and-blue Obama poster. Some have even opted for portraits of the President to be inked onto their skin. One tattoo parlor owner in Washington D.C. said that the demand for Obama tattoos has been overwhelming since the election was called. "A lot of people are feeling very inspired and taken by this moment," he said. "They want to have a permanent reminder of what this moment means to them." The price for these permanent keepsakes ranges from $50 to upwards of $500, depending on the size and complexity of the design. While some may question the wisdom of getting a politician's face permanently etched onto their skin, for many, this is a way to show their unwavering support and devotion to the President. For those who want a temporary option, there are also Obama piercings and airbrush tattoos available. These can be a fun and less permanent way to show political pride without the commitment of a permanent tattoo. The popularity of Obama tattoos is not limited to the United States. Tattoo parlors in countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and Japan have reported an increase in requests for Obama-inspired designs. In the days leading up to and following the inauguration, tattoo parlors all over Washington D.C. were booked solid with appointments for Obama tattoos. Some even offered special deals and discounts in honor of the occasion. While some may view these tattoos as simply a fad, the desire to permanently commemorate important moments in history is not a new concept. For many, getting a tattoo is a deeply personal way to express themselves and mark significant events in their lives. Whether it's the hope and beauty that the Obama presidency represented or simply a desire to be a part of the historical significance of his election, these tattoos are a lasting symbol of this moment in American history. In an increasingly polarized political climate, it's refreshing to see people using art and self-expression to show their support for a shared cause. These tattoos serve as a reminder that even in times of great division, there are still moments of unity and hope. As Obama's presidency comes to a close, these tattoos will serve as an enduring homage to a President who inspired a nation and changed history.
