article: (CNN) -- A man who allegedly threatened to decapitate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii appeared in court Friday in San Diego and was ordered to remain in jail for now. Aniruddha Sherbow made two threats to murder the Democratic congresswoman earlier this month, according to newly unsealed court documents. On August 1 the man allegedly left an expletive-laden voicemail on Gabbard's cell phone, with the message including a threat to her life. An affidavit said that Gabbard had been getting harassing messages from Sherbow since 2011 and identified his voice as the caller. The court document said Sherbow's mother later listened to the recording and told investigators it sounded like her son. On August 3 Sherbow allegedly sent an e-mail to the FBI and some unnamed media outlets and identified himself by name, according to the affidavit. The subject of the e-mail was "Cutting Off Tulsi Gabbard's Head." The message said in part, "I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresover she may be, and to sever her head from her body." According to the court affidavit, Sherbow's father said he received a copy of that e-mail and he identified his son as the sender. The FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police said Thursday that Sherbow's threats were "deemed credible." Sherbow, 43, was arrested by Mexican law enforcement officers in Tijuana on Wednesday. The former resident of Hawaii was then turned over to the FBI in San Diego. He faces a charge of transmission of threats in interstate commerce. He is scheduled to have another court hearing on September 12, and officials eventually want him transferred to the District of Columbia for trial. Gabbard's office would not comment on Sherbow's arrest and the allegations against him. Press secretary Heather Fluit would only say the congresswoman was "grateful for the work" of all the law enforcement officers involved in the investigation. CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has arrested a suspect in connection with threatening messages directed at Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. The individual, a former resident of the state, allegedly left an expletive-laden voicemail and sent an email titled "Cutting Off Tulsi Gabbard's Head." According to a federal affidavit, the suspect had initially reached out to Gabbard's office via email, expressing his opposition to her political views. However, when he did not receive a response, he allegedly escalated the situation by making the threatening comments. Gabbard, who represents a district in Hawaii, has been a prominent figure in politics since being elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She also ran a presidential campaign in 2020 but withdrew early in the primaries. Federal authorities were alerted to the threatening messages and launched an investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspect. The individual is currently being held in custody pending further legal action. Congresswoman Gabbard released a statement thanking law enforcement for their work in apprehending the suspect. "No one should have to experience threats of violence because of their political beliefs," Gabbard said. "I appreciate the FBI's diligence in investigating this matter and ensuring that the individual responsible is held accountable for their actions." The incident has sparked concerns about the safety of elected officials. In recent years, several politicians have been the victims of threats and violent acts, including the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords at a constituent event in 2011. Many lawmakers have spoken out against political violence and called for a more civil discourse in politics. However, incidents like this serve as a reminder of the ongoing risks faced by those in public office. As the investigation into the threatening messages continues, it remains unclear what charges the suspect will face. However, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of taking threats against elected officials seriously and taking swift action to protect them from harm.
