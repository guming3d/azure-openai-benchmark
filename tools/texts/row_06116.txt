article: By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 5:36 PM on 3rd October 2011 . Fake air fresheners containing chemicals that can cause headaches, nausea and even loss of consciousness have been seized from markets in Manchester and North Wales. Trading Standards officers from Denbighshire County Council discovered 162 counterfeit refills for the battery-powered auto-spray Air Wick Freshmatic Max on sale at markets in Mold and Prestatyn in north Wales. Shoppers are now being warned to beware of buying the 250mlÂ  counterfeit canisters of air freshener that were found to contain 'excessive amounts of methanol' - enough to cause loss of consciousness when too much is inhaled over a period of time. The fake air freshener, left, was designed to look like the authentic one on the right. Council officers say the way to recognise a counterfeit is by the label, which does not fit around the tin and exposes a silver strip down the side . The chemical is a non-drinking and flammable form of alcohol that is often used as an antifreeze, solvent or fuel. Genuine Air Wick auto-spray refills contain around five per cent methanol and are entirely safe for use. There is no connection to genuine Air Wick products, which have not been recalled or been linked to any toxins. A Denbighshire County Council spokeswoman said investigations were ongoing into where the canisters originated and that it was not yet known whether criminal charges will be brought against the sellers. Phil Richards, Trading Standards senior . investigations officer said: 'We would urge anyone who has bought a . counterfeit refill to stop using them immediately and get in touch with . their local Trading Standards office, giving information about where . they got them from and when. 'It is very easy to tell if they are . counterfeit by the seal that goes around the can - that's how officers . have been able to identify them straight away.' Some of the counterfeit air fresheners were seized from Mold market in Flintshire, north Wales . The alarm was first raised when 219 replica air freshener refills seized from a wholesaler in Cheetham Hill, Manchester were found to have been causing people headaches. Tests commissioned by the manufacturer of genuine Air Wick refills identified excessive amounts of methanol in some. Councillor Nigel Murphy, Manchester City Council's executive member for environment, said: 'I would warn Manchester residents to be on their guard when buying Air Wick refills, ensuring they buy genuine products from reputable retailers.' The counterfeit containers can be easily identified. Unlike genuine Air Wick refills, the label does not go all the way around the can, leaving a silver strip down one side.

chatgpt: Authorities in north Wales and northern England have seized over 162 canisters of alcoholic drinks, with some found to contain dangerous levels of methanol. In Mold, north Wales, authorities found and seized 100 canisters, while a total of 62 were seized in Prestatyn. A staggering 219 canisters were found at a single wholesaler in the Manchester district of Cheetham Hill. According to officials, the canisters contain "excessive amounts of methanol" which can lead to a number of potentially harmful side effects including headaches, nausea, and even loss of consciousness. After the seizure in Mold, a spokesperson for Denbighshire Council urged members of the public to only purchase and consume alcohol from reputable sources. "We would like to remind members of the public to ensure that they only buy alcohol from reputable sources and be wary of alcohol being sold from vehicles or on the street," the spokesperson said. "Alcohol that is being sold from vehicles or on the streets is not regulated and could pose a danger to public health." Similarly, authorities in Prestatyn reminded residents of the dangers of consuming unregulated alcohol. In a statement to the media, a spokesperson said: "The dangers of consuming these illicit drinks cannot be overstated. They are unregulated, which means they can contain dangerous levels of methanol and other harmful chemicals that can cause serious harm, and in some cases, even death." This is not the first time authorities have seized illicit alcohol in the UK. In recent years, seizures have been made in various parts of the country, with many of the canisters containing dangerously high levels of methanol. In light of the latest seizure, officials are urging members of the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity relating to the sale or distribution of illicit alcohol. "We would encourage anyone who suspects that illegal alcohol is being sold or distributed in their area to contact their local council or the police," said the spokesperson for Denbighshire Council. Consumers are also urged to be mindful of the potential dangers associated with consuming illicit alcohol. While many may be drawn to the low prices of such drinks, the risks associated with consumption far outweigh any potential savings. The consumption of unregulated alcohol can lead to a range of serious health complications, including blindness and death. In conclusion, the latest seizure of illicit alcohol in north Wales and northern England serves as a timely reminder of the dangers associated with consuming such drinks. Members of the public are urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities, while also being mindful of the potential health risks associated with consuming unregulated alcohol.
