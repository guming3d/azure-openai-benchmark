Jamie Cummings has been diagnosed with scoliosis at just 18-months-old and his family are aiming to raise £40,000 for surgery. He is pictured here with his father  Matthew Cummings and mother Ellie Griffiths . They organised a stall at a car boot sale at Bessemer Road in Grangetown, Cardiff,  selling items which had been donated to them. But thieves managed to get into their locked car through a window which was slightly ajar, grabbed the float money and took some of the morning's takings which were in the glove compartment. Jamie's aunt, Nicola Wheten, 31, said: 'We are absolutely gutted, we're so devastated.' 'It was probably between £50 and £100. We had about £50 in change which we took ourselves.'

She said that since then the family, including Jamie's father Matthew and mother Ellie Griffiths from Llanrumney, have been fundraising in case they have to pay for treatment.

chatgpt: A family from Cardiff has been left devastated after thieves broke into their car and stole £100 during a car boot sale. The money was being raised to help fund vital surgery for their son, Jamie Cummings, who suffers from scoliosis. Scoliosis is a medical condition that causes curvature of the spine, and the surgery that Jamie requires is essential for his continued health and well-being. Unfortunately, the Cummings family has been struggling to raise the £40,000 needed for the operation, and the theft has come as a terrible blow. The family had been at a car boot sale in Cardiff when the theft occurred. They had been selling items in order to raise money for Jamie's surgery, and had amassed a total of £200 over the course of the day. However, when they returned to their car at the end of the event, they found that £100 had been stolen. The family is understandably devastated by the theft. The money that was stolen was a significant portion of what they had raised, and they had been counting on it to help cover their outgoings. They have now been left in a difficult financial situation, and are unsure of how they will be able to continue funding Jamie's treatment. Despite the setback, the family remains determined to raise the funds that Jamie needs. They have set up a crowdfunding page to try and generate more support, and have been overwhelmed by the response from the local community. The page has already raised several thousand pounds, and the family is hopeful that they will be able to reach their target in time for Jamie's surgery. Scoliosis is a condition that affects millions of people around the world, and it can be a debilitating and painful disease. For those who suffer from it, surgery is often the only option for relief. However, the cost of surgery can be prohibitively expensive, and many families struggle to cover the costs. The Cummings family's experience shows just how difficult it can be to raise funds for essential medical procedures. Despite the setback of the theft, they remain determined to do whatever it takes to ensure that Jamie gets the treatment he needs. They have demonstrated a remarkable sense of resilience and community spirit, and we wish them all the best in their efforts.
