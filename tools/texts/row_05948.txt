article: By . Nelson Groom For Daily Mail Australia . Passengers on the budget airline Jetstar are trying to save more money by eluding extra baggage fees. This excess carry-on is causing many passengers to lose their allocated cabin space, as well as prolonging the boarding process. In order to address the mounting concern, Jetstar will implement ‘cabin baggage officers’ in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast on a trial basis. Nip in the bud: Jetstar will soon introduce 'cabin baggage officers' at airport gates in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast . Any passengers who attempt to sneak extra luggage on board will be placed in 'hold in line', where baggage officers will weigh their luggage . The officers will be located at airport gates, where they will weigh and measure customer’s bags as well as arranging to have luggage checked if it looks oversized or over the assigned weight. At present, passengers who have checked in online can avoid having their bags checked by Jetstar staff until reaching the gate lounge, which is allowing those with excess carry-on to board the flight without the extra-baggage charges, reports Business Traveller. Now, passengers who attempt this will have their bags placed in the aircraft hold in line, along with the checked baggage allowance that they have purchased. Those who purchased ‘carry only fares’ will be penalised by paying the prevailing airport rates, which are higher than what is charged online. Caught red handed: Passengers found sneaking on excess luggage will pay a higher rate than what they would have if they had declared the baggage . The excess baggage being snuck on-board is causing passengers to lose their cabin-space and prolonging boarding process . Jetstar currently offers Economy passengers one main and one small item with a total combined weight of up to 10kg. Business Class passengers are allowed two main items with a combined weight of 20kg. Fees for check-in baggage at the time of booking are $15.50 for baggage of up to 15kg, and $16.50 for baggage of up to 20kg. For baggage checked-in at the airport, fees are $70 for up to 15kg of checked baggage, and $15 for every additional kilo after that. It is not yet announced when the baggage officers will be introduced.

chatgpt: Jetstar, the Australian budget airline, has been forced to address the issue of customers boarding flights with excess baggage. This problem has resulted in passengers losing cabin space and has also been prolonging the boarding process. In order to tackle this issue, the airline has decided to hire baggage officers in several cities in Australia, including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Cairns, and Gold Coast. These officers will be located at airport gates and will closely monitor passengers and their luggage. Any passengers who attempt to sneak extra luggage onboard will be placed in a 'hold in line' and their bags will be examined. The officers will weigh any suspicious looking luggage to ensure that it does not exceed the weight limit and does not pose any safety risks to the flight. This new strategy by Jetstar is expected to bring an end to the problem of excess baggage, which has been causing inconvenience to both passengers and the airline. Jason Gregory, the CEO of Jetstar, stated in a press conference that the new measures the airline is taking will lead to a reduction in the number of delays caused by excess baggage. He said, "We have been facing the issue of customers boarding with excess baggage for a while now, and we know it has been causing problems for our passengers. Our new baggage officers will be on the front line, ensuring that all baggage is within the weight limit and that we maintain the safety of our flights." Passengers have been advised to be cautious when packing and to only bring what is necessary on board. They have also been urged to check the weight limit of their luggage before arriving at the airport to avoid any unnecessary delays. Jetstar has faced criticism in the past for its strict baggage policies, which have been perceived by some as being too stringent. However, the airline has maintained that its policies are in place to ensure the safety of its passengers and crew, and to maintain the efficiency of its operations. The hiring of baggage officers is just one of the many steps Jetstar is taking to improve the experience of its passengers. The airline has also introduced several new services, such as in-flight entertainment and upgraded seating options, to make flying with Jetstar a more enjoyable experience. In conclusion, the hiring of baggage officers by Jetstar is a positive move that is sure to bring an end to the problem of excess baggage, which has been causing a lot of inconvenience to its passengers. The airline has always put its passengers' safety and comfort first, and these new measures are further proof of its commitment to providing a high-quality flying experience.
