article: A patient who received the world's first double-leg transplant has had both limbs amputated after being struck down by an unrelated illness, it was confirmed today. The man, who was in his 20s when he had the operation in 2011, was forced to stop taking his anti-rejection drugs so he could be treated for the illness. The Hospital Le Fe, in Valencia, Spain, said the patient has already undergone the operation to amputate both legs. The double leg transplant was led by surgeon Pedro Cavadas (pictured) but the patient was forced to have the legs amputated after treatment for an unrelated illness meant he had to stop taking his anti-rejection drugs . A statement released by the hospital said the new treatment took precedence over the immuno-suppressant drugs. A spokesman said: 'In these cases the protocol is that, if the transplanted organ is not a vital organ, it should be removed from the patient so as to allow treatment of the illness that is more serious and urgent', according to AFP. The patient, who initially lost his legs above the knees after a road accident, has not been named. He was given the transplant as he faced life in a wheelchair because attempts to fit him with prosthetic limbs had failed. The 14-hour milestone transplant was led by Spanish surgeon Pedro Cavadas in 2011. It was the first leg transplant of any kind. Valencia's Hospital La Fe said treatment for the illness takes precedence over saving the legs . Fifty surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and other staff at the hospital worked on the operation to give the man the . legs of another person. The bones were attached first, followed by tendons, arteries and nerves. About eight months after the operation, the hospital said the man was recovering well and was able to stand in a swimming pool. Mr Cavadas also carried out Spain's first face transplant in 2009 and was the first anywhere in the world to include a tongue and jaw. He has also carried out several arm transplants.

chatgpt: A patient who received a heart transplant made the difficult decision to stop taking his anti-rejection medication in order to undergo treatment for a life-threatening illness. The man, who was in his 20s at the time of his transplant in 2011, had developed an infection in his legs that was threatening his life. According to Hospital Le Fe, the medical team caring for the patient, the infection was so severe that amputating both legs was the only way to save his life. However, the patient was keen to explore other treatment options, including a high-risk experimental treatment that required him to stop taking his anti-rejection medication. The decision was not an easy one, as stopping his medication could have resulted in the rejection of his transplanted heart, which had been keeping him alive for almost a decade. Despite the risks, the patient was willing to take them in order to try and save his legs. The experimental treatment involved infusing the patient's blood with a high dose of chemotherapy drugs, followed by a stem cell transplant. The hope was that the treatment would kill the infection in his legs, allowing him to keep his limbs and avoid amputation. The treatment was a success, and the patient's infection was eradicated. However, there were some concerning side effects, including damage to his kidney function, which required additional treatment. Hospital Le Fe praised the patient's bravery in making the difficult decision to stop taking his anti-rejection medication in order to undergo the experimental treatment. The hospital also acknowledged the risks associated with the treatment, and the importance of careful monitoring to minimize potential complications. The patient, who asked not to be identified, expressed his gratitude to the hospital staff and his family for their support throughout his treatment. He emphasized the importance of considering all available options when faced with a life-threatening illness, and the need for patients to make informed decisions about their care in collaboration with their medical team. Overall, the case highlights the challenges that patients with complex medical histories can face when undergoing treatment for serious illnesses. It also underscores the critical role that careful decision-making and close monitoring can play in achieving successful outcomes.
