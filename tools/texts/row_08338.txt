article: Moscow (CNN) -- Among the tens of thousands of people happily enduring the freezing temperatures in Moscow's Bolotnaya Square is Alexey, an international lawyer. He tells me he's never protested before. "I'm not a political person," says Alexey, who asked his full name not be used. "I'm just a simple Russian citizen." Alexey says the day after Russia's parliamentary elections he asked his friends and colleagues who they voted for. Not one said United Russia. "It was some kind of astonishment for me to understand how a party for whom nobody voted could win the elections," he says. It was enough to inspire Alexey to protest. His story is not unique. Police estimate 25,000 people gathered in Moscow; protest organizers told the crowd they thought some 80,000 gathered. There are many in the crowd who until recently chose apathy over politics. But the elections on December 4 changed them. The protesters are demanding an annulment of the election results - which saw Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's United Russia party win 238 seats - and a new vote. Writer Dmitry Glukhovsky says it was the first time he voted. The experience transformed him into another first time protester. "I decided to try to influence the destiny of my country. I came to the polling station, I cast the ballot and it's stolen," Glukhovsky says. Another man in the crowd, Vyacheslav Zhmakin, vents similar feelings. "I'm a little bit angry because they told me, 'give us free time to hear our positions' and so on. And then 'give us your free time to come and vote'. I see my country does not really need my vote," Zhmakin says. "So you want new elections. Do you want anything else?" I ask. "Me personally? No," he replies. It's another point often repeated by the protesters -- they don't want a revolution. Tamara Mamedova and her friends laugh when I use the R-word. "We just want free elections. And that's all. We don't want revolution," Mamedova says. "We just want our rights back and that's all." But the protest movement of this Russian winter does appear to have one thing in common with the Arab Spring. Social networks played a vital role in mobilizing these educated, middle class people to stand in the snow and demand political change. "I think without the Internet, without Facebook and without Russian parallel social network services, this would not have been possible," Glukhovsky says. Many in this crowd are politically inexperienced. None of them is naive. No one here believes this one gathering will convince Prime Minister Putin to annul the vote and hold new elections. But it has inspired hope and the protesters say that's a profound change. "I feel one, a union, with all these people," Mamedova says. "I believe we can do something. Something really great that can change the whole political situation in Russia."

chatgpt: On Saturday, an estimated 25,000 people gathered in Moscow to demonstrate against the recent election results. The protesters voiced their discontent over the victory of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's party in the parliamentary elections held on September 18th. The demonstrators dispute the election results, alleging widespread fraud and vote-rigging. The protest was peaceful, with people chanting slogans and holding up placards that read "Russia Without Putin" and "We Deserve Fair Elections." Despite the size of the gathering, the police maintained a low profile, and no violence was reported. One of the protesters, Dmitry, stated that their demand was for free elections. "We just want free elections. And that's all. We don't want revolution," he said. He added that people were tired of the government's autocratic rule and were ready for change. The protest is the latest in a series of demonstrations against Putin's regime. The Prime Minister has been in power since 2000, and his party, United Russia, has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade. The opposition has accused Putin and his party of suppressing dissent, stifling free speech and press, and rigging elections. Putin's critics have also accused him of being behind the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who remains in a coma in a German hospital. Navalny was poisoned with a banned Soviet-era nerve agent, and his supporters allege that the Kremlin was behind the attack. The government denies any involvement in the poisoning. The protest in Moscow is significant, as it occurred despite a crackdown on dissent by Putin's government. In recent years, the government has jailed opposition leaders and activists, closed down media outlets critical of the government, and restricted the freedom of expression and assembly. The protest also highlights the growing frustration of the Russian people with Putin's rule. Despite the government's efforts to suppress dissent, people are taking to the streets, demanding change. The protest was not just confined to Moscow, with demonstrations taking place in other cities across Russia. In St. Petersburg, protesters gathered near the Kazan Cathedral, chanting slogans and waving Russian flags. In Novosibirsk, protesters gathered in the city center, holding up placards demanding free and fair elections. The protest in Moscow ended peacefully, with people leaving the square without incident. However, the government has warned that it will not tolerate any further protests and has threatened to use force against the demonstrators. In conclusion, the protest in Moscow is a significant development in Russia's political landscape. The fact that people are taking to the streets and demanding change, despite the government's efforts to suppress dissent, shows the growing frustration of Russians with Putin's rule. The question now is whether Putin will listen to the voices of his people and initiate democratic reforms, or continue with his authoritarian rule.
