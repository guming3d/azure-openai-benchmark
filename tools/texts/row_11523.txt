chatgpt: Real Madrid's captain Sergio Ramos recently revealed the top three coaches he has worked with at the club. In an interview, the Spanish defender named Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Aragones, and Joaquin Caparros as the best coaches he has had the privilege to work with during his time at the club. Notably absent from the list was Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, with whom Ramos had a falling out over the treatment of players during their time together at Real Madrid. Despite winning several trophies together, including La Liga and the Copa del Rey, the relationship between the two deteriorated due to Mourinho's harsh approach to coaching. Ramos, who has been an integral player for Real Madrid for over a decade, praised Ancelotti for his excellent management of the team and his ability to maintain a positive atmosphere in the dressing room. The Italian manager led Los Blancos to their long-awaited La Decima, their tenth European Championship title, during his time at the club. The Spanish defender also spoke highly of Aragones, who was the coach of the Spanish national team when they won the European Championship in 2008. Ramos noted that Aragones was an inspiration to him and many other young players who were part of Spain's successful Euro campaign. Finally, Ramos praised Caparros, who coached him during his time at Sevilla. The Spanish coach is admired for his tactical knowledge and ability to get the best out of his players. Ramos revealed that Caparros was instrumental in his development as a player and his leadership skills on the pitch. Despite the absence of Mourinho from Ramos' list, the Portuguese coach undoubtedly played an important role in the success of Real Madrid during his time at the club. His approach to coaching, however, did not sit well with everyone, which may explain his omission from Ramos' list. In conclusion, Ramos' list of the top three coaches that he has worked with is a testament to the high standards and expectations of Real Madrid. It is a clear reflection of the quality of coaching that is required to lead the club to success, both domestically and in Europe.
