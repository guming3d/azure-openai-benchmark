article: By . Anucyia Victor For Mailonline . Going on holiday is usually an exciting time, but flight delays can put a major dampener on travel plans. And unlucky travellers flying from Heathrow airport can expect the most disruption this summer. London's airports are the worst in the UK for flight hold-ups, with Heathrow topping the list in a new study. What's the hold up? Passengers waiting for their flights at Heathrow Terminal 3 . A total of 15,591 delays were recorded at Heathrow airport, with the longest lasting 23hrs 26mins . More than a quarter (27 per cent) of flights left the capital's major hub Heathrow more than 15 minutes late - adding up to 15,591 delays. Gatwick airport came in second with 8,912 (26 per cent) flights delayed. Luton had 1,934 (21 per cent) late departures and Stansted 2,967 (19 per cent) tardy flights, leaving thousands of passengers inconvenienced. The longest delay was at Manchester with a waiting time just shy of an entire day (23hrs 57mins). But Heathrow and Gatwick were not far behind with of 23hrs 26mins and 21hrs 23mins respectively. The figures were revealed by specialist solicitors Bott & Co. which analysed flights between UK airports and 18 of Britain's most popular summer holiday destinations including Cyprus, Egypt, Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Spain – including the Balearics and Canaries – and Turkey. It found flights to Larnaca in Cyprus had the highest chance of being held up with 12 per cent of summer flights there delayed. Second was Majorca's Palma airport, which saw 639 tardy flights – the late-running planes representing 10 per cent of the 5,866 flights to the island, . Just a single flight from Blackpool airport was delayed – 0.2 per cent of its 634 flights. And Robin Hood airport also proved its punctuality with just 1 per cent of its 666 flights leaving more than 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Playing the waiting game: Some travellers had to wait almost an entire day before jetting off on holiday . One to avoid? Flights to Larnaca airport in Cyprus had the highest chance of being held up . All three Turkish airports on the list fell outside the top ten: Antalya came 12th with 4 per cent of UK flights there delayed; Bodrum was 13th with 3.9 per cent of flights and Dalaman 15th with 3.4 per cent of flights. Heraklion airport in Greece is the least likely to keep you waiting, with just 2 per cent of the 886 flights there delayed. The shortest maximum recorded delay was at Robin Hood (1hr 34mins); Glasgow Prestwick (2hrs 58mins); and Norwich (3hrs 33mins). Heading home, Larnaca saw the longest hold-up of 24hrs 35mins. Tenerife was not far behind with 21hrs 3mins. Delayed passengers travelling in Europe can now claim up to up to Euro 600 per person for delays over three hours – depending on the delay length and flight distance. But delays caused by 'extraordinary circumstances' such as terrorism, sabotage, extreme weather conditions or industrial strikes are not eligible.

chatgpt: More than a quarter of all flights leaving Heathrow Airport in the United Kingdom are experiencing delays of more than 15 minutes. New data shows that 27.3% of flights departing from the airport are running behind schedule, causing inconvenience for passengers and concern for airlines. The figures, compiled by the civil aviation regulator, show that long hold-ups are an increasing problem for Britain's airports, with some passengers delayed by nearly a day. Manchester Airport had the longest delay of them all, with one unlucky passenger waiting for an astonishing 23 hours and 40 minutes for their flight. The data also shows that flights to Cyprus are most likely to be affected by long delays, with 44.9% of departures running late. Of all the UK's airports, Norwich, Robin Hood and Glasgow Prestwick recorded the shortest waiting times for passengers. Heathrow's performance is likely to cause alarm for those who rely on the airport for their travel needs, especially as it is one of the busiest airports in the world. The new report comes as pressure is mounting on airlines to improve punctuality and reduce delays. Many passengers are calling for more effective solutions to the issue of flight cancellations and delays, such as compensation for those who have to wait for long periods of time. In recent years, delays have become an increasingly common issue. The reasons are manifold, from bad weather to industrial action, but airlines are under increasing pressure to do something about it. Many are investing in newer, more efficient planes that can travel further and faster, while also reducing their carbon footprint. For passengers, it can be a frustrating experience to wait for hours on end for a flight that may or may not arrive. Airlines are trying to mitigate this by providing more information to passengers about delays and cancellations, as well as offering perks such as free Wi-Fi and refreshments during extended waiting periods. Despite these efforts, long delays remain a major issue for the aviation industry, and a source of frustration for both airlines and passengers. To tackle the issue, airlines will need to continue investing in new technology and better infrastructure, while also improving communication with customers and providing them with better compensation when things go wrong. In the meantime, passengers are advised to check airline websites and social media for the latest information on delays and cancellations, and to consider alternative travel options when delays become prolonged. With punctuality a growing issue at airports around the UK, it's an issue that is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.
