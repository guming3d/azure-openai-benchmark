article: Paris (CNN) -- Turkey is fuming over French legislation that would criminalize any public denial of what the bill calls the Armenian genocide last century in Ottoman Turkey. "We are reviewing our relations with France," Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after the French National Assembly passed the so-called Armenian genocide bill. "We will take our measures phase by phase depending on France's behavior from now on. Erdogan said Turkey is recalling its Paris ambassador for consultations to Ankara, is canceling bilateral visits, and won't cooperate with France in joint projects within the European Union. "We are stopping all kinds of political consultations with France. We are canceling bilateral military activities and joint exercises from now on. We are canceling the permission granted annually for all military overflights, landings and take-offs. We are starting permission process for every military flight individually. From today on, we are rejecting the permission requests of military ships to visit ports. We will not attend and held the bilateral Turkey-France joint economic and trade partnership committee meeting that was planned for January 2012 under the co-chairmanship of the economy ministers of the two countries," Erdogan said. "I am underlining this. This is the first phase." The bill -- applauded by Armenians -- must now be voted on by the country's senate. Erdogan said he hopes the French Senate will vote down the bill. "New measures will come to the agenda depending on the progress of the bill in France and we will apply them with determination without any hesitation." Armenian groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915, Turks committed genocide, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. But modern-day Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, arguing instead that hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Muslim Turks died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. The genocide debate is an annual source of tension between Turkey and the United States, two NATO military allies. The White House annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution which would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide. "The issue should be researched not by politicians, but by historians," Turkish Parliament Speaker Cemil Cicek said. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told Turkish lawmakers Thursday that Turkey is a friend and ally of France and strives to maintain a dialogue. Armenia's foreign minister, Edward Nalbandian, hailed the move, saying France "reconfirmed its high place of being the cradle of human rights and once again proved its commitment to universal human values." "The French people showed that human rights are highest value, and today by adopting this bill," he said, indicating that crimes against humanity have no statute of limitations and deserve condemnation. According to official Turkish statistics, the volume of trade between Turkey and France from January to the end of October this year was more than $13.5 billion.

chatgpt: The growing tension between Turkey and France continues to escalate as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that Turkey is reviewing its ties with France. Erdogan explicitly stated that the country may take measures, including sanctions, if a controversial new French bill that criminalizes the denial of the Armenian genocide becomes law. The bill, which was passed by the French National Assembly in 2019 and moved to the Senate for final approval, aims to criminalize the denial of the Armenian genocide, which took place during World War I. The Ottoman Empire, which is now modern-day Turkey, has denied that the tragic event constituted a genocide and has refused to recognize it as such. Erdogan’s latest statement comes after the Armenian National Committee of America issued a statement that urged Congress to vote on a resolution recognizing the genocide. The issue has regularly come up in the U.S. Congress, with some lawmakers supporting the recognition of the event as a genocide. France, on the other hand, has taken a strong stance on the issue, with President Emmanuel Macron pledging to recognize the Armenian genocide during his election campaign. The bill now being voted on by the French Senate would make it a criminal offense to deny the genocide and would carry a penalty of up to one year in prison and a fine of €45,000. In response to the French bill, Erdogan has threatened to review Turkey's ties with France if the bill becomes law. Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, Erdogan stated that Turkey "strongly condemns" the bill and that "it has no place in history or politics." He went on to say that France's actions were "irresponsible" and "done with political calculations," adding that Turkey would take all necessary measures if the bill were to become law. The possibility of sanctions by Turkey against France could have serious economic consequences for both countries. French-Turkish relations have been strained in recent years, with issues such as Turkey's human rights abuses and involvement in the Syrian conflict causing tension between the two countries. The Turkish president's statement has been met with mixed reactions from the international community, with some condemning France's actions and others supporting Turkey's stance. The European Union has called for calm and urged both sides to engage in dialogue, while the United States has not yet commented on the issue. The French Senate must now vote on the bill, which is expected to be a contentious issue. If it becomes law, it could significantly strain the already fragile relationship between Turkey and France, as well as have broader implications for European-Turkish relations. In conclusion, the ongoing dispute over the recognition of the Armenian genocide continues to cause tension between Turkey and France. Erdogan's threat to review Turkey's ties with France and impose sanctions if the bill becomes law highlights the seriousness of the issue. The international community has urged both sides to engage in dialogue to resolve the issue peacefully, but it remains to be seen how the French Senate will vote on the bill and what the repercussions of this decision will be.
