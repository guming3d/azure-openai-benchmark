article: Ticket prices for The Open at St Andrews next year will rise by £5 to a minimum of £70 for an adult - or £80 on the day - despite disappointing attendances the last time it was held in Scotland. High prices were blamed for a drop in attendance at Muirfield in 2013 and ticket prices were frozen for this year's Open at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake. In 2013, the R&A had hoped for 170,000 fans to attend but only 142,036 did - 18,000 fewer than at the same venue in 2002 when tickets cost £35 - which saw a £1.35million shortfall in ticket income.
