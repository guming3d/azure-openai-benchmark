article: The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft guidelines proposed this week, WHO is encouraging people to consume less than 5% of their total daily calories from sugars. The organization's current guidelines, published in 2002, recommend eating less than 10% of your total daily calories from sugars. Most Americans still consume much more. Our sweet tooth increased 39% between 1950 and 2000, according to the USDA. The average American now consumes about three pounds of sugar each week. "There is increasing concern that consumption of free sugars, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, may result in ... an increase in total caloric intake, leading to an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases," WHO said in a statement. Of particular concern, WHO said, is the role sugar plays in causing dental diseases worldwide. For an adult at a normal body mass index, or BMI, eating 5% would be around 25 grams of sugar -- or six teaspoons. That's less than is typically found in a single can of regular soda, which contains about 40 grams of sugar. Real or fake sugar: Does it matter? To find the amount of calories from sugar in a product, multiply the grams by 4. For example, a product containing 15 grams of sugar has 60 calories from sugar per serving, according to the American Heart Association. If you eat 2,000 calories a day, that's 3%. WHO's proposed guidelines apply to sugars added to foods by manufacturers, as well as those found naturally in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit concentrates. They do not apply to those found in fresh produce. "Much of the sugars consumed today are 'hidden' in processed foods that are not usually seen as sweets," the WHO website states. Did you know sugar is often added to your frozen pizza? How about your bread, soup, yogurt and mayonnaise? As consumers became more concerned about the amount of fat in their food, manufacturers went out of their way to make low-fat items -- often substituting sugar to preserve the taste. Choosing foods with fewer added sugars at the grocery story may soon get a little easier. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed several changes to the nutrition labels you see on packaged foods and beverages. The proposed labels would also note how much added sugar is in a product. Right now, it's hard to know what is naturally occurring sugar and what has been added by the manufacturer. The WHO guidelines will be open for public comment until March 31. Then WHO will finalize and publish its recommendations.

chatgpt: The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued new guidelines that suggest people should consume less than 5% of their total daily calorie intake from sugars. This recommendation comes as concerns about the impact of sugar on health continue to grow. For an adult with a normal body mass index (BMI), consuming 5% of their daily calories in the form of sugar would equate to around 25 grams per day. This is equivalent to around six teaspoons of sugar. Excessive sugar intake has been linked to a wide range of health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. However, one of the biggest concerns for the WHO is the role that sugar plays in causing dental diseases. According to the WHO, dental diseases affect around 3.5 billion people worldwide. These conditions range from cavities to gum disease and can cause significant pain and discomfort. In severe cases, dental diseases can even lead to tooth loss, which can have a negative impact on a person's overall health and wellbeing. One of the primary causes of dental disease is the bacteria that inhabit the oral cavity. These bacteria feed on sugar, which provides them with the energy they need to survive and reproduce. The more sugar a person consumes, the more fuel these bacteria have, which can lead to an overgrowth and subsequent dental problems. Understanding the impact of sugar on dental health is important, but it is also critical to recognize that consuming too much sugar can have negative effects throughout the body. When people consume large amounts of sugar, their bodies are forced to produce high levels of insulin to deal with the glucose that is released into the bloodstream. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance, which in turn increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Given all of these concerns, the WHO's new guidelines are welcome news. However, it is important to note that cutting back on sugar can be challenging, especially given its pervasive presence in many processed foods and drinks. To help avoid excessive sugar intake, people should focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and limit their intake of sugary treats and drinks. Ultimately, the WHO's new guidelines are an important reminder of the need to pay attention to our sugar intake, not just for our dental health, but for our overall wellbeing. By making conscious choices about what we eat and drink, we can help reduce our risk of developing a wide range of health problems, from tooth decay to cardiovascular disease.
