chatgpt: Wyldfire, the new dating app that promises to weed out creeps, will be launching in the UK next month. The app, which has received praise for its unique approach to online dating, aims to create a safe and welcoming environment for women by allowing them to recommend men to the app's database. Unlike other dating apps that allow anyone to sign up, Wyldfire requires men to be invited by a female friend before they can join. This not only provides a level of safety for women, but it also ensures that men using the app have been pre-approved by women they know and trust. "We wanted to create an app that put women's safety and comfort first," said Wyldfire co-founder and CEO, Brian Freeman. "By requiring men to be recommended by women, we're not only weeding out creeps, but we're also creating a community of men who are respectful and trustworthy." The app has already gained a significant following in the US, where it was launched in 2014. With over 100,000 downloads to date, Wyldfire has received positive feedback from both women and men for its unique approach to online dating. "I love the fact that I can recommend guys to the app," said Sarah, a Wyldfire user in the US. "It makes me feel like I have a say in who's using the app, and it gives me peace of mind knowing that the men on there have been pre-approved by women I trust." While the app's focus on women's safety has been praised, some have criticized the fact that men can only join when recommended by a woman. However, Freeman believes that this is necessary to create a truly safe and respectful online community. "We know that some men may feel left out, but we believe that by prioritizing women's safety, we're creating a better app for everyone," he said. In addition to its unique approach to user registration, Wyldfire also offers features such as photo blur, which allows users to block out certain parts of their photos for added privacy. The app also requires users to fill out a detailed profile, which helps to ensure that users are more than just a pretty face. As the app prepares to launch in the UK, Freeman and his team are excited about the app's potential to create a safer and more respectful online dating community. "We know that online dating can be tough, but we're hoping that Wyldfire can make it a little bit easier, and a lot safer," he said. "We're excited to see how the app will be received in the UK, and we're looking forward to creating a truly global community of respectful and trustworthy daters."
