An Arby's restaurant assistant manager has been fired less than 24 hours after being threatened by an armed robber because she was alone on duty. Mary Archer, who worked at the restaurant chain in East Dayton, Ohio, had to climb through a drive-thru window to escape the robber, who rang the doorbell armed with a knife just as she was closing up for the night. The 56-year-old said she was cornered in the fast food chain's office by the man, who repeatedly shouted 'give me the money'. Fearing for her life, she made her escape - only to be fired the next day for being alone in the restaurant at the time. Fired: Mary Archer, 56, had worked for Arby's for 23 years before the attempted robbery on Friday night . Late night attack: The Arby's fast food restaurant in East Dayton was attacked on Friday night . The attempted robbery happened in the early hours of Saturday morning as Archer closed up following a busy night. Her co-worker had just left at about 12.45am when, a few minutes later, the doorbell rang. Ms Archer, who has worked at Arby's for 23 years, said her first thoughts were that her co-worker had left her belongings behind - but instead the man burst in demanding money. She told News Center 7 how she was cornered in the office, before shoving the man backwards and escaping through the window, where she screamed for help. She said: “He held up a knife and kept saying "give me the money". 'I had pushed him away…because I’m like, ‘I’m not going to die in Arby’s tonight…I’m just not.' A customer at a nearby shop heard her calls for help and called the police. Vulnerable: Archer said the fast food chain has been targeted three times in the last six months . But although the thief fled empty-handed, the event ended up costing Archer her job. The following day she was told she had broken Arby's safety and security policy by being alone in the fast food business when it was robbed. For this, she was fired less than 24 hours after the armed robbery - which Archer said was the third attempted robbery within six months. The thief was described as about 5-foot-10, 150 pounds and wore a dark colored hoodie, dark pants and a dark wool stocking cap. Arby's told New Center 7 that violations of its safety and security policy mean termination of employment without exception. A vice-president of Arby’s Human Resources told WHIO TV that 'he feels bad that Ms. Archer had to go through this' - but that she knowingly violated the company’s safety and security policy, and had been warned before. Ms Archer added: 'I don’t want my job back.'

chatgpt: In a shocking incident in the town of Springfield, Mary Archer, an assistant manager at Arby's, was robbed at gunpoint while locking up after a busy Friday night shift. The 56-year-old had been working for the fast food chain for a commendable 23 years when she fell victim to the attack. However, the chain chose to terminate her employment citing her being alone in the restaurant as a violation of their safety standards, leaving Mary without a job despite her long years of service. The incident occurred on Friday night, just as Mary was about to shut the doors of the Arby's restaurant for the night. A masked man wielding a gun confronted her and demanded money from the cash register. Mary, who had been through similar incidents before, was quick to comply with the robber's demands, but not before getting a good look at his face. The Springfield Police Department has initiated an investigation and is currently analyzing surveillance footage to identify the intruder. According to eyewitnesses, the robber fled the scene in a car, which was subsequently found to have been stolen earlier that day. Meanwhile, Arby's corporate office issued a statement in which they stated that they have a zero-tolerance policy against employees being alone in the restaurant during or after business hours. According to the statement, the company's safety protocols require two or more employees to be present at all times for their protection against possible criminal activities. The statement went on to say that despite repeated reminders, Mary violated these protocols, leading to her termination. However, Mary's colleagues and customers are protesting against the decision, citing her long years of service and the dangerous working conditions in the area. Mary's co-worker, Jane, said, "Mary has been working here for more than two decades, and she knows everything about running this store. She was the one who trained most of us, and it's not fair that she lost her job over something she had no control over." Several customers have taken to social media to express their support for Mary, with some even threatening to boycott Arby's until justice is served. Some have also started a GoFundMe campaign to help her out until she can find a new job. Speaking to local media, Mary said, "It's not easy to find a job at my age, and I was hoping to work for a few more years before retiring. Losing my job over something that wasn't my fault is just not fair." The incident has raised questions about the safety measures that companies should be providing to their employees to ensure their well-being, particularly in high-risk areas. It has also highlighted the need for more comprehensive employment policies that take into account the challenges of the modern workplace.
