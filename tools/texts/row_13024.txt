article: When you look at Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, you know immediately they are football superstars. But with his shirt untucked and socks round his ankles, Thomas Muller looks more like a schoolboy playing in the playground. But make no mistake, he is absolutely lethal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Thomas Muller dancing Gangnam style in a club . Team player: Muller celebrates with Ozil after opening the scoring in Belo Horizonte . UNORTHODOX TALENT . There is a beautiful ugliness to Muller’s game. Sometimes his touch can be scrappy and he doesn’t go for fancy tricks, but he’s so effective. How many times does he pop up in the right place at the right time? That doesn’t happen by accident — he is aware of where he needs to be and does whatever it takes to get there. TOP TECHNICIAN . As well as reading the game so well, Muller has the technique to go with it. He is quick, strong and good with both feet; he can just as easily bend one in the top corner as scuff one in from close range. He’s good in the air, holds the ball up well and brings team-mates into the game. A manager’s dream. Workaholic: Muller in action during the quarter-final win over France in Rio de Janeiro . TEAM PLAYER . Muller is unique in that you don’t really know his best position. He’s not quite a striker, not quite a winger. You could play him as a No 10 or an old-fashioned inside-forward. But wherever he ends up he’s dangerous. How would England use a player like that? Because he doesn’t catch the eye and his skills aren’t as apparent, he might not even get a chance. Credit Germany for getting the best out of such a versatile player. Start of the rout: Muller took advantage of awful Brazil defending to score Germany's opening goal . WORKAHOLIC . One thing you are guaranteed is a huge amount of effort. Even if things aren’t coming off, he gives everything for his team and it rubs off on the rest of the side. Their work ethic is fantastic. WORLD CUP WONDER . It's the pinnacle of the game, so you don’t score 10 goals in two tournaments without being something special. Muller was young player of the tournament and Golden Boot winner in South Africa and is one game away from being player of the tournament in Brazil. Muller’s one of those players who thrives on this kind of pressure. He is a tournament specialist and he is clearly enjoying himself in Brazil. Not far behind: Klose's team-mate Tjomas Muller looks ready to beat his goals record . RECORD-BREAKER . Miroslav Klose just broke the all-time World Cup scoring record with 16. Muller is only 24 but he’s already got 10. That is an unbelievable achievement and I fully expect him to go on and beat his  team-mate’s record.

chatgpt: As the World Cup final between Germany and Argentina draws near, all eyes are on the German star, Thomas Muller. The 24-year-old forward has captured the hearts of football fans around the world with his quick moves, strength, and versatility. Muller, who looks like a schoolboy playing in the playground with his scruffy hair and impish grin, may not appear intimidating at first glance. However, his performance on the field proves otherwise. Muller has been one of the standout performers for Germany in the tournament, scoring five goals and providing three assists throughout the competition. Muller's performance has earned him a spot on the shortlist for the Golden Ball award, which is given to the best player of the tournament. He faces stiff competition from the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar, and Arjen Robben. However, Muller is no stranger to achieving success on a global stage. In the 2010 World Cup, he won both the Golden Boot and the Best Young Player award. Muller's impressive skills have not gone unnoticed by his teammates, who have praised his contributions to their success. Manuel Neuer, the German goalkeeper, described Muller as a "team player" who always puts the team's needs ahead of his own. "He’s not interested in individual awards, he’s interested in winning the World Cup," Neuer said. When asked about his chances of winning the Golden Ball award, Muller remained modest. "All I’m interested in is winning the World Cup," he said. "If I’m named the best player, that’s a nice bonus, but it’s not my main goal." Muller's versatility is also a key asset for Germany. He can play in multiple positions, including as a striker, winger, or attacking midfielder. This makes him a valuable asset for the team's coach, Joachim Löw, who can rely on Muller to adapt to different situations and opponents. As Germany prepares to take on Argentina in the final, Muller is determined to be a hero for his team. "I want to help my team win the World Cup," he said. "I don't care if I score or not, as long as we win." Despite his achievements, Muller remains humble and focused on the team's success. His dedication and team-first mentality make him a role model for young football players around the world. The World Cup final on Sunday will be a test for Muller and the entire German team, but if anyone can rise to the occasion, it is the scruffy-haired schoolboy who has captured the hearts of football fans around the world.
