article: Many animal lovers are familiar with the nuisance caused by cats interrupting their work by climbing across their papers or computer keyboard. But this is not a new phenomenon, as this extraordinary photograph of a medieval manuscript proves. The 15th-century book is marked with four pawprints, which appear to be the result of a cat jumping on to the paper. Age-old problem: This 15th-century manuscript has been damaged by a cat walking across it . The animal also seems to have stepped in ink of some kind, leading to the exceptional clarity of the marks even five or more centuries later. The picture was taken by Emir O. Filipovic, a scholar working in the Dubrovnik State Archives in Croatia. After he sent it to historian Erik Kwakkel last year, the image took on a life of its own as web users shared it as a poignant proof of how cats have been beloved pets for half a millennium. The book is part of the 'Lettere e commissioni di Levante', an official record of the activities of the Dubrovnik government throughout the Middle Ages. Clear: The animal had apparently just stepped in a pot of ink before jumping onto the book . Document: The book contains medieval records from the city of Dubrovnik, now in Croatia . These days, if a government document was disfigured by an animal it would probably be destroyed and replaced - but back then writing was such an elaborate and expensive exercise that the book could not be wasted. This week, Mr Filipovic went online to give his own interpretation of the image's success. 'You can almost picture the writer shooing the cat in a panicky fashion while trying to remove it from his desk,' he wrote. Unique: The mishap is an extraordinary glimpse into the daily life of a scribe in the Middle Ages . 'Despite his best efforts the damage was already complete and there was nothing else he could have done but turn a new leaf and continue his job. In that way this little episode was "archived" in history.' This is not the only incident of a cat vandalising a manuscript - one item in the Cologne archive features a page left half-blank because an animal had urinated on it when it was left out overnight. Cats were often allowed to live in monasteries and scriptoria because they chased away mice which might otherwise nibble at the manuscripts.

chatgpt: A unique and peculiar document has come to light from the Dubrovnik State Archives in Croatia. The document, which dates back to the medieval period, bears stains of pet ink, evidence of a mischievous and unexpected interruption in the archives' daily routine. According to sources within the archives, a small animal, later identified as a cat, had gained access to the scriptorium where important documents were being kept. The cat, known by the name of pet, playfully hopped onto an archive book that was open on a table, and playfully stepped in its inkwell. Amused by the feline's antics, the scribes on duty did not shoo the animal away, only to realize their mistake once pet leaped onto the archive book. The feline-ink mishap, as it has been called, has left its mark on the historic document. The paw print of the curious pet still mars the page, standing out against the black ink of the text. While the pet has long since passed on, it appears as if its legacy will live on in this unexpected footnote in history. The head archivist of the Dubrovnik State Archives has expressed deep regret over the incident. "We take the preservation of these documents very seriously," he said in a statement. "However, we cannot anticipate every unexpected occurrence that may arise, and this mishap serves as a reminder that we must remain vigilant at all times." Despite the regrettable incident, historians and researchers alike find the feline print quite fascinating. To them, it serves as an insight into the daily lives of those who worked in the archive, reminding us that history is not just the words on the page, but also the stories that surround it.  The document itself remains on display at the Dubrovnik State Archives, framed and under glass, marking a curious piece of history with a playful element. Visitors to the archives are often drawn to it, pondering the whimsical twist of fate that brought the pet and the scriptorium together. Ultimately, the feline-ink mishap serves as a cautionary tale for archivists and historians alike. It reminds us to remain vigilant in our efforts to preserve history, but also reminds us to appreciate the more unexpected and curious elements of our past.
