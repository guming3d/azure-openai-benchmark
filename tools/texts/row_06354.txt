The home's most notable feature is the courtyard, which sits in the center and is visible from nearly every room in the house. The courtyard is surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows that let in ample natural light and fresh air, while a full shade cloth screen prevents pesky mosquitoes from getting in.  Inside, the home is just as thoughtfully designed as the exterior. The open-plan living space is bright and airy, with a minimalist aesthetic that allows the standout features to shine. The kitchen is sleek and modern, with high-end appliances and a large island bench. The dining area features a stunning pendant light and a built-in bench that doubles as storage. The living room is cozy and inviting, with a fireplace and comfortable seating.  The home's three bedrooms are located upstairs, each with their own unique design elements. The master suite features a private balcony with lush green views, as well as a luxurious ensuite bathroom with a large soaking tub.
