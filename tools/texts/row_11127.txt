article: Minister for the Disabled Mark Harper has been labelled a 'hypocrite' after it emerged his own office isn't wheelchair friendly. The Tory MP recently criticised businesses around the country for not making it easier for the disabled to get in and out. But critics pointed out that the minister's own constituencyÂ office in Cinderford, Gloucestershire is on a steep hill with a large step from the pavement to the front door withno handrail. Constituents have attacked Mark Harper, Minister for the Disabled, after it emerged he criticised 'inaccessible' shops and restaurants - despite his own constituency office being 'difficult to get into' Local Labour councillor Max Coburn branded the MP was a 'hypocrite', adding: 'It's a bit rich criticising people when he doesn't do it himself. 'It's an awkward slope up to the door and you think he would have done something since he moved but he hasn't.' Mr Harper, member of Parliament for the Forest of Dean, hit out earlier this month after a survey he commissioned discovered around a fifth of shops and a third of restaurants lack facilities to allow access for wheelchair users. In response he said: 'This isn't just about doing what's right. Businesses are missing a trick by not doing more to tap into this market. 'Everyone deserves to be able to go Christmas shopping or enjoy a festive meal or drink with their friends or colleagues. Improving accessibility is a no-brainer.' Mr Harper recently railed against shops with bad accessibility and insisted that improving it is a 'no-brainer' Critics say the large step and lack of rail in front of his office's front door make it difficult to enter . He has now shrugged off criticism of his  office, claiming only a small number of constituents visit him in person and insisting he's willing to meet them elsewhere. He said: 'Any constituent can use either the phone or email to reach my office. 'If anybody wishes to meet me to discuss an issue in person at a surgery then I hold these on a regular basis in accessible venues around the constituency. 'If a wheelchair user was to do so, then we do have a ramp available.' His original comments came after a government audit of more than 30,000 shops and restaurants branded access for disabled people  'shocking'. The report found only 15 per cent of restaurants and shops had hearing loops and three quarters of restaurants did not cater for those with visual impairments.

chatgpt: The Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the Forest of Dean and current Minister for the Disabled, has recently drawn attention for his criticism of shops with poor access for those in wheelchairs. However, some locals in his constituency have pointed out that his own constituency office is difficult to access. The MP's constituency office, which locals refer to as his 'shop', is situated on a hill and has a step with no rail by the front door, making it a challenge for those with disabilities to access. This has raised questions about the MP's sincerity towards promoting access for those with disabilities. The MP has shrugged off the criticism, insisting that he does have a ramp available for those who need it. However, locals have pointed out that the ramp is not always present and that it can be difficult to arrange for someone to bring it out. Additionally, the ramp's angle is steep, which can be dangerous for those in a wheelchair. The controversy comes as the MP has been publicly criticising various shops in the Forest of Dean for their poor access to those with disabilities. In particular, he has highlighted shops that have steps at their entrance without a ramp, making it impossible for those in wheelchairs to enter.  The MP has called on shops to ensure that they are accessible to all customers and has even suggested that those who fail to comply should face penalties. However, the irony of the situation has not been lost on his constituents, with many pointing out that the MP should lead by example and ensure that his own workplace is accessible. The issue has brought attention to the challenges faced by those with disabilities in the Forest of Dean and across the UK, where many shops and public spaces remain inaccessible. It has also sparked a debate about the responsibilities of those in positions of power to lead by example in advocating for accessibility. In response to the criticism, the MP has stated that he is committed to ensuring that his office is accessible to all and that he will be taking steps to improve access. He has also reiterated his call for all shops and public spaces to ensure they are accessible and inclusive to all, regardless of their abilities. Overall, this controversy has highlighted the importance of considering accessibility in all aspects of public life and the need for those in positions of power to lead by example. As the Minister for the Disabled, the MP has a unique opportunity to make a real difference in promoting accessibility and inclusion, and his actions and words will be closely watched by his constituents and disability rights advocates alike.
