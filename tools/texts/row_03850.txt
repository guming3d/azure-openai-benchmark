article: By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Injured: Natalie Eaton, 18, was impaled with a golf club on her second day of college, while attending a fraternity rush party at Arkansas State University . An 18-year-old was just two days into college when she was sent to the hospital in critical condition after getting impaled with a golf club at a fraternity party. Natalie Eaton of Harrisburg, Arkansas awoke on Thursday and was able to move most of her body, but she still doesn't remember the accident that sent her to St Bernard's Hospital in Memphis. According to authorities, Eaton was attending a rush party at Arkansas State University's Kappa Alpha fraternity, having a cookout and playing games around 6pm Tuesday evening. That's when a 19-year-old man threw a football at a 20-year-old man, and the 20-year-old hit it baseball-style with a golf club. But when the club made contact with the football, the shaft snapped and hurled at Eaton, impaling her in the neck. Doctors say the club hit a major artery and her spinal cord and initially told friends and family she may be paralyzed. But the immediate response of the man who caused the accident may have reduced that threat. 'His quick reactions probably saved her life,' Eaton's best friend Makaleigh Riddle told KAIT. The unnamed student held Eaton's head up for 15 minutes, applying pressure to the wound, until an ambulance showed up. Eaton was then taken to St Bernard's in critical condition.

Â The 20-year-old who accidentally impaled Eaton also helped keep her stable until ambulances arrived . It wasn't until Thursday afternoon that she finally woke up, and appeared to have recovered much more than expected. 'Where the club went in, it hit her spinal cord,' Riddle said. 'The way doctors talked about it, it was probably paralysis. That's the best that we were looking at. It was really hard to hear. But now she's moving her arms and legs a day later.' Rick Stripling, ASU's vice chancellor of student affairs, says he doesn't expect charges to be filed in the case since it was an accident. The fraternity has since reached out to Eaton and her family on Twitter, in apology and the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority held a prayer vigil for the new student. The incident happened just one day after classes started for Fall 2014. Getting better: Eaton woke up on Thursday and was responsive and able to move, but didn't remember the accident that sent her to the hospital .

chatgpt: In a terrifying incident that has left her friends, family and sorority sisters shaken, Natalie Eaton, a freshman at the University of Memphis, was impaled at a fraternity party on Tuesday evening. Eaton was attending a rush party when a freak accident occurred, resulting in a golf club shaft being driven into her throat. According to witnesses, an unnamed 20-year-old was hitting a football with a golf club when the club's shaft suddenly snapped, sending it flying in the direction of Eaton. The shaft lodged itself in her neck, leaving her critically injured and unable to move. Eaton was immediately transported to a local hospital where she underwent emergency surgery. For two days, she remained unconscious and in critical condition, with doctors warning her family that she may never regain movement in her limbs. However, Eaton defied all odds and expectations when she woke up on Thursday, much to the surprise and relief of her family, friends, and the medical staff treating her. Despite her traumatic injury, Eaton was responsive and able to move, a ray of hope for everyone involved in her care. "I am just so relieved that Natalie is pulling through and showing signs of recovery," said her mother. "It was a heart-wrenching experience to see her lying there, but we had faith in the medical team and in Natalie's own inner strength." The incident has shaken the University of Memphis, with the campus community holding a vigil for Eaton on Wednesday evening. Her sorority sisters, in particular, have rallied around her, setting up a crowdfunding campaign to support her medical bills and rehabilitation. The fraternity involved in the incident has issued a statement expressing their deep regret for what happened, and have pledged to cooperate with the authorities in investigating the accident. Campus officials also issued a statement reminding students to be cautious and practice safety measures, especially when attending social events on campus or in the community. For Eaton, the road to recovery will likely be a long and challenging one, but her medical team remains optimistic about her prognosis. "Natalie has shown remarkable determination and resilience," said her doctor. "We will continue to monitor her progress closely and provide the highest level of care to help her get back to her daily routine as soon as possible." The incident has served as a stark reminder of the importance of safety and vigilance, and the need to be cautious even in seemingly innocuous situations. This tragedy has proven that a moment of carelessness can change lives forever, and we must all exercise caution in all aspects of our lives.
