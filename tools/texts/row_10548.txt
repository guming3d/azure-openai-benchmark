article: A driver sent a ticket for speeding past a primary school has successfully had his case dismissed after arguing the white lines marked either side were too short. David Erasmus, 55, opted to have his day in court after being snapped allegedly doing 36mph in a 30mph zone. After receiving the ticket, the former engineer had revisited the spot where he was caught and noticed that the white road markings, used to measure the speed that a vehicle is travelling between them, seemed short. David Erasmus (pictured) opted to have his day in court after being snapped allegedly doing 36mph in a 30mph zone in Hendy, west Wales . Adamant he had not been speeding, he measured the markings and found they were three inches shorter than at other speed camera locations. During his trial, Mr Erasmus, of Hendy, near Llanelli, west Wales, was able to convice Llanelli Magistrates Court that the shorter lines made it appear he was going faster than he actually was. His case has now been formally dismissed. During his trial, he argued the white lines used to measure speed (pictured) were three inches out, meaning he appeared on the speed camera to be going faster than he actually was . Mr Erasmus has now had his case formally dismissed at Llanelli Magistrates Court and said the ruling was likely to impact other drivers . The decision could mean hundreds of other drivers have been wrongly convicted of speeding - some may even have been banned. 'The lines were three inches short, which is a big difference. It will impact on other drivers,' he said after the trial. 'It was worth challenging it as I got it to court and the case was dismissed.' A spokesman for GoSafe, which is responsible for speed camera enforcement in Wales, said it would look closely at the evidence in the case. 'The camera and secondary check marks on the A4138 has been fully type approved by the Home Office and the secondary check marks in particular, meet the required tolerance. 'The outcome of the case is a matter for the Magistrates Courts, however, we are keen to understand the circumstances and will review the case in due course.' Carmarthenshire Council transport manager John McEvoy said: 'The markings referred to will be measured by our team this week to confirm the interval measurements reported to the court and, if necessary, amended.' GoSafe, which is responsible for speed camera enforcement in Wales, has said it would look closely at the evidence in the case .

chatgpt: A man in Wales has successfully challenged a speeding ticket issued to him after noticing a mistake in the markings used to calculate his speed. David Erasmus, 55, was sent the ticket for allegedly speeding past a primary school. However, he noticed that the markings used to work out his speed were three inches too short, meaning the calculation was incorrect.  Mr. Erasmus decided to challenge the ticket and took his case to Llanelli Magistrates' Court. After a trial, the case was formally dismissed, meaning the ticket was cancelled and Mr. Erasmus will not have to pay the fine or receive any penalty points on his driving license.  This decision is significant not only for Mr. Erasmus but for other drivers who may have been wrongly accused of speeding. It means that other drivers who have been issued with tickets based on faulty speed calculations may also be able to appeal their convictions. Speaking about his experience Mr. Erasmus said, "I was shocked to receive the speeding ticket, as I had no memory of breaking the speed limit. On closer inspection, I realised that the markings used to calculate my speed were too short. I decided to challenge the ticket and am pleased that justice has been done." The markings used to calculate speed are a common tool used by police forces around the world to determine whether a driver is exceeding the speed limit. The markings are usually painted on the road and are used to measure the time it takes for a vehicle to travel a certain distance. Based on this time, the speed of the vehicle can be calculated. However, mistakes can be made in the placement of these markings, which can lead to incorrect speed readings. This case highlights the importance of ensuring that the equipment and processes used to enforce speed limits are accurate and reliable. The decision to dismiss Mr. Erasmus' case also demonstrates the importance of being vigilant when receiving penalties or fines. If Mr. Erasmus had not noticed the mistake in the markings used to calculate his speed, he may have been wrongly convicted of a crime he did not commit. In conclusion, this case serves as a reminder to drivers to always be aware of their surroundings and to challenge any penalties or fines that they feel may be unjust. It also highlights the need for law enforcement agencies to ensure that their equipment and processes are accurate, reliable and fit for purpose.
