A wanted drug smuggler has been arrested in the middle of a game of poker in a swoop by armed police. Robert Knight, 53, from Walsall, was held in Saffy's sports bar in Calpe near Benidorm in southeast Spain last night after six years on the run. He was enjoying a game of Texas Hold'em poker when gun-wielding officers burst in and arrested him under a European Arrest Warrant. Knight, accused of a conspiracy to import cocaine, had previously been named on a most wanted list of British criminals who had fled to Spain. Hank Cole, Head of International Operations for the UK's National Crime Agency, said: 'Knight is believed to be a member of an organised crime group involved in the importation and distribution of illegal drugs. 'He had been on the run for a number of years but we were able to track him down. Spain is not a safe haven.' West Midlands Police seized six kilogrammes of cocaine at Heathrow Airport in April 2008 and arrested five men, who were later jailed, but had been looking for Knight ever since. Inspector Dave Simpson from the force said: 'I am delighted that Knight has been caught, it has been a long time coming. 'This just demonstrates that there is no hiding place for criminals and we will work with police forces from other countries along with the National Crime Agency to seek them out.' Knight is due to appear at the Spanish National Court in Madrid on Sunday where extradition proceedings will begin.

chatgpt: Robert Knight, a 53-year-old man, has been arrested in connection with a major drug seizure that took place more than a decade ago. Reportedly on the run since April 2008, Knight was apprehended by Spanish police while playing Texas Hold'em poker in a Costa Blanca bar. The arrest was made after heavily armed police raided Saffy's Sports Bar in Calpe, which is situated close to the popular tourist destination of Benidorm. According to reports, Knight had been on the run since the discovery of 6kg of cocaine during a search at Heathrow Airport. The drugs were intercepted by law enforcement officials, and Knight subsequently disappeared. He had been at large for more than a decade before his recent arrest. The National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom will now seek the extradition of Knight from Spain, where he was arrested. Knight is wanted on suspicion of drug trafficking and other related offenses in connection with the Heathrow seizure. While it remains to be seen how the extradition process will unfold, reports indicate that authorities in both the UK and Spain are actively working to bring Knight to justice. The case is a testament to the persistence of law enforcement officials in pursuing criminals who seek to evade justice. Despite more than a decade elapsing since the drug seizure, authorities were able to track down Knight and bring him to justice for his alleged involvement. The arrest highlights the ongoing efforts to combat drug trafficking and other forms of organized crime around the world. In conclusion, the arrest of Robert Knight represents a major victory for law enforcement officials in the UK and Spain. The efforts of authorities to track down individuals who evade justice for extended periods of time demonstrate a commitment to pursuing justice and holding criminals accountable. As the extradition process unfolds, the public will await further updates to see how the case proceeds.
