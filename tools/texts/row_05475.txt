article: (CNN)  -- Amid conservative opposition, a bill that would designate a day of "significance" in California for slain gay politician Harvey Milk is heading to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's desk. Harvey Milk was California's first openly gay elected official. He was assassinated in 1978. The legislation would denote May 22 -- Milk's birthday -- as a day of significance across the state. The governor's office said Tuesday it had received more than 100,000 constituent phone calls about the bill, although it was not immediately clear if most were in favor of it or opposed. The governor's office said Schwarzenegger has not taken a position on it yet. Milk, the state's first openly gay elected official, served briefly as San Francisco's supervisor before he and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated in 1978. Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year, saying he believed Milk "should be continued to be recognized at the local level by those who were most impacted by his contributions." State Sen. Mark Leno, a Democrat who authored the current bill as well as last year's, said in a written statement that the governor had "contradicted" his veto message by announcing that the gay rights icon will be inducted into the California Hall of Fame. Milk was a "unique" historical figure who led a civil rights movement and then was "assassinated in his public office for being who he was," Leno said. "In a perfect world, we'd have a state holiday for him, like [the Rev.] Martin Luther King Jr. or Cesar Chavez," Leno said in a telephone interview. But the California state finances are in such "disarray ... we think it's appropriate in light of our fiscal crisis" to have a special day of significance that won't cost the state anything, said Leno, whose district includes portions of San Francisco. That way, he said, Milk is still afforded "the respect that he's due." The day of significance would not close schools or state offices, according to its text. However, Randy Thomasson, the president of SaveCalifornia.com, said the bill was vague and could allow for a number of things at schools, including gay pride parades or "mock gay weddings." "There's no definition in the bill," he said. "There is absolutely no limit to what could occur on campuses and go into little children's brains." "Harvey Milk was a terrible role model for children," Thomasson said. His organization plans to oppose the bill through automatic phone calls, e-mails, media interviews and news conferences, he added. Leno said that claims that the bill would lead to schools holding gay-pride parades and similar activities were "hyperbole." The bill "mandates nothing," he said, although it certainly "affords an educational opportunity." President Obama also posthumously honored Milk with a Presidential Medal of Freedom this year, and Sean Penn portrayed him in this year's film "Milk," which garnered him an Oscar for best actor. CNN's Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A bill that aims to set aside a day of statewide significance for Milk, a gay rights activist and the first openly gay elected official in California, is heading to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's desk. The bill has caused quite a stir, with Schwarzenegger's office reportedly receiving over 100,000 calls in opposition to it on Tuesday. The opposition comes primarily from conservative groups who fear that the bill's vagueness could allow for gay pride parades at schools. The bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, has defended the legislation, stating that Milk was a "unique" figure who led a civil rights movement. Ammiano, who is openly gay, has been a long-time advocate for Milk and the LGBT community. He sees the bill as an opportunity to honor Milk's legacy and promote awareness of the issues he fought for. Milk was a visionary leader who campaigned tirelessly for gay rights, working to combat discrimination and promote equality in California and across the United States. He was a vocal advocate for minority communities, and his work helped to pave the way for future activists who would continue the fight for civil rights. The bill's opponents, however, argue that Milk's legacy is not relevant to the wider population, and that the bill is a thinly-veiled attempt to promote the gay agenda. They fear that if the bill passes, it will lead to further erosion of traditional values and promote an agenda that many Californians find distasteful. Despite the opposition, the bill has gained significant support from those who see Milk's contributions to California's history and the civil rights movement as significant. The bill seeks to recognize Milk's contributions to society and promote awareness of the challenges faced by the LGBT community. Milk was a true pioneer, and his legacy continues to inspire change and progress. The bill to set aside a day of statewide significance for Milk serves to promote awareness of his contributions to society and inspire others to continue the fight for equality and civil rights. As the bill heads to the Governor's desk, the debate over Milk's legacy and the role of the LGBT community in California's history will continue. Regardless of the outcome, however, it is clear that Milk's impact on society will not soon be forgotten, and that his courageous efforts to promote civil rights and equality will continue to inspire future generations to come.
