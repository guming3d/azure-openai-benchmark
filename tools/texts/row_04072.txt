chatgpt: A man who was tasered by police has reportedly lodged a letter of claim against the Lancashire Constabulary, stating that he suffered physical and psychological injuries. Colin Farmer was left lying on the ground in November 2012, after he was mistaken for a man with a samurai sword. The 65-year-old collapsed to the floor in shock, believing he was dying. The incident occurred when police were searching for a man with a sword, after several reports were made to the police. Farmer, who is registered blind, was walking to meet friends when he was tasered. Farmer was carrying only a white stick at the time, which he uses as an aid for his sight loss. He suffered cuts to his face as well as soreness to his chest, and later stated that he was too frightened to go out in the evenings again. Following this incident, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched an investigation into the incident. The IPCC found that the actions of the police had been “excessive and disproportionate”. However, the constabulary refused to apologise or admit liability for the incident. Farmer has now lodged a letter of claim against them, which means that he is seeking compensation for the injuries and trauma he suffered. In his letter of claim, Farmer states that he has suffered “physical injuries, including cuts to the face and soreness to the chest, and psychological injuries, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression”. The letter also claims that the incident has had a long-lasting impact on his life, “preventing him from going out in the evenings, and causing him anxiety and depression that persist to this day”. It is understood that Farmer is seeking a settlement of around £50,000, which would cover his medical treatment and compensate him for the distress and trauma he has suffered. The constabulary has yet to respond to the letter of claim but, if it admits liability, it is likely that a settlement will be reached outside of court. This incident highlights the potential risks of using tasers without proper training or under circumstances where their use is unwarranted. As the IPCC found, the actions of the police in this case were "excessive and disproportionate," and Farmer's case reinforces the need for continued training and evaluation of police use of force. It remains to be seen whether the constabulary will issue an apology or admit liability, but in any case, Colin Farmer's experience serves as a stark reminder of the importance of ensuring the proper and appropriate use of police force.
