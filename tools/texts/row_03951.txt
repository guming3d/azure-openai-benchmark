chatgpt: Lake Charles, Louisiana - Authorities arrested Princess Marks, 25, on charges of child desertion after she was caught in a vehicle with her two young children aged 5 and 7. The children were found in the SUV with the windows left down. After the arrest, Marks was later released on a $5,000 bond. The incident occurred just days after a couple was arrested for leaving their children in a 104 degree car in the same city. The cases shine a light on the dangers of leaving children alone in vehicles, especially during the hot summer months. Details surrounding the arrest of Marks remain unclear, but authorities have confirmed that she was taken into custody in Lake Charles. Her children were found in the SUV with the windows down, which could have potentially put them at risk of heat exhaustion or other related medical issues. Marks has been charged with child desertion, a charge that is taken very seriously in the state of Louisiana. If convicted, the charge carries a potential sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. Child desertion is a growing problem in many areas of the country, and authorities are working to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving children alone in vehicles. In addition to the risk of heat exhaustion, children are also at risk of being abducted or attacked by potential predators. The arrest of Marks follows a string of similar cases in Louisiana and other states, including several incidents in which children were left in cars for hours while their parents or guardians went about their daily routines. These incidents have led to calls for stiffer penalties for those who leave children in vehicles. In addition to criminal charges, parents who leave their children in cars can also face CPS investigations and potential loss of custody. This can have long-term consequences for both the children involved and their parents. Authorities are reminding parents to never leave their children alone in vehicles, even for a few minutes. They advise parents to always take their children with them when exiting the car and to never leave them in a vehicle unattended. As the summer months approach, authorities are urging parents to take extra precautions to ensure their children's safety while traveling in vehicles. They advise parents to always have water and snacks on hand, as well as to take frequent breaks to allow children to stretch and cool off. The cases involving Marks and the couple who left their children in a hot car serve as stark reminders of the danger of leaving children alone in vehicles. Parents and guardians are urged to take these incidents seriously and to always prioritize the safety and well-being of their children above all else.
