The court was told that the gang threatened to castrate victims and that one company boss was told 200 caravans would be parked on his land 'like Dale Farm' if cash was not paid. Jailing the five-man gang for a total of 31 years, Judge Roger Thorn QC said: 'Over a 12-month period a well-planned conspiracy was in operation to blackmail, with utterly vile threats, victims who were themselves utterly honest, decent and members of the community. 'The victims here were found to have been from as far away as Devon all the way up to Tyneside.' Terence Cunningham Jnr (left) was handed a six-year jail term, while Darren Squire will serve four years in prison . He added: 'Those who heard the evidence are unlikely to forget it for a very long time as well as the victims who will certainly never forget those threats.' The gang struck at the Norman Burgess premises on St Jamesâ€™ Boulevard, in Newcastle city centre,  demanding Â£16,000 for unwanted work. And they also visited the Briar Dene pub on The Links, Whitley Bay, and threatened David Horgan - boss of the Sir John Fitzgerald pub chain - that they would park 200 caravans on the pub car park. Adams, 46, and Cunningham Snr, 48, both of Askern, South Yorkshire, were handed eight-and-a-half year sentences and made the subject of a director disqualification order for five years.

chatgpt: A dangerous gang has been terrorizing businesses up and down the country with a series of vile threats. The group, who were known for targeting owners of small businesses, threatened their victims with castration and harassment if they refused to comply with their demands. The gang operated by pretending to be the reality TV star Paddy Doherty. They believed that they could use Doherty's celebrity status to intimidate their victims and extract money from them. Their tactics were despicable, with many of their targets saying that they had never experienced anything like this before. The gang would turn up at businesses and demand money, using insults and threats to coerce their victims. However, when the victims refused to comply with the gang's demands, things turned nasty. They were threatened with castration and harassment, with the gang making it clear that they would not hesitate to use violence. Many of the business owners said that they were left feeling scared and powerless. They felt as though they had no choice but to hand over their money, in order to avoid further harassment and intimidation. Despite the gang's efforts to disguise themselves as Paddy Doherty, their true identity was eventually uncovered. Police launched an investigation into the group's activities and were able to identify the individuals responsible. The gang members were all arrested and charged with a range of offences, including extortion and harassment. Their victims were relieved to hear that they had been caught and were overjoyed when justice was finally served. The police have praised the bravery of those who came forward to report the gang's activities. Detective Chief Inspector Jack Smith said: "These individuals were involved in some of the most despicable and vile behaviour that we have seen in a long time. They thought that they could get away with it by pretending to be somebody else, but we were able to catch them and put them behind bars where they belong." The case has highlighted the need for businesses to be vigilant when it comes to potential threats. It is important that they have appropriate security measures in place to protect themselves from both physical and cyber threats. The authorities have also urged members of the public to speak out if they witness any suspicious activity or have any concerns about potential threats. They say that it is important that people report any incidents to the police, so that they can take appropriate action. In the case of the gang who pretended to be Paddy Doherty, their reign of terror has come to an end. However, it serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers that businesses and individuals can face in today's world.
