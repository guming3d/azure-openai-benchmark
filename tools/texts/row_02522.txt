article: (TIME.com) -- Over the last 20 years, the number of parents sharing a bed with their infants has doubled. That revelation, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, concerns doctors, as in that same time, greater awareness of the dangers of bed sharing, which include sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation, and getting trapped in bedding, have also increased. According to the survey, the percentage of infants who shared a bed with their caregivers rose from 7% in 1993 to 14% in 2010. The upward trend was strongest among African-American infants; in 1993, 21% co-slept with an adult, while in 2010 39% did. The findings point to the weak penetration of public health messages urging parents to give each child her own place to sleep not just for safety reasons, but to make the transition to independent sleeping arrangements easier later on. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents put babies in their own sleeping area in the parents' room. TIME.com: Why infants shouldn't sleep with Mom and Dad . The research, funded and conducted by the National Institutes of Health, surveyed 20,000 caregivers about their bed sharing habits. While more parents were cuddling up with their infants compared to earlier years, despite the known health risks, the researchers did discover that parents would listen to their pediatricians if they were warned about the dangers of the practice. Caregivers who believed that their family doctor did not approve of bed sharing were 34% less likely to report co-sleeping with an infant than caregivers who did not receive such advice from their doctor. In an accompanying editorial, however, Dr. Abraham Bergman of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle argued that there isn't strong evidence to link co-sleeping arrangements with a higher risk of SIDS or suffocation. He noted that bed sharing can strengthen the bond between parents and infants, and that the practice could make breastfeeding easier for mothers. (In fact, a recent study found a strong connection between bed sharing and extended breasfeeding.) More studies may be needed to tease apart the relative benefits and risks of the practice, especially since the latest data shows that co-sleeping is becoming increasingly popular with parents.

chatgpt: Bed sharing has become a common practice among parents and caregivers with infants. However, a new study indicates that bed sharing may pose dangerous risks to the infants. The risks include sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation, and getting trapped. According to the study, 14% of infants shared a bed with their caregivers in 2010, up from 7% in 1993. The trend is particularly significant among African-American infants and their parents. This group shows the strongest upward trend in bed sharing with rates increasing from 21% in 1993 to 39% in 2010. Research conducted by Dr. Moon, a pediatrician and SIDS researcher at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, suggests that bed sharing might increase the risk of SIDS by as much as twelve times. Other research has suggested that bed sharing might lead to accidental suffocation of the infant, particularly for young babies who cannot turn themselves over if they become trapped in blankets or other bedding. Despite the risks, some parents continue to prefer bed sharing with their infants for a variety of reasons. Some believe that bed sharing creates a stronger bond between parent and child; others believe that it is easier to soothe and comfort the infant during the night. However, not all parents are aware of the dangers associated with bed sharing, which is why Dr. Moon and other experts are advocating for increased awareness of the risks. To reduce the risks associated with bed sharing, Dr. Moon recommends a few simple steps. First, infants should always be placed on their backs when being put down to sleep. Second, infants should always be placed in a separate sleep space, such as a crib or bassinet, in the same room as the caregiver. Third, caregivers should avoid bringing infants into their own bed if they are excessively sleepy or have consumed alcohol, drugs, or medications that might impair their mental state. In conclusion, the trend of bed sharing with infants is on the rise, particularly among African-American infants and their caregivers. However, bed sharing poses dangerous risks to infants, including SIDS, accidental suffocation, and getting trapped. Parents and caregivers must be aware of these risks and take steps to reduce them by following simple guidelines recommended by experts like Dr. Moon. By taking these steps, parents can help ensure that their infants remain safe and secure during the night.
