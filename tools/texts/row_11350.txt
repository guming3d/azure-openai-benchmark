article: At least a quarter of Newcastle’s 4,200 travelling fans were not in their seats for kick-off. They were still queuing to get into the away end at White Hart Lane, with several posting pictures on Twitter and bemoaning the stewarding which they claim caused the delay. It wasn’t until 20 minutes in — by which point their team were already trailing to Nabil Bentaleb’s opener — that they all made it to their seats inside the stadium. Spurs have scored in each of their last 26 home games in the League Cup. It was January 1999 in a goalless semi-final draw with Wimbledon when they last drew a blank. Their team included three future or former Newcastle players — Stephen Carr, Sol Campbell and David Ginola. They won the second leg 1-0 before beating Leicester in the final. Nacer Chadli celebrates after his 46th minute strike against Newcastle at White Hart Lane . A year after his exit and Andre Villas-Boas piped up to claim Tottenham broke promises, but Spurs retaliated by accusing him of ‘attempting to rewrite history’. AVB bemoaned the departures of Luka Modric (Spurs insist he knew about it all along) and Rafael van der Vaart (a sale he initiated). He also cited the failure to sign Willian, Joao Moutinho or Oscar. ‘He has clearly forgotten the facts,’ said a Tottenham spokesman. Spurs have accused former manager Andre Villas-Boas up 'attempting to rewrite history’ Alan Pardew named the strongest XI available to him, but that still meant four players on the bench who had yet to make a senior appearance. Goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, 17, defenders Remie Streete, 20, and Lubomir Satka, 19, and forward Callum Roberts, 17, are all graduates of the club’s academy and tipped for a big future. Roberts has been likened to Lionel Messi for the dribbles which have lit up Under 21 matches of late. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew added a sprinkling of youth to his bench for the Spurs clash .

chatgpt: Newcastle United travelled to Tottenham Hotspur's stadium for their League Cup quarterfinal clash, facing a tough challenge with Spurs currently boasting a 26-game scoring streak at home in this competition. However, the Magpies' supporters seemed to have other priorities as a significant number of them arrived later than expected, with at least a quarter of the 4,200 travelling fans not in their seats for the start of the game. It wasn't until twenty minutes into the game that all of the Toon supporters had taken their seats inside the stadium, with many suggesting that the delay was caused by transport issues in the capital. Ultimately though, the late arrival of the Newcastle fans didn't prove to be a deciding factor in the outcome of the match, as Spurs took control early on. In the 18th minute, Nabil Bentaleb fired Tottenham into the lead and put the home crowd in fine spirits. The goal seemed to be the spark that Tottenham needed to take a stranglehold on the game, and it wasn't long before they doubled their advantage. Just after half time, Nacer Chadli pounced on a loose ball and smashed it into the back of the net, sending the Spurs faithful into raptures. Chadli's goal seemed to break the spirits of the Newcastle players who struggled to create any real chances throughout the game. Despite this setback, Newcastle kept pushing, aiming to mount a comeback. However, Spurs held firm and managed to keep a clean sheet, securing their place in the League Cup semifinals. Newcastle's dreams of a cup run were ended for another year, leaving manager Steve Bruce to reflect on what might have been. For Spurs, they will now look to build on their impressive home record in the League Cup as they prepare to face either Stoke City or Brentford in the semifinals. The two teams play each other on Wednesday in the last quarterfinal of the competition, with Tottenham surely fancying their chances against either side. Overall, while the late arrival of some travelling fans may have been an issue, it ultimately had little impact on the result of the game. Tottenham were simply too good for Newcastle on the night, and deserving of their place in the next round of the competition.
