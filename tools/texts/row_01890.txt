article: (CNN) -- Real Madrid recovered from going a goal behind to beat rivals Atletico Madrid 3-2 on Sunday to return to the top of the Spanish Primera Liga ahead of Barcelona. But they did not have things their own way at the Bernabeu and went into the interval trailing after a flowing Atletico move saw the ball reach former Real striker Jose Antonio Reyes, who curled home a delightful shot to give the visitors the lead. But Real were a different side after the break and levelled in the 49th minute when Xabi Alonso netted from close range. And six minutes later, the home side were ahead when defender Alvaro Arbeloa -- who like Alonso moved to Madrid from Liverpool last pre-season -- superbly cut inside his marker before stroking the ball home. Madrid made it 3-1 in the 62nd minute when top scorer Gonzalo Higuain took advantage of a defensive mix-up to fire home. However, the scoring was still not over and Alonso turned from hero to villain when handling the ball in the area, with Diego Forlan slotting home the resulting penalty. Forlan missed a golden chance to level in the final minute when firing into the side-netting, but Real Madrid held on to move ahead of Barcelona, who scraped a narrow 1-0 victory at Mallorca on Saturday, on goal difference. The victory was Real's 11th in succession and continued their recent domination over their city rivals, with Atletico not winning a derby match since 1999. In other matches, Sevilla's recent poor run of form continued with a 3-0 defeat at Villarreal, for whom veteran Frenchman Robert Pires came off the substitutes' bench to score a superb third goal. Struggling Xerez thumped Valladolid 3-0 in a battle of the bottom two clubs, while Deportivo La Coruna's Champions League hopes took a knock after they slumped 3-1 at home to Getafe.

chatgpt: Real Madrid overcame early adversity to clinch a crucial 3-2 victory in a high-octane derby against cross-town rivals Atletico Madrid on Sunday. A well-taken early goal from Fernando Torres saw the visitors take an early lead, but a resilient Real Madrid side bounced back in style, extending their unbeaten run in the Primera Liga to 11 matches with the win. The first half saw both sides play a high-intensity game with plenty of end-to-end action. It was Atletico Madrid who drew first blood, as Fernando Torres scored in the 10th minute after a well-placed through ball from Koke. However, Real Madrid refused to lie down and quickly responded with an equalizer just minutes later courtesy of a thunderous strike from Toni Kroos. The remainder of the first half saw both teams trading blows, but it was Real Madrid who edged ahead in the 42nd minute thanks to a neat finish from young forward Alvaro Morata. Atletico Madrid tried to push forward in search of an equalizer, but their efforts were in vain as Real Madrid held firm to go into the halftime break with a 2-1 lead. The second half saw Atletico Madrid come out with renewed energy, pushing forward in search of the all-important equalizer. However, it was Real Madrid who once again showed their class, extending their lead in the 67th minute with a goal from Isco. Although Atletico Madrid responded in the 85th minute through a goal from Antoine Griezmann, it proved too little too late as Real held on for a hard-fought victory. With this latest win, Real Madrid's winning run in the Primera Liga extends to 11 matches, further cementing their place as genuine title contenders this season. The win also sees Real Madrid return to the top of the Spanish table, albeit on goal difference. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane was visibly pleased with his team's performance, stating in a post-match interview, "It was a tough game against a very good team, but my players showed great character and determination to come from behind and win. We have to continue in this vein and make sure we maintain our winning run for as long as possible." Real Madrid will now look to build on this hard-fought victory when they host Cultural Leonesa in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday, while Atletico Madrid will aim to get back to winning ways when they face Eibar in the Primera Liga on Saturday.
