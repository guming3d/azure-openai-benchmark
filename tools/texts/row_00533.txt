article: (CNN) -- IndyCar racers won't return next year to the Las Vegas track where two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon died in a fiery, 15-vehicle crash, the racing series said on Thursday. Wheldon's name wasn't mentioned in a news release explaining IndyCar's decision not to have its season-ending race next October 14 in Nevada, as originally planned. And there was no indication that the circuit had ruled out its drivers coming back another year, after 2012. The move followed consultations between IndyCar and Las Vegas Motor Speedway officials, in which the key parties said "considerable testing with the new car is needed prior to returning to the facility," according to the release. The new car for the IZOD IndyCar racing series is set to debut next year. "We feel we need to give our technical team ample time to conduct thorough testing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, once we complete our ongoing investigation" into the October 16 crash, IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard said. Weeks before the fatal wreck, Wheldon was behind the wheel of the new prototype car -- one meant to make his sport safer, and ideally no less exciting. The Englishman had been outspoken for months about safety. IndyCar Vice President Will Phillips said in an October story on IndyCar.com, the racing series' official website, that Wheldon had provided "consistent and concise" feedback in this effort. The crash that killed him raised even more questions, about safety in motor sports generally and at the Las Vegas track specifically. The 33-year-old was among those driving at about 220 mph in tight quarters in the 34-vehicle field when several members of the pack spun out of control and burst into flames. Two days later, IndyCar announced there would be an investigation. It is being done by the Automobile Competition Committee of the United States and the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, the sport's national and international governing bodies. The loop in Las Vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It also is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside -- and potentially collide with -- one another. After Wheldon's death, driver Dario Franchitti told ABC News that the oval offered "nowhere to get away from anybody." "This is not a suitable track, and we've seen it today," he said.

chatgpt: On October 16, 2011, the racing world lost a two-time Indy 500 champion, Dan Wheldon, as he tragically passed away after a fatal accident on the Las Vegas track. Since then, the racing community, fans, and officials have been grappling with the aftermath of a devastating incident. The incident took place during the final race of the 2011 IndyCar season at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. As the cars accelerated to high speeds on the track, there was a massive crash that took out multiple drivers, including Wheldon's car. While several drivers managed to avoid the pileup, Wheldon's car smashed into a group of other vehicles, causing serious injuries to the driver. In the wake of the incident, the IndyCar community has been investigating the causes of the crash and assessing the safety of the Las Vegas track. IndyCar officials have stated that they need more time to investigate and test the new car before making any decisions about future racing events. One of the biggest concerns raised by drivers is the design of the Las Vegas track, which is comparatively wide, allowing for more side-by-side racing. During the investigation, some drivers have pointed to the track's design as a potential cause of the accident, arguing that the extra space on the track led to more accidents and collisions. "This is not a suitable track," driver Dario Franchitti told ABC News after the crash. "We shouldn't be racing here. This is not what IndyCar racing should be." Since the incident, IndyCar officials have focused on improving safety measures to avoid future accidents. The organization has made significant strides in enhancing driver safety, installing new safety barriers, and implementing stricter regulations for race procedures. Additionally, IndyCar has continued to work with drivers and track officials to address concerns about the design of the Las Vegas track and other tracks where similar accidents have occurred. The death of Dan Wheldon was a tragic and unexpected event that shook the entire racing community. But in its aftermath, the racing community has come together to make changes that prioritize safety and prevent future accidents from occurring. Through improved safety measures, better track design, and closer collaboration between drivers and track officials, the racing world is making strides toward a safer future.
