article: Six Australian tourists have been injured after the railing they were leaning on at a temple in Cambodia suddenly collapsed, sending them tumbling down an embankment. The Australians were part of a tour group who had been sightseeing on their final day of a seven-day Mekong River cruise when the the railing surrounding Han Chey pagoda outside Phnom Penh  gave way at 9.30am on Monday causing the six to fall about four metres below, reported The Cambodia Daily. Four of the unlucky tourists - Sandra McIntosh, 63, Heather Todd, 73, Steven Burgess, 65, and Patricia Jachimowicz, 68, - were treated at the Kompong Cham Provincial Hospital for minor injuries. The remaining two injured Australians - Christine Menzel, 63, and Ian McIntosh, 66 - were rushed to Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh.

'All six of them were leaning on the banister on the stairs up to the temple, which is obviously decayed because the rock is so old,' Ms Channyda said. Ms Menzel suffered serious back injuries and a possible broken rib, while Mr McIntosh underwent surgery for a dislocated elbow. Ms McIntosh, from NSW, who received four stitches to her head, said the accident had not ruined what had been an enjoyable holiday with plans to travel on to Siem Reap for six days once her 'tough-as-nails' husband was released from hospital. '[The railing] all of a sudden gave away and all these people just fell into the jungle,' she told The Cambodia Daily. 'Everyone has been wonderful helping us—the staff at the original hospital, at this hospital [Calmette], and all the travel-company people who carried everyone out.' Meanwhile the Menzel's had no intention to include temples in their future holidays. Ms Menzel's husband Phil, who was not injured in the accident, said the couple would return home to Adelaide in South Australia, as soon as possible for his wife to receive further treatment. 'We'll never go to another temple again,' he said.

chatgpt: Six Australian tourists were injured after a temple railing collapsed in Cambodia on Tuesday. Two of the tourists were rushed to Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh, while the other four were treated for minor injuries at Kompong Cham Provincial Hospital. The accident occurred at a temple in the city of Kompong Cham, located in eastern Cambodia. The six tourists were reportedly standing at the railing when it suddenly gave way, sending them tumbling to the ground below. One of the tourists, a woman, suffered serious back injuries and a possible broken rib. She was immediately taken to Calmette Hospital for treatment. Another tourist, a man, underwent surgery for a dislocated elbow. The remaining four tourists were treated for minor injuries and released from the hospital later that day. Local authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the accident. While the exact reason for the railing's collapse has not been determined, officials are checking for any signs of structural damage or wear and tear. Cambodia's temples are a popular tourist attraction and draw visitors from all over the world. However, the country has faced criticism in recent years for failing to maintain its ancient structures. In 2018, the Apsara Authority, the government agency responsible for preserving the temples of Angkor, announced that it had identified over 500 temples at risk of collapse due to neglect and weather damage. Following the incident, tourism officials in Cambodia are urging visitors to be cautious when visiting the country's temples and to pay attention to any potential safety hazards. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also issued a travel advisory for Cambodia, warning tourists to exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of accidents and petty crime. The Australian embassy in Cambodia is reportedly providing consular assistance to the injured tourists and their families.
