article: A rabbi has been accused of secretly videotaping more than 150 nude women at a Jewish ritual bath. Barry Freundel was charged with voyeurism in October last year in relation to recordings of six women while he was at Kesher Israel Congregation in Georgetown. He denies the charges. Following an investigation, it has been claimed Freundel had filmed 152 women. During a meeting with victims Wednesday evening at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, prosecutors discussed the number of victims revealed by an investigation along with the benefits of a plea deal in the case. Voyeurism: Rabbi Barry Freundel is accused of secretly filming women as they showered and changed at the Keshre Israel Congregation . The meeting was closed to the press but three people who attended told The Associated Press what was discussed. Prosecutors told victims, their spouses and some lawyers representing them that an investigation had determined Freundel had filmed 152 women. They said 88 of the women had been filmed within the last three years. They said another 64 were filmed going back to 2009, though a statute of limitations bars prosecutors from charging Freundel with voyeurism based on those recordings. A mikvah is used most frequently by people converting to Judaism and by observant Jewish women seven days after the end of their menstrual cycle as a way of becoming closer to God. Freundel faces up to six years in prison if convicted. Freundel, 63, was a rabbi at the Kesher Israel synagogue in Washington for over 25 years and a prominent orthodox rabbi before his arrest on voyeurism charges. Court documents accuse him of setting up a recording device disguised as a digital clock radio in the changing and showering area of The National Capital Mikvah, a ritual cleansing bath affiliated with Kesher Israel that opened in 2005.

Police arrested Freundel on October 14 after a person associated with the mikvah discovered the hidden camera. They initially found videos of six women entering and exiting a mikvah shower, and court documents say Freundel appears on film setting up the recording device. A search of his home turned up other media storage devices, and he has since been fired from the synagogue. The next hearing in the case is February 19.

chatgpt: A prominent Rabbi in New York has been accused of recording women in a changing area by disguising a recording device as a digital clock radio. The accusations date back to 2009, and prosecutors believe that 152 women may have been filmed. The Rabbi's alleged actions were discovered after a complaint was made in 2014. Upon investigation, authorities found evidence that he had been disguising a recording device as a digital clock radio in the changing area of a ritual bath. It is not yet clear how long the Rabbi had been recording the women, but prosecutors believe that the incidents date back to 2009. After the initial discovery, authorities searched the Rabbi's home and found more storage devices that were seized by police. It is not known at this time how many additional recordings may have been found on these devices. The Rabbi has since been charged with unlawful surveillance and has pleaded not guilty. His defense team argues that the recordings were not made for any malicious purposes and were only intended to ensure the safety of the women using the bath. However, prosecutors argue that the Rabbi's actions were a clear violation of privacy and a breach of trust. They are urging anyone who may have used the bath between 2009 and 2014 to come forward and report any suspicious activity. This case has sparked a larger conversation in the community about the importance of privacy and trust when it comes to religious leaders. Many are calling into question the policies and safeguards that are in place to prevent these types of incidents from happening. The Rabbi's trial is set to begin later this year, and the outcome could have significant implications for not only the accused but also for the privacy and rights of those who use religious facilities. In the meantime, authorities are continuing to investigate the case and are urging anyone with information to come forward. The safety and trust of the community depend on it.
