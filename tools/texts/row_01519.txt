chatgpt: Manchester City have completed the signing of midfielder Danilo Pereira from Porto. The Premier League champions have reportedly been tracking the 26-year-old for over a year and were keen to add him to their squad in time for the upcoming season. Danilo, who has been with Porto since 2007, has established himself as one of the most talented midfielders in Portugal. His impressive performances led to interest from several European clubs, but it was Manchester City who ultimately secured his signature. The Portuguese international will be a valuable addition to Pep Guardiola's side, offering defensive support to the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan. Danilo's physicality and ball-winning abilities will also help City to maintain their high-pressing style and control the midfield area. Speaking about his move to the Etihad Stadium, Danilo said: "I am delighted to be joining Manchester City, one of the best teams in the world. This is a new challenge for me and I am excited to test myself in the Premier League. I can't wait to get started." City have been busy in the transfer market this summer, already securing the signings of Nathan Ake and Ferran Torres. Danilo's arrival adds further depth to an already formidable squad, as Guardiola looks to mount a serious challenge for the Champions League next season. The transfer fee for Danilo has not been disclosed, though reports suggest it is in the region of £45 million. The midfielder will wear the number 16 shirt for City, taking over from Rodrigo who departed for Atletico Madrid earlier this summer. As the Premier League season gets underway, all eyes will be on Danilo to see how he adapts to life in England. With the support of his new teammates and the guidance of Guardiola, the Portuguese midfielder will be hoping to make an immediate impact and contribute to another successful season for Manchester City.
