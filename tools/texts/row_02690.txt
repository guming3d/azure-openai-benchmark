article: By . Adam Shergold . Follow @@adamjshergold . Every team has one and it's not usually the player you would expect. They're the talismen, the good luck charms whose mere presence on the pitch always seems to inspire the team to victory. A look at the best player win percentages from the Barclays Premier League season just passed throws up some unexpected names. Lucky charms: The players with the best win percentage for each Premier League club during the 2013-2014 season (minimum of 10 matches). Source: Opta . Talisman: Manchester City won 80 per cent of matches in which Joleon Lescott took his place in their defence . Heading for victory: Liverpool won 85 per cent of the games in which Daniel Agger (centre) featured . At champions Manchester City, Joleon Lescott's presence in the heart of the defence came with an 80 per cent win ratio. He may have only played the minimum threshold of 10 matches in this Opta statistical analysis, but City won eight of them. Less reassuringly, Lescott was involved in two of City's six Premier League defeats - at Cardiff and Sunderland. At Liverpool, Daniel Agger was the lucky charm with the side collecting all three points in 17 of the 20 matches in which he featured - a resounding win percentage of 85 per cent. Nacho Monreal had a similar effect on Arsenal, helping them to 19 victories in the 23 matches in which he featured (82.6 per cent). Spot on: Arsenal won 19 of 23 matches in which Nacho Monreal played a part this season . Sign him up! Chelsea always seem to get all three points when Ashley Cole is at left-back . And if Chelsea need any further persuasion to sign stalwart Ashley Cole up for another 12 months, look at his impressive record of 12 wins resulting from the 17 Premier League games he figured in this season. Manchester United endured a torrid campaign by their standards but they at least tasted success on the rare occasions Darren Fletcher made the starting XI - the Scot boasted a two-thirds win percentage, as did Everton's John Stones. By contrast, some teams experienced that winning feeling so rarely in the nine months just passed that even their talismen have laughable win percentages. Winning habit: Darren Fletcher always seemed to inspire Man United to victory during an otherwise dire campaign . Star in the making: Everton's John Stones is not only very talented, he's fairly lucky for the team too . Fabio was Cardiff's most successful man but his 23.1 per cent win ratio looks pretty paltry when set against some of the others. Stephane Sessegnon and West Bromwich wasn't a lot better - his win percentage was a meagre 26.9 per cent.
highlights: Analysis of the win percentages per player in this season's Premier League . Monreal won 19 of the 23 matches he was involved in for Arsenal . Agger had an 85 per cent win ratio for Liverpool . Lescott was lucky charm for champions Man City with eight wins from 10 .
