article: By . Mark Duell . A top-secret £133million United States Air Force unmanned drone has flown in British airspace for the first time, it was revealed today. The Ministry of Defence said the Global Hawk aircraft flew at 50,000ft across several European countries, including the UK, after leaving an air base in the Mediterranean. It was part of the Nato trial Unified Vision, which aims to assist with the group’s Alliance Ground Surveillance system - expected to become operational with five of the remotely-piloted aircraft. Up in the air: The Ministry of Defence revealed today that the Global Hawk aircraft (file picture) flew at 50,000ft across several European countries, including the UK, after leaving an air base in the Mediterranean . Drone: The flights took place in 'controlled and segregated airspace at heights of approximately 50,000ft' On the ground: Royal Air Force controllers working at the London Area air traffic control centre Swanwick, Hampshire (file picture) Nato said the AGS will give commanders a 'comprehensive picture of the situation on the ground'. The flights took place in ‘controlled and segregated airspace at heights of approximately 50,000ft, well above the cruising altitude of commercial airliners’, according to an MoD press release. It added that the flights ‘made a useful contribution to understanding how remotely-piloted air systems (RPAS) can be safely integrated within the existing aviation framework’. Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn said: 'It is good to see existing airspace procedures enabling the seamless integration of remotely-piloted air systems, such as the unarmed Global Hawk aircraft, within European airspace. ‘This trial will have helped with the development of the Nato Alliance Ground Surveillance system and the future airspace integration of RPAS.' Unmanned: The Mail reported four years ago how the drone used to locate Al Qaeda and Taliban hideouts in Pakistan and Afghanistan could one day be patrolling over British cities to search for hidden terror cells .

Summit in September - where world leaders will gather in Newport, South Wales, to discuss . issues such as terrorism, piracy, unstable states and cyber-attacks. The Mail reported in April 2010 how the drone used to locate Al Qaeda and Taliban hideouts in Pakistan and Afghanistan could one day be patrolling over British cities to search for hidden terror cells. The controversial move would allow MI5 and GCHQ, the Government's eavesdropping centre, to step up surveillance operations over the UK. The announcement today comes two weeks after the Pentagon said the US was using at least one Global Hawk to aid in the search for the Nigerian girls kidnapped by Islamist militants Boko Haram. They became the first drones to be certified by the American Federal Aviation Authority for use in civilian air corridors with no advance notice. The Global Hawk has a top speed of 357mph and its overall cost per flying hour is about £14,360.

chatgpt: In a stunning display of aerial might, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) codenamed "Global Hawk" flew across Europe at a mind-boggling speed of 357 miles per hour. This UAV is part of a NATO trial to assist with its Alliance Ground Surveillance system, and it is expected to become operational along with five other UAVs in the coming months. The Global Hawk has undergone extensive testing in recent years, and its capabilities have impressed military officials around the world. This UAV has been used to locate Al Qaeda and Taliban hideouts abroad, and it has proven to be an indispensable tool for military intelligence operations. On its recent flight across Europe, the Global Hawk traversed several countries, including Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. This flight was no easy feat, and it required careful planning and execution by the team of military personnel responsible for the UAV's operation. The Global Hawk's speed and maneuverability make it an ideal tool for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Its advanced sensors can detect activity on the ground from high altitudes, and its ability to operate for long periods of time without needing to refuel makes it an ideal tool for monitoring enemy activity. NATO officials are excited about the prospects of the Alliance Ground Surveillance system, and they believe that this new technology will give them an edge over their adversaries. The system will allow military commanders to monitor large areas of land from a single location, and it will provide them with real-time information about enemy movements and activities. The Global Hawk's incredible speed and precision will be a valuable asset to NATO forces, and it will help them achieve their goals with greater efficiency and accuracy. The UAV's advanced sensors and cameras allow it to capture high-resolution images and video, which can be analyzed by military analysts to gain a better understanding of enemy activity. As NATO continues to modernize its military capabilities, the Alliance Ground Surveillance system and the Global Hawk UAV will play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and security of NATO member states. These technologies represent a significant advancement in military intelligence, and they will give NATO forces an unprecedented level of situational awareness on the battlefield. In conclusion, the Global Hawk's recent flight across Europe is a testament to its capabilities and potential as a critical tool for modern military operations. With its advanced sensors, high-speed capabilities, and long-range endurance, the Global Hawk represents the future of military UAV technology. As NATO continues to develop and deploy this technology, it will undoubtedly reshape the way we approach military intelligence and surveillance operations.
