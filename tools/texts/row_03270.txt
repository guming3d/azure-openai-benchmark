O’Shea, from Bedminster Down, Bristol, was driving through the Bristol . suburb of Hartcliffe last summer when she wound down her car window and . flicked out the butt. Carol Donovan, a street scene officer for Bristol City Council, said: 'We wrote to her telling her that if she did not pay that we would take her to court. 'She ignored this, and failed to turn up when the case was heard, despite reminders, and then magistrates obviously took her behaviour very seriously.' O'Shea was ordered to pay a fine of £600, costs of £361.08, and a £60 victim surcharge. Jonquil Maudlin, council neighbourhood enforcement manager, said: 'People should be aware that cigarette ends are just as much litter as anything else, and they take a long time to biodegrade, as they are made not of paper, but of plastic filament. 'They are full of toxic chemicals and it has been found that many have been found in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals who mistake them for food.' Andy Walker, from the Keep Britain Tidy Campaign, said: 'People tend to think that littering is a victimless crime but the reality is it affects us all. 'According to research, littering costs the country around £1 billion every single year, and it is a major cost for councils such as Bristol City Council. 'Every time someone drops litter in the street, we are all having to pay to clean it up.  If this person had paid the fine and not ignored the court letters then she would not have got herself in such a mess.'

chatgpt: A young woman from Bedminster, Alexandra O'Shea, was given a hefty fine after throwing a cigarette out of her car while driving through Bristol. The incident initially resulted in a £75 on-the-spot fine, but O'Shea failed to pay it. Bristol City Council pursued the matter further and ultimately took O'Shea to court. During the court hearing, magistrates were evidently displeased by O'Shea's behavior, leading them to impose a substantially larger fine of £600. In addition to the penalty, O'Shea was ordered to pay £421.08 in costs and charges. The council released a statement regarding the case, stating that magistrates took O'Shea's behavior seriously. This case highlights the growing issue of littering in Bristol, particularly cigarette butt disposal. The city has launched a campaign to clamp down on littering, and it is apparent that they are not taking offenses lightly. Whilst the fine may seem steep, it sends a clear message that littering will not be tolerated in the city. According to Bristol City Council, cigarette butts are the most commonly dropped item of litter, with over four and a half trillion discarded globally each year. Not only are cigarettes harmful to the environment, but they also pose a safety risk. A study conducted by the AA found that there were 121 accidents caused by drivers throwing cigarettes out of their car window in a three-year period. Bristol City Council has urged drivers to take responsibility for their actions and dispose of cigarettes in a safe and environmentally friendly way. They even launched their own branded cigarette disposers, which are installed around the city and encourage smokers to dispose of their cigarette butts properly. It is vital that individuals take responsibility for their littering habits to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces. The penalties for littering may seem insignificant, but in reality, they can have a significant impact on the individual responsible, as seen in this case. As for O'Shea, it is likely that she regrets her actions which led to a substantial fine and several court appearances. The situation serves as a reminder that littering has serious consequences and should not be taken lightly.
