To adapt one of the most famous lines in British TV comedy: ‘Don’t mention that we won the war’. The Government is said to be against a series of celebratory events for commemorations from next year to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War - in order to avoid upsetting Germany. War author Sebastian Faulks said the tone of events must be ‘modest, inclusive and reverential of others’ - while a source on the planning team said ministers are keen ‘not to upset the Germans’.

Respected First World War historian Professor Sir Hew Strachan said the events should be a mixture of victory celebrations and commemorations of lost lives. He told The Sunday Times: ‘Germany has almost as great a sense of guilt about this war as it does about the Second World War. ‘Therefore we don’t put ourselves in the wrong in German eyes by opposing German imperialism, by opposing the Kaiser’s regime.’ Days gone by: Crowds celebration VE Day in 1995 in London, 50 years after the end of the Second World War . German leaders are scheduled to attend many ceremonies with the Allies – including memorial events to mark the declaration of war in August 2014 and the Battle of Gallipoli in 2015. The Battle of the Somme will be marked in July 2016 and Passchendaele in 2017, reported The Sunday Times. The events will end with the Armistice Day centenary in November 2018. Meanwhile the British Commission for Military History wants Andrew Murrison, who is handling the centenary events for Prime Minister David Cameron, to include the Battle of Amiens. A spokesman for the group of military historians said the junior defence minister should consider the August 1918 battle, which marked the end of the Western Front stalemate. The BBC has insisted that it will mark the occasion with ‘a wide range of programming’ and it ‘will not be politically correct coverage’. Mr Murrison would not comment on whether the Government is worried about upsetting the Germans.

chatgpt: Various events are planned to take place from next year onwards to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I. The planning committee, according to sources, are doing their best to ensure that the upcoming events do not upset the Germans, who were on the opposing side to the Allies in World War I. This is a delicate balance that they need to strike. According to novelist Sebastian Faulks, the tone of the events must be one that is modest and respectful to others. It is essential to pay homage to the fallen soldiers, instead of focusing too much on the triumph of the winning side. He emphasized that this is an occasion to show our appreciation for the sacrifice made by many, without glorifying war. It is important to remember that the war was a devastating experience for all involved. Millions of soldiers and civilians lost their lives, and whole communities were destroyed. Many suffered physical and emotional scars that lasted long after the conflict ended. Therefore, the events should be a commemoration of this deep loss and sacrifice. On the other hand, Sir Hew Strachan, who is a military historian, suggests that there should also be elements of celebration in the events. He feels that it's crucial to honor the achievements and sacrifices that were made. It is essential to remember not just the loss, but also the hard-won victories and the sacrifices made to achieve them. The events planned will start from next year and will go on for years. They will include memorial services, battlefield tours, exhibitions, and cultural performances. The UK government has pledged to spend £50 million on the commemorations, which will include the renovation and upkeep of war memorials, such as the Menin Gate and the Cenotaph. The events will be planned in such a way that they will be accessible to everyone, irrespective of their age, social status or background. The government is also working together with charities and other organizations to make sure that the commemorations will have a far-reaching impact. There will be efforts to focus on the personal stories of soldiers and civilians involved in the war. These stories will serve as a reminder of the humanity of the individuals involved in the conflict, and of the devastating impact that war can have on the lives of ordinary people. There will also be a recognition of the contribution made by soldiers from across the world, and not just from the Western side. The upcoming 100th anniversary of World War I will be an occasion for us to remember and commemorate the sacrifices made by many. The events planned will not only pay homage to the fallen soldiers and civilians but will also help to educate future generations about the significant role played by the conflict in shaping the world we live in today.
