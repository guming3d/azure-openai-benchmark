A thrifty gardener is still using the same tools his grandfather first used 130 years ago. Neville Hume inherited the utensils in 1979 from his late father Alfred who had been given them by his own father, and has been using them ever since. The former hairdresser from Sutton Coldfield, Warks, claims they are more reliable than tools in shops today. Mr Hume has been using his grandfather's tools since 1979 and claims they are more reliable than those in shops today . Despite being over 130 years old, the Victorian weeding hoe and digging fork are in surprisingly good condition. The handles of both tools are made from elm wood, with their steel ends remaining in almost pristine condition. The four prongs on the fork have been worn down slightly and are now only four inches long, about half their original length. But Mr Hume insists he wouldn't be caught in his garden without them. He said: 'My grandfather was a professional gardener for a wealthy landowner and his boss bought the tools for him. 'I guess they built things to last in those days. 'My father was given them and he worked as a chauffeur and gardener and so used them professionally as well. 'When he retired he even took them to his retirement home and used them right up until he died in 1979 . 'I have had them since then and use them all the time in my garden and allotment. They are perfect for tidying up a flower border. 'I always keep them clean and wipe them off after I use them. 'I've had lots of other forks over the years but the tines of those end up bending out of shape and they don't last.' Mr Hume who lives with his wife, Amanda, does not have any sons of his own to pass the tools on to. 'If and when it gets to the point where I can't manage the garden anymore I will probably donate them to a museum,' he said.

chatgpt: Neville Hume, a 73-year-old gardener from rural England, has been using a set of garden tools that were passed down to him from his grandfather who was himself a Victorian gardener. The tools, which are now over 130 years old, have been Mr Hume's go-to utensils for nearly all of his gardening needs.  Mr Hume claims that these precious heirlooms are far more reliable and effective than their modern-day counterparts that can be found in shops today. As he explains, "Back in the day, everything was made to last. These old tools were lovingly crafted by hand and have stood the test of time. You just can't beat that kind of quality."  With the tools being far too precious to be used by anyone other than himself, Mr Hume has made the decision to donate them to a museum once he can no longer use them. "It would be a shame to let these beauties go to waste," he says. "They are a real piece of our family's history and I want them to be preserved for future generations to enjoy and appreciate."  The tools themselves are a sight to behold. Rustic and well-worn, they bear the marks of countless hours of use in the garden. The pruning shears, trowels, and rakes are all constructed from top-quality materials and are as sturdy as the day they were first crafted. It is easy to see why Mr Hume has such an affinity for them. For those not familiar with Victorian gardening practices, the tools in question may look like antiques that have long since been surpassed by modern versions. However, those in the know understand just how valuable and precious these heirlooms truly are. As Mr Hume continues to use these treasured tools, he takes care to maintain them as best he can. He is fastidious about cleaning them after each use and ensures they are properly stored away when not in use. "These tools mean the world to me," he says. "And so I want to take care of them as best I can." All in all, Neville Hume's set of gardening tools represents a link to a bygone era of handcrafted tools and a simpler time of gardening. It is heartening to see someone so devoted to preserving such a valuable piece of personal and cultural heritage. And it is sure to bring a smile to the faces of those who visit the museum where these precious artifacts will no doubt go on to inspire and educate others for generations to come.
