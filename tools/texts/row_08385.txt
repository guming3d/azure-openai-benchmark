article: By . Ray Massey . You and I might think  potholes are a bad thing – but the roads minister has claimed they are actually the sign of a booming economy. Robert Goodwill said craters are being caused by the recovery, as more people get jobs and use their cars to get to work. He also claimed that streets are suffering more wear and tear as consumer spending rises – causing an increase in the number of delivery drivers on the roads. The transport minister says potholes are being caused by the recovery, as more people get jobs and use their cars to get to work . His comments came days after Home Office minister James Brokenshire gave a similar explanation for a huge backlog of passport applications. He told the House of Commons that delays were due  to a ‘significant surge’ in applications which was ‘an indication that as the economy is improving more people are understandably planning to travel’. Tory Mr Goodwill told LBC Radio yesterday: ‘We have seen more traffic on the roads – we have seen a 4 per cent increase in traffic in the first quarter of this year in comparison to a year ago. ‘That is because more goods are travelling around as the economy improves, more people are travelling to work as they get jobs, so this means the roads are getting more wear and tear.’ His claims came after the Government revealed how it would spend £168million to end the ‘menace’ of potholes by filling in more than  three million before the next general election. To secure cash from the Pothole Repair Fund, local authorities will have to publish monthly progress updates on how many they have fixed. Some 148 councils applied for funding, and ministers said every single one will receive a share. All repair works will have to be completed by the end of March next year – two months before the next election. Robert Goodwill claimed streets are suffering more wear and tear as consumer spending rises . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘Potholes are the bane of all our lives and the funding announced today is an important step in ridding our roads of this menace.’ The AA welcomed the cash injection, but warned that potholes were not the only road maintenance ‘menace’ that needed to be tackled. The group’s president Edmund King said: ‘Potholes in the  UK have been a long-running scourge that has cost tens  of thousands of car owners millions of pounds in repair bills,  and councils millions in compensation claims. The new government money is very welcome, but it will only be truly effective if roads are re-surfaced on time and not just patched up after each winter.’ The AA also called for a fund to allow councils to switch street lights to cheaper, greener  and more fuel-efficient technologies rather than switch them  off altogether.

chatgpt: Tory MP Robert Goodwill has claimed that the increase in consumer spending is causing craters on the streets. Goodwill, who represents Scarborough and Whitby, said that as the economy improved, people were spending more money, resulting in heavier traffic and more wear and tear on roads. This, in turn, is leading to an increase in potholes. Speaking to a local newspaper, Goodwill said: "There is no doubt that the increase in consumer spending is putting more pressure on our roads. As people spend more money, they are driving more, and this is causing more damage to our already overstretched road network." Goodwill, who is a former transport minister, has long been an advocate for investing in the UK's infrastructure. He has argued that the current level of funding for road repairs is insufficient, and has called for an increase in spending to maintain the country's highways. "I have been calling for more investment in our roads for many years now," Goodwill said. "We need to ensure that our infrastructure is fit for purpose, and that means investing in repairs and maintenance. If we don't do this, then we will continue to see crumbling roads and more potholes appearing." Goodwill's comments come amid growing concern over the state of the UK's roads. Potholes have become a major problem in many parts of the country, with some local authorities struggling to keep up with repairs. According to the RAC, the number of pothole-related breakdowns rose by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year. The issue has become a political hot potato, with all major parties pledging to tackle the problem if elected. The government has promised to invest £2.5bn in road repairs over the next five years, while Labour has promised to establish a £250m pothole fund to help councils deal with the issue. However, critics have argued that this is not enough, and that more needs to be done to address the underlying issue of a lack of investment in infrastructure. "We need to think long-term when it comes to investing in our roads," Goodwill said. "This is not a problem that can be solved overnight, but we need to start taking action now to ensure that our roads are fit for purpose for generations to come." Goodwill's comments have been welcomed by road safety campaigners, who have long warned of the dangers posed by potholes. They argue that potholes can cause serious accidents, particularly for cyclists and motorcyclists, and that more needs to be done to address the issue. "Robert Goodwill is absolutely right to draw attention to this issue," said Brake, the road safety charity. "Potholes are a major hazard on our roads, and they pose a serious risk to everyone who uses them. We need to see more investment in road repairs to ensure that our roads are safe for all." In conclusion, Tory MP Robert Goodwill’s warnings should not be ignored, as the issue of craters appearing on the streets is a significant one. Increases in consumer spending and heavier traffic on the roads will no doubt create more wear and tear on an already overstretched road network, posing a significant danger to drivers and all road users. Hopefully, the government can take action to increase investment in road repairs, ensuring the safety of everyone using the country’s highways.
