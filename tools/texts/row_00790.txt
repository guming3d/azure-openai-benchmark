article: (CNN) -- CNN Hero Amy Stokes uses the internet to connect South African teens affected by HIV/AIDS and poverty with volunteer mentors from around the world. Stokes is the founder of Infinite Family and spoke with CNN about the importance of her group's efforts in South Africa -- where nearly two million children have been orphaned by AIDS. Below are excerpts from that interview. CNN: How does HIV/AIDS affect a South African child? Amy Stokes: They will talk about being very happy as children and growing up with two parents until they were grade school level. And then they'll lose one of their parents. They will move where they can be in a community that helps support them and then they'll lose the other parent. Then they're moved into a home where it's an auntie running the house -- and they'll lose that aunt. And then they go to live with the gogo -- or a grandmother -- and before long, they're living with 10 other children in the same 20 square foot space. That gogo is spending all of her time just trying to feed everybody, much less being able to help them prepare for their future. CNN: How widespread is the problem? Stokes: Many of these communities have lost up to 40 percent of the young adults [from HIV/AIDS]. So the children ... don't learn the survival skills that they would have learned tagging along with an adult -- watching an adult as they work, or do grocery shopping, or cooking or any of the life skills that they need. These children are losing, not only love and nurturing, but ... the education of having a parent attend to them. CNN: What's the biggest challenge these kids face? Stokes: They lack access to everything that would teach them what is needed to be successful. There's no technology; there are no computers. The kids walk into our computer labs having never touched a mouse or a keyboard before. However, they are the most hopeful children you will ever meet. They are resilient, resourceful; they are joyful; they are very ambitious. CNN: What change do you see in them as they interact with their mentors? If you reach out to them they will grab that lifeline and work so hard to make your investment of time and talent worth your while. They know that they are in a situation they would like to change -- their lot in life, their future -- but they struggle very hard until someone helps show them the way. What Infinite Family does is we expand their village to include the entire world. When they get connected with their mentors, the mentors make sure that no one is ever truly alone.

chatgpt: Amy Stokes, a CNN Hero, founded a non-profit organization called Infinite Family with a mission to help orphaned children in South Africa who have been affected by AIDS. The organization focuses on providing these children with the equipment and mentorship they need to thrive in their academic and personal lives. Stokes, who was motivated to make a difference after visiting South Africa in 2001, realized that while these children were resilient, they lacked basic resources to succeed. The lack of proper educational tools, along with emotional support, often led to negative outcomes for these children. Infinite Family was founded in response to these challenges. To address the issue of educational resources, Infinite Family designed a program called "Computer and Internet Access," which provides each child with a laptop, internet access, and online learning resources. These tools enable the children to have access to educational resources that they wouldn't have had otherwise. Mentorship is also a crucial aspect of the program. Infinite Family recruits mentors from around the world to help support and guide the children. These mentors provide emotional support, educational guidance, and motivation to the children. Having someone who believes in them can make a world of difference to a child who has faced such profound adversity. Stokes believes that the most important aspect of the program is the connection that each child forms with their mentor. The mentorship program is designed to create a long-lasting relationship between the child and their mentor, which can continue even after the child graduates from the program. This lifelong mentorship can provide much-needed support and guidance during difficult times. Since its inception, Infinite Family has made a vast difference in the lives of many children. One of the children, Siphiwe, was diagnosed with HIV when he was just four years old. He lost both of his parents to AIDS and was taken in by his grandmother. Through Infinite Family, he was able to connect with a mentor who helped him overcome the challenges of living with HIV. Today, Siphiwe is thriving, and his mentor continues to be an important part of his life. Infinite Family has also collaborated with local organizations to provide a range of services to the children, including medical care and psychological counseling. As Stokes explains, "Our ultimate goal is to ensure that each child reaches their full potential, and we will do whatever it takes to make that happen." The impact of Infinite Family's work can be seen in the success stories of the children who have been enrolled in the program. The organization has helped many children overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and become successful in their personal and academic lives. In conclusion, Infinite Family's work is a shining example of how one person's vision can make a vast difference in the lives of many. Through the dedication and hard work of Amy Stokes and her team, many orphaned children in South Africa have been given the tools and support they need to succeed. Stokes firmly believes that with the right resources and support, every child has the potential for greatness.
