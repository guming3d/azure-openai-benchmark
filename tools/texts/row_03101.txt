chatgpt: In today's modern world, we're always surrounded by conversation. From online chats to in-person debates, talk is always taking place. However, certain phrases can be particularly annoying to listeners. A recent survey discovered that the word 'Whatever' took the top spot for the most frustrating word, irritating 38% of people. In second place was 'Like', found to be irksome by 22%. The phrase 'You know' came in third, annoying 18% of participants. The data was compiled by Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. The study involved asking 1,005 adults based in the United States for their opinions. Participants were given a list of words and phrases and were asked to register their irritation levels. Interestingly, some age groups found different words more annoying than others. For example, the word 'like' was more aggravating for those aged between 18-29, with 33% of respondents in this age group finding it particularly frustrating. That number decreased to just 15% for adults aged 45 or older. Political buzzwords were also surveyed, with 'Obamacare' being the most commonly cited term people want banned in 2014. The divisive healthcare plan was named by 41% of those who took part in the survey. In second place was 'shutdown', with 14% expressing their dislike of the term. Coming in third was 'gridlock', followed by 'fiscal cliff' in fourth. Linguistics expert, Dr. Emma Thompson, weighed in on the results of the survey. "It's interesting to see the different words that people find annoying. 'Whatever' has certainly become overused in everyday conversation, so it's understandable why it takes the top spot. However, I think it's important to remember that language is constantly evolving and words and phrases will come in and out of fashion." The Marist survey also included other words and phrases, and some of the results were quite surprising. In fifth place, 7% of people said they found the phrase 'no offense' annoying. Sixth place went to the word 'actually', with 2%, and in seventh place was 'unsure', with 1% finding it irksome. The study did not delve into why certain words and phrases are particularly annoying to people. One possible theory is that words become so overused that they lose their meaning or significance. As a result, they can sound insincere or contrived. Whatever the reasons for the survey results, it's clear that certain words and phrases have become unpopular in society. Perhaps this will lead to a shift in language habits, with people seeking to express themselves more clearly and authentically. Only time will tell.
