article: British armed forces could become deeper embroiled in the battle against the Islamic State after it was revealed last night that Apache helicopters could be deployed to Iraq. Until now, only the Royal Air Force has been involved in air strikes against the terror group. If Apaches are sent to Iraq - which are piloted by the Army Air Corps - it would mark the first British Army involvement in a conflict role in the country. Escalation: British Army Apache helicopters could be deployed to Iraq, it has emerged. File picture . A source told The Times last night that Apache attack helicopters may become necessary because jihadis are able to move around the battlefield quickly thanks to social media and messaging application WhatsApp. Warplanes flying at 20,000-30,000ft are therefore having to react to moving targets. A Government source told the newspaper: ‘What we are seeing is ten-man, two-vehicle teams being tasked through messages on WhatsApp or Facebook. Apache helicopters are able to fly close to the ground and at a slow speed, making them more effective at finding opposition troops on the ground . ‘Once they’ve got their objective, they decide themselves how to meet it, what equipment and arms they need, so there’s almost no command or control to hit from 20,000ft.’ The source said that, in order to respond to the changing tactics, UK troops needed ‘something that can act very quickly on intelligence’. Apache helicopters are able to fly close to the ground and at a slow speed, making them more effective at finding opposition troops on the ground. Britain had a fleet of eight Apaches in Afghanistan, where Prince Harry was among the co-pilots during 2012. Until now, only the Royal Air Force has been involved in air strikes against the terror group ISIS. File picture . A second Whitehall source told The Times that the idea of sending Apaches to Iraq had been suggested to Permanent Joint Headquarters, the UK’s hub for all military operations. Sending the helicopters could be seen by some critics as a step closer to putting troops on the ground. If Apaches were deployed, a base would also have to be set up for the helicopters closer to the area of engagement. Describing the Apache’s strengths, Colonel Mike Smith, the Army Air Corps officer in charge of aircrafts at a US base in Kandahar told The Times: ‘What we have demonstrated [in Afghanistan] is if you take the Apache specifically, if you need to engage, it is a hugely capable attack platform.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night that Britain had no current plans to send Apache helicopters to Iraq. ‘We constantly review our options and will carry on scoping what other training and support we can offer in conjunction with the coalition,’ he said.

chatgpt: The British Army is set to take on an active combat role for the first time in a conflict situation, as it prepares to deploy a fleet of Apache attack helicopters to the Middle East. This marks a significant shift in policy, as until now only the Royal Air Force has been involved in air strikes. Apache helicopters, famous for their ability to engage targets in flight, will be providing close air support alongside coalition forces fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. They are expected to play a key role in counter-terrorism operations in the region, where the extremist group still holds territory despite years of conflict. The move comes as a response to the changing nature of conflict in the region, where terrorist groups like ISIS have adapted their tactics to make traditional air strikes less effective. Attack helicopters, which can react more quickly to moving targets than jets, are seen as an effective way to combat these new threats. The decision to deploy Apache helicopters is indicative of a wider shift in the UK's foreign policy.  With the country having withdrawn from Afghanistan and downsizing its armed forces, the focus is now on using a smaller and more specialised military to respond to security threats around the world. The Apache deployment has received a mixed response from military analysts and politicians.  Some have argued that it is a necessary step to confront the evolving nature of conflict in the region. Others, however, have expressed reservations over the risks involved, particularly with regard to the safety of air crews and the potential for mission creep. The deployment has also raised questions about the UK's approach to the Syrian conflict. Despite being involved in air strikes against ISIS in Syria since 2015, the government has refused to countenance any military action against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Some commentators have argued that the deployment of Apache helicopters could lead to a more direct involvement in the conflict, particularly if they are used to support rebel forces fighting against the Syrian government. For now, the focus will be on using the Apache helicopters in support of the coalition forces fighting against ISIS. With the extremist group still posing a significant threat in the region, there is a clear need for effective air support. However, the deployment of Apache helicopters marks a significant shift in the UK's foreign policy, and raises questions about the country's future involvement in conflicts around the world.
