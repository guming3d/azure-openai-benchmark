article: An evangelical writer has had his latest book turned down by his Christian publishers after he revealed that he is gay. Brandan Robertson had signed a deal last year with Destiny Image to publish his book, Nomad: Not-So-Religious Thoughts On Faith, Doubt, And The Journey In Between. In January Robertson appeared in a TIME magazine article – Inside The Evangelical Fight Over Gay Marriage – in which he identified himself as a homosexual. Brandan Robertson had signed a deal last year with Destiny Image to publish his book, Nomad: Not-So-Religious Thoughts On Faith, Doubt, And The Journey In Between . Last week when he turned in his manuscript, he quickly received a reply from his publisher who had 'concerns' about his 'media attention'. He alleges that he was then asked to sign a statement that he does 'not condone, encourage, or accept the homosexual lifestyle'. Robertson, who is also a spokesperson for Evangelicals for Marriage Equality, refused to sign the statement, and days later he was contacted by the publisher again and told that his book had been dropped. According to Robertson, the publishers were concern that Christian retailers wouldn’t buy the book because of his public advocacy for gay and lesbian inclusion in Christian communities. Destiny Image had previously agreed to publish the book last year, with no advance payment, after Robertson submitted a proposal while still a student at the conservative Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. The book, described as a collection of essays on his personal spiritual journey from a fundamentalist to a progressive evangelical, makes only a glancing reference to homosexuality . Robertson, who is also a spokesperson for Evangelicals for Marriage Equality, refused to sign the statement that he does 'not condone, encourage, or accept the homosexual lifestyle' Don Nori of parent company Nori Media Group told TIME: 'We did not reject or refuse. As with all books, a publisher decides what is financially viable. 'We released the book back to the author with our sincere prayers for his success. This occurrence happens every season.' According to Robertson the incident illustrates a much larger problem that the evangelical community has with homosexuality. 'This is so symptomatic of what happens in the broader evangelical community—every day, LGBTQ individuals are told that they are no longer welcome in churches, are kicked out of homes, are fired from jobs, and forced in to reparative therapy by those who claim to represent Jesus.'

chatgpt: Brandan Robertson, a Christian author, has been caught in controversy with his publisher, Destiny Image. Last year, he signed a contract with them to publish his book Nomad, but in January he came out as gay, which raised concerns among his publishers. Last week, Robertson submitted the complete manuscript of his book to his publishers, only to receive a reply that his publishers had "concerns" about the "media attention" he had been receiving since he came out as gay. To address these alleged concerns, the publishers had asked for his signature on a statement that he does “not condone, encourage, or accept the homosexual lifestyle." In an interview with Religion News Service, Robertson said he refused to sign the statement because he is “committed to telling the truth” and he believes it is wrong to speak out against an entire community of people. The controversy with Destiny Image has caused a stir on the internet, with many Christian authors and activists calling for more tolerance in the community. Robertson has been particularly vocal, taking to social media to express his disappointment in Destiny Image. “This is deeply concerning, as it reflects the larger issues within the Christian publishing industry,” he said in a tweet. “Instead of seeking to expand the conversation around faith and sexuality, publishers are doubling down and stifling the voices of those who do not conform to their narrow, partisan views.” Robertson’s situation highlights the struggles that many LGBTQ Christians face today. While many churches and Christian organizations claim to be inclusive or tolerant, they often make it difficult for LGBTQ Christians to be fully included in their communities. “The way things are going in the world, you shouldn’t have to choose between your faith and your sexuality,” Robertson said. “We should be able to have both." The controversy with Destiny Image has sparked discussions about the LGBTQ community in Christian publishing, and it remains to be seen what the future will hold for Robertson and his book. However, he remains steadfast in his belief in the power of truth and the need for more love and acceptance in the Christian community. “I believe that we can find a way to make room for one another — that we can respectfully disagree on issues of sexuality and yet still be united in our commitment to Christ,” he said. “That’s what I’m hoping for, both for myself and for others who may be struggling with the same issues.”
