article: (CNN) -- It's probably the furthest thing from Hugh Hefner's idea of a sexy hotel room, or a "Fifty Shades of Grey" weekend getaway, but a white, bright, mother-of-pearl-themed hotel room in London has won an award for world's sexiest bedroom. The Corfu Suite at the Blakes Hotel in London took the top spot for its "sumptuous decor," "a bed you can't leave" and "an element of intrigue." And no, the judges weren't the prude, prim types -- they included burlesque star Immodesty Blaze, fashion blogger Garance DorÃ© and the president of luxury lingerie brand Kiki de Montparnasse. Runners-up were the "fantasy cocoon" at the Ca Maria Adele hotel in Venice, and rooms at Secret Bay resort in Dominica. More categories .
