article: Neil Warnock plans to be more boring in the future to avoid any further Football Association raps. The Crystal Palace boss was fined £9,000 for comments he made about referee Craig Pawson following his side's defeat at Chelsea last month. The 65-year-old had a personal hearing on Wednesday after denying the charges after saying that Pawson had been 'influenced' by Chelsea players to send off Damien Delaney shortly after the Blues had seen Cesar Azpilicueta dismissed.

Warnock, who has not seen his side win since a 2-0 victory over Leicester on September 27, was also warned as to his future conduct and intends to steer clear of saying anything of note any time soon. "I'm going to be boring from now on," he said. "(I will) Give you nothing to write about. I know journalists appreciate my comments, but they are not the ones who pay the fines. "The media is part of my job and I have a lot of acquaintances who are journalists and I know how hard they work, so I will always come out and do press conferences. "You just have to learn about the timing of things with the TV. Twenty minutes after a game is very soon so you have to get your thoughts together." Warnock's comments were made after Crystal Palace's 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in October . Warnock could have fallen foul of the FA for questioning decisions in the two matches either side of the Chelsea defeat, with the loss at Hull and a 2-2 draw at West Brom also seeing him question certain decisions. He then saw Palace lose 3-1 at home to Sunderland on Monday night in a game where the Eagles were denied at least one clear penalty. The former Sheffield United and Leeds boss reined in his comments following the defeat as he struggles to work out what would constitute an FA charge, having seen Swansea's Garry Monk avoid a fine for his remarks after a soft penalty was awarded in their game at Stoke. "You have to watch what you say otherwise you are going to get fined," he added. "What I said, I could have changed maybe two or three words and I wouldn't have got charged. "My wife, for example, saw the Garry Monk thing and said, 'Don't you ever do anything like that or I will be mad at you'. I told her this week, 'But he didn't get charged, darling!"' Warnock takes Palace to Old Trafford on Saturday looking to move away from the relegation zone with a victory against a Manchester United side that is also in desperate need of points.

chatgpt: Neil Warnock, the Crystal Palace manager, has been fined £9,000 by the FA following comments made about referee, Craig Pawson. Warnock was critical of Pawson’s decision to send-off Damian Delaney during a Premier League match against Chelsea back in October. The incident took place in the 43rd minute of the game, with Delaney being shown a straight red card for a challenge on Diego Costa. Warnock was vocal in his disapproval of the decision, stating that he felt Pawson had made a mistake. “It’s a joke, the referee is not good enough,” he said at the time. “There’s no way it was a sending off. If we don’t start talking, managers, about poor refereeing decisions nothing will ever get done.” Those comments have now resulted in a fine for Warnock, who has accepted the charge against him. Speaking after the verdict, Warnock confirmed that he would be toning down his public statements in future. “I’ve been fined before and it’s not something I’m proud of,” he said. “When you’re a manager, you have to be careful about what you say. From now on, I’ll be boring – I’ll let my team do the talking on the pitch.” The incident in question was a crucial moment in the match between Crystal Palace and Chelsea, which the latter went on to win 2-1. With Delaney sent off, Palace were reduced to ten men for the remainder of the game, making it a difficult task to take anything from the match. Pawson’s decision was also widely debated in the media, with many pundits questioning whether it was a harsh or justified call. The FA’s punishment for Warnock comes as part of the organisation’s ongoing efforts to maintain discipline and respect within the game. Managers and players are expected to maintain a level of professionalism when making public statements, particularly when it comes to discussing the decisions made by referees. Warnock has had previous run-ins with the FA for similar comments, having been fined twice before for his conduct. Despite this, he remains a popular and respected figure within the football world, particularly among Palace fans. The game against Chelsea was one of several tough fixtures for Palace in the early stages of the current Premier League season. Warnock’s side have struggled for consistency, but remain mid-table and will be hoping to push on in the coming weeks. While the fine for Warnock is unlikely to have a significant impact on his team’s fortunes, it serves as a reminder of the importance of discipline and professionalism in football. The manager’s vow to be “boring” from now on may disappoint fans and reporters hoping for entertaining soundbites, but it is likely to be welcomed by the FA and those who wish to see a more respectful approach to refereeing decisions in the game.
