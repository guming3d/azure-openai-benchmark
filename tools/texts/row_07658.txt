article: Senior Constable, Justice and Corporal are names reserved for positions of authority and rank. But bizarrely, a number of parents have tried to use them as unique names for their beloved newborn babies. The names were among those rejected in 2014 and join a list of knocked back baby titles including Christ, Lucifer, Royal-Rule, Prince, Princess and Majesty. Scroll down for video . Senior Constable, Justice and Corporal are among the bizarre names parents have tried to unsucessfully name their children in 2014 . The New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs rejected several names last year that included rank or royal connotations. But parents who also tried to enter the forward-slash symbol, 3rd and 09 when they registered their child's name were also turned down. There was one rejection of Senior Constable as a name, one rejection of Corporal, six rejections of Justice and one rejection each of Justyce and Justis. There was one attempt to name a child Christ. Under New Zealand law names can be rejected for a limited number of reasons, including that they are unreasonably long, resemble a title or rank, or may be offensive. Back in 2008, a nine-year-old girl at the centre of a custody battle was told she should become a ward of the court until she could choose a name she liked. Parents who also tried to enter the forward-slash symbol, 3rd and 09 when they registered their child's name were also informed they had been rejected . Her parents had called her Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii. Family Court Judge Rob Murfitt said at the time: 'The court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this child's parents have shown in choosing this name. It makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap, unnecessarily.' Murfitt cited a list of unfortunate names that he said were embarrassing or made children seem foolish among their peers. Some names, including Fish and Chips (twins), Yeah Detroit, Stallion, Twisty Poi, Keenan Got Lucy and Sex Fruit, were blocked by registration officials, he said.

chatgpt: Parents have been getting increasingly creative with the baby names they choose for their children. In 2014, many parents attempted to use ranks and positions of authority as baby names, with a number of these names ultimately being rejected. According to official records, names such as Royal-Rule and Mr were among those that were denied by authorities. It seems that while some parents may have thought it was clever to use these types of names, officials were not amused. But it wasn't just authority-based names that were rejected in 2014. Some parents attempted to incorporate special characters and numbers into their children's names, such as using the forward-slash symbol or adding the number 3rd. These names were also rejected by authorities. The logic behind these rejected names is unclear, but it seems that some parents were using their child's name as a way to express their own creativity or as a way to make a statement. It's important to remember that a child's name is a significant part of their identity, and a lot of thought should be put into choosing the right name. Although it may be tempting to choose a unique or unusual name, it's important to consider how the child may feel about their name later in life. Choosing a name that may be seen as too unusual or difficult to pronounce may cause problems for the child in the future, especially if they have to constantly correct people on how to pronounce or spell their name. It's also worth noting that some countries have specific laws and regulations around what types of names are allowed. In some cases, authorities will object to names that may be offensive, discriminatory or have religious or political connotations. In conclusion, while it may be tempting to choose a unique or creative name for a new baby, parents should carefully consider the impact their choice may have on the child. It's important to choose a name that is both appropriate and meaningful, and that the child will be proud to carry with them throughout their life.
