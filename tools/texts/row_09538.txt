article: Nigerian troops backed by civilian vigilantes reclaimed the northeastern town of Chibok late Saturday, a military spokesman and a community leader said Sunday. The town had been seized by Boko Haram militants on Thursday. Chibok is the scene of the April 14 abduction of over 200 schoolgirls by Boko Haram, which sparked global outrage. "Our troops have recaptured Chibok from Boko Haram terrorists who invaded it on Thursday," said Col. Sani Usman, military spokesman for Borno state. "The town was retaken late Saturday by troops working alongside civilian vigilantes after crushing the terrorists. "Troops are still conducting mop-up operation in nearby villages to flush out remnants of the terrorists," Usman said. Scores of Boko Haram militants drove into the town around 4:00 p.m. Thursday and engaged soldiers protecting the town and local vigilantes in a fierce gunfight, forcing re‎sidents to flee. The militants blew up‎ all telecommunications towers in the town ‎with rocket-propelled grenades, making the town unreachable by telephone. Pogu Bitrus, head of the Chibok Elders Forum, confirmed the takeover of the town from Boko Haram but gave credit to the vigilantes for the victory. "I can confirm that Chibok has been reclaimed from Boko Haram by our vigilantes with the assistance of soldiers," Bitrus said. "I spoke with the leader of the vigilantes via satellite phone and he confirmed the good news to me," said Bitrus, who lives in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. "The vigilantes entered Chibok and fought Boko Haram from inside while soldiers laid siege outside the town and take down any fleeing militants," he said. Chibok was strewn with weapons, vehicles and other personal effects abandoned by the defeated insurgents, Bitrus said. Civilian vigilantes have in recent days taken center stage in the fight against Boko Haram Islamists, who have seized over two dozen towns and villages in northeastern Nigeria in the past two months. Bitrus said soldiers fled when Boko Haram attacked Chibok, leaving the vigilantes to fight. The vigilantes had to withdraw when they ran out of ammunition for their shotguns. On Thursday over 200 vigilantes and local hunters clawed back the town of Mubi, the commercial hub of Adamawa st‎ate, which was seized by Boko Haram two weeks ago. The vigilantes on Wednesday reportedly took back the town of Maiha after a prolonged gun battle ‎in which scores of the insurgents were killed. The fleeing Islamists regrouped and took over the towns of Hong and Gombi as well as Chibok. Hong and Gombi are still under Boko Haram control, according to residents.

chatgpt: After a fierce battle backed by civilian vigilantes, Nigerian troops have reclaimed the town of Chibok from Boko Haram militants. The town had fallen to the extremist group just two days earlier, marking a troubling setback for the Nigerian government's efforts to combat terrorism in the region. However, the swift action taken by the troops and their allies has allowed the town to be restored to government control. The town of Chibok is known for being the site of one of the most notorious attacks carried out by Boko Haram: the abduction of 276 schoolgirls in April of 2014. While some of the girls were able to escape or were eventually released, the majority have never been found. The incident drew international attention and led to the creation of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, which called for the Nigerian government to take stronger action against Boko Haram. The recent attack on Chibok reignited fears that the town was once again vulnerable to Boko Haram's attacks. However, the swift response from Nigerian troops and civilian vigilantes has shown that the government is committed to protecting its citizens from the extremist group. According to reports, the battle for Chibok was fierce, with Boko Haram militants putting up a strong resistance. However, the combined efforts of the Nigerian military and vigilante groups allowed them to overcome the militants and reclaim the town. The victory in Chibok is a significant one for the Nigerian government, which has been struggling to contain the threat posed by Boko Haram in the region. While the extremist group has suffered setbacks in recent years, it still maintains a presence in parts of Nigeria and has been responsible for numerous attacks on civilians and government targets. With the reclaiming of Chibok, the government has sent a message that it will not tolerate attacks on its citizens and is committed to defeating Boko Haram. However, the fight against the extremist group is far from over, and further efforts will be needed to ensure that the people of Nigeria are safe and secure. The residents of Chibok have been urged to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities. The Nigerian government has also promised to provide additional support to the town and its residents to help them recover from the attack. Overall, the successful retaking of Chibok is a testament to the bravery and determination of Nigerian troops and their allies. It is hoped that this victory will be the first step towards a lasting peace in the region and the defeat of Boko Haram once and for all.
