The firm hopes that a child friendly version of YouTube and its chrome browser could make the internet safer for youngsters. It says it is aiming the news products at under twelves. Google hopes its new products will make it easier - and safer- for children to use the web. A recent study said the iPad has now overtaken household names such as McDonalds and Disney to become the number one brand among American 6-12 year olds. The annual study, conducted by leading youth and family research firm Smarty Pants, ranks more than 250 brands each year. 'The big motivator inside the company is everyone is having kids, so there's a push to change our products to be fun and safe for children,' Pavni Diwanji, the vice president of engineering charged with leading the new initiative, told USA Today. 'We expect this to be controversial, but the simple truth is kids already have the technology in schools and at home,' says the mother of two daughters, ages 8 and 13. 'So the better approach is to simply see to it that the tech is used in a better way.' Google is developing the products in a secret room at its Mountain View,'Googleplex' called the Kids Studio. Diwanji said her own daughter was part of the test group, and has already given the team some guidance after  Googling 'trains' and seeing a list of Amtrak train schedules pop up. 'She came to me and said, 'Mommy, you should tell Google about Thomas the Tank Engine, because Google obviously doesn't know about him,'' Diwanji said. Although Google has not said which products will be released, it is believe search, youTube and Chrome are the most likely. It comes as youngsters increase have their own tablets to play on.

'iPad's number one status among kids represents the culmination of the 'tablet takeover' â€“ a movement from shared screens and TV network dominance to curated content on personal devices,' said Wynne Tyree, president of Smarty Pants. 'Kids increasingly turn to iPad for games, TV shows, videos, books, homework help and communicating with friends and family.' In the firm's 2014 study, Apple's iPad trumps iconic kid brands such as McDonald's, Toys'R'Us, Nickelodeon, and Disney.

chatgpt: Google has taken a significant step towards making the internet safer for children to navigate. The tech giant has announced that it is investing heavily in developing apps specifically designed to protect youngsters while they browse the web. This move comes as Google recognizes the need to keep children safe and secure online in a rapidly evolving digital world. To aid in this endeavor, Google has created a special lab at their Googleplex headquarters, where teams will focus on studying children and their online behaviors. In doing so, Google hopes to gain deeper insights into how kids use the internet, and the challenges they face while doing so. Recent studies have shown that child internet usage has increased dramatically over the last few years, and this trend is set to continue. In a survey conducted by the Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report, it was found that children aged 5 to 15 are spending an average of 15 hours per week online. Further, the report revealed that the iPad is the number one brand among 6-12-year-olds, with a staggering 55% of children within this age range owning one. With children spending more time online than ever before, it is becoming increasingly important for parents to have the assurance that their kids are safe while they navigate the digital world. The new apps Google is developing will focus on providing parental controls, filtering content and monitoring internet usage, all with the aim of making the internet safer for children. There are several functions that the apps will perform. The first is to filter out potentially harmful content from search results or online feeds. This will ensure that children are not accidentally exposed to inappropriate material. Further, some of the apps will include features that will help parents establish rules around internet usage, such as limiting the amount of time spent online or restricting access to specific websites. The Google app development team is working tirelessly to create products that deliver an optimal user experience for children. They have been working closely with children and parents to gain insights into what would make the apps both enjoyable and safe, while still preserving the freedom and autonomy of the users. Google has made a significant investment in this area, but the return on investment is potentially huge. By creating apps that help children navigate the internet safely, parents will have peace of mind and be more likely to encourage internet use by their children, which in turn will increase engagement with Google and other digital service providers. Overall, Google is making a significant step towards providing safer online experiences for children. By investing in app development and focusing on the user experience, Google is taking a proactive approach to ensure that internet use for kids is both fun and safe. As the digital world continues to evolve and children become more reliant on the internet for everything from schooling to socialization, Google is positioning itself as a leader in the drive towards a more secure online future.
