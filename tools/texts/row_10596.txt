Two reunited friends set out to check off some items from their 'bucket list' of things they'd never done together and wound up jailed after one of their to-dos was a misdemeanor. Police say Andrea Mobley and Jennifer Morrow face charges after stealing from an Ocala, Florida Walmart on Wednesday. The items? Beef jerky and a bathing suit. A Walmart loss prevention officer told Ocala police officer Charles Hunt she witnessed Mobley eating beef jerky in the store. Meanwhile, Morrow concealed bathing suits inside her purse. Tears in a bucket: Friends Andrea Mobley, left, and Jennifer Morrow, right, were reunited after years apart and decided to celebrate by making a bucket list of things they'd never done together and then do them . Morrow went inside a fitting room and when she came out the duo tried heading for the hills. That’s when police were alerted and the two were detained. And the crime due, it appears, were shaking down the local Walmart for old time’s sake. According to the Ocala Star-Banner, Morrow told Hunt that she and Mobley had been friends for 30 years. For around half that time, they’d been separated and had only very recently reunited. Morrow said their mini crime spree ‘was a bucket list thing on our list of things to do together.’ And her friend’s defense? Reports say Mobley, who was wearing the stolen bathing suit underneath her clothes, just wanted to go swimming and didn’t have a swimsuit. She called the theft, along with the jerk-eating, ‘an impulsive thing.’ Always low prices: Neither of them had ever shoplifted so, police say, they went to this Ocala, Florida Walmart where Mobley stole some beef jerky and Morrow boosted a swimsuit before they both got caught . The women were arrested and Mobley later posted a $250 bail after they were charged with petty theft. She was released early Thursday morning. Morrow stayed behind and appeared before a judge Thursday. She explained that she and Mobley met as children and parted ways once they were each married but are now living together after recently reconnecting. While apologizing, 38-year-old Morrow said the plans to steal were mutual. ‘It's not something I wanted to do, but we both decided to do it,’ she said. But Mobley seemed to disagree. Reached by reporters, the 36-year-old pointed the finger at her long lost friend and said it was all Morrow’s idea. ‘I'm ashamed of this whole situation,’ Mobley said. ‘She said it would be all right. We were two stupid women doing something we never did before.’
