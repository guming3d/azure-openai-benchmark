article: GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN)  -- A radical Muslim sheikh's call for the creation of an Islamic emirate in Gaza sparked clashes with Hamas forces that left 21 people dead and injured at least 121 others. Members of Jund Ansar Allah surround Sheikh Abu al-Nour al-Maqdessi in Rafah on Friday. Hamas forces blew up the home of Sheikh Abu al-Nour al-Maqdessi, leader of the radical group Jund Ansar Allah, or Soldiers of the Partisans of God, Hamas sources said. Al-Maqdessi, also known as Abdel Latif Musa, was among the 21 dead, a hospital spokesman told CNN. Friday's clashes were the latest between Gaza's Hamas rulers, who have said they are moderate Muslims pledged to the Palestinian cause, and more extremist Islamic groups. Jund Ansar Allah is part of the radical Islamist movement that follows the doctrines of the "Salaf," or the predecessors -- referring to the early generations of Muslims. They reject all modern influences such as politics and government. In a televised statement, Hamas ministry spokesman Taher Nunu called al-Maqdessi's group "outlaws" and said they have been "terrorizing the country and attacking civilians." "We hold the group and its leader fully responsible for what is happening in Gaza and we offer our condolences to everyone who was killed during the clashes," Nunu said. "No one is above the law and we urge everyone who is a member of this group to surrender himself to the authorities or they will be accountable for all of their actions." The gunfight erupted near a mosque in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where the cleric delivered his sermon, the sources said. Hamas militants raided the mosque and seized control of it. Later, the fighting spread to al-Maqdessi's home, the sources said. Al-Maqdessi also called for a public meeting at the mosque, posting on the Jund Ansar Allah's Web site an invitation dubbed "the golden advice to the government of (Hamas leader) Ismail Haniya." The group posted a statement on the Web site announcing the establishment of the Islamic emirate in Gaza and proclaiming al-Maqdessi "the commander of the faithful." The statement declared that armed forces in Gaza should unite under him. It urged Muslims everywhere to support the "young emirate" by providing money, weapons and men because "this is the hope of the Muslim nation in raising the banner of monotheism in Palestine and to liberate all the lands and purify Al-Aqsa mosque from the filth of the damned Jews." Al-Aqsa mosque is in Jerusalem. The group accused Hamas of not being Islamic enough, saying they care more about pleasing "tyrants" than "obeying God." But Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zahri dismissed statements about the establishment of an Islamic emirate as "theoretical." "It is not permitted to any party or individual to enforce their own laws because this is the responsibility of the security forces," he said. CNN's Talal Abu-Rahman in Gaza City, Gaza, contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Sheikh Abu al-Nour al-Maqdessi, the leader of an Islamist movement that rejects politics and government, was killed in a battle with Hamas forces, according to officials. The incident occurred in Gaza, where al-Maqdessi had been seeking the creation of an Islamic emirate. It is not clear how the battle started, or how many casualties were sustained by either side. However, the news of al-Maqdessi's death was confirmed by Hamas officials, who said that their forces had engaged with his followers in a gunfight in the center of Gaza City. Al-Maqdessi had been a prominent figure in the Islamic Jihad movement for many years before forming his own group, which rejected the notion of state governance and instead sought to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region. His group was believed to have been responsible for a number of attacks on Israeli targets in the past, including the kidnapping of soldiers. While many Palestinians have been frustrated with their lack of political and economic power, al-Maqdessi's group had taken a more extremist stance, rejecting not only the Palestinian Authority but also the more moderate Hamas movement, which has governed Gaza since 2007. The exact motivation behind the battle with Hamas forces remains unclear, and it is possible that there were other factors at play beyond the rivalry between the two factions. Some speculate that al-Maqdessi's group may have been cooperating with other militants in the region, posing a threat to Hamas' rule. Regardless of the circumstances, al-Maqdessi's death represents a significant blow to his followers and those who shared his extremist views. It is also a reminder that Gaza remains a deeply divided and unstable region, with a complex web of alliances and rivalries. The Palestinian Authority, which has been trying to negotiate a peace settlement with Israel, condemned the violence and called for an investigation into the circumstances of al-Maqdessi's death. In a statement, President Mahmoud Abbas said that "we cannot afford to let extremist and violent groups threaten the security and stability of our people and our region as a whole." The Israeli government, which has been engaged in a decades-long conflict with Palestinian militants, did not immediately comment on the news. However, the incident is likely to fuel tensions and increase the risk of further violence in the region.
