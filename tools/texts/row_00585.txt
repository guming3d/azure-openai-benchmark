article: ADRE, Chad (CNN) -- Nearly 100 children at the center of an international scandal that left them stranded at an orphanage in remote eastern Chad returned home after nearly five months Friday, and were being reunited with their families. Some of the children who were nearly abducted by a French charity, pictured in Abeche in November 2007. It was a six-hour bus ride from Abeche, in eastern Chad, to Adre, on the border with Sudan, where mothers and fathers gathered at the post office waiting for their children. During the ride, the bus broke down when its radiator burst. Those accompanying the children were concerned about rebels causing trouble along the way, but that concern turned out to be unfounded. The 97 children were taken from their homes in October by a then-obscure French charity, L'Arche de Zoe (Zoe's Ark), which claimed they were orphans from Sudan's war-torn Darfur region.  Watch as children prepare for return home. Â» . The group, which registered under the name "Children's Rescue" in Chad,  planned to place the orphans with foster families in France. But Chadian authorities stopped the group just before its first planeload of children departed Abeche, after it was discovered that most of the children -- who range form age one to 10 -- were from Chad and had at least one living parent. Both Chadian and French officials were quick to criticize the group's actions. Zoe's Ark head Eric Breteau and five others were convicted of attempted kidnapping. They were initially sentenced to eight years of hard labor in Chad, but were taken to France and jailed there after French President Nicolas Sarkozy intervened by flying to Chad and appealing directly to President Idriss Deby. Although UNICEF and other agencies rapidly determined the children were Chadian, finding their parents was an arduous process, as little paperwork on them could be found. Social workers and officials literally went door-to-door in the Chad-Sudan border region, with photographs in some cases, asking parents whether the children were theirs. Those efforts were hampered by a February offensive in the capital, N'Djamena, by rebels attempting to oust Deby. Furthermore, the children could not be returned home until the criminal case involving them was complete. As the children left the orphanage for the last time on their trip home, Red Cross and UNICEF workers who have cared for them over the months were in tears. Some of the children are too young to know what is going on, but others, who understand, were only told Thursday they were going home, as officials did not want to raise false hopes. Six of the children remained in the Abeche orphanage after it was determined they were from Darfur. Their future is unclear. But the scene in Adre was one of jubilation as families headed out of the post office in a steady stream, taking their children home.  E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: In a heartwarming reunion, nearly 100 children who were taken by French aid workers have been reunited with their families. The emotional reunion took place at a post office in Adre, a town in eastern Chad. The children, who were originally from Darfur, had been taken from their families in 2007 by members of the Zoe's Ark organization. The aid workers claimed that they were rescuing orphans from the war-torn Darfur region and were planning to bring them to France for adoption. However, it was soon revealed that most of the children had living relatives who had been tricked into giving up their children. The ordeal began on October 25, 2007, when the French aid workers were found to be trying to fly 103 children out of Chad without proper documentation. The group was detained by Chadian authorities, and the children were taken into custody. It was then discovered that the children were not orphans, as the Zoe's Ark workers had claimed, but had been taken from their families under false pretenses. The group was accused of kidnapping and sentenced to eight years of hard labor. Six of the workers, including the group's leader, were convicted and imprisoned in Chad in December 2007. After the convictions, the remaining children were placed in Abeche orphanage, where they have been cared for by UNICEF and other aid groups. The children have been given food, clothing, and shelter, and have been attended to by doctors and social workers. Efforts have also been made to trace their families and reunite them. The reunions have been taking place over the past few months, with families traveling from different parts of Chad to collect their children. According to the head of the Abeche orphanage, around 50 children have been reunited with their families so far, and more are expected to be reunited soon. He expressed his gratitude to the aid workers and organizations who have been helping with the reunification process, saying that it has been a difficult and complex task. The children who have not been reunited with their families will continue to stay at the orphanage, where they will receive the care and support they need. The orphanage has been praised for its efforts to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the children, and for its commitment to helping them find their families. The Zoe's Ark case caused an international uproar and shed light on the dangers of unregulated charity work in Africa. Many aid groups and organizations have since called for stricter regulations and monitoring of aid work in the continent. The case also highlighted the importance of ethical and responsible aid work, and the need for transparency and accountability. In conclusion, the reunification of nearly 100 children with their families is a positive development in a case that had caused much trauma and anguish. It is a testament to the resilience and perseverance of the families, aid workers, and organizations involved, and a reminder of the power of compassion and humanity in overcoming adversity.
