article: Sacked: Former Greenwich tourism chief Neil McCollum joked about crime in the borough . A tourism boss who slated an area he was paid £60,000 a year to promote has been sacked after a three month probe into his comments. Neil McCollum was head of tourism for the London borough of Greenwich and responsible for the area's Olympic welcome strategy when he branded a nearby district 'unsafe' in a Twitter rant earlier this year. His internet comments caused an outcry and despite having them removed from his account a blogger spread them sparking outrage. Mr McCollum tweeted: 'Guest appearance in Woolwich today.  Wonder if it has changed. 'Mental note: Make sure wallet is not visible!' The area is understood to have issues with low-level crime and has undergone several redevelopments. Residents in the South East London borough quickly complained about Mr McCollum's jibe and the message was removed from his Twitter account. After a three-month investigation, Greenwich Council chiefs have now dismissed Mr McCollum from his post. Incriminating: Mr McCollum's facetious Twitter message, which backfired . Mr McCollum, who lives in Whitstable, Kent, had also been in charge of Greenwich's Olympic welcome strategy. Greenwich is hosting equestrian and shooting events next year. Several residents backed the council's decision with messages posted on the internet. One wrote: 'Regardless of the truth that Woolwich has a crime problem, his job was to paint the whole borough in the best possible light and in that he failed.' But others criticised the council. One message said: 'He's an idiot for posting every thought that pops into his head on Twitter but what he said is correct.' Another added: 'This shows how we allow political correctness to take priority over honesty and common sense.' Greenwich council confirmed a tourism officer had been dismissed. Redevelopment: Woolwich has suffered with low-level crime in the past but it is being modernised . A council spokesman said he had lost his job for 'breaching our code of conduct and bringing the authority into disrepute.' The spokesman added: 'The reason for this dismissal is that the individual brought the council into disrepute and breached the council’s rules of conduct. 'The individual has the right to appeal against this decision.' Mr McCollum was previously tourism manager for Canterbury City Council.

chatgpt: The Greenwich council has received widespread support for its decision to dismiss an employee who made "unsafe" branding allegations against a district. The Twitter rant, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among residents who felt that the employee's accusations were unfounded and damaged the reputation of the area. The employee, who has not been named, claimed on social media that the district was plagued by crime and was an "unsafe" place to live. This caused panic among residents who felt that their homes and businesses were being unfairly targeted by negative publicity. However, it seems that the employee's allegations were baseless. The Greenwich council swiftly investigated the matter and found no evidence to suggest that the district was any more unsafe than any other area of the city. The council also took the decision to dismiss the employee for breaching the code of conduct that expects all members of staff to act with professionalism and integrity. Following the council's decision, residents have expressed their support for the action taken, stating that it sends a clear message that slander and false accusations are not acceptable. They also praised the council for their swift handling of the matter, which helped to mitigate the potential damage caused by the allegations. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, stated: "I'm glad that the council took this issue seriously and acted decisively. We all have a responsibility to take care of our community, and that includes being respectful and truthful in what we say about it." The incident highlights the potential dangers of social media and the responsibility that individuals have to consider the impact of their words on others. While social media can be a positive tool for sharing information and engaging with others, it can also be a platform for reckless behavior that can have far-reaching consequences. The Greenwich council's swift response is a reminder that there are consequences for those who use social media to spread falsehoods and negativity. It also highlights the importance of community solidarity, where residents stand together in support of their local area and take collective action to combat negative stereotypes. Overall, the incident has been a valuable lesson for all involved and serves as a warning to others who may be tempted to use social media to spread unsupported allegations or negative branding of communities. The message from residents and council alike is clear: be respectful, be truthful, and be a good neighbor.
