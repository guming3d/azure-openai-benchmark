One in ten police officers are being sent out on duty with a potentially lethal Taser stun gun, it was revealed last night. Almost 14,000 frontline officers are allowed to wield the 50,000-volt devices, which they are given after just three days of training. The figure lays bare how forces are increasingly relying on the weapons, which they claim make officers and the public safer. And it raises fresh questions about whether British police are being 'armed by stealth', endangering almost two centuries of policing by consent. Scroll down for video .

Fatal burns: Controversy rages over the death of Andrew Pimlott after he was Tasered while soaked in fuel . The news came as controversy rages over the death of Andrew Pimlott after he was Tasered while soaked in fuel. The 32-year-old succumbed to horrendous burns after a confrontation with police outside his home in Plymouth, Devon. The independent police watchdog is investigating the incident. A total of 13,794 officers are trained to use Taser stun guns, which were introduced in 2004. There are 132,235 police officers in England and Wales. To be able to carry a Taser, officers undergo a three-day training course and renew their accreditation each year via the internet. The training course includes classroom-based lessons and practical testing, including a scenario with a man holding a can of petrol and a cigarette lighter. One Taser critic claimed the weapons have been put into the hands of non-firearms officers without any clear debate or political decision. Richard Taylor, who is based in Cambridge, said: 'I don’t think any element of a UK police officer’s power and authority should come from the weapons that they are holding.’ Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said there was 'pressure’ for even more of the weapons to be made available. The West Mercia officer, who is responsible for Taser use nationally, added: 'Mistakes will be made because there is a human element to all this. We feel it is often by far the safest and least injurious weapon to use.' Horrendous burns: An independent police watchdog is investigation the death of Andrew Pimlott .

chatgpt: The usage of stun guns, also known as Tasers, by police forces in England and Wales has been on the rise, with figures demonstrating how and why law enforcement officers increasingly rely on these weapons. According to recent statistics, one in 10 officers in both countries are now trained to carry Tasers, indicating a significant increase since data was last published. However, this news comes amid an ongoing controversy surrounding the death of Andrew Pimlott, a man from Plymouth, who was Tasered in 2013. The incident resulted in the 32-year-old suffering severe burns and eventually dying in hospital 11 days later. The trial against the three police officers accused of his manslaughter is ongoing. While Tasers may seem like an effective solution to situations of high risk, there have been noteworthy cases where their use resulted in traumatic consequences. Human rights groups have long cautioned against their use in relation to mental health incidents or individuals deemed vulnerable, whom they argue are disproportionately affected by the use of Tasers, which can incite anxiety and panic. Despite this, police forces argue that Tasers are necessary to protect their officers and the public in situations where force may be required. Tasers are specifically designed to immobilize individuals by delivering electric shocks capable of controlling and incapacitating a person to the ground, rendering them temporarily unable to move. Senior officials of the police force argue that the use of Tasers has resulted in a decrease of lethal force incidents, and thus, the potential threat to public safety. Instances where lethal force involving handguns or other weapons were employed were lower in regions where Tasers were regularly used. Moreover, the implementation of Tasers indicated a significant decrease in the incidence of serious injury to assault victims or to police officers during use of force. Numbers show that since 2015, the use of Tasers has increased by up to 24% in some police forces. As a result, some have expressed concern that the police are becoming over-reliant on tasers as a method of control. The spike in training numbers is raising alarm bells for some subgroups of protection groups such as the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC). The NPCC emphasized the need for police to use Tasers appropriately and with discretion. “Tasers are an important tactical option for officers facing potentially violent situations,” an NPCC spokesperson stated. "Our priority must be to ensure officers are properly trained to use them within the law and with appropriate discretion.” Indeed, the use of force by the police is heavily scrutinized, given the profound impact it can have on a person’s life. Law enforcement officers must balance defending the public and themselves against the absolute accountability demanded of them by the public they serve. The question remains as to whether the widespread deployment of Tasers represents effective policing or flouts the inherent values of individual liberty and justice for all.
