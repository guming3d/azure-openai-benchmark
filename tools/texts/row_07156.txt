The owner of the runaway dog was on hand calling for his four-legged friend by name to try and make him come ashore . Beukendaal Fire Chief Paul Chevalier told Time Warner Cable News since this is the first freeze of the river, the ice was thin; as soon as it started to crack, they had to take the rescue team out and launched an airboat at around 5pm. By that point, however, they lost sight of the dog because the ice jam he was on had broken up and was swept by the current. The rescue operation was officially called off at 5.30pm, about two hours after the dog ran away. Chevalier said they put in as much effort into trying to locate the dog and bring it to safety as if they were dealing with a person.
