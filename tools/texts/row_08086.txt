But even worse is having to carry around a bulky spare battery twice the size of your slim and lightweight smartphone in case this happens. But now an inventor from Singapore has come up with a solution by developing a credit-card sized device that allows you to wirelessly charge your phone on the move. Scroll down for video... The WiFlux device uses an inductive coil in charging circuitry that fits into packaging that is 72mm x 55mm x 5.5mm. To power your phone, you simply stick a charged WiFlux device to the back of it . ‘In order to keep up with the pace of modern power consumption, many resort to carrying additional power packs in an effort to remain connected in this wireless world,’ said creator Raffi Ismail. ‘Portable charging in this manner seems like the stone age, especially when wireless charging and ultra-thin lithium polymer batteries are already a reality.’ The WiFlux device uses an inductive coil in charging circuitry that fits into packaging that is 72mm x 55mm x 5.5mm. The system is made up of a receiver and a transmitter. The receiver will stick or get fitted on the back of your mobile phone and plugs into a micro USB port. The transmitter will contain a 850mAh lithium polymer battery. The receiver is shown on the left and wireless charger on the right. It won't provide a complete charge, as with cable-based systems, but it buys you some time before plugging your smartphone into the mains . The device won’t provide a complete charge, as with cable-based systems, but it buys you some time before plugging your smartphone into the mains. ‘We're rushing to finish the prototype for the WiFlux Card, focusing at the moment on the inductive wireless transmitter card and the receiver coils,’ said Mr Ismail. ‘The circuitry for the mobile charging portion has been challenging to design, as we are trying to deliver 0.25W from the receiving coil to the charging input.’ The WiFlux project is currently raising funds on the Indiegogo website. The creators are hoping to receive $100,000 and are so far $588 towards their goal. If they can hit their target, the charger will be available from January 2014. The price is £25, but early-bird backers can reserve one for £22.30, or receive a customised version for £127. Currently, only two versions of the WiFlux charging system are available for the Samsung Galaxy S2, S3 and S4 and for the iPhone 4, 4S and 5. When placed near each other, the charger will wireless supply the receiver with power. At present, the prototype runs off a 9V battery, and provides 5V from the receiver. The goal is to reduce this to 3.7V on the charger and up the voltage to 5V from the receiver while maintaining a slim profile .
