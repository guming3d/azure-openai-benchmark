article: A Russian university is planning to create a 'Noah's Ark' consisting of the frozen DNA of every creature that has ever lived. Moscow State University has received the country's largest-ever scientific grant to embark on the project, which is scheduled to be completed by 2018 and will be based in a 430sq km site on campus. The institute, which has received 1billion rubles (£12.6million) to help get it off the ground, aims to cryogenically freeze and store cells which are capable of reproducing. The 'Noah's Ark' project aims to collect cellular materials from every creature to have ever lived . Viktor Sadivnichy, the university's rector, likened the gigantic project to a modern-day 'Noah's Ark', RT reported. He explained: 'It will involve the creation of a depository - a databank for the storing of every living thing on Earth, including not only living, but disappearing and distinct organisms. 'It will also contain information systems. If it's realised, this will be a leap in Russian history as the first nation to create an actual Noah's Ark of sorts.' The announcement marks the latest, and most ambitious, of the world's DNA banks which have increased in numbers in the past decade following breakthroughs in technology and growing concern about species extinction. These are known as frozen zoos - the most well known of which is that at San Diego Zoo. Staff at the research centre have sperm, DNA and other animal matter frozen in liquid nitrogen since 1976. It currently holds about 8,400 samples from over 800 species. Britain also maintains the Frozen Ark Project, which is run by a consortium of biological societies, zoos, museums and research facilities. Its website states preserved viable cells will enable biologists to 'reverse the dangerous loss of genetic variation that can cause infertility and early death in breeding programmes'. The enormous DNA database will be held in a building at Moscow University Campus (pictured) It holds a remarkable 28,604 frozen DNA samples, of which more than 7,000 are from species on the 'red list' of endangered animals. This includes the Spiny Lobster, the Channel Islands Fox, the Bonefish, the Indiana Bat and Cat's Paw Coral. But Russia's historic Noah's Ark project is not the first of its kind for the country - a storage facility in the remote Siberian wilderness aims to use the natural cold of Siberia's thick permafrost to preserve seed and plant samples for up to 100 years. At least 1.5million seeds from plants and vegetables will be housed in the cryostorage unit in Yakutsk, protecting many of the world's important foods and endangered plant life against climate change, war, and disaster. There is already a small unit containing 100,000 samples (pictured) on the site, but a new extension will mean many more seeds can be stored .

chatgpt: Russian scientists have announced the launch of the world's most ambitious DNA bank, which aims to preserve the biological matter of every creature known to have lived on Earth. The project has been given the nickname 'Noah's Ark', in reference to the biblical tale of saving all of the world's creatures from a flood. The landmark project has already received 1 billion rubles ($12.6 million USD) in funding and will be based at a university in Russia. The principle behind the project is to create a 'databank' of cellular materials, which will include samples from every living creature that has ever existed. The scientists behind the project hope that it will become a valuable resource for future generations of researchers, allowing them to study the DNA of the world's creatures with greater accuracy than ever before. This DNA bank is a first-of-its-kind initiative and is expected to take several years to complete. The project team will be working with scientists from around the world to collect specimens from every living creature on Earth. Once the samples have been collected, they will be stored in a temperature-controlled environment, ensuring that they remain viable for future study. The project's director, Professor Yuri Ovchinnikov, has stated that the database will be used to revolutionize our understanding of evolution and the natural world. He explained that by studying the genetic makeup of different species, we will be able to better understand how they have evolved and how they relate to one another. In addition to its scientific value, the DNA bank is also likely to have important conservation implications. With many species now facing extinction as a result of habitat loss and climate change, preserving their DNA could be crucial in ensuring their survival in the long term. The data could be used to reintroduce endangered species to the wild and to restore ecosystems that have been damaged by human activity. The Noah's Ark project has been heavily supported by the Russian government, which has recognized the importance of preserving the Earth's biodiversity. In a statement, the Russian Minister of Natural Resources and Environment stated that the project was a symbol of the country's commitment to environmental protection and scientific research. However, the project has also raised some concerns among the scientific community. Some experts have argued that the scale of the project is unrealistic, given the vast number of species that have ever lived on Earth. Others have questioned the ethical implications of creating such a vast genetic database. Despite these concerns, the project team remains optimistic about the potential of the DNA bank. They hope that it will become a vital resource for scientists working in a range of fields, from conservation to medicine. With the first samples expected to be collected in the coming years, the Noah's Ark project looks set to become a major landmark in the history of scientific research.
