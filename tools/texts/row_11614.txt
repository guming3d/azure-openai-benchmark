chatgpt: Trinity Liliana Coward, a two-year-old toddler from Norwich, tragically died after a heavy fireplace surround fell on top of her. The incident occurred while Trinity was playing in the living room of her family home. An inquest into her death heard that Trinity stood on the fireplace and grabbed onto the mantelpiece, attempting to swing on the heavy surround when it came crashing down onto her.

According to the inquest, the fireplace was fitted with a heavy cast iron surround, which weighed over 30 kilograms. The surround was attached to the wall by brackets, which were secured with screws.
