article: Government staff sending festive emails have been urged to not to say Merry Christmas. The extraordinary advice was sent this week to avoid offending people of other faiths and agnostics. Officials at the Department for Energy and Climate Change were also told not to use ‘images of skin’ to prevent accusations of racism. The email was sent to staff this week who wanted advice on what to send in festive e-cards . The ministry, led by Lib Dem Ed Davey, sends e-cards instead of traditional paper greetings to save money and paper. An email sent to some officials this week gave advice on what the messages should and should not say, to avoid offending people who do not celebrate Christmas. The message was sent on Monday to staff who wanted to know how to style festive greetings sent from the department, The Sun reported. It stated: ‘When picking, think Season’s Greetings rather than Merry Christmas.’ The email added: ‘As an organisation of multiple faiths and agnostics serving a community of the same and in the interest of inclusion, I’d avoid images with skin.’ Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said the advice was ‘just pathetic’. ‘They should grow up and get a grip. We live in 21st century Britain and we should be able to get on and celebrate Christmas and recognise people have different faiths without offending anyone.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted he mentioned Christmas several times in his seasonal message to staff . DECC employs 1,600 staff in London and Aberdeen. A spokesman insisted the email was only sent to a small group of people in the department. ‘There is no formal guidance to staff about Christmas cards,’ he said. Mr Davey’s seasonal message to staff included several references to Christmas, the spokesman added. Writing to all staff, Mr Davey said: ‘Having just spent the last week in Lima at the Climate Change talks, I, for one, am definitely looking forward to a few days at home with the family at Christmas. I’m sure you are too! ‘I hope that everyone finds time over Christmas to reflect, relax and recharge the batteries. You deserve it. Merry Christmas – and a Happy New Year.’

chatgpt: The Department for Energy and Climate Change has issued a message to officials, containing tips for sending festive e-cards. The purpose of the message is to ensure that the greetings sent via e-cards do not cause any unintended offense. The first tip provided by the department is to include the phrase "Season's Greetings" in the e-card. This phrase is neutral and non-denominational, making it an appropriate greeting for everyone. It is important to remember that not everyone celebrates Christmas, and not everyone wants to receive a card that is so closely tied to a specific religion. The second tip is to be mindful of the images used in the e-card. The message specifies that the images should 'avoid skin'. This means that any images of people should not show skin that is exposed or even slightly suggestive. This is because it is possible for such images to be misinterpreted and cause racial offense. In fact, it is better to avoid images of people altogether and opt for more generic Christmas-themed images such as snowmen, snowflakes, or Christmas trees. The department's message underlines the importance of not only avoiding causing offense but also being inclusive. Sending greetings via e-cards can be an easy way to reach out to colleagues, clients, or acquaintances that you have not seen for a while. However, it is essential to ensure that the greetings are respectful of everyone's beliefs, cultures, and backgrounds. In addition to the tips provided by the Department for Energy and Climate Change, it is also essential to consider the timing of the e-cards. Sending messages at the right time can make all the difference. It is best to send e-cards during normal working hours and avoid sending them during weekends or after work hours. In conclusion, sending festive e-cards is a great way to spread some holiday cheer. But it is essential to make sure that the greetings are inclusive and do not cause any unintended offense. The tips provided by the Department for Energy and Climate Change, such as using neutral greetings and being mindful of the images used, can help ensure that the e-cards are well-received.
