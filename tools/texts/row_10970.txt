article: (CNN)Atletico Madrid stunned their city rivals Real after thrashing them 4-0 in what must count as one of the most humiliating derby defeats in recent memory. The Spanish champions took a first half lead after Real's goalkeeper Iker Casillas fumbled Tiago's shot into his own net. Although there was little Casillias could do about Saul Niguez's stunning overhead kick that gave Atletico a 2-0 halftime lead. The visitors had hoped to cement their strong position in this season's title battle with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, who had been suspended for two matches following a sending off last month. But Atletico pushed on in the second half with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic sealing a historic derby day victory. Atletico are now unbeaten against Real in six matches. Angry Ancelotti . "It is easy to analyze this game because Atletico were better in every facet of the game: they fought more, had more quality on the ball, had better organization, everything," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told AFP after the match, calling it  "the worst game we have played since I have been coach." "We will reflect on it in the coming days with a cool head. We will suffer a lot from this defeat, but we need to change this attitude and avoid it happening in another game in the future," he added. "We failed at everything, we lost all the tackles, all the high balls. We didn't have one player who played well." Ronaldo unhappy . Equally as unhappy was Cristiano Ronaldo. His return from suspension did little to revive what was a limp and lifeless Real performance. "Real Madrid cannot lose 4-0 against anyone," said Ronaldo. "We lacked desire, attitude, everything. The team wasn't fresh mentally or physically, but there are no excuses. The damage is done." Atletico coach Diego Simeone, meanwhile, was ecstatic at his team's performance. "I always insist that the players are the most important people," he said. "Today their capacity to understand what we needed and execute it was fantastic." The victory has revived Atletico's flagging title aspirations. They sit in third, with Real's lead at the top cut to seven points. Barcelona, in second place and four points behind Real, will hope to take advantage Sunday when they play Athletic Bilbao .

chatgpt: In a highly anticipated Madrid derby, Real Madrid suffered a crushing 4-0 defeat against their rivals Atletico Madrid. The loss came as a shock to fans and pundits alike, especially given the return of star player Cristiano Ronaldo to the lineup. The match started off on a heated note, with both teams showing early signs of aggression. However, it was Atletico who drew first blood, with midfielder Saul Niguez scoring a stunning goal in the 16th minute. Real failed to reply and things only went downhill from there. In a display of superb teamwork and tactical mastery, Atletico managed to capitalize on their opponent's weaknesses and score three more goals. Despite Ronaldo's return to the pitch after serving a five-match suspension, he failed to make much of an impact. Real's struggles in defense were evident throughout the game, with Atletico's attackers managing to find gaps and exploit them time and time again. The loss marks Real Madrid's heaviest defeat in a derby since 2010, and their first 4-0 loss in La Liga since 2015. It is also Atletico's first home victory against their cross-town rivals in over three years, and their sixth consecutive unbeaten derby. Speaking after the game, Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane was quick to acknowledge his team's shortcomings. "We didn't play well, we didn't do anything right," he said. "We didn't start the game with the intensity we needed and it showed. It's a painful defeat, but we have to accept it and move on." In contrast, Atletico manager Diego Simeone praised his team's efforts, saying: "It was a complete performance. It's always important to win the derby, and I think we deserved this victory. We showed great character and discipline throughout the game." The result is a major blow to Real Madrid's title hopes, as they now find themselves seven points behind league leaders Barcelona. Atletico, on the other hand, are now within striking distance of the top spot, just two points adrift of their rivals. The Madrid derby never fails to disappoint, and this game was no exception. Fans and neutrals alike will be eagerly anticipating the next clash between these two fierce rivals in the hope of witnessing another thrilling encounter.
