The current $3 parking fee at the trail head lot brought in $47,000 last year, which was only a fraction of what it costs to manage about 138,000 visitors, according to the agency. The proposed permit fee would allow the park service to provide sufficient staff and infrastructure during open ice caves season, although it wouldn't cover all of the associated costs. During the summer, the caves are a popular destination as they can be accessed by kayak, but they're even more of a draw during winter when as many as 1,000 people a day make the trip on the weekend.

The park service plans to hold two open houses this month, one in Ashland and the other Bayfield, where the new fee will be discussed and members of the public will be able to put forward their views. Because of ideal weather last winter, the lakeshore's mainland sea caves were open for the first time since 2009, when they saw fewer than 10,000 visitors. According to the park service, the unexpected surge of people brought in nearly $10 million in revenue throughout the local communities.

chatgpt: The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin is truly a geological marvel that has been attracting visitors from all over the world for decades. However, visitors may now have to dig a little deeper into their pockets to enjoy the breathtaking beauty of this amazing site. The National Park Service, which operates Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, has proposed a $5 special recreation fee to visit the site. The service says the current $3 parking fee brought in $47,000 last year, but they need more revenue to cope with rising demand. The natural wonders of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, located in northern Wisconsin on the south shore of Lake Superior, are indeed mesmerizing. Formed by the forces of water, wind and ice, these spectacular sandstone formations in and around the Great Lakes attract almost 150,000 visitors each year, who come to hike, camp, kayak, and explore the islands' caves and rock formations. The Apostle Islands span over 21 islands of which 12 are available for public use. Each of these islands has unique features that make them a must-visit for anyone travelling to Northern Wisconsin. They offer a glimpse of history and natural beauty that is truly awe-inspiring. According to the National Park Service, the proposed fee increase is necessary to generate additional revenue to support the park's operations and maintenance. The service claims that the revenue generated from the $5 recreation fee would help them maintain park infrastructure, manage the fragile eco-systems, and provide services and programs for visitors. The proposed plan has elicited mixed reactions from the public, with some calling it an unjustified burden on visitors, while others argue that the money would go towards preserving the park's natural resources and ensuring its sustainability. Some businesses near the park have expressed concern that the proposed fee increase may discourage visitors from coming to the area altogether, leading to a decline in their revenues. "I think it's quite steep," said Susan Williams, executive director of the Bayfield Chamber of Commerce & Visitor Bureau, which acts as the local chamber of commerce for the Apostle Islands region. "It's going to affect visitors. It's going to affect businesses. It's going to affect the way people view our community." Despite these challenges, the National Park Service is optimistic that the proposed fee increase will be implemented by next year. If implemented, the $5 special recreation fee is expected to help the park service generate additional revenue, which will go towards maintaining the park's infrastructure, preserving the natural resources, and ensuring that future generations get a chance to enjoy the stunning beauty of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. In conclusion, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore is an incredible natural wonder that attracts thousands of visitors each year, and the National Park Service is committed to ensuring that it is preserved for future generations. While the proposed $5 special recreation fee may be met with resistance from some visitors, the service is hopeful that the revenue generated will be used to make improvements that will benefit all park visitors in the long run.
