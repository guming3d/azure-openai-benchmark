chatgpt: Mixed Martial Arts fighter Cody Gibson got more than he bargained for when a night out in Las Vegas took a violent turn. According to reports, Gibson was at a bar when a man approached him and asked for his name. Gibson obliged, but when the man seemed unconvinced, Gibson suggested that he look himself up. That's when things took a turn for the worse. Eyewitnesses say the man responded to Gibson's suggestion by punching him in the face. What followed was a brief scuffle in which Gibson lifted the man off the floor. The altercation was eventually broken up by bystanders. Gibson took to social media to recount the event, writing, "Got sucker punched tonight by a dude when I told him what my name was and to Google me. Had a small scuffle and that was it." Gibson also shared a photo of his bloodied face on Instagram. This incident comes just days after Gibson lost a fight to Manny Gamburyan at UFC 178 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Gibson has since spoken out about the incident. "I just want to say thank you to all of my supporters who reached out to me to make sure that I was okay," he said in a statement. "Stuff like this happens and it's important to remember that we can't control the actions of others." Despite the violence, Gibson seems to be taking the incident in stride. "It definitely wasn't the way I wanted to start my night, but I'm okay," he wrote. "I'm just glad it didn't ruin my weekend." Law enforcement officials have not commented on the incident at this time. It is not clear whether any charges will be filed as a result of the altercation. For now, Gibson is continuing to focus on his MMA career. He is expected to return to the arena soon, where he will no doubt continue to leave his mark on the sport.
