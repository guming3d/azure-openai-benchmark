Iran’s president has blamed the steep drop in Iran’s currency on 'psychological pressures' linked to Western sanctions. Admitting for the first time that sanctions over Iran’s nuclear programme are taking their toll, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad highlighted concerns over his country’s economy. In the past few days Iran’s currency, the rial, has lost more than half its value against the U.S. dollar. Scroll down for video . Under pressure: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, pictured speaking at the General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City last week, blames Western sanctions for the dip in Iran's economy . It has prompted fears that the economy is on the verge of collapse, crippled by sanctions which mean Iran has lost markets where it can export oil. The price of goods has also risen, as many have to be imported. The U.S. and its allies have imposed the punishing measures in attempts to force Iranian concessions over its nuclear programme, which the West says is aimed at developing atomic weapons. Tehran insists it is for peaceful purposes. An Iranian parliament member, Mohammad Bayatian, was quoted on the chamber’s website as saying that enough signatures have been collected to force Ahmadinejad to face questioning before lawmakers over the currency’s tumble. The Parliament speaker Ali Larijani said that '80 per cent' of economic problems were linked to government mismanagement and the rest to sanctions. President Ahmadinejad faced demonstrations from anti-nuclear groups during his stay in New York last week and has admitted the pressure from the United States and its allies has affected Iran's economy . 'The speaker should help the government overcome the problem instead of accusing the administration,' Ahmadinejad said. Larijani is among the possible candidates for next June’s presidential elections that will pick Ahmadinejad’s successor. Iran’s currency fell again yesterday, hitting a record low of 35,500 rials against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial street trading rate, which is widely followed in Iran. On Sunday it was 29,500 rials to the dollar. Two years ago, it was close to 10,000 rials for $1. 'Are these (currency) fluctuations because of economic problems? The answer is no,' Ahmadinejad said. 'Is this because of government policies? Never ... It’s due to psychological pressures. It’s a psychological battle. 'The enemy is making pressure by playing with (exchange rate) numbers in the street.' Ahmadinejad described the sanctions as part of a 'heavy battle' that has succeeded in driving down oil exports 'a bit,' but he gave no precise figures.

chatgpt: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the President of Iran, has pointed his finger at the United States and its allies for the recent decline in the Iranian economy. In a speech given to the United Nations last week, the President stated that the economic sanctions imposed on Iran by the U.S. and its allies are the primary cause for the country's economic woes.  Ahmadinejad's comments come at a time when Iran's economy is seeing significant financial strain, caused by global sanctions that have been implemented in an attempt to curb the country's nuclear program. The Iranian President maintains that the sanctions are unjustified, and that Iran has every right to pursue nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  This argument, however, has been met with a great deal of skepticism. Many in the international community believe that Iran's nuclear program is aimed at developing nuclear weapons, despite the country's insistence that it is for peaceful purposes only. As a result, the UN and other countries have imposed a series of tough economic sanctions aimed at forcing Iran to cease its nuclear activities.  The sanctions have had a significant impact on the Iranian economy, particularly on the value of Iran's currency. Since the sanctions were first imposed, the value of the Iranian Rial has plummeted, leading to a sharp rise in inflation, high unemployment rates and a significant reduction in the country's purchasing power. This has had a devastating impact on ordinary Iranians, who have seen their living standards decline rapidly.  The President's speech at the UN last week was met with a mixed response. While many in the audience were supportive of his stance against the economic sanctions, others took issue with his government's human rights record and its alleged involvement in the ongoing conflict in Syria. Additionally, President Ahmadinejad was greeted with protests during his visit to the UN, with a number of anti-nuclear protesters demonstrating outside the building where he was speaking.  Despite the challenges facing his country, Ahmadinejad remains defiant, maintaining that Iran will not be deterred by the economic sanctions. He has stated that Iran will continue to develop its nuclear program, arguing that it is the only way the country can ensure its security in an increasingly unstable world.  However, the situation in Iran remains tenuous, with the country facing significant economic difficulties that threaten to undermine the stability of its political system. As the economic sanctions continue to take their toll on the Iranian people, Ahmadinejad and his government will need to find new solutions to deal with the challenges that lie ahead. Otherwise, Iran may face an uncertain future as it grapples with a tenuous economic situation and uncertain political environment.
