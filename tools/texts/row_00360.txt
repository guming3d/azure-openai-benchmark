article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A handful of people rallied outside the Japanese Embassy on Saturday to show support for an American man who is jailed in Japan, accused of trying to kidnap his own children. Amy Savoie calls on Japan to release her husband during a rally outside the Japanese Embassy in Washington. During the demonstration, Christopher Savoie's wife, Amy, along with others from the Children's Rights Council of Japan -- a group that advocates visitation for both parents in divorce cases, and which organized Saturday's event -- called for Savoie's release. "It makes me feel wonderful to know that these people are calling him a hero, saying he's brave, and I just hope he can come home and say thank you to all these people who've supported him," Amy Savoie told CNN. Christopher Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school Monday in a rural town in southern Japan, police in Japan said. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate in the city of Fukuoka to try to obtain passports for them, screaming at guards to let him in the compound. Savoie was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when Japanese police arrested him. Amy Savoie said the separation is taking a toll on her. "I just wish I could talk to him, but I am forced to live with the fact that I can't talk to him. So I have to soothe myself and comfort myself with what he would say right now, and I just hope he's doing well," she said. Christopher Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their divorce in January. The couple, both citizens of the United States and Japan, had lived in Japan but moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. During the summer, she fled with the children to Japan, according to court documents. A U.S. court than granted Christopher Savoie sole custody. Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian. The law there also follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When the couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple still are considered married in Japan because they never divorced there, police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports. A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction, but Japan is not a party to that agreement. If a child in Japan is taken against the wishes of the recognized Japanese parent, Japanese law considers the person who took the child an abductor. Christopher Savoie will be jailed for at least 10 days while Japanese prosecutors sort out details of the case.

chatgpt: Christopher Savoie, an American citizen, has been sitting in jail in Japan since his arrest on September 28. His crime? Attempting to take his own children from his Japanese ex-wife outside of her home, in accordance with a U.S. court order granting him custody. While Savoie may have been acting in accordance with U.S. law, in Japan he was violating both the country's customs and custody laws. Savoie and his ex-wife, Noriko, were married in the United States, but later moved to Japan where they had two children together: a boy, Isaac, and a girl, Rebecca. In 2008, Noriko filed for divorce, and a Japanese court awarded her sole custody of the children. Savoie returned to the United States shortly thereafter. The couple continued to argue over custody, and according to Savoie, his ex-wife stopped allowing him to speak to his children over the phone in May 2009. After exhausting his legal options in Japan, Savoie turned to the U.S. courts. On August 17, a Tennessee court granted him full custody of the children, finding that Noriko had wrongfully retained them in Japan and ordering her to return them to the United States. But Noriko did not return the children, and Savoie decided to take matters into his own hands. He flew to Japan and attempted to retrieve them. According to Japanese police, Savoie grabbed his children as they walked to school, put them in a car, and attempted to drive away. The police caught up with him eight miles away from Noriko's house. Savoie is now being held in a Japanese jail, where he is reportedly refusing food and water. Noriko has not visited him, and has made no public statements about the case. However, Savoie's wife, Amy, has spoken out in support of her husband. "I just wish I could talk to him," she said in an interview with CNN. "I want him to know that we love him and we miss him." The Savoie case has sparked renewed debate over the differences between U.S. and Japanese custody laws. In Japan, custody is routinely awarded to one parent, with the other parent usually receiving limited visitation rights. Neutrality on the part of the courts is considered paramount, with little regard given to the child's preference or the nature of the parental relationship.  In the United States, custody disputes are often more contentious and resolved through extensive litigation. Custody is regularly awarded to both parents, with joint physical custody becoming increasingly common. The Savoie case also highlights the difficulties faced by American parents attempting to retrieve their children from Japan. Japan is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which provides a framework for the prompt return of children to the country of their habitual residence.  As a result, American parents attempting to retrieve their children from Japan face a difficult uphill battle, as they must rely on Japan's domestic legal system, which often (as in Savoie's case) does not recognize foreign custody orders. Savoie's case is ongoing, with no end in sight. The plight of the American father has touched a nerve in the United States and the international community, and has sparked renewed pressure on Japan to reform its custody laws and sign the Hague Convention. In the meantime, Savoie remains in a Japanese jail, with little hope for release.
