article: An unemployed Mexican builder faked his own kidnapping so his wife would pay his $450 ransom. Eliot Garrido Guido, 36, from Mexico City enlisted the help of his friend Carlos Amilcar Martinez Reyes, 42, to stage the kidnapping and take photographs of him tied up an gagged. Mexican authorities believe that Guido was embarrassed that his banker wife earned more money than him so worked on his devious plan. Eliot Garrido Guido from Mexico City, pictured, staged his own kidnapping to steal $450 from his wife . Reyes brought his friend to a derelict house, tied him up, sat him on a stool and took photographs of him as part of the fake kidnap plot. One of the photographs showed Guido with blood on his white tee shirt and with a gag over his mouth, while the second showed him in the same position but with a hood over his head. The images were uploaded to Guido's Facebook account, with the claim that the unemployed builder had been moved 900 miles away. According to the wife: 'When I saw the message and the photos I couldn’t believe what was happening. 'The kidnappers had demanded 7,000 Pesos ($450), and said my husband was being tortured. 'They said they would kill him if I didn’t pay up. 'I was seriously worried but when I contacted them they said I should leave the money at an address in Mexico City. 'I asked them why I should do that if they were in Playa del Carmen, and they just said do it. 'But it didn’t make sense so I contacted the police.' Police arrested Guido, left,  and his friend Carlos Amilcar Martinez Reyes, 42, right, after they were able to trace the Facebook ransom message to a derelict house just 300 metres away from Guido's home . When police arrived and examined the message they quickly discovered it had been sent from nearby after spotting the message’s location identifier. A police spokesman said: 'We found them in a house about 300 metres away. 'They both confessed and were arrested on the spot.' The men now face five years in jail.

chatgpt: Eliot Garrido Guido, a resident of Mexico City, had conspired to extort money from his wife after being annoyed that she was earning more than him. Guido had lost his job as a builder three months before the plot. To execute his plan, he approached Carlos Amilcar Martinez Reyes and offered him a cut of the spoils.  Guido and Reyes staged an elaborate kidnapping and later posted images of it on Guido's Facebook page, demanding a ransom of $450 for his release, or they would kill him. Guido's wife, who became extremely worried for her husband's safety, contacted the police. She shared the message and photographs with the authorities, who immediately began an investigation in search of Guido. The police were able to track down the kidnappers' location just 300 meters away from Guido's residence. Guido and Reyes were swiftly apprehended and charged with extortion, kidnapping, and illegal possession of weapons. Their extortion attempt was clearly unsuccessful and ultimately led to their undoing, resulting in both men being sentenced to five years in prison. Many people across Mexico have expressed outrage at the brazenness of the kidnappers, taking to social media to comment. Some readers have noted that the whole ordeal would not have happened had Guido simply compromised and negotiated with his wife over their monthly earnings. Despite the severity of the crime, both Guido and Reyes continue to plead their innocence, stating that they never intended to harm anyone and their actions were simply an act of desperation brought on by their financial troubles. This case has come as a grim reminder of the challenges couples often face when dealing with financial matters. It points to the consequences that can arise when tempered judgment and common sense are thrown out the window. Ultimately, the lesson learned from this unfortunate situation is that extortion is a severe crime and that there are better ways to resolve disputes within marriages.
