article: Steffon Armitage has reiterated his desire to play for England but appears increasingly pessimistic about his chances of doing so ahead of next year's World Cup. The European Player of the Year, without a cap since moving to Toulon in 2011 owing to the RFU's strict policy on selecting overseas players, came close to joining Bath last month. But that move fell through and the 29-year-old, rated among the world's best back row forwards, remains in international exile as England struggle through a testing autumn series. Steffon Armitage celebrates scoring a try for Toulon against Scarlets in the European Rugby Cup last month . England head coach Stuart Lancaster (centre) has resisted the temptation to select Armitage . 'It would have been a lot easier if things had worked out with Bath,' Armitage admitted in an interview with The Times. 'But it didn't. At this point, I have to move past that.' Armitage, who moved to the two-time European champions from London Irish having earned five caps while at the Premiership club, gave an impassioned defence of his desire to play for his country in the face of interest in his services from France. 'Maybe I spent time in France, but that is nothing, my heart was always with England,' he insists. 'I definitely still want to play for England,' he added. 'As a rugby player, you want to play at the top of the game, and the top of the game is your country.' England captain Chris Robshaw reflects on their fifth successive Test defeat on Saturday . Perhaps more worryingly for England fans though, Armitage revealed his frustration at a lack of contact from England and head coach Stuart Lancaster, particularly when he was mulling over his future this time last year. 'That was on my mind, knowing there was a World Cup, but we heard nothing, no feedback from England,' he said. 'That made the decision to stay on in France quite easy.' If England's performance in the defeat by South Africa on Saturday - their fifth Test loss in a row - was concern enough with a World Cup around the corner, then Armitage's consistent use of the past tense despite insisting he still wants to play for England is another blow to the Red Rose's hopes next year. Armitage says he had no contact from England when he was mulling over his future last year . 'It did bother me,' Armitage adds. 'But it has got to the point now where I have accepted it.' For now, Armitage seems to have accepted his fate. It appears the ball is well and truly in England and Lancaster's court. VIDEO Stuart Lancaster explains his selection to face Samoa .

chatgpt: Steffon Armitage, the Toulon flanker, has recently opened up about his chances of playing for England ahead of the upcoming Rugby World Cup. In an interview with The Times, Armitage discussed his desire to don the white of England once again, despite not having played for his country since 2011 when he joined Toulon.  Armitage's absence from international rugby is largely due to a rule enforced by the Rugby Football Union (RFU), whereby players based overseas can only be selected for England in "exceptional circumstances". As a result, Armitage's impressive performances for Toulon - including the prestigious European Player of the Year award last season - have counted for nothing in terms of his international prospects.  However, Armitage remains determined to force his way back into the England setup. In his interview with The Times, he acknowledged the barriers that the RFU's overseas rule poses, but remained optimistic about his chances. "I'd love to play for England again," he said. "Especially with the World Cup coming up, it would be the ultimate achievement."  Armitage's desire to play for England has been a recurring theme throughout his time at Toulon. Despite the constraints of the RFU's overseas rule, the 29-year-old has never given up hope of adding to his five international caps. His performances for Toulon have been nothing short of exceptional, and he knows that he still has plenty to offer at the highest level.  Perhaps Armitage's biggest asset is his versatility. Although he is primarily a flanker, he is capable of playing across the back row and has even been used as a stand-in scrum-half in the past. This flexibility could prove invaluable to England, who will be looking for a balanced squad with plenty of options in each position.  Of course, the ultimate decision on Armitage's selection will rest with England head coach Eddie Jones. Jones has a reputation for being unafraid to make bold decisions, and if he believes that Armitage can contribute to England's World Cup campaign, he will surely select him.  But even if Armitage does not make the cut for England, he remains committed to his rugby career at Toulon. He has established himself as a firm fan favourite at the French club, and his displays on the pitch have earned the respect of players and pundits alike. With his contract set to expire next year, Armitage is keen to extend his stay at Toulon and continue to compete at the highest level.  "I'm enjoying my rugby, and I feel like I've still got a lot to give," he said. "Whether that's at Toulon or with England, I just want to keep playing and keep pushing myself."  In conclusion, Steffon Armitage's international prospects may be uncertain, but his determination and commitment to the sport cannot be doubted. His performances for Toulon speak for themselves, and if he is given the chance to represent England once again, he will undoubtedly give it his all.
