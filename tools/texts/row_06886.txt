A seven-year-old Florida boy and his father claims to have been hit in the head by fragments of a meteorite that fell from the sky at the weekend. Steven Lippard was playing in the driveway of his home in Loxahatchee, a suburb west of Delray Beach, on Saturday when he was struck in the head by a hard object. His father, Wayne Lippard, found his son on his back bleeding from the scalp, reports CBS 12. Close encounters: Steven Lippard, 7, from Loxahatchee, Florida, claims to have been hit by fragments of a meteorite while playing outside his home . Ouch: Whatever hit Steven Lippard in the head - scientists are examining the rocks found nearby - left a nasty cut, which required three staples . Examining the evidence: These are some of the fragments found on the driveway where Steven Lippard was struck in the head. Researchers at Florida Atlantic University determined that met the criteria of that of a meteor . The resultant cut required three staples to be stitched up. 'At first I thought it was a golf ball or maybe a bird of prey,' dad Wayne told CBS12 News. However a search of the driveway produced pieces of a strange rock. Wayne bagged up the interesting minerals and took them to Florida Atlantic University. Researchers soon discovered the rocks met the scientific criteria of a meteorite. A demonstration showed that, despite their small size - less than that of a pea - the pebbles were still highly magnetic. Proof? Wayne Lippard demonstrates how, using a metal detector, the minerals they found are magnetic . A chemical test will now prove definitively whether the rocks are from space. Astronomer Phil Plait said it was almost impossible to calculate the odds of a meteorite striking a human. Just two Americans have had encounters with them in recent times. A fragment weighed eight pounds hit an Alabama in 1954. After the accident: Wayne Lippard took this photo of his son after finding him bleeding from the head on Saturday . Wayne Lippard (right) with son Steven discusses during a TV news interview what he believes happened during the accident on Saturday . Then a 27-pound rock crushed a car in New York in 1992. As the Lippard family wait for the chemical tests to come back, young Steven is paying particular attention to whether he develops any super powers as a result of the encounter. Typical meteorites, such as the one pictured here, have seldom come in contact with humans in recent years .

chatgpt: Seven-year-old Steven Lippard was playing in the driveway of his home in Loxahatchee, Florida last Saturday when he was suddenly hit in the head by an unknown object. The incident left a gash on little Steven's head which required three staples to close. After discovering his son's injury, Wayne Lippard, Steven's father, went out to search the area for any clues that could lead to the source of the object. To his surprise, he found fragments of rock scattered around the area. Believing that they had fallen from the sky, he decided to take them to Florida Atlantic University for observation and testing. The fragments were analyzed by researchers at the university who were able to determine that they met all the necessary criteria of a meteorite. A meteorite is a space rock that has made it past Earth's atmosphere and landed on the planet's surface. While meteorites are a common occurrence, it is rare for one to have caused injury to a person. The researchers were able to determine that the meteorite weighed approximately 4 pounds, and it was estimated to have landed in the area sometime around midnight on Saturday. While it is unclear how high the meteorite was when it made contact with the ground, it is believed to have been traveling at a speed of approximately 40,000 miles per hour. The discovery of the meteorite has caused quite a stir in the Loxahatchee community. Many people have been left in awe by the incident, with some even describing it as a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence. Wayne Lippard, who found the meteorite fragments, has expressed his gratitude that his son's injury was not more serious. Meanwhile, researchers at Florida Atlantic University are continuing their analysis of the meteorite fragments. They hope to learn more about the composition of the space rock and how it ended up landing in Loxahatchee. This incident serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of space and the potential dangers that can come with it. While meteorites are not typically dangerous, they do have the potential to cause significant damage if they make contact with a person or structure. As for Steven Lippard, he is expected to make a full recovery from his injury and has been left with a unique and unforgettable story to tell for years to come. The Loxahatchee community will undoubtedly be keeping a close eye on the developments surrounding this rare and fascinating event.
