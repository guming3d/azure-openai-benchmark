article: South Korea is perhaps the world's leader in terms of identifying and treating gaming and Internet addiction. After wiring the nation with the world's fastest broadband infrastructure, South Korea's government spends millions per year to identify and treat gaming and Internet addicts. About 8% of the country's population age 9 to 39 suffer from Internet or gaming addiction, according to a 2010 government study. Some see South Korea as a window into the future: Perhaps other nations, including the United States, will see a wave of gaming and Internet addiction when our technological infrastructure catches up. Others say it's too soon to know if gaming addiction is really its own disorder. In the United States, Internet and gaming addiction are not listed in the official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. In the next revision of that list, however, the American Psychiatric Association has proposed that "Internet Use Disorder" be listed as warranting further study. Some groups, however, have moved forward with treating Internet and gaming addiction. One of the leaders in that field is Dr. Han Doug-hyun, from Chung-Ang University Hospital in Seoul, South Korea's capital. Han's research lab treats people who are addicted to games using techniques similar to those used to treat alcoholics, including counseling and virtual-reality therapy (Check out this CNN video to see inside his research and treatment space). As part of CNN's feature on "Gaming Reality," Han gave us his list of the top five warning signs that a person should seek professional help for Internet or gaming addiction. Take a look at the tips and let us know what you think of them, and of the science of gaming addiction, in the comments. Here are Han's top 5 warning signs of gaming or Internet addiction: . 1. Disrupted regular life pattern. If a person plays games all night long and sleeps in the daytime, that can be a warning he or she should seek professional help. 2. If the potential gaming or Internet addict loses his or her job, or stops going to school in order to be online or to play a digital game. 3. Need for a bigger fix. Does the gamer have to play for longer and longer periods in order to get the same level of enjoyment from the game? 4. Withdrawal. Some Internet and gaming addicts become irritable or anxious when they disconnect, or when they are forced to do so. 5. Cravings. Some Internet and gaming addicts experience cravings, or the need to play the game or be online when they are away from the digital world.

chatgpt: A South Korean psychiatrist has issued a warning about the dangers of gaming addiction after observing the detrimental effects it can have on individuals who are hooked on computer and internet games. Dr. Sungwon Roh, from Chung-Ang University Hospital, identified five warning signs of this addiction, which include neglecting daily responsibilities, a decline in personal hygiene, changes in sleep patterns, social withdrawal, and a loss of interest in other activities. South Korea has been at the forefront of the battle against internet and gaming addiction for many years. Its government has implemented programs to help prevent and treat such addictions, including funding research and clinical treatment facilities. However, according to Dr. Roh, other countries such as the United States haven't yet listed internet and gaming addictions as official disorders. Although there is a growing consensus among experts that gaming addiction is a real problem, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has yet to officially recognize it as a disorder. However, the APA recently proposed more research on the topic, indicating that the issue is being taken seriously. Dr. Roh's warning comes at a time when video gaming has become more popular than ever, and with the pandemic challenging people's social lives, many are turning to gaming as a way to cope with isolation. The gaming industry has experienced a surge in sales, and social media platforms like Twitch have exploded in popularity, giving gamers a way to socialize virtually. Experts warn that the boundary between a healthy interest in gaming and addiction is a fine line. Some people may simply enjoy playing games for hours on end without any negative consequences, but for others, it can cause problems in their personal and professional lives. Those who neglect their daily responsibilities, such as schoolwork or work, in favor of playing games are particularly at risk. In addition to the five warning signs noted by Dr. Roh, gaming addiction can also lead to physical problems, such as headaches, back pain, and even carpal tunnel syndrome. It can also exacerbate existing mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. The battle against gaming addiction is expected to become more challenging as gaming technology advances. Virtual reality and augmented reality games are becoming increasingly popular, offering a more immersive experience. Experts say that as technology continues to improve, the line between reality and gaming will continue to blur, making it more challenging to distinguish between healthy gaming and addiction. Overall, the warning signs of gaming addiction should be taken seriously. The South Korean government's efforts to prevent and treat internet and gaming addiction serve as a model for other countries. However, this is just the beginning of the battle against gaming addiction, and more research is needed to better understand how it affects individuals and what can be done to help those struggling with this addiction.
