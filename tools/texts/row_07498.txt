'Dine and dasher': Saul Zelaznog has been taken into police custody after allegedly failing to pay his bar tab . An alleged serial 'dine-and-dasher' has been arrested after the owners of a Reno pub named and shamed him on Facebook because he 'left without paying his hefty tab'. Saul Zelaznog was taken into police custody today accused of failing to pay his $100 bill at Brewer's Cabinet on Tuesday night. The restaurant owners reported Zelaznog to police, but also took matters into their own hands by posting a picture of the Reno resident with a warning on their Facebook page. In their post, the owners claimed the 'serial thief' also skipped out on bills at three other outlets - Chapel Tavern, Imperial and Campo. They also called on residents who saw  Zelaznog to 'remind' him to pay his bill. 'And, while you're at it, you could tell him that visiting restaurants/bars with your friends, running up a huge bill, roughing up servers and then bailing is pretty uncool...pathetic, really. Get a life, man,' they wrote on Wednesday. Within hours, the post had gone viral with hundreds of shares and comments. 'Just trying to look out for all the other business owners,' co-owner Chris Kahl told Reno Gazette Journal. '$100, that’s a lot of money to lose...All his friends paid and left, and he was the last one. The server needed to collect his money. He said he forgot his wallet.' He said the server let Zelaznog go to avoid a confrontation, before Kahl contacted the Reno Police Department. Name and shame: Restaurant Brewer's Cabinet identified Saul Zelaznog on Facebook, accusing him of not paying a bill . However Zelaznog tells a different story. He said there was simply a misunderstanding, and . he had forgotten a method of payment. 'They’re acting like I ran out of there. I was going to be back to take . care of my tab,' Zelaznog told Reno Gazette Journal. He said he was involved in a similar situation at another local restaurant, but left a 'nice watch' as collateral. 'I’m not trying to burn bridges around town,' he said. 'This is a small little town.' Update: Brewer's Cabinet announce 'Mr. Z' has been taken into police custody . However staff at other watering holes that Zelaznog frequented disagree. 'Ya . know, it's really unfortunate that we put faith in people and they . don't always pull through and it makes it harder for us to trust . everyone else,' Campo manager Nick Meyer told KRNV news. Brewer's Cabinet today announced on Facebook that Zelaznog was 'taken into custody' and they hope 'all of his outstanding debts are paid in time'.

chatgpt: Saul Zelaznog, a 42-year-old man from Reno, Nevada, was recently arrested for failing to pay a $100 bar tab at the Pub Brewer’s Cabinet. The incident occurred on July 16th, but it wasn't until the following day that the bar named and shamed him on social media. In a now-deleted Facebook post, the bar posted a picture of Zelaznog along with a caption that read: "Attention, please help us find this man, he came into our establishment on July 16th and racked up a $100 tab and walked out on it. After we repeatedly asked him to pay his tab, he laughed and said 'he wasn't paying'. We have his picture and we will be posting it, along with his full name, all over Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram until we are paid in full." The post quickly went viral, with many people criticizing the bar for publicly shaming Zelaznog. However, the bar defended its actions, saying that they had tried to resolve the situation privately but had been met with the same disregard and disrespect from Zelaznog. Zelaznog, for his part, has claimed that there was a misunderstanding and that he had intended to pay the tab. He explains that he had recently had his wallet stolen and only had cash on him, which was not enough to cover the full amount. He says that he offered to leave his ID and come back to settle the tab later, but the bar refused. Despite Zelaznog's explanation, he was arrested by the police and charged with theft. He spent a night in jail before being released on bail. The incident has sparked a discussion about the use of social media by businesses to shame customers who fail to pay their bills. While some people believe that the bar was justified in its actions, others feel that it was inappropriate and unprofessional. Nevertheless, the incident has drawn attention to the issue of customer service and how businesses should handle situations where customers fail to pay their bills. In response to the incident, the Pub Brewer's Cabinet issued a statement on its Facebook page, apologizing for any offense caused by the post. The statement also said that the bar would be reviewing its policies and procedures to ensure that incidents like this do not happen again in the future. Zelaznog is due to appear in court in the coming weeks, where he will have the chance to present his side of the story. Whatever the outcome, this incident has shown that social media can be a powerful tool for both businesses and individuals, but it must be wielded responsibly and with caution.
