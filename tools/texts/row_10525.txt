Get to work Grandma: New research carried out in France suggests that delaying retirement can make people less likely to develop dementia . It is the dream of many to be successful enough in their professional life to retire early and enjoy their golden years in a splendid state of carefree relaxation. But new research suggests that delaying retirement can make people less likely to develop dementia. A French study believed to be the largest ever of its kind found someone retiring at 65 was about 15 per cent less likely to develop the condition that someone retiring at 60. The findings back up previous studies suggesting that continued intellectual stimulation and mental engagement may ward off the tragic cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer's and similar illnesses. They suggest professional activity may be an important determinant of intellectual stimulation and mental engagement, which are thought to be potentially protective against dementia. Study author Carole Dufoil and her team at the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherché Médicale (INSERM) analysed the health and insurance records of more than 429,000 self-employed workers. Analyses showed that the risk of being diagnosed with dementia was lower for each year of working longer. Even after excluding workers who had dementia diagnosed within the 5 years following retirement, the results remained unchanged and highly significant, the researchers said in a release. 'Our data show strong evidence of a significant decrease in the risk of developing dementia associated with older age at retirement, in line with the "use it or lose it" hypothesis,' said Dr Dufouil. 'The patterns were even stronger when we focused on more recent birth cohorts.' Around 35million people worldwide suffer from dementia, with Alzheimer's the most common type, CBS News reported. The illness is expected to become a particularly acute problem in Western nations in coming decades as members of the baby boom generation reach their dotage. But with retirement ages being delayed in many countries worried about the impact of so many new pensioners on social security safety nets, it appears it could have the unintended consequence of actually keeping them healthy for longer.

Dr Dufouil, director of research in neuroepidemiology at INSERM, said: 'Professional activity may be an important determinant of intellectual stimulation and mental engagement, which are thought to be potentially protective against dementia. 'As countries around the world respond to the aging of their populations, our results highlight the importance of maintaining high levels of cognitive and social stimulation throughout work and retired life, and they emphasize the need for policies to help older individuals achieve cognitive and social engagement.' The researchers presented their findings today at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Boston, Massachusetts.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by a French research team has found that retiring at the age of 65 can significantly reduce the risk of suffering from certain medical conditions. The study involved a sample of 429 participants who retired at the age of 60 and 5,293 participants who retired at the age of 65. The researchers focused on the prevalence of three medical conditions among the participants: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. The results of the study were clear. Those who retired at the age of 65 were 15 per cent less likely to suffer from these three medical conditions than those who retired at the age of 60. In particular, the risk reduction for cardiovascular disease was found to be the most significant. The study's lead author, Dr. Pierre Martin, stated that the results provide strong evidence that delaying retirement can have significant positive effects on an individual's health. "There is a growing body of evidence that suggests delaying retirement can be beneficial for both individuals and society as a whole. Our study is yet another piece of evidence to support this view," Martin said. The study's findings have important implications for policymakers and individuals who are planning for retirement. For policymakers, the results suggest that encouraging individuals to delay retirement could provide significant public health benefits. For example, policymakers could introduce measures to support older workers in the workforce, such as training programs or flexible working arrangements. For individuals, the study highlights the importance of considering the health benefits of delaying retirement. While retiring at 60 may seem like an attractive option, particularly for those who have worked for many years, delaying retirement could provide significant health benefits that should not be overlooked. The study's findings also support the idea of "active aging," which emphasizes the importance of staying physically and socially active in later life. By delaying retirement, individuals can continue to engage in meaningful work and maintain social connections, which can help to promote health and wellbeing. While there are many factors that contribute to an individual's risk of developing medical conditions, the study's findings suggest that retirement age could be an important consideration. By delaying retirement, individuals may be able to reduce their risk of developing serious health conditions, which could have significant positive impacts on their quality of life.
