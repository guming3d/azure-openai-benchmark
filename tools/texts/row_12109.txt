article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Charlie Sheen was "very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain" last Thursday morning, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor. "Kind of weird, the phone call I received," Dr. Paul Nassif told the Los Angeles Fire Department dispatcher in the recorded call, which was released by the fire department Wednesday. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse. Paramedics went to Sheen's Los Angeles home and then took him by ambulance to a hospital, where he spent several hours. Sheen's representative later blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain and ambulance ride to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He did not respond to a CNN request for comment on the 911 call Wednesday. Sheen's manager has said the actor is undergoing rehab at home, not in a residential facility. His hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men" has suspended production, with the network ordering additional episodes of "Rules of Engagement" to fill the gap in their Monday night schedule. "I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people," Sheen said in a statement . released Wednesday. It did not directly address the incident. "Like Errol Flynn, who had to put down his sword on occasion, I just want to say, 'thank you,'" Sheen said. Dr. Paul Nassif, in an interview Tuesday by HLN's "Showbiz Tonight," said he couldn't tell if Sheen, who is his friend, was drunk. What he told the emergency dispatcher last week was different. "I got him on the phone and he was very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain," Nassif said on the 911 call. He told the dispatcher that Sheen was saying, "Don't call 911." Nassif is a facial plastic surgeon and is not Sheen's medical doctor, Nassif told HLN. Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said. Nassif's wife, Adrienne Maloof-Nassif, appears on "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." "They wanted to get married, and a mutual friend introduced all of us, and they said, 'Let's get married, can we get married at your house?' and that's how we met and soon after that we became very good friends," Nassif said. Nassif drove Sheen home from the hospital, but he declined to provide details of their conversation. "There were things he said I don't feel comfortable" disclosing, Nassif said. At another point in the interview, Nassif added: "Obviously we all want Charlie to keep his sobriety. No one can push him into it."

chatgpt: Charlie Sheen recently made headlines after Dr. Paul Nassif, his friend and plastic surgeon, called 911 following a "kind of weird" call from Sheen's home. The Los Angeles Fire Department has since released the 911 recording, where Nassif can be heard expressing concern for Sheen's wellbeing. According to Sheen's representative, the actor is currently undergoing rehab treatment at home. Sheen has struggled with substance abuse issues in the past, making rehab a familiar setting for the actor. In response to Nassif's call, Sheen has issued a statement saying that he has "a lot of work to do to be able to return the support." While the statement does not directly address the reason for Nassif's call, it suggests that Sheen acknowledges the seriousness of the situation. This incident is not the first time that Sheen has made headlines for his personal struggles. In 2011, the former Two and a Half Men star went on a highly publicized rant against the show's creator, Chuck Lorre, and was subsequently fired from the series. Sheen's erratic behavior and substance abuse issues led to an extended break from the spotlight, during which he sought treatment and worked on rebuilding his public image. Since then, Sheen has remained relatively out of the spotlight, focusing on his personal life and continuing his work in the entertainment industry. However, this latest incident highlights the ongoing struggle that Sheen and many others face when it comes to addiction and mental health issues. While it remains unclear what led to Nassif's call, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking help and support for mental health and addiction issues. Sheen's statement suggests that he is taking steps to address his own struggles, and hopefully, this incident will serve as a wake-up call for others facing similar challenges. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional stress on individuals struggling with addiction and mental health issues, making it more important than ever to prioritize self-care and seek out resources for support. With the help of friends, family, and medical professionals, those facing addiction and mental health challenges can find the strength and support they need to recover and thrive.
