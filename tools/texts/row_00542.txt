Eastbourne has become the first place in the UK to boast a population with an average age of more than 70 . Meads councillor Barry Taylor said: ‘We don’t feel old. I’m 67, so I’m a bit young, but I still work and I’m going to keep on working. So do a lot of other people in Meads. ‘People are living a lot longer than they used to, and they are a lot more active. This is a wonderful part of the world and we don’t make enough of it. ‘We are very lucky. We have the Downs and beautiful countryside, we have the sea and we have clean air, and it’s pretty quiet.’ Mr Taylor, who represents the Tories, added: ‘There are some on the council who are very keen on attracting young people to the town, and that’s fair enough. But they ought to think about doing more to attract retirees. This is a superb town to retire to. ‘It’s true that there are a lot of older people without much money, but there are plenty who do have some. They bring prosperity to the town.’ Eastbourne started attracting retirees 150 years ago, following the building of a railway line (file picture) The ONS calculations are based on the 2011 census but have been updated to give estimates for the middle of last year.

chatgpt: A recent report has revealed that the Meads district of town has the oldest residents in England and Wales, with an average age of 71.1 years old. This is in stark contrast to the national average of 39.7 years old. The report, released by the Office for National Statistics, has found that Meads district is home to a high number of retired individuals who have chosen to settle in the peaceful and picturesque coastal town. Local residents have welcomed the news, citing the close-knit community and wide range of amenities available as key reasons for their decision to live in the area. One retired resident, 78-year-old Mary Jenkins, said: "I moved to the Meads district three years ago and I've never looked back. There's a real sense of community here, everyone looks out for one another, and there's always something going on." Despite the positive nature of the report, some have raised concerns about the ageing population and its impact on the wider community. The report highlights potential challenges such as increased strain on healthcare services and a shrinking workforce, particularly with the retirement of the baby boomer generation. Experts have urged the need for proactive measures to support an ageing population, including investing in affordable housing for older people, promoting social inclusion and providing accessible healthcare services. The Meads district council has already taken steps to address the issue by providing support and resources to residents in the area. This includes regular social events and activities for older individuals, as well as a dedicated healthcare centre. Councillor Lucy Jones, responsible for community and wellbeing, said: "We are proud to have an older population that chooses to call the Meads district home. We recognise the importance of supporting our residents as they age, and we will continue to invest in the services and facilities they need to live happy and healthy lives." Overall, the report highlights the growing trend towards an ageing population in England and Wales, and the need for proactive measures to support this demographic shift. While challenges may arise, it is clear that the Meads district has embraced its older population, providing a welcoming and supportive community for its residents.
