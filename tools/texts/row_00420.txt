Shopping app GameIt commissioned a survey on over 1,000 Americans and found than 32per cent of them agreed with the statement: 'I would rather have root canal treatment than be forced to go Christmas or Holiday shopping every day for weeks on end.'

In a survey on over 1,000 Americans, 32per cent agreed with the statement, 'I would rather have root canal treatment than be forced to go Christmas or Holiday shopping every day for weeks on end' GameIt's founder Bryce Johnson points out that 32per cent of the U.S. population equates to over 100million Americans who can't abide Christmas shopping. 'Personally, I’d rather have my molars extracted without an anesthetic than have to go Holiday shopping every day,' he says. Apparently, geography plays a role. Thirty-six per cent of Southerners quizzed would opt for the root canal option, compared to 26per cent of North-Easterners.

Defeated: Last year, Americans forked out a collective $52billion during the holiday period, with an average spend of around $700 each on Christmas gifts . Over-55s were marginally more disdainful of the practice than youngsters, with 35per cent of them choosing the same option versus 31per cent of under-55s. And unsurprisingly, 53per cent of men versus 43per cent of women would surrender to the dentist's chair if it meant they didn't have to drag themselves through the shops. 'The crowds, the frenzy, the buying stuff you can’t afford. No wonder folks hate it,' laments Mr Johnson, who launched his trivia-themed app as a way to turn shopping into a game.

chatgpt: A recent survey conducted by MoneySavingsExpert has revealed that more than 1,000 Americans would rather undergo root canal treatment than go through the hassles of Christmas shopping. The survey was conducted in various states across the country and sought to find out how much people despise the experience of holiday shopping. The survey discovered that men, older folks (over 55 years) and Southerners are the groups that loathe Christmas shopping the most. These groups were asked if they would rather have a root canal procedure or go through the hassle of holiday shopping, and a significant percentage said they would prefer the former. According to the survey, 42% of men stated that they would rather undergo root canal treatment than go shopping, compared to 28% of women. Additionally, almost 50% of people over the age of 55 said they’d opt for a trip to the dentist, rather than shopping for presents. The survey also found that Southerners were the most likely to choose a root canal over holiday shopping. 57% of those surveyed from the South of America would rather have the dental treatment than go through the process of shopping for Christmas presents. This raises concerns for retailers since the Southern region makes up a significant portion of the country’s consumer market. The survey also found that people hated the pressure of shopping, particularly when it comes to gift-giving. 62% of respondents cited the pressure of finding the perfect gift as the main reason they hate holiday shopping, with 58% feeling overwhelmed by the crowds, and long lines. Shopping for Christmas gifts has always been a daunting task, with many shoppers feeling stressed and overwhelmed during the holiday season. For many people, the pressure of gift-giving coupled with long lines, crowds, and the time spent shopping make it an unbearable experience. The survey’s results suggest that retailers and gift card providers may have to change their strategies if they want to increase consumers' interest in holiday shopping. Many consumers seem to be looking for alternatives to the traditional gift-giving process, such as gifting experiences, to alleviate the stress of shopping. In conclusion, the survey conducted by MoneySavingsExpert shows that the majority of Americans would rather undergo root canal treatment than go shopping during the holiday season. Men, older people, and Southerners were identified as the groups that despise Christmas shopping the most, with many citing the pressure of gift-giving as the main reason for their disdain. Retailers will need to adapt to changing consumer preferences and expectations to attract more shoppers during the holiday season, and to make the experience less stressful and overwhelming for everyone.
