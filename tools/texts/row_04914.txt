article: Paris, France (CNN)  -- The widow of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose assassination sparked the 1994 genocide, was arrested Tuesday in Paris on a Rwandan warrant, French and Rwandan officials said. Agathe Habyarimana was arrested at her French home Tuesday morning and is scheduled to appear in court later in the day, said a deputy prosecutor who declined to give his name because he is not authorized to speak about the matter. Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo told CNN that Habyarimana was arrested on genocide charges. They include genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, complicity to commit genocide, and direct and public incitement to commit genocide, said John Bosco Mutangana, the head of Rwanda's Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit. The charges also cover crimes against humanity, specifically murder and extermination; creation of a criminal gang, namely the Hutu militias; and aiding and abetting the killings perpetrated by soldiers in violation of the Geneva Convention, Mutangana told CNN. "We have of course strong evidence linking her to the genocide and the planning of the genocide itself, as early as the early 1990s," Mutangana said. Former president was killed in April 1994 when his plane was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The mass killings began hours later, and by the time they ended 100 days later, some 800,000 people had been killed. Most were members of the country's Tutsi minority, killed by members of the Hutu majority. The circumstances surrounding Habyarimana's death remain a mystery. He was a Hutu, and speculation immediately fell on Tutsis as the perpetrators of the attack -- but some have also speculated that Hutus themselves shot down the plane to provide cover for the genocide. Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide have been tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried by local communities in "gacaca" courts, which allow survivors to confront their attackers. Some human rights organizations have criticized the gacaca courts for falling short on delivering justice. Agathe Habyarimana is now under temporary arrest, the French deputy prosecutor said. The Court of Appeal in Paris must now decide whether to remand her into custody or place her under judicial control at her home, he said. After that, the French court must decide on the validity of the Rwandan warrant before any decision on extradition can be made, the deputy prosecutor said. Rwandan officials began working on Agathe Habyarimana's case in 1995, but it took a while before they could gather enough evidence to indict her, Mutangana said. They submitted the indictment last October, he said. Mutangana said Rwanda is hoping France will extradite her. "We are the first beneficiaries of justice, the Rwandans," he said. CNN's Alix Bayle in Paris, France, and Melissa Gray in London, England, contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Agathe Habyarimana, the widow of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, has been arrested in France on charges of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, and complicity to commit genocide. The 78-year-old was taken into custody on Tuesday morning at her home in the Parisian suburb of Courcouronnes.  The charges against Habyarimana stem from her alleged involvement in the Rwandan genocide, which began in April 1994 after her husband's plane was shot down. The killing of President Habyarimana, a member of the Hutu ethnic group, sparked a wave of violence that led to the deaths of some 800,000 people, mainly from the Tutsi minority.  Habyarimana had been living in France since 1994, shortly after the genocide took place. She had been granted asylum in the country, along with other members of the Rwandan government and military. The French government has been accused of being complicit in the genocide for providing support to the Hutu-led government at the time. Habyarimana's arrest is a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to hold those responsible for the genocide accountable. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established in 1994 by the United Nations, has convicted dozens of people for their role in the genocide, including high-ranking government officials and military leaders.  Habyarimana's arrest also highlights the role of France in the genocide. The French government has long been accused of providing military and diplomatic support to the Hutu-led government, despite evidence of its involvement in the massacres. Habyarimana's arrest follows the arrest of another Rwandan fugitive, FÃ©licien Kabuga, in France earlier this year. Kabuga is alleged to have been a key financier of the genocide.  The French government has denied any official involvement in the genocide and has pledged to cooperate with international efforts to hold those responsible accountable. However, critics argue that the French government has been slow to acknowledge its role in the genocide and has been reluctant to hand over suspects to the international tribunal.  Habyarimana's arrest has been welcomed by human rights organizations and survivors of the genocide. The president of the Ibuka association, which represents survivors of the genocide, said that Habyarimana's arrest was "a major turning point in the search for justice and truth." The group renewed its call for other suspects to be arrested and brought to justice.  The genocide in Rwanda remains one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century. The international community has been criticized for its failure to intervene and prevent the killings. The United Nations has acknowledged its failure to prevent the genocide and has pledged to learn from its mistakes.  The arrest of Agathe Habyarimana is a significant step towards justice for the victims of the genocide. However, much work remains to be done in order to bring other suspects to trial and to ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions.
