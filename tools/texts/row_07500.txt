article: (CNN) -- Google plans to start combining information the company collects about each user of its various websites and services into a single profile, the company announced on Tuesday. Previously, Google said it did not create comprehensive profiles across its various properties, including its leading search engine, Android smartphone operating system and YouTube video site. In a statement, Alma Whitten, a Google privacy director, wrote that the changes "will mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience." She added, "Our recently launched personal search feature is a good example of the cool things Google can do when we combine information across products." That change, called Google Search Plus Your World, brought criticism from rivals Facebook and Twitter, which said that Google+ content now buries their own pages in Google's search engine, and from people who do not care to use Google's new social network. The new privacy policy, too, has already sparked concerns voiced on social networks, including on Google's own platform. "Google consolidating data -- gives me some cause for concern," Robert Mason, a professor of information technology at the University of Washington, wrote publicly on his Google+ profile. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment and instead referred CNN to Whitten's statement and a brief document posted on the company's website. The latter notes that Google does not sell users' personal info to other companies, and that people who do not like the changes can close their accounts. Google uses some of the data it collects based on people's usage in order to deliver advertisements customized to individuals. Whitten boasted in her company blog post that the single, shorter privacy policy should appease government regulators who have called for simplifications across the industry. Facebook made a similar claim last year when it removed much of the legal jargon from its privacy agreement. Google's new privacy policy will go into effect on March 1. It applies to everyone who is logged into a Google account while searching, checking Gmail, watching YouTube videos or downloading apps to an Android phone. The company plans to send e-mails to users and post a notification on its home page about the changes, Whitten wrote.

chatgpt: Google, the world's largest search engine, announced on Tuesday that it would be making significant changes to its privacy policy. The company said that it plans to create a single profile of the data it has about each user. This new policy will take effect on March 1, according to a statement made by the company. The move to a single profile has been met with mixed reactions, as privacy advocates have voiced concerns about the potential invasion of privacy.  The privacy policy change means that rather than maintaining separate user data profiles for Google products such as YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps, the company will now collate all the data it has collected from each user to create a comprehensive record of their online activity.  This move by Google is aimed at creating a more personalized experience for users, with the company stating that it will allow them to provide better recommendations and targeted advertisement. In a blog post on the company's website, Google stated that this change would "help create a simpler, more intuitive Google experience â€“ one that makes more sense for you." However, privacy advocates have warned that the policy change will allow Google to build a more detailed picture of its users' lives, including their interests, hobbies, and spending habits. They fear that this data could be used by third parties to target users with tailored advertising or used illegally by hackers. Google, for its part, has stressed that the company takes user privacy seriously and that this change will not result in any loss of control over personal data. In their statement, they stated that "we're making these changes to further simplify our policies and to ensure that we're able to create the best possible experience for users across all of our services." The policy change follows a record $5 billion fine levied against Google by the European Union for violations of anti-trust laws. Google has stated that it will be implementing the new policy worldwide, regardless of where a user is located. In conclusion, Google's new policy, while aiming to provide a more personalized experience, has been met with concerns about privacy. This updated policy will lead to a single profile of user data, which has raised concerns about data privacy and the use of personal information. With the implementation of these new changes, only time will tell how they will affect user's online experiences.
