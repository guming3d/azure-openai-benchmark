chatgpt: Former Chelsea striker Fernando Torres scored his first goal for AC Milan in their Serie A match against Empoli, helping the Rossoneri to comeback from a 2-0 deficit to earn a point. Empoli had started strongly, with Lorenzo Tonelli and Manuel Pucciarelli both finding the back of the net in the first half. However, the introduction of Torres proved to be a turning point for AC Milan. The Spanish striker, who joined the Italian club on a two-year loan deal from Chelsea, found the back of the net in the 43rd minute. Torres' goal was a result of a fine header, as he met a well-placed cross from Andrea Poli to beat Empolu's goalkeeper. Torres' goal provided Milan with the necessary momentum to push for an equalizer, and it came in the 72nd minute. Japan international Keisuke Honda converted a penalty to make it 2-2, securing a point for the Rossoneri. The result means that AC Milan are now eighth in the Serie A table, with five points from their first three games. While there were some encouraging signs in their second-half performance against Empoli, there is still room for improvement for Filippo Inzaghi's side. Despite the draw, Torres will be pleased to have opened his account for Milan. The former Liverpool striker moved to Chelsea in a Â£50m deal in 2011, but struggled to live up to his price tag at Stamford Bridge. After a loan spell at AC Milan last season, Torres agreed to another temporary move to the Serie A club for the 2015/16 season. Torres had made five appearances for Milan this season before the match against Empoli, but had yet to score a goal. The Spanish striker's goal will be a relief for both him and the Milan fans, and could provide him with the confidence to make a significant impact in Serie A this season. Milan will now look ahead to their next match, a home game against Palermo. Inzaghi will hope that Torres' goal will be the first of many for the Rossoneri, as they seek to improve on last season's disappointing eighth-place finish in Serie A.
