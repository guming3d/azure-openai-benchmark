article: (CNN) -- Embattled country singer Mindy McCready fought for custody of her son in an Arkansas courtroom Friday, a little more than a week after she was accused of fleeing with the 5-year-old and refusing to return the boy for days. The judge in the case made no decision in the custody hearing, which pitted McCready against her mother. The hearing was continued to a later date, said Kat Atwood, McCready's publicist. "Mindy and her family are pleased the courts are handling this case with care," Atwood said. The judge could decide whether the boy stays in foster care under Arkansas state custody, goes to his grandmother's home in Florida or goes to McCready's home, CNN affiliate KARK reported. This custody battle became national news after McCready took her son from her mother's Florida home in late November and had asked a court to restore custody to her out of concern over the boy's safety. On December 1, a Florida judge issued an emergency "pick up" order for young Zander McCready. Days after the order, McCready was found by authorities hiding in a closet with her son in a home in Arkansas. The boy was then taken into the custody of the Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services. Until recently, the boy had been living with Mindy McCready's mother and stepfather, Gayle and Michael Inge, who have legal custody. The singer, who has fought a public battle against drug addiction, has visitation rights. The singer burst on the music scene in 1996 with the debut album "10,000 Angels" and the chart-topping country hit "Guys Do It All the Time." McCready participated in the 2009 season of the reality TV show "Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew." A biography on her website says she had an "explosive relationship" with the boy's father, Billy McKnight, who also is a country singer. McKnight released a statement about the incident just after the boy was found in Arkansas. "As we move forward from this incident, please remember that everyone has the ability to make positive changes in their life," the statement said.

chatgpt: A legal battle is underway to determine the custody of country singer Mindy McCready's son. A judge could soon be making the decision on whether the child should live with McCready or his grandmother. The case has yet to be settled, and it remains unclear as to who will receive custody of the young boy. The dispute began when McCready took her son from her mother's home late last month. However, the singer does not have legal custody of the child. As a result, the boy was placed in foster care in Arkansas while the case is being decided. Many are watching the case closely, with some voicing support for McCready while others believe the child would be better off with his grandmother. Supporters of McCready have criticized the child's grandmother, alleging that she has played a role in the singer's recent troubles. McCready has had a tumultuous history, with legal and personal issues plaguing her career. She has admitted to struggling with addiction and faced legal issues in the past. However, the singer has maintained that she is a devoted mother who loves her child and wants what's best for him. The case has attracted both sympathy and criticism for McCready. Supporters have cited her love for her son and her struggles with addiction as reasons to give her custody. Critics, however, point to her past legal troubles and her current living situation as reasons to deny her custody. Despite the ongoing legal battle, it's important to remember that the well-being of the child is the top priority. The judge will have to weigh both sides of the case and make a decision that is in the best interests of the child. As the case continues to play out, many will be watching to see what the judge decides. No matter what the outcome, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of putting children's needs first in matters of custody and ultimately, doing what is best for them.
