article: Banks are behaving 'disgracefully' by refusing refunds to victims of conmen, the former boss of a major lender said yesterday. Peter Burt, who was chief executive of Bank of Scotland, said money stolen through 'vishing' should be returned to customers automatically. Vishing is where fraudsters masquerading as bank staff telephone customers and tell them to transfer money to another account as soon as possible. Scroll down for video . Peter Burt (pictured), who was chief executive of Bank of Scotland, said money stolen through 'vishing' should be returned to customers automatically . The victims – often old and vulnerable – are told their cash is at risk from cybercriminals but soon find it has vanished. The scam is a variant of 'phishing' using a voice on the phone instead of emails. Even after the fraud has been discovered, many customers do not get their money back because the transfers were authorised by the bank. Sir Peter urged such victims to take legal action. 'Somebody needs to bring a law suit against banks that receive money from fraud and refuse to give it back,' he said. 'If I had been defrauded, I would bring a criminal charge against the bank. 'A bank will, of course, say it carried out all the reasonable checks but I don't think that's good enough. It's a disgrace.'

The British Bankers' Association last year launched an awareness campaign called 'Know Fraud, No Fraud'. It stressed that no bank will ever ask for a full PIN or password by phone or email and that staff will not call for a transfer to be authorised. A spokesman said: 'Banks are determined to stop such crimes. It is important cases are handled on a case-by-case basis and banks work with customers.'

chatgpt: Former Bank of Scotland CEO, Peter Burt has called for stolen money through 'vishing' scams to be returned to customers automatically. Vishing, the act of fraudsters posing as bank employees through phone calls to convince victims to transfer money to another account immediately, often goes undiscovered until it is too late. Despite the victims' realization of the fraud, the money transfers are authorized by the bank, resulting in customers not receiving their money back. Burt states that banks should bear the costs of restoring lost funds of customers because the responsibility of protection lies with the banks. He stressed the need for banks to work on improving their fraud detection methods to combat such scams. Currently, banks resort to asking customers to call back to authenticate that the call is genuine before sanctioning any transfer of money. However, with vishing attacks becoming more sophisticated, this approach has not proven effective in deterring fraudsters. This call for action follows revelations of high levels of financial scams erupting worldwide. The March 2021 UK Finance fraud report states losses due to scams totaled over £1.8 billion during the pandemic alone. Furthermore, a report by Action Fraud reveals that £479 million was lost to financial scams in the UK in 2020. Vishing, the fastest-growing form of scam, rose by 32% during this period. Experts argue that banks must invest more in technology to detect and prevent scams on their platforms. AI systems could be used to track anomalies in customer transactions and alert banks of a potential scam in progress. By implementing more robust fraud detection technology, banks could quickly prevent financial loss and protect their customers. Financial institutions across the world are also collaborating with law enforcement agencies to combat fraud. Through joint operations and with support from Interpol, banks can identify potential fraudsters and shut down their operations. Financial experts say that while banks must work to prevent fraud, customers too must remain vigilant at all times. The general public must report suspicious calls or emails and always double-check suspicious payment requests.  In summary, the severity of financial scams continues to increase, causing huge losses to the public. While many measures are being taken to combat scams, more must be done to prevent innocent victims from losing their hard-earned money. Banks must invest in more sophisticated technology to detect such activities, and customers must be informed and aware of the latest scams. Only then can we begin to turn the tide against financial fraudsters.
