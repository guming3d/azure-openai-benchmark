In 12 Spurs games this year Adebayor has started just once and been on the bench three times — playing just 115 minutes.

Now Big Sam is convinced he could have got the best of Adebayor. Allardyce said: 'He is one of those players that you have to look at and say, 'How do I react to him and interact with him (because) that is the basis for how well he plays for us?' 'You use your management skills in terms of looking at his personality and talking about wanting him to enjoy his football and do what he does best: play and score goals.'

chatgpt: After a long-standing battle to push through their £400m arena project, Tottenham Hotspur has finally been given the go-ahead to proceed with their ambitious plans. The High Court cleared the path for the construction of their 56,000-seater stadium, a much-awaited step for the North London club. The decision comes as a blow to Archway Sheet Metal Works, who had sought to block the development plan, citing concerns over the impact on the health of its workers. However, after an extensive review process, the High Court rejected their claims, stating that the development was in the public interest. Spurs’ Chairman, Daniel Levy, was delighted with the outcome, stating that it was a "momentous day" for the club. Tottenham has been playing their home games at Wembley Stadium since the beginning of the 2017-18 season, and the new stadium plan will bring them back to their traditional roots. The new stadium will feature a retractable pitch, allowing the venue to host various other events, including NFL games and concerts. The club has also promised that the new facility will offer state-of-the-art facilities, including a microbrewery and an in-stadium bakery. With the stadium plans approved, Tottenham will also be able to increase their revenue streams, a crucial factor in an era of financial fair play. Earlier this year, the club clinched a £30m-a-year deal with Nike, and the stadium project will undoubtedly generate additional revenue streams. The news comes just a few days ahead of Tottenham's Premier League fixture against West Ham United. While the Spurs fans will undoubtedly be happy with the announcement, the players will be hoping to mark the occasion with a victory over their London rivals. The new stadium will be located adjacent to the current White Hart Lane ground, which was demolished last year to make way for the new construction. Levy has proudly stated that the new stadium will offer one of the greatest matchday atmospheres in the world, and we can expect the fans to turn up in full force when the stadium finally opens for business. The new stadium will also have a positive impact on the community, offering new employment opportunities and enhancing the area's infrastructure. For Spurs fans, the news of the stadium approval will come as a welcome relief after years of setbacks and delays. The project promises to provide the club with the platform they need to compete with the best and to become one of the most successful teams in the Premier League. With the new stadium on the horizon, the future looks brighter than ever for Tottenham Hotspur.
