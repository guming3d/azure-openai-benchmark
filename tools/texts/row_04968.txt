But now it appears that the tide has turned for the rare creatures and thanks to a successful breeding programme there are more than 1,000 on the islands. The tortoises which helped inspire Charles Darwin's theories of evolution were virtually extinct - but thanks to pioneering work the future looks much less bleak. Road to recovery: A young tortoise at the Fausto Llerena Breeding Centre in Galapagos National Park where a successful breeding programme has seen numbers rise to more than 1,000 . There are now thought to be more than 1,000 tortoises on the islands of Santa Cruz, Santiago, Pinzen, and Espanola. Conservationists began a unique project to return the environment back to the time when Darwin first visited the Galapagos in the mid 19th Century. The group of rocky, volcanic islands 600 miles west of mainland Ecuador are a Unesco world natural heritage site and home to dozens of species found nowhere else. Some 95 per cent of the territory's 3,000 sq miles is a protected area. Endangered: The giant tortoise, seen here feeding on a prickly pear, was almost wiped out after the arrival of humans to the Galapagos islands . Success: Conservationists say there are now more than 1,000 giant tortoises on the Galapagos islands following a successful breeding and repatriation programme . Charles Darwin visited the Galapagos islands during his five-year voyage around South America which set sail in 1831. He was fascinated by the giant tortoise and in particular noted the difference in the shape of their shells between the different species on each island. It helped him understand how animals adapt to their environment and inspire his theories of evolution which shook the scientific world when they were published in 1859. Inspiring: Tortoise eggs in an incubation pod as part of the successful breeding programme which has helped save the iconic giant tortoise from extinction . Theory: Charles Darwin became fascinated by the giant tortoise and noted the difference between the shells of different species. This helped him understand how animals adapt to their environment . But the iconic species was all but wiped out by the actions of the human population throughout the 20th century. After running out of tortoises to eat, sailors introduced goats to the island and their numbers multiplied rapidly, destroying the island's vegetation. The remaining tortoises had to be taken into a captive breeding environment while the goat population was culled. But there is renewed hope that the giant tortiose will flourish now that tortoise numbers have risen and the species appears to have become part of the ecosystem once again.

chatgpt: In a remarkable conservation success story, a pioneering breeding programme has saved an iconic species from the brink of extinction. The programme, which was initiated in the 1970s, saw the captive breeding of the species, increasing their numbers from as low as 15 to over 1,000 now thriving in the wild. The species in question is the Galapagos giant tortoise, which has played a crucial role in inspiring Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. The giant tortoise is native to the Galapagos Islands, which lie off the coast of Ecuador, and is one of the world's largest tortoises, with some individuals weighing up to 550 pounds. However, the tortoise was on the verge of extinction in the 1970s due to a variety of factors, including the introduction of invasive species and overhunting. In response, a team of conservationists launched a breeding programme with the aim of saving the species from extinction. The programme involved the capture of individuals from the wild and their relocation to breeding centres, where they were carefully monitored and cared for. The tortoises were bred in captivity, and the resulting offspring were gradually released back into the wild. The programme was a success, and the population of giant tortoises rebounded, with over 1,000 individuals now living freely in their native habitat. The success of the breeding programme has been hailed as a triumph of conservation, and has provided a beacon of hope for other species that are facing extinction. The Galapagos giant tortoise has become an icon of conservation, and has inspired countless people around the world to take action and protect endangered species. The breeding programme was not without its challenges, however. Captive breeding can be a difficult and expensive process, and requires a significant amount of expertise and resources. In addition, there were concerns about the impact of releasing captive-bred tortoises back into the wild, as they may be genetically different from wild tortoises and could potentially disrupt the ecosystem. Despite these challenges, the breeding programme has been a resounding success, and provides a blueprint for how other species can be saved from extinction. By combining scientific knowledge, conservation expertise, and a commitment to protecting the natural world, conservationists have demonstrated that it is possible to reverse the damage that has been done to our planet and its wildlife. As we face the ongoing challenges of climate change and habitat loss, the conservation of endangered species has never been more important. The Galapagos giant tortoise serves as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when we work together to protect the natural world, and provides hope for a future in which all species can thrive.
