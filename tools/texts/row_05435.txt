article: Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Between 15 and 20 people died when two trains collided outside of Cairo, Egypt, Saturday night, and officials expect the death toll to rise, the country's Health Ministry said. Another 40 to 50 people were injured when one train traveling from Cairo to Asyut crashed into a train en route from Giza to Fayyoum, Deputy to the Health Ministry Mohammed Sarhan told state-run Nile News TV. The Fayyoum-bound train was stationary when it was struck in Al-Ayyat district, he said. The collision occurred in Kafr Girza, a village in Al-Ayyat district of October 6th province, Nile News TV reported. Al-Ayyat is about 70 km (40 miles) south of Cairo. The wreck's location posed a problem for emergency personnel, Sarhan said, because the site is next to a water canal. Security forces used tree trunks and branches to create an ad-hoc bridge to reach the dead and injured. People were still trapped beneath the wreckage late Saturday, reported Nile News TV. Some of the dead were found buried under the trains, Sarhan said. Eighty ambulances were sent to the scene to transport the injured to local hospitals, said government spokesman Ahmed Rady in a statement. The Transportation Ministry has ordered an investigation into the cause of the crash, Rady said. Government investigators are searching for the train's recorders, reported the country's official news agency, MENA. Egyptian National Railways also launched an investigation into the collision of their trains, MENA said. The governor of October 6th province ordered that families of the victims receive compensation, MENA reported. The Egyptian government has issued compensation to families of train crash fatalities and to those injured in crashes in the past. Train disasters in Egypt over the last 12 years have killed hundreds. In August 2006, at least 57 people died and 128 injured when two passenger trains collided and burst into flames in Qalyoubiya Province, just north of Cairo. A month later, three people died and 24 injured when a cargo train collided with a passenger train in the same area. More than 370 people died in February 2002 when a fire broke out near the rear of a passenger train en route to Luzzur from Cairo. At least 44 of those passengers died when they leapt from the burning cars while the train was still moving.

chatgpt: In a tragic incident outside of Cairo, 40 to 50 people were injured when two trains collided. The incident occurred when a train traveling from Cairo to Asyut hit a stationary train, causing a catastrophic accident. The collision was so powerful that both trains derailed, with passengers on board being thrown onto the tracks.   Immediately after the incident, emergency services were dispatched to the scene. A total of 80 ambulances were sent to transport the injured to hospitals in the area. Given the severity of the accident, the rescue operation was challenging, but rescuers quickly got to work to provide critical care to those in need. One of the key obstacles that rescuers faced was the difficulty of accessing certain areas of the wreckage. However, they managed to build a makeshift bridge from tree branches and vehicles in order to reach the injured. The bridge allowed rescuers to reach passengers who were trapped in the wreckage and bring them to safety.  The sound of the collision was so loud that it could be heard from miles around. As news of the incident spread, residents of the area rushed to the scene to see what had happened. The sight of the two trains tilted and precariously balanced on the tracks left a sobering impression on all who saw it.  The injured were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. Many suffered severe injuries, including broken bones and internal injuries. Others were treated for more minor injuries such as cuts and bruises. The authorities have ensured that all those injured in the incident are receiving the best possible care and attention at the hospital.  In the aftermath of the accident, an investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the collision. Preliminary reports suggest that a technical malfunction on one of the trains may have been responsible. The authorities have called for a full inquiry to ensure that such an accident does not occur again in the future.  The incident has once again highlighted the challenges faced by Egypt's aging railway infrastructure. In recent years, the authorities have made efforts to upgrade the railway network to improve passenger safety. However, much work remains to be done to modernize the rail system and ensure that incidents like this are not repeated.  As the investigation into the incident unfolds, the thoughts and prayers of people across the nation are with those who were injured in the accident. The authorities have promised to take all necessary steps to ensure that passengers can travel safely on Egypt's railways in the years to come.
