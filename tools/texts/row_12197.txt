article: Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Tehran's main bazaar reopened for its first full day of activity after demonstrations this week over the country's plummeting currency. The bazaar was open Saturday, as were money exchange shops. "The price of the dollar on the open market today dropped to (between) 28,500 and 29,000 rials, but the price of all foreign currencies, including the dollar, is still fluctuating and only a few transactions took place today," Mohammad Kashtiarai, head of the National Gold and Jewel Association, told the semi-official Mehr News Agency. Sixteen people were arrested Thursday, a day after police dispersed a crowd at the bazaar, where protesters were blaming President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the high price of the dollar and goods in general. Demonstrators chanted slogans opposing firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and decrying the skyrocketing cost of basic goods. The rial's plummet to historic lows is the result of international sanctions, imposed largely by the United States and the European Union in an effort to pressure Iran to sit down for talks on its nuclear program. Ahmadinejad has insisted that sanctions hurt the people, not the government, and that the country's economy "has become a tool for psychological warfare." The rial's value was cut in half from September of last year through last month, the Congressional Research Service said in a report. It has fallen even further since, including a sharp nosedive this week, reaching historic lows against the value of the dollar. But protesters in Tehran blamed Ahmadinejad, chanting slogans against his regime and complaining about high prices. Those arrested "were the main players in the recent fluctuations in the foreign currency market," the Tehran Judiciary said in a statement.

chatgpt: Following protests over Iran's ongoing currency crisis, Tehran's main bazaar opened for business on Wednesday. Despite concerns that the unrest would continue, the bustling market was once again filled with vendors and shoppers eager to do business.  Just one day earlier, the bazaar was closed due to protests against the nation's struggling economy. The demonstrations had been peaceful, but they resulted in the arrest of 16 individuals. News of the arrests was widely circulated on social media, prompting a mixed response from those sympathetic to the protesters. With tensions on the rise, many feared that the bazaar would remain closed for an extended period. The bazaar, which dates back to the 16th century, is a major hub for trade and commerce in Iran. It is known for its wide variety of goods, including everything from textiles and spices to electronics and souvenirs. Thankfully, the reopening of the bazaar appears to have gone smoothly, with no reports of further protests or disturbances. However, the underlying issues that sparked the unrest remain unresolved. The Iranian economy has long been plagued by inflation and unemployment, and the recent devaluation of the rial has only made matters worse. Many Iranians are struggling to make ends meet, and the currency crisis has left many feeling frustrated and powerless. Despite the challenges, many shopkeepers in the bazaar remain optimistic. "We have to be patient," one vendor told local media. "The customers will come back if we offer quality products at reasonable prices." Others, however, are more skeptical, and worry that the protests could continue if the government does not take steps to address the underlying economic issues. For now, the bazaar is back in business, but the currency crisis shows no signs of abating. It remains to be seen how the government will respond to the protesters' demands, and whether the bazaar will remain a hub of commerce and activity in the days and weeks to come.
