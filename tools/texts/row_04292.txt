article: Amir Khan enjoyed the luxury of a slap up breakfast before weighing in for his big fight with Devon Alexander. Khan had woken in the morning more than half a pound under for the 10st 7lbs welterweight limit. That gave him the unusual indulgence of his pre-scale treat. He then came in exactly on the limit.

Khan said: 'As I've been saying, I'm really comfortable now in this higher division. My weight's perfect and you'll see that my strength and power has grown.' Alexander was also right on the weight. The pair then exchanged some light banter. Khan told his opponent: 'I'm from England but I've got more fans than you in America. I'm going to win this in style.' Alexander responded: 'You've got to say that, in your mind you know I'm going to beat you. You know you're already beaten.' Khan, who's fought once at welterweight, believes his power and strength has grown since moving to 147lbs . Alexander is adamant Khan knows he's already a beaten man ahead of Saturday's bout . The weigh-in took place in the MGM Grand Garden Arena, where the fight itself will happen. This tradition began when Ricky Hatton brought his blue Manchester City army to Vegas for his fights with Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. Then, and for subsequent Mayweather and Pacquiao fights, this ritual has been almost as crowded as the fights themselves.

The upper tier of the arena has been curtained off. But while Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions are clearly not expecting a sell-out they are predicting a healthy attendance. Of the possibility of going to fight Mayweather if he wins, Khan said: 'A lot of people are saying now that it may well happen but I'm concentrating on beating Devon and then we'll see how it falls.' Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night.

chatgpt: Amir Khan has his eyes set on a major victory this weekend, as he prepares to fight Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand Garden on Saturday. Both boxers weighed in at 10st 7lbs in Las Vegas on Friday, setting up what promises to be an epic bout between two top pugilists. Khan has made it clear that he is refusing to look past his Alexander fight, despite the potential for a huge match-up with Floyd Mayweather if he is victorious. Speaking ahead of the fight, Khan emphasized that his focus is solely on Alexander, and he is not underestimating the challenge that his opponent presents. "I've got a tough test ahead of me in Devon Alexander, and I know that I can't afford to slip up," said Khan. "He's a very skilled fighter, and I need to be on top form if I want to come out on top. I'm not thinking about any potential fights with Mayweather or anyone else right now. My only focus is on Saturday night." Of course, the prospect of a fight with Mayweather is tantalizing for boxing fans and pundits alike. Khan has long been considered one of the top contenders for a match-up with the undefeated American, and a victory over Alexander could potentially set up the clash that many are calling for. But Alexander is no pushover, and Khan is well aware of the challenges that his opponent brings to the ring. The 27-year-old has an impressive record, including notable victories over Marcos Maidana and Lucas Matthysse, and he will undoubtedly be looking to add Khan to his list of scalps on Saturday night. However, Khan has also been in fine form recently, with impressive wins over Luis Collazo and Devon Alexander's fellow American Chris Algieri. The Bolton-born fighter has been sharpening his skills in training camp, and he will be looking to use his speed and agility to overcome Alexander's technical prowess in the ring. With both fighters weighing in at the same weight, the stage is set for a thrilling encounter between two evenly-matched boxers. Khan has been the favorite in the build-up to the fight, but Alexander will be looking to upset the odds and prove his doubters wrong. Regardless of the result on Saturday, Khan's focus will remain on securing the victory over Alexander. If he can come through this fight unscathed and with his unbeaten record intact, the clamor for a match-up with Mayweather will only grow louder. But for now, Khan is taking things one step at a time, fully focused on the task at hand.
