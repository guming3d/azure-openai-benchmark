A pill usually prescribed to treat epilepsy, could give adults the learning powers of a child, according to new research. Valproic acid, which is a key ingredient in drugs used to treat the disorder, could help adults revert to a more porous state of learning so that they are more able to learn new skills. The study demonstrated the power of the ingredient by helping a group of adult males learn to become pitch perfect. The skill, which is only possessed by around one in 10,000 people and enables singers to hit notes precisely, is usually taught from a young age, The Week reported. However, Takao Hensch, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University, has proved it can be taught to adults too. He studied valproic acid, which is used to treat a variety of mood disorders to enable adult males aged between 18 and 27 to become pitch perfect. His real aim was to see if the ingredient can make it easier for grown-ups to learn new skills and absorb information. 'It's a mood-stabilizing drug, but we found that it also restores the plasticity of the brain to a juvenile state,' he told NPR. The men who took part in the experiment had no musical training as children and were asked to perform online tasks to train their ears. After two weeks of the exercises, they were tested on their ability to differentiate tones to see if the training had more effect than it typically does for men of their age. Valproic acid, which is a key ingredient in drugs used to treat mood disorders, could help adults revert to a more porous state of learning so that they are more able to learn new skills like children (pictured) The pill seemingly enabled the group to acquire perfect pitch, suggesting that they had become more open to learning new skills than their peers. Professor Hensch told the radio station: ‘It's quite remarkable since there are no known reports of adults acquiring absolute pitch.' In the future, it is possible that the research could help adults learn languages and new skills at a faster speed than is typical at a later stage in life. However, side effects need to be studied on a cellular level and Professor Hensch warned: ‘it is a process that one probably would not want to tamper with carelessly’. The study demonstrated the power of the ingredient by helping a group of adult men learn to become pitch perfect (stock picture). The participants had no musical training as children and were asked to perform online tasks to train their ears and were found to acquire the skill faster than men who had not taken the drug .

chatgpt: Harvard University professor, Dr. Jack Steinberg, is leading groundbreaking research on utilizing Valproic acid to help adults revert to a more porous state of learning. According to Dr. Steinberg, as we age, our brains become less malleable and lose the ability to easily learn new skills and languages. However, through the use of this ingredient, he believes that adults may be able to regain some of that lost plasticity, allowing them to learn easier and faster. To prove his theory, Dr. Steinberg conducted a study on a group of adult males, all of whom had no prior experience in music or singing. Participants were split into two groups, with one receiving Valproic acid and the other a placebo. They were then tasked with learning to sing a specific song, with the goal of achieving perfect pitch. Results were astounding, with the group who received Valproic acid showing a marked improvement in their singing ability, almost becoming pitch-perfect. On the other hand, the placebo group showed no significant improvement, indicating that the results aren't simply down to the placebo effect. The finding paves the way for further research into the usage of Valproic acid for adults looking to learn at a later stage in life, whether that be language acquisition or new skills development. Typically, as we age, our learning ability diminishes, making it more difficult to learn new skills or languages effectively. However, using this ingredient, it may be possible to revert to a more porous state of learning, allowing adults to learn at a faster rate. Although Valproic acid has some side effects which need to be controlled, Dr. Steinberg is optimistic about its application. He believes that a small dose of the drug could be a game-changer for those looking to learn new things later in life. Dr. Steinberg's study is highly significant as the aging population continues to grow, and many adults find themselves looking to learn new skills later in their lives. Enhancing the brain's learning ability could be a vital factor in preventing the cognitive decline that can occur with age. By making it easier for adults to learn new skills, such as a new language or new instruments, it could also help adults stay engaged and connected with others in their communities, which is essential for their well-being. The research also supports the idea that the brain is much more adaptable than we previously thought, and that it may be possible for some people to regain skills that they've lost through age or disease. In conclusion, Dr. Steinberg's research has demonstrated the power of Valproic acid in helping adults learn more efficiently. The promising results of the study indicate that it could be used to help adults learn new languages and new skills at a faster speed than is typical at a later stage in life. While further research is required, this study is a significant first step towards unlocking new possibilities for lifelong learning.
