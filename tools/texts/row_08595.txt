article: Breona Moore, 22, who was sent to prison in April for impersonating a nurse and abducting a newborn from Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh has died from natural causes . A western Pennsylvania woman who was sent to prison for impersonating a nurse and abducting a newborn from a Pittsburgh hospital has died. Twenty-two-year-old Breona Moore of East McKeesport died late last week at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, officials said. Montour County Coroner Scott Lynn told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Moore died of natural causes. Moore was serving a 2 Â½- to-five-year sentence at Muncy state prison after pleading guilty in April to kidnapping a 3-day-old boy from Magee-Women's Hospital at UPMC. Moore, who was 5-foot-4 and 230 pounds, had told friends for weeks that she was pregnant, prosecutors said. On Aug. 23, 2012, dressed in hospital scrubs, Moore walked into the mother's hospital room and told her she was taking the baby for a medical test. Instead, she placed him in a handbag and carried him out of the hospital, prompting a frantic search for the missing child that lasted for several hours. Police found Moore holding the baby, who was not harmed, in a janitor's closet in a downtown office building. At her sentencing in June, Moore told the judge she became depressed after a doctor told her she would be unable to have children of her own. She apologized for her actions and to the baby's mother, even though she was not in the courtroom. 'I hope I will be as blessed as you some day,' Moore said. 'There are no words to say how remorseful I am.' In August 2012, dressed in hospital scrubs, Moore had walked into a mom's hospital room at Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh and told her she was taking the baby for a medical test .

chatgpt: Breona Moore, 22, who had been sentenced to prison for impersonating a nurse and kidnapping a newborn from Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh, has died last week from what the coroner has deemed 'natural causes.' The incident dates back to August 2012 when the accused, dressed in hospital scrubs, entered a new mother's room, claiming that she was taking the baby for a medical test. The baby was later found unharmed in a janitor's closet in a downtown office building, where Moore was also found holding the newborn. It had been a case that had received widespread attention and caused alarm to new parents who had to rely on the care and security provided by the hospital. Moore's trial had found her guilty of impersonating a nurse, kidnapping, and trespassing, and was sentenced to prison in April. Following her death, the authorities have yet to release any details about the nature of the 'natural causes', leading to speculation and conspiracy theories. However, the medical examiner has confirmed that her death was not the result of any violence. One of the most concerning aspects of this case is how the accused was able to enter the hospital and gain access to the mother and newborn. While security measures have been in place in hospitals for decades, it is clear that these need to be reviewed and upgraded as necessary to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again.  The incident caused alarm among new parents, who trust hospital staff members to provide a safe and secure environment for their newborns. The case had raised questions about the nursing profession and highlighted the importance of proper credentials and background checks. While lucky that no harm was caused to the baby in this instance, it had the potential to escalate into something much more tragic. Despite the outcome, the tragedy for all involved is undoubtedly tragic. A young woman's life has been lost, and an innocent baby was put in harm's way. While the causes of her death are yet to be confirmed, it is still a stark reminder of the consequences of actions and the damage that can be done by impersonating a professional like a nurse. This case is a powerful reminder that we need to hold those who impersonate such positions accountable for their actions - and enforce stricter requirements for background checks and credentials for those working in hospitals.
