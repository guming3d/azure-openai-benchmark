chatgpt: The luxury car market has some exciting news for collectors and fans of the British royal family. A 1991 Bentley Turbo, previously owned by Prince Charles, is now up for auction in Ascot. The car, which was used by the Prince for several years, is expected to draw the attention of prospective buyers from all over the world. The Bentley Turbo has a unique history. It was first ordered by the Prince's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in 1990. The car was then passed on to Prince Charles a year later, and he used it extensively for several years. The vehicle boasts a powerful 6.75-liter V8 engine and features a number of luxury upgrades, including Connolly leather upholstery, a walnut dashboard, and a sunroof. Coys auctioneers, who are handling the sale of the car, expect it to fetch a significant sum at auction. While it is difficult to predict the exact amount, the car's provenance and historical significance are expected to attract high bidders. However, another vehicle that will be up for sale at the same auction is also expected to attract a lot of attention. It is a 1994 Audi owned by Princess Diana, which she used to drive her sons Prince William and Prince Harry around in. The car has been photographed multiple times with Princess Diana behind the wheel and is expected to fetch a handsome amount at auction as well. The Audi 80 Cabriolet features a 2.3 liter 5-cylinder engine and boasts a leather interior and walnut dashboard. It has 21,000 miles on the clock and is in pristine condition. The Princess purchased the car in 1994, at the height of her popularity, and it has since become a treasured item among collectors. According to a spokesperson for Coys, "We're thrilled to have both of these cars up for sale at the same auction. They offer a unique insight into the lives of two of Britain's most famous royals and will undoubtedly attract a lot of interest from collectors all over the world." The auction is set to take place on 29th June 2021 in Ascot, and both vehicles are available for viewing prior to purchase. It will be interesting to see what kind of bids these vehicles generate and who ends up becoming the lucky owners of these pieces of royal history.
