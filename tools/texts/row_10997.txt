article: By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . City fat cats have seen their wages soar to 180 times that of an average worker, a new report revealed today. On average the bosses of Britain's 100 biggest companies took home £4.7million last year - up from £4.1million the year before, according to the High Pay Centre. Ordinary workers, meanwhile, earned £26,884. The gap between bosses and workers has soared over the past 20 years - from just 60 times the average wage in the 1990s. Bosses of Britain's 100 biggest companies earned £4.7million last year - 180 times the average worker . The High Pay Centre today urged to take 'radical action' to close the gap, such as requiring firms to cap executive pay at a fixed multiple of their lowest paid employees. It said shareholders were still signing off soaring executive pay despite being given the power to vote them down at annual meetings. The think tank said trust in business was being damaged by the perception that an executive 'elite' were reaping all the rewards from economic growth. High Pay Centre director Deborah Hargreaves said: 'It's time to get serious about tackling the executive pay racket. The Government's tinkering won't bring about a proper change in the UK's pay culture. 'We need to build an economy where people are paid fair and sensible amounts of money for the work that they do and the incomes of the super-rich aren't racing away from everybody else. 'A maximum pay ratio would recognise the important principle that all workers should share in a company's success and that gaps between those at the top and low and middle earners cannot just get wider and wider.' The gap between City bosses and ordinary workers has soared over the past 20 years, the High Pay Committee said . While FTSE chiefs take home millions each year, ordinary families are sinking into debt. A report last week revealed how Southampton, Peterborough and Newcastle were the most indebted places in the country . A Business Department spokesman said: 'The Government has introduced comprehensive reforms to give shareholders more powers in order to restore the link between top pay and performance, which in recent years has become excessive and increasingly disconnected. 'We've seen chief executive pay increase substantially over the past three decades, with CEOs earning 139 times the average employee in 2011, up from 47 in 1998. It's only in the last few years that we're beginning to see more restraint applied.'

chatgpt: The bosses of FTSE 100 companies in the UK took home an average salary of £4.7 million last year, according to a report published by the High Pay Centre. This figure represents an increase of 11% from the previous year, and highlights the stark divergence between the pay of top executives and ordinary workers. The report also stated that the average salary in Britain in 2013 was just £26,884, highlighting the vast chasm between the working class and the upper echelons of the corporate world. This gap has steadily widened since the early 1990s, when the average CEO took home around 60 times the salary of the average worker. Today, that figure has ballooned to roughly 120 times. The High Pay Centre, an independent think tank that scrutinizes executive pay, has urged ministers to take "radical action" to address this widening pay gap. The report states that the issue of excessive executive pay is not only a matter of fairness, but also of economic sustainability. The concentration of wealth at the top of society has negative implications for social mobility, as well as for consumer demand and overall economic growth. Moreover, the High Pay Centre argues that the current system for setting executive pay has become too convoluted and opaque, and fails to accurately reward performance or incentivize long-term growth. Many CEOs receive large bonuses and stock awards that are tied to short-term targets, leading to a culture of "short-termism" that ultimately harms the company and its stakeholders. Critics argue that the current system is simply a reflection of the market forces at play, and that demanding a reduction in executive pay amounts to a form of interference in the free market. However, the High Pay Centre maintains that the market is not a neutral entity, and that it is shaped and influenced by government policies and social norms. The report presents several concrete proposals for addressing the issue of excessive executive pay. One suggestion is to introduce a maximum pay ratio, which would limit how much a CEO can earn in relation to the lowest-paid worker in the company. Another proposal is to give workers a greater say in setting executive pay, by including them on remuneration committees or holding binding votes on pay packages. While the report's proposals are likely to provoke debate and criticism, it is clear that the issue of executive pay is a thorny and complex one, with significant implications for the future of the economy and broader society. The High Pay Centre's call for radical action reflects a growing sense of frustration and anger among ordinary workers who feel that the system is rigged against them, and that the rewards of hard work and dedication are being funneled disproportionately to the elite few.
