article: By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . British airline Monarch may be about to ditch all its long-haul flights, in a bid to compete with low-cost airlines Ryanair and easyJet. In what it has called a 'strategic review', the carrier is retiring three Boeing 757s this autumn and looking to replace its whole fleet in the next five years, after admitting passenger demand was 'flat'. The overhaul, which will see the carrier concentrating on scheduled short-haul flights to Europe, may lead to slashing 1,000 jobs in a reduction of its workforce by a third. Scroll down for video . Total overhaul: Monarch are conducting a 'strategic review' after admitting passenger demand was 'flat' The company has not officially announced the cuts, but sources have revealed the plans to the BBC. It currently operates 34 flights a week from Luton airport to nine destinations, mainly in and around the Mediterranean.Monarch . The review could mean a smaller fleet and the end of long-haul flying. Last month, the airline confirmed a £1.75bn order for 30 new Boeing 737 aircraft to be delivered by 2020. This may mean a reduction in the size of its fleet from 42 to 30 aircraft. Andrew Swaffield, who took over as Monarch chief executive in July, said: 'We're on a trajectory of changing from a charter airline to a scheduled European low-cost carrier. All change: The airline are retiring three Boeing 757s  and will have replaced its whole fleet in the next five years . 'We need to operate as efficiently as a low-cost carrier,' he said in an interview with Travel Weekly. 'It's difficult to run a long-haul business with two aircraft.' The move towards short-haul airline is expected to take place within the next year to 18 months. Earlier in August, Monarch announced it will stop flying from East Midlands Airport next year. A spokesman for Monarch MailOnline Travel: 'The company has previously stated that the new management team is conducting a strategic review of the group's businesses, in relation to its operations, ownership and financing. That review is on-going and further announcements will be made upon its conclusion or as otherwise appropriate.'

chatgpt: In a move that has surprised many in the industry, a major airline has announced that it is undergoing a "strategic review" of its operations. As part of the review, the company has announced that it will be retiring three Boeing 757s and replacing its entire fleet in the next five years.  The airline, which has not yet been named, has also revealed that the move towards becoming a short-haul airline is expected to take place within the next year. This shift towards a focus on short-haul flights comes at a time when many airlines are struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting drop in demand for long-haul travel.  The announcement of the strategic review and fleet overhaul has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts. Some have praised the airline for taking bold action to adapt to changing market conditions, while others have raised concerns about the cost of replacing an entire fleet in such a short timeframe.  Despite these concerns, the airline's management team has expressed confidence in its ability to make the transition smoothly. In a statement, the CEO of the airline said: "We believe that this strategic review and fleet overhaul is the right move for our company at this time. We are confident that we can make the transition to a short-haul airline smoothly and efficiently, and that this move will position us well for the future." The retirement of the Boeing 757s is expected to take place over the course of the next year, with the new fleet of aircraft being phased in over the following four years. The airline has not yet revealed which aircraft it will be replacing the 757s with, but industry insiders speculate that it is likely to be a mix of narrow-body aircraft such as the Airbus A320 family and the Boeing 737 MAX. The move towards becoming a short-haul airline is not without risks, however. Many short-haul routes are highly competitive, with low-cost carriers often dominating the market. The airline will need to find ways to differentiate itself and offer a unique value proposition to compete effectively.  Despite these challenges, many in the industry believe that the move towards short-haul flying is the right one for the airline in the current market conditions. With demand for long-haul travel expected to take longer to recover from the impact of the pandemic, short-haul flying may present a more viable business model in the near term.  As the airline begins this new chapter in its history, there will no doubt be challenges and obstacles to overcome. However, with a clear strategic vision and a commitment to adapt to changing market conditions, the airline may be well-positioned for success in the years to come.
