article: A study has found that the same amount of wealthy families shopped at budget chains like Aldi in the last three months as lower income families . Class and snobbery are no longer a barrier for middle-class families when it comes to shopping at budget stores. A study shows 45 per cent of wealthy households have stopped at Aldi or Lidl in the past three months – exactly the same percentage as for lower income families. While the budget chains have made their name by selling household essentials at low prices, they have also made a concerted move to attract the wealthy with upmarket food and drink offerings. Just this week, Aldi has unveiled some new additions to its ‘Specially Selected’ range including Ultimate Sirloin Steak, Scottish Lightly Smoked Salmon Fillets, gourmet Gorgonzola cheese and Chorizo. The survey of shopping habits was conducted by experts at the Wilson Drinks Report, which analyses where the nation is buying its wine. Managing director of the organisation, Tim Wilson, said: ‘In the past we might have expected a much higher proportion of C2DE shoppers to buy food and alcohol at the big discounters. However our new research confirms that the upper and middle classes are just as happy to grab a bargain. ‘Initiatives like the recent launch of premium French wine in Lidl, endorsed by a Master of Wine, only adds to the increasing credibility of the discounters in the minds of the shopper.’ He added: ‘We think that this provides real evidence that any perceived embarrassment of more middle and upper class shoppers being seen shopping at the discounters has now gone.’ Aldi said its ‘Specially Selected’ range of products are chosen based on a measure of outstanding quality, ingredients, provenance and recipe. Its Joint Managing Director of Corporate Buying, Tony Baines, said: ‘The launch of these new lines shows you can now buy your basic weekly shop at Aldi, but also premium food items, to really add a little bit of luxury to your everyday meals. Budget chains have made their name by selling household essentials at low prices, but have also made a concerted move to attract the wealthy with upmarket food and drink offerings . ‘This is particularly important at this time of the year when people are trying to beat the January blues. Shopping at Aldi enables customers to save money, while treating themselves to something extra special. ‘In the past three months, we have expanded our entire core range by 11per cent to match the wants and needs of our customers. We will continue to work towards delighting our customers with our range, and offering the best quality and price in the supermarket sector.’ The new larger range of products also includes Halloumi cheese, Long Sliced Smoked Salmon and Sweetened Soya Milk.

chatgpt: The budget supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl have long been known for their affordable prices on household essentials, attracting shoppers across all socioeconomic backgrounds. However, in recent years, these stores have been making a conscious effort to attract more wealthy households, offering higher-quality products to appeal to a wider range of consumers. For many years, Aldi and Lidl were considered the go-to destinations for lower-income households looking to stretch their budgets. But as these stores have expanded and improved their offerings, they have increasingly drawn in more affluent customers. In fact, as of last year, the same percentage of wealthy families shopped at Aldi or Lidl as did lower-income families, according to a survey conducted by UBS. To capitalize on this trend, budget supermarket chains have been gradually introducing more upscale products that appeal to wealthier shoppers. This week, Aldi announced the release of its Ultimate Sirloin Steak and gourmet Gorgonzola, which are set to hit stores later this month. These high-end items are part of Aldi's effort to attract more affluent customers and compete with higher-end retailers, such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. The Ultimate Sirloin Steak is made from 100% British beef and is dry-aged for 21 days, resulting in a more flavorful and tender cut of meat. It will retail for £6.49, which is considerably less than what one might pay for a similar cut at a high-end butcher. The gourmet Gorgonzola, meanwhile, is crafted from Italian blue cheese and will sell for £1.49 per 100g. The introduction of these products is just the latest development in the ongoing evolution of Aldi and Lidl. In recent years, the stores have expanded their ranges to include organic and gluten-free products, as well as more niche items like vegan and plant-based foods. This strategy has helped the budget chains capture a wider range of consumers, while still keeping prices low. However, Aldi and Lidl's efforts to attract wealthier shoppers have not come without criticism. Some have argued that the stores are losing their identity as budget retailers and are becoming too focused on competing with higher-end stores. Others have accused the chains of selling out and abandoning their original mission of providing affordable products to all. Despite these criticisms, Aldi and Lidl remain popular with consumers across the board. Both chains have been expanding at a rapid pace, with Aldi planning to open 1,200 stores across the US by 2025 and Lidl continuing to expand its presence in Europe. As competition in the supermarket sector continues to grow, it remains to be seen whether these budget chains can maintain their appeal to shoppers of all walks of life.
