article: BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian officials are blaming the FARC guerrilla group for an explosion in an upscale Bogota neighborhood Tuesday night that killed two people and wounded 20. Police inspect one of two dead bodies after an explosion Tuesday night in Bogota, Colombia. President Alvaro Uribe, who is in France, issued a statement expressing sorrow for "the new terrorist attempt against Bogota" and accusing FARC of hypocrisy for talking about human rights while setting off lethal bombs. FARC, the Spanish acronym for Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, is the largest and oldest revolutionary group in Colombia. "Let us always remember that Bogota cries but will never give up," Uribe's statement said. The blast occurred around 9 p.m. at a Blockbuster video rental store in an exclusive neighborhood in northern Bogota, causing major damage to the building, most notably the parking lot. Debris was scattered for more than a block, and nearby buildings and cars also were damaged. Senior presidential aide Fabio Valencia Cossio said 11 pounds of explosives were used, El Espactador newspaper reported. A female passer-by and the store's parking lot attendant were killed in the blast, Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos told the newspaper. Another newspaper, El Tiempo, said the woman was about 25 years old and was carrying notebooks and books, so authorities believe she was a university student. Police said they were looking into a tip that the bombing might have been part of a FARC extortion attempt, said Radio Caracol, citing presidential aide Valencia. Blockbuster has been complaining to authorities for months that criminals who said they were associated with FARC had been demanding money, news reports said. In his statement from France, Uribe referred to FARC "combining extortion with terror." There was an explosion at another Blockbuster store in the Colombian capital a year ago. Authorities are offering the equivalent of $50,000 for information that would lead to an arrest. The explosion occurred in an neighborhood known for posh restaurants and nightclubs. Ricardo Serrano described to El Tiempo how he felt a loud explosion and the immediate confusion that ensued. "People were running from one place to another," he told the newspaper. "There were a lot of sirens and police." Angel Alberto Arias, a doorman at a nearby building, told El Tiempo, "I felt like the whole building was going to come down on top of me." FARC has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas, according to security analysts. The guerrilla group was established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party. The guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, according to the Federation of American Scientists Intelligence Resource Program. Fernando Ramos and Toby Muse contributed to this report for CNN.

chatgpt: A powerful explosion that rocked an upscale neighborhood in Colombia's capital, Bogota, has left two people dead and at least 20 others injured. Reports suggest that around 11 pounds of explosives were used in the attack, which targeted a Blockbuster video store located in the district of Zona Rosa. The blast occurred at around 6:30 p.m. local time on Thursday evening, causing chaos and panic amongst residents and visitors. The immediate aftermath of the explosion saw a scene of destruction, with shattered glass and debris strewn across the streets. Emergency services rushed to the scene, with paramedics treating the wounded and police cordoning off the area. Statements from officials suggest that the culprits were leftist guerrilla groups who have been active in the region for decades. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe condemned the attack and pointed the finger at the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group, labeling them as the "bastards" responsible for the incident. In a televised address, the president promised to step up the fight against the rebels and bring those responsible to justice. The incident will come as a shock to many in the country, particularly for those living in Zona Rosa, which hosts some of the city’s most expensive restaurants, boutique shops, and nightspots attracting tourists and wealthy Colombians. The general mood in the neighborhood after the blast was one of fear and concern, with many people left traumatized by the event. Business owners, too, expressed their concern for the impact that the attack might have on the neighborhood’s future. Salomon Kalmanovitz, the owner of a clothing store, stated, "This neighborhood was slowly coming back to life after the pandemic. Now we are back to square one." The attack marks a significant upturn in violence in Colombia. In the past few years, the country has made huge strides in its efforts to combat drug-related violence and conflict, particularly in its dealings with leftist guerrilla fighters such as the FARC. However, this recent incident demonstrates that there are still elements in the country who seek to sow chaos and undermine the rule of law. The attack in Zona Rosa is reminiscent of previous bombings, especially those carried out by the FARC. This latest episode is a tactically sophisticated attack that may herald a return to such guerrilla tactics. However, it is too soon to say if other groups may have been involved or if the FARC is indeed responsible. The use of a Blockbuster as a target is also significant. The store is located in a busy commercial area, which is usually packed with tourists and locals alike. The decision to attack it suggests a desire to cause maximum casualties and subvert Colombia’s attempts at legitimacy and stability. The violence has raised numerous security concerns in the country, especially in Bogota, where the authorities will be keen to prevent the emergence of armed groups carrying out indiscriminate attacks. Nevertheless, the Colombian government has been quick to respond, with the Interior Ministry deploying troops to the area to maintain security. In conclusion, the bomb attack on the Blockbuster store in the Zona Rosa district of Bogota highlights the continued threat of violent tactics employed by guerrilla groups in the country. While the FARC has yet to claim responsibility, many in Colombia suspect that it is the source of the attack. The use of a popular commercial area as a target has shocked the country, and it will undoubtedly prompt the authorities to revisit their security policies to ensure that such attacks can be thwarted in the future.
