article: Most of us are all too familiar with the rage that ensues when fiddly plastic tags defy all attempts to remove them. But Marks and Spencer has come up with a solution in the shape of a new set of easy-open ties - that will be launched just in time for Christmas. The brainchild of the team at Design Futures, which is based at Sheffield Hallam University, PaperTies are made from recyclable paper and lock the product in place. Impossible: Many of us will be all too familiar with the challenges involved in prising toys from their boxes . Like the traditional plastic variety, they keep toys secured in their box but can be torn away with ease - finally eliminating packaging rage. The new design is part of the British high street brand's bid to boost its eco credentials, with the company hoping to become the world's most sustainable major retailer by 2020. As a result of innovations already in place, the company has already reduced by two billion the number of plastic bags it uses and sends zero waste to landfill. M&S has also become the first retailer to receive the triple award of certification for achievements in carbon, water and waste reduction from the Carbon Trust. But while the company's green plans are good news for the environment, for customers, getting rid of irritating plastic ties is set to prove the icing on the cake. The ties, which use a stronger, more flexible version of regular paper, have already been rolled out in the toy department, and will later be used across several product ranges. New and improved: M&S toys such as this Butterfly Rattle are now held in place with easy-open paper ties . Ever hopeful: With Christmas on the way, M&S hope the new packaging will come in handy for parents . Speaking about the new look packaging, Alex Hill, Senior Packaging Technologist, General Merchandise, at M&S said: 'Getting toys out of their packaging can be a big frustration for consumers and we have been working really hard over the last 18 months to find a solution. 'The PaperTies are designed to be as effective as plastic or metal ties, but can be torn easily - no more accidents trying to cut plastic and wire ties on Christmas Day, and no more frustrated children waiting to play with their new toy.' 'Our design team devised the initial concept for the ties as a direct response to the frustration caused by hard to open toy packaging,' added John Kirkby, creative director at Design Futures. 'We identified a new paper material that is very strong and used it to create a user focused way of holding products in packs. 'Not only is the product much easier to open but the material is better for the environment. It is very exciting to see the team at M&S develop our initial idea and take it to market.'

chatgpt: Marks & Spencer (M&S) has taken a step towards sustainability by introducing PaperTies across its toy department. In a bid to reduce plastic waste, the retailer has replaced the traditional plastic ties with PaperTies, which are easy to open and made from recyclable materials. As the festive season approaches, M&S has made this move to provide a sustainable shopping experience to its customers. The PaperTies are a result of a collaboration with Design Futures at Sheffield Hallam University, who designed them for M&S. The introduction of PaperTies is a significant move towards the retailer's commitment to reducing its environmental impact. The change will mean that M&S no longer uses approximately 120,000 plastic ties per year in its toy department, leading to a significant reduction of waste. Speaking about this move, Mark Sumner, Sustainable Business Consultant at M&S, said, "We're constantly looking for ways to reduce our environmental impact as a business, and the introduction of PaperTies is just one of the many steps we're taking to ensure that we're doing our bit for the planet." He further added, "We're committed to making a real difference through innovation and collaboration, and our partnership with Design Futures at Sheffield Hallam University is a testament to that. We're incredibly proud to be bringing this initiative to our customers and continuing our journey towards a more sustainable future." The PaperTies are just one of the many sustainable initiatives undertaken by M&S over the years. The retailer has committed to ensuring that 100% of its packaging is recyclable by 2022 and has already introduced several sustainable alternatives such as plastic-free packaging for its fruit and vegetables. M&S is also encouraging its customers to shop sustainably by providing them with alternative packaging options, such as reusable bags, when they visit their stores. The move towards sustainability has become a top priority for retailers in recent years, and M&S is leading the way. The fashion industry, in particular, has been under scrutiny for its environmental impact and M&S has taken the lead in introducing sustainable alternatives, including clothing made from recycled plastics. The introduction of PaperTies is another step towards M&S's sustainability goals, and the retailer hopes to inspire other industry leaders to follow suit. The PaperTies are expected to be rolled out across other departments in M&S soon, and the retailer hopes to reduce its environmental impact even further. As the festive season approaches, M&S is encouraging its customers to shop sustainably and choose environmentally friendly alternatives. In conclusion, M&S's commitment to sustainability is a welcome move towards a more environmentally conscious future. The introduction of PaperTies in its toy department is a significant step towards reducing the retailer's impact on the environment. The move is expected to inspire other retailers to introduce sustainable alternatives and make a real difference to the planet.
