article: (CNN) -- Federal investigators are looking into whether stowaways are tucked inside a shipping container aboard a vessel docked at a Newark, New Jersey, seaport. During a routine security check, a Coast Guard boarding team heard sounds coming from inside the container, prompting the investigation, according to Coast Guard spokeswoman Lt j.g. Fannie Wilks. "There is no way to know exactly what is inside because we have not opened it yet, but we can knock on the container and hear someone knock back," she said. "Thus it is our understanding that there is at least one person in the container." The Cyprus-flagged cargo ship -- which maintains about 2,000 containers -- last docked in Egypt, and had made a stop in Pakistan after originating in India, officials said. "U.S. Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers and agents are currently investigating allegations of stowaways," said Anthony L. Bucci, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Inspectors first checked the ship around 3 a.m. Wednesday. Just prior to docking, the inspectors tapped on the bulkhead and heard something, said Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe. They "tapped twice" and got "two taps back," he said. "Tapped 3 times" and got "three taps back," Rowe added, a process done periodically over several hours as they investigated. But inspectors haven't heard the suspicious tapping since the ship docked at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. The vessel -- which is named the Ville D' Aquarius and managed by Global Ship Lease Services Limited -- is not loaded with dangerous cargo, and the container in question is underneath several other containers, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Michelle Krupa. The operating transportation company is working closely with U.S. officials as they investigate the situation, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesman for CMA-CGM, a French-based firm considered the world's third largest container shipping company.

chatgpt: The U.S. Coast Guard has announced that there may be stowaways inside a shipping container at the port of Newark, New Jersey. The container is reportedly on a ship that is being operated by a well-known shipping company which is in close communication with U.S. officials. A spokesperson for the company has assured the public that they are working closely with authorities to resolve the situation. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has launched an investigation into the matter. The department is taking the potential threat very seriously, and have taken measures to increase security at the port. The shipping company has also stated that they are fully committed to ensuring the safety of their crew and preventing any unauthorized access to their vessels. Stowaways are individuals who illegally board a vessel with the intention of hiding away and potentially avoiding detection. They face many dangers on board including lack of access to food, water, and sanitary facilities. They also pose a major security risk as their intentions are often unknown and they may pose a threat to the crew and cargo. The discovery of potential stowaways highlights the need for increased security measures at ports and the importance of proper screening procedures. It also underscores the need for strong cooperation between shipping companies and government agencies to identify and prevent potential security threats. With this in mind, the port of Newark and other ports across the country are expected to strengthen their security measures in the coming months. The safety and security of our ports is crucial to the economic and national security of the United States. The Department of Homeland Security will continue to work closely with shipping companies and other agencies to identify and prevent any potential threats to our ports, our economy, and our country as a whole. As the investigation into this incident continues, the Coast Guard has urged anyone with information related to the potential stowaways to come forward. The public is reminded that reporting any suspicious activity can help prevent security threats and save lives.
