article: (CNN) -- NASA put its newest Landsat satellite into orbit on Monday, extending a long-running program that has been beaming back dramatic images of Earth for more than 40 years. The Landsat Data Continuity Mission -- to be designated Landsat 8, once it's up and running -- lifted off from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base atop an Atlas V booster. The $855 million platform, about the size of a sport-utility vehicle, has been in the works for years amid concerns about maintaining the U.S. suite of geoscience satellites. The first Landsat mission went into orbit in 1972; the last working mission, Landsat 7, was launched in 1999. It's still sending back images long after its five-year life expectancy, but suffers from a scanner problem that leaves black diagonal streaks across them. Landsat 5 sent back its last images in January after nearly 29 years; it had been designed to last three. The new mission's solar panels deployed successfully after Monday's launch, and the satellite should be fully operational after about three months of trials, NASA said. "Everyone's very relieved. We've got good telemetry coming back from LDCM, so all is well so far," Dunn told NASA TV. In 2012, the National Academy of Sciences warned that a combination of budget pressure, program delays and a pair of launch failures in 2009 and 2011 left the United States facing a "rapid decline" in its capability to monitor land and seas from space. An asteroid is coming, but don't sweat it . The Landsat program is managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, which has been distributing the data for free since 2008. The imagery has been used to monitor urban growth, water use, farm production and a variety of natural disasters, from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens to the historic earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011. "Landsat is a centerpiece of NASA's Earth Science program, and today's successful launch will extend the longest continuous data record of Earth's surface as seen from space," NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement.

chatgpt: On Monday, the Landsat 8 satellite officially went into orbit. This satellite is the newest in a series that has been collecting and sending back valuable data since 1972. The Landsat program, run by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has been instrumental in providing researchers, governments, and the public with critical data on land use and environmental changes for almost half a century. The Landsat data is an essential tool for a wide range of uses, including tracking deforestation, urbanization, agricultural growth, and natural disasters, among others. The imagery provided by the Landsat satellites has been vital for researchers and decision-makers to monitor changes to the Earth's land use, assess the impacts of climate change and natural disasters, and plan for the future. Without this data, we would be missing critical information on how the planet is changing. What makes the Landsat program unique is that the USGS distributes the imagery for free. This approach means that the data is available for researchers, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and the public, which has helped to democratize access to critical information on the Earth's land use. Furthermore, the ability to access the data for free has opened the door for more collaboration among different actors, which allows for collective solutions to environmental and societal challenges. The Landsat 8 satellite is a significant improvement over its predecessors. It has an advanced sensor that is capable of providing far more detailed and accurate images of the Earth. The resolution of the imagery is so precise that it can distinguish objects as small as 15 meters across. Additionally, the Landsat 8 satellite can scan the entire planet in just 16 days, making it more efficient and faster than previous Landsat satellites. Overall, the launch of the Landsat 8 satellite is excellent news for those who rely on the valuable data the program provides. As climate change continues to have a profound impact on the environment and our lives, having accurate and timely data on land use is essential for making informed decisions. With the Landsat program, we have a tool that can help us to understand the changes happening on our planet and work towards solutions.
