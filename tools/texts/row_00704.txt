Experts have warned that Europe faces a sustained outbreak of dengue fever – the worst in almost 100 years. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said yesterday that the continent is experiencing its first sustained transmission of dengue fever, which is carried by mosquitoes, since the 1920s. Six Britons have been confirmed as suffering from the disease after contracting it on the holiday island of Madeira. Infection: More than 1,300 people infected have been with the mosquito-borne disease in the Portuguese island of Madeira . A further 19 cases have been found elsewhere in Europe among travellers returning from the island. Since the outbreak began in early October, 1,357 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Madeira, including 669 laboratory-confirmed cases and 688 probable cases. Eighty-nine people have received hospital treatment but there have been no deaths so far. Dengue, caused by a bite from a mosquito infected with the virus, can cause symptoms from mild flu-like illnesses to more serious problems such as bone pain.

Dr Dipti Patel, joint director of the National Travel Health Network and Centre, said: ‘Anyone who develops a fever or flu-like symptoms within two weeks of returning from a trip to Madeira should seek medical advice.’

chatgpt: Over the past few months, the Portuguese island of Madeira has been grappling with a significant outbreak of dengue fever. According to the latest reports, over 1,300 people have been infected with the mosquito-borne virus on the island since early October. While the outbreak has led to hospital treatment for 89 people, there have thankfully been no fatalities reported so far. Dengue fever is caused by a bite from a mosquito that is infected with the virus, which then transmits the infection to humans. Symptoms of the illness can range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe and potentially lethal hemorrhagic fever. Local health authorities on the island have been working hard to contain the outbreak and provide the necessary care and treatment to those affected. They have implemented a range of measures to control the mosquito population, including fumigation and public education campaigns to help reduce the risk of further infections. In addition to this, health officials have urged people on the island to take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites, such as using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing. Despite the efforts of the authorities, however, the outbreak continues to spread, with new cases being reported on a daily basis. This has raised concerns among local residents, particularly as the island is popular among tourists, and there are fears that the outbreak could impact the island's tourism industry. To address these concerns, the authorities have stated that they are doing everything possible to contain the outbreak and minimize its impact on the local economy. They have also stressed that while the risk of infection remains, it can be significantly reduced by taking the necessary precautions. Despite the challenges posed by the outbreak, many on the island remain hopeful that the situation can be brought under control. They believe that with continued vigilance and a concerted effort from all those involved, the outbreak can be contained and the island can once again return to a state of normalcy. In the meantime, health officials have urged people to remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes on the island. By working together, they believe that the outbreak can be successfully contained, and the people of Madeira can get back to their normal lives without any further interruptions.
