article: (CNN) -- A Michigan man could face life in prison after he allegedly tortured and ultimately killed his girlfriend's 4-year-old son last week for wetting his pants, prosecutors say. Brandon Joshua-Frederick Hayes, 24, "systematically beat" Dominick Calhoun, 4, "pummeling [him] with fists and kicking him" on his arms, legs and genitalia, Genesee County prosecutor David Leyton told CNN. Hayes also apparently burned the boy in the course of the torture. "The knuckles across one hand were charred," Argentine Township police chief Dan Allen said. "I've been doing this a long time, and this is the worst case of child abuse I've ever seen," the police chief said. "In all respects, he was tortured." Prosecutors arraigned Hayes on Thursday on nine charges, including one count of first-degree premeditated murder, one count of first-degree child abuse and one count of torture, which by itself carries a possible life sentence. "Little Dominick met his boogeyman, and that was defendant Hayes," Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said at a news conference Thursday. CNN was unable to reach someone who could speak on Hayes' behalf. Hayes' motivation for his savage multiday attack on the boy was that the child "had wet his pants," Leyton said. "It had happened before." Hayes also resented the child because his "biological father wouldn't pay child support," Leyton said. Dominick's mother, Corrine Baker, was present for at least some of the beating and tried to shield the boy from Hayes' aggression, authorities said. "She tried to lay on top of the child to guard the child against being beat any further, but she was beat in the process," according to the police chief. The sequence of events that led to the discovery of the abuse began when Baker's sister and several acquaintances came to the apartment to buy drugs from Hayes, according to Allen. After seeing Dominick's condition, the sister alerted the boy's paternal grandfather, who in turn contacted authorities. When emergency responders entered the apartment on the afternoon of April 11, Dominick was "barely alive." EMS transferred him to Hurley Hospital in Flint, where he was pronounced brain dead. The boy was taken off life support the following morning. Dominick's mother's whereabouts and actions through all portions of the torture session remain somewhat hazy. The county prosecutor said his office is "still investigating her involvement in all this." "She's also culpable for putting him in the dangerous position in the first place," he added. Baker was taken into custody on Sunday but released later. Attempts to reach her at her home Thursday evening were unsuccessful. The town police chief said Baker and her son had been brought to the attention of Genesee County Department of Child Services on several occasions. The agency did not respond to CNN's requests for comment Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether Baker's involvement with the child services agency predated her relationship with Hayes. The police chief said he believed Baker and Hayes had been together for about six months.

chatgpt: Brandon Joshua-Frederick Hayes, 24, has been arraigned on nine charges, including first-degree premeditated murder, first-degree child abuse, and torture. The charges stem from the horrific death of 4-year-old Dominick Calhoun in Genesee County, Michigan. Police Chief David Dicks described the case as one of the worst he has seen in his 36-year career. "In all respects, he was tortured," Dicks said of Dominick during a press conference on Wednesday. "There is no way around it." The young boy was found beaten and unresponsive in his mother's apartment on April 11. He was rushed to the hospital, where he died a few days later from his injuries. Hayes, who was dating Dominick's mother, Corrine Baker, at the time of the incident, was arrested shortly after the boy's death. Police say he was the primary abuser and responsible for the horrific injuries Dominick suffered. The charges against Hayes include first-degree premeditated murder, first-degree child abuse, torture, and other related charges. During the arraignment on Tuesday, Hayes appeared in court via video conference from the Genesee County Jail. He was held without bond and did not enter a plea. His next court date is scheduled for May 4. Meanwhile, police are still investigating the role of Dominick's mother, Corrine Baker, in the case. Baker, 26, has not been charged in connection with the boy's death, but police say she may have played a role in the abuse he suffered. Baker was initially charged with second-degree child abuse and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Dominick's death has sparked outrage in the community and beyond. A candlelight vigil was held in his honor on Tuesday evening, and a GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family with funeral expenses. "This is a heartbreaking tragedy that has left a young boy dead and a family devastated," said Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton. "We will do everything in our power to hold those responsible accountable for their actions." The case has also raised questions about child protection services in Michigan. According to a report from the Detroit Free Press, Michigan's child protection system has been plagued by funding cuts, staff shortages, and other problems in recent years. The state ranks among the worst in the nation for child welfare, with nearly 15,000 children in foster care. "We need to do better for our children, and we need to do it now," said Genesee County Commissioner Ellen Ellenburg. "No child should have to suffer like this." As the investigation continues, the community is mourning the loss of a young life that was taken too soon. Dominick's family has asked for privacy during this difficult time. "We are devastated by the loss of our little boy," the family said in a statement. "Dominick was a happy and loving child who brought joy to everyone he met. We will never forget him, and we will always love him."
