His daughter daughter Carla is one of them. Hypertrichosis (also called Ambras syndrome) is an abnormal amount of hair growth on the body. Extensive cases of hypertrichosis have informally been called 'Werewolf Syndrome'. Hypertrichosis can be either present at birth or acquired later in life. Several circus sideshow performers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Julia Pastrana, had hypertrichosis. Many of them worked as freaks and were promoted as having distinct human and animal traits. The first recorded case of hypertrichosis was Petrus Gonsalvus of the Canary Islands in 1648. Two daughters, a son, and a grandchild in Gonzales' family all had the condition. The Wolf Man will appear alongside Garry Stretch and his record-breaking elastic skin . Macabre: The Circus of Horrors is a self-proclaimed freak show. But does it bring back memories of the fairground tradition in which crowds once flocked to gawp at victims of deformities?
