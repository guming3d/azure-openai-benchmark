article: Sharknado, a spoof movie about sharks on a killing spree on land, became a surprise blockbuster hit last year. But life imitated art (to an extent) when a church group witnessed more than 100 sharks risk beaching themselves in a shoreline attack last week. Members of One Harbor Church filmed the feeding frenzy on the beach at Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. Feeding frenzy: Over 100 sharks are seen feeding on a school of fish close to shore in North Carolina last week . The sharks came dangerously close to becoming stuck on land in order to feast on a school of blue fish in the shallow surf. The video was shot by Donnie Griggs, who stumbled upon the scene as his church group fished for their evening meal for a camp retreat at noon last Thursday. His friend Brian Recker uploaded the clip to Facebook and YouTube, the latter attracting over 87,000 views in just two days. Too close for comfort: The sharks came dangerously close to becoming beached during their meal . Plenty for everyone: Seagulls and pelicans joined in on the feeding frenzy, which lasted five minutes . Recker wrote on Facebook: 'Donnie Griggs shot this amazing video of the SHARKNADO we saw at Cape Lookout! Not sure what kind exactly they were, but there were over 100 in a feeding frenzy.' 'The men were out fishing for the evening’s dinner when they stumbled across more than 100 sharks attacking a school of blue fish,' Recker added on YouTube. 'As seagulls and pelicans joined in on the meal, the men began to cast into the surf, catching fish without the use of bait. 'For more than five minutes, the sharks were observed swimming in and out of the surf, some of which became beached in the fury. Life imitates art? Satire movie Sharknado was a surprise hit last year . 'Donnie Griggs, the cameraman who captured the footage, is an avid waterman who spearfishes, dives, swims and surfs at Cape Lookout often. Recker said that despite the furious sharks, he believes Cape Lookout to be safe for swimmers, adding that 'the presence of these sharks and large schools of fish is actually a sign of a very healthy ecosystem'. Some commenters on YouTube expressed concern that sharks coming so close to shore to feed is a sign of humans over-fishing in the ocean. Popular beach: Cape Lookout National Seashore is located near the Crystal Coast of North Carolina . Sharknado is a made-for-television film starring Tara Reid and Beverly Hills 90210 star Ian Ziering that became a cult hit when it aired last July on the Syfy channel. The disaster movie satire sees a tornado lift sharks out of the ocean and spitting them out across Los Angeles, where they wreak havoc. It was such a surprise hit that  a sequel was made, Sharknado 2: The Second One, which premiered on July 30. A third film is slated for 2015.

chatgpt: Last week, visitors at Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina were startled by an unexpected attack. While enjoying a camping retreat, members of One Harbor Church were shocked to witness a swarm of sharks circling the waters nearby. Despite being a frightening spectacle, the group managed to capture the entire incident on film. The video quickly went viral, attracting over 87,000 views on YouTube in just two days. The video was filmed by churchgoers who were taking part in a weekend retreat at the National Seashore. During their time there, they decided to take a break from their activities and visit the nearby beach. It was there that they spotted a group of sharks swimming close to the shore. Initially, the group was thrilled to witness such a rare sight. However, their excitement soon turned into fear when they noticed that the sharks were slowly closing in on them. Thankfully, everyone managed to stay out of the water and there were no injuries reported. In a statement following the incident, representatives from One Harbor Church said, "We are grateful for the opportunity to have witnessed such a spectacular event in nature. We are also thankful that everyone in the group was safe and unharmed." Despite the potential danger, the churchgoers decided to continue filming the sharks from a safe distance. They managed to capture footage of the sharks circling the waters and even managed to get some up-close shots. The video has since gone viral, attracting over 87,000 views on YouTube in just two days. The incident has sparked a great deal of interest online, with many calling for greater awareness about the potential dangers of shark attacks. According to experts, shark attacks are relatively rare and most people who swim in the ocean are unlikely to encounter one. However, incidents like the one at Cape Lookout National Seashore serve as a stark reminder of the importance of staying alert and staying safe when in the water. In response to the incident, the National Park Service has issued a statement reminding visitors to exercise caution when swimming in the ocean, especially in areas known for shark activity. They also reiterated the importance of obeying posted signs and warnings, and of keeping a safe distance from any marine wildlife. For the members of One Harbor Church, the experience was a thrilling and unforgettable one. While it may have been slightly nerve-wracking at the time, the group managed to turn the incident into a powerful learning experience. They now hope that the viral video will inspire others to appreciate the wonders of nature while also staying safe in the process.
