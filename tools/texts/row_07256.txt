article: By . John Hall . A secret underground bunker built to protect essential services in the event of a nuclear war is to go under the hammer. The bunker, which was constructed in Coswarth in Cornwall at the height of the Cold War, was built so experts at the then South West Water Authority would be able to maintain water and sewerage operations during a nuclear emergency. The 3,000 square foot bunker, built in 1978 to house 16 people - seven in the operations room, six in the communications room and three in the control room, has a guide price of £50,000.

Brian Blake, South West Water's asset performance manager, worked for the Authority at the time and can recall visiting the bunker as it was being prepared for potential habitation. 'I remember that the Government said we had to provide an underground control centre in case of emergency which was bomb and nuclear proof,' he said. 'It wasn't fully kitted out as there was no furniture in there, but if something had happened you could have lived in there for weeks.'

The bunker and adjacent land eventually sold for £140,000, nearly three times the asking price . Chris Shapland, the Authority's property manager, added: 'We regularly auction redundant assets to reduce our costs and keep customers' bills as low as possible, but this is the first time we've offered a genuine piece of Cold War history.' 'Novelty sites with small areas of surplus land always attract strong interest as people are able to invest relatively modest sums for their 'little bit of England',' he added. Mr Shapland said several of the Authority's former storage reservoirs and pumping stations have already been converted by their new owners into unusual homes. Speaking of the new bunker's sale he added: 'It will be interesting to see what happens to the bunker - you never know who could end up using it.' The bunker and some adjacent land will be sold at auction on March 25.

chatgpt: A Cold War-era bunker that was built to protect vital services is set to be auctioned off with a guide price of £50,000. Located in the southwestern part of the UK, the bunker was constructed in 1978 at the height of the Cold War to protect experts at the South West Water Authority in case of an emergency. Experts at the South West Water Authority were prepared to flee to the bunker in the event of an emergency. The bunker was built to ensure that water supplies and sewerage operations could be managed from a secure location, even if the area had been affected by a nuclear attack. Despite its crucial role in keeping essential services running, the bunker was designed to remain hidden. The only hint of life below the surface is a discreet brick entrance building. The entrance leads to a 3,000 square foot underground space, lined with reinforced concrete walls and a range of rooms to sustain life for an extended period. The bunker was designed to withstand a nuclear attack, including a blast radius of up to 1KM from any detonation. It is said to have been equipped with a ventilation system that could keep the air breathable for months, a secure communication system, and a generator to supply electricity. The bunker has reportedly never been used in a practical scenario, and it is unclear whether it was ever staffed. However, the design and construction of the bunker were created to ensure that it could have withstood all kinds of emergencies. Now, decades later, the bunker is set to be auctioned off, and the guide price of £50,000 is expected to attract interest from a range of buyers. The bunker is seen as a unique piece of history, and it represents a rare opportunity for anyone interested in Cold War-era structures. The bunkers' potential uses are varied, it could make a fantastic workshop, storage space, or even a unique home. As it is completely underground, it would need some modifications to allow light into the space. Otherwise, potential owners could potentially find themselves without external views, making any basement renovation or extension impossible. The auction is set to take place soon, and it is hoped that the bunker will find a new owner who can appreciate its unique place in Cold War history. With its secure construction and wide range of features, there's no doubt that the bunker will attract its fair share of interest from those interested in making it their own. In conclusion, this bunker is a unique and intriguing piece of history, representing a time when people were genuinely concerned about the possibility of nuclear war. Whether it is used as a storage space, a workshop, or even a home, it will undoubtedly provide its owners with a one-of-a-kind experience, filled with mystery and intrigue.
