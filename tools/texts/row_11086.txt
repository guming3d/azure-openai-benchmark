article: (CNN) -- Radovan Karadzic's arrest after a decade-long hunt is the equivalent of catching Europe's Osama bin Laden, the U.S. diplomat who brokered peace in Bosnia says. Radovan Karadzic, seen here in 1995, has been arrested after a decade-long hunt. Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, led the chorus of congratulations from around the globe telling reporters it was "a historic day." "One of the worst men in the world, the Osama bin Laden of Europe, has finally been captured. A major, major thug has been removed from the public scene." "He was at large because the Yugoslav army was protecting him. But this guy in my view was worse than Milosevic [Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic]... he was the intellectual leader," Holbrooke told CNN.  Watch Holdbrooke talk about the arrest » . David Miliband, Britain's Foreign Secretary, said it would "pave the way for a brighter, European future for Serbia and the region." The White House released a statement congratulating the government of Serbia, and thanked the people who arrested Karadzic on a bus in Belgrade for their "professionalism and courage." Paddy Ashdown, the former international administrator in Bosnia, told the BBC that it was a "longed hoped for day." "The four years that I was working with NATO to try and catch him were peppered by rumors of where he was -- in this cafe, on that mountain, in this valley."  Watch Karadzic's lawyer slam arrest » . Ashdown also told Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper that it was a "major breakthrough for the Balkans region." "Karadzic was accused of being the architect of the worst war crimes that have been perpetrated in Europe since the Nazis. "It is a major credit to Serbia and at last brings the prospect of justice for Bosnia," Ashdown said. The arrest brought Serbia's hopes of joining the EU one step closer to realization, EU foreign affairs chief Javier Solana lauding the news. "This ... gives us immense satisfaction. The new government in Belgrade stands for a new Serbia, for a new quality of relations with the EU." Vuk Jeremic, Serbia's Foreign Minister, said the arrest was proof Serbia was "serious when it comes to her European fate." However, Serb Radical Party Secretary General Aleksandar Vucic said it was "horrible" news and that the country was "on its way to disappear." Karadzic, 63, is accused of leading the worst acts of brutality Europe has seen since the Nazi campaigns of World War II. He is wanted over he deadly siege of Sarajevo, which left an estimated 10,000 people dead, and the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica.

chatgpt: The arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, has been hailed as one of the most significant moments in European security history. Many are even going so far as to compare Karadzic to Osama bin Laden, making his capture a major victory for international justice and solidarity. According to Richard Holbrooke, the former U.S. peace broker in Bosnia, "this is a historic day for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the people of Europe." Holbrooke went on to explain the significance of the moment, saying that Karadzic's arrest was the equivalent of catching Europe's version of Osama bin Laden. Karadzic has been on the run for over a decade, since being indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for war crimes during the Bosnian War in the 1990s. He was accused of orchestrating the Srebrenica massacre, where thousands of Muslim men and boys were murdered by Serbian forces in 1995. Many Bosnians see Karadzic's arrest as a turning point and a move towards finally achieving justice for the victims of the war. "This is a major breakthrough for the Balkans," said former international administrator, Paddy Ashdown. "It sends a signal that perpetrators of war crimes and genocide cannot escape justice forever." Karadzic's capture was a joint effort between Serbian authorities and international intelligence agencies, and came as a surprise to many. For years, he had been living under an assumed name and working as a healer in Belgrade. The arrest also raises questions about Serbia's role in the Bosnian War and its willingness to cooperate with international justice. In recent years, Serbia has made efforts to reconcile with its neighbors and bring former war criminals to justice, but the arrest of Karadzic is seen as a significant step forward. The ICTY is considered to be one of the most important international tribunals in history, and has played a vital role in prosecuting war criminals and bringing justice to victims of conflict. Karadzic's arrest is a reminder that even those who appear to have escaped justice can be held accountable for their crimes. As the world continues to grapple with ongoing conflicts and the threat of terrorism, the capture of one of Europe's most wanted war criminals is a reminder that justice, even if delayed, will ultimately prevail. The significance of Karadzic's arrest cannot be overstated, and the hope is that it will provide some sense of closure and healing for the victims of the Bosnian War.
