Don't blame yourself for overdoing it next time you pour yourself an excessively large wine – it could be all down to the glass you’re using and whether you’re holding it. Researchers found drinkers unintentionally poured larger servings when their glasses were wider and when the pourers held them in their hands. They also found drinkers were more likely to pour out less red than white because of its deep contrasting colour to glass.

chatgpt: A team of researchers from Iowa State and Cornell Universities have found that the shape and color of a wine glass, as well as whether or not a person holds the glass, can influence how much they pour themselves. The study, published in the journal Substance Use & Misuse, examined the pouring habits of 73 drinkers in various scenarios. The researchers discovered that participants poured themselves 11.9% more wine into a wide glass than a narrow glass. They also found that when holding the glass while pouring, participants poured 12.2% more than when the glass was placed on a table. Interestingly, the study noted that the color of wine also played a role in how much was poured. Participants poured 9.2% more white wine than red wine. "For the most part, humans tend to consume alcohol for the psychoactive properties that it possesses," said Laura Smarandescu, an assistant professor of marketing at Iowa State and one of the authors of the study. "The glass serves as a cue or a reminder for how much they should be pouring or drinking." The findings of this study have important implications for public health. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to a variety of health problems, including liver disease, heart disease, and cancer. It's essential that consumers understand how subtle cues like the shape and color of a glass can influence their drinking habits. Smarandescu and her team suggest that by using narrower glasses and placing them on a table rather than holding them, people could better control their alcohol intake. "Understanding how these perceptual cues influence the amount of alcohol poured can help drinkers monitor and potentially reduce their alcohol consumption," said Doug Walker, a professor of marketing at Iowa State and a co-author of the study. The study also raises questions about the role of marketing in influencing drinking behavior. Wine glasses are often designed to be wider at the top to enhance the aroma and taste of the wine. However, this study suggests that such design features may also encourage people to pour more than they realize. Overall, the findings of this study offer a valuable insight into how environmental cues can influence our behavior. By being aware of these cues, we may be able to better control our alcohol consumption and improve our overall health.
