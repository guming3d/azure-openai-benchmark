article: (CNN) -- A group of passengers who were aboard an Asiana Airlines flight that crash-landed last summer has sued aircraft manufacturer Boeing, according to a lawsuit filed in an Illinois court. "We are asking for damages to be paid to the passengers and asking the court to hold Boeing partially liable," Monica Kelly, an attorney for Chicago-based Ribbeck Law Chartered, told CNN on Saturday. The personal injury lawsuit was filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court. Asiana crash video: Firefighters saw injured girl before she was run over .

The lawsuit alleges that some equipment on the plane was improperly installed or defective, resulting in inadequate warnings for the pilots about low airspeed. "Boeing was aware that its low airspeed warning system was inadequate," the suit states. More than 80 of the plane's 291 passengers are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

CNN reached out to Boeing for comment about the lawsuit. Company spokesman Doug Alder declined to comment. The passengers represented by Ribbeck Law began their court proceedings shortly after the crash, filing a petition for Boeing to release evidence to the plaintiffs. At the time, the law firm said it was considering adding Asiana and certain parts manufacturers to the lawsuit, but Friday's filing named only Boeing, Kelly said.

chatgpt: San Francisco - Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed on July 6, 2013, killing three people and injuring over 180 others. It was a tragic event that shocked not only the people of San Francisco but the whole world. The investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing and now, a law firm representing some of the plaintiffs is seeking to hold Boeing partly liable. According to reports, the law firm is claiming that the aircraft manufacturer was negligent in the design of the Boeing 777's autothrottle system. They believe that the system contributed to the crash and that Boeing should be held accountable for the damages caused. The autothrottle is a system that helps control the speed of the aircraft. It was said that during the final approach, the autothrottle system on the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was not functioning properly. Pilots were manually controlling the aircraft's speed, which can be extremely difficult and complicated. At the time of the crash, the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was carrying 291 passengers and 16 crew members. The flight originated from Shanghai and made a stop in Seoul before heading to San Francisco. As the aircraft was landing at San Francisco International Airport, it clipped the seawall, causing it to crash and catch fire. The crash was a traumatic event for all those involved, including the passengers, their families, and the crew. The survivors are still dealing with the physical and emotional scars of the accident, and the families of the victims are still grieving their loss. In response to the law firm's claims, Boeing has released a statement saying that they are cooperating fully with the investigation and that they remain committed to ensuring the safety of the traveling public. The investigation into the cause of the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash is ongoing, and only time will tell what the final outcome will be. However, the law firm's claims against Boeing highlight the importance of holding manufacturers accountable for the safety of their products. As the investigation continues, the hope is that something can be learned from this tragic event that will prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.
