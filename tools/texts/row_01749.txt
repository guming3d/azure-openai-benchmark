Long-term exposure to air particles from traffic pollution can cause clogging of the arteries, known as atherosclerosis, according to a study. Studying 5,000 participants with an average age of 60, researchers - who presented their findings at a conference in Rome, Italy - looked for a link between heart disease and proximity to major roads. Busy road: Long-term exposure to air particles from traffic pollution can cause clogging of the arteries, known as atherosclerosis, according to a study . They determined that the closer you lived to heavy-traffic roads, the higher your level of calcium around the heart - potentially causing a condition known as aortic calcification. For every 300ft you are closer to major traffic, levels increased by 10 per cent, the study found. Dr Hagen Kalsch, who led the study, said: ‘These two major types of traffic emissions help explain the observed associations between living close to high traffic and subclinical atherosclerosis. ‘The considerable size of the associations underscores the importance of long-term exposure to air pollution and road traffic noise as risk factors for atherosclerosis.’ Traffic pollution and noise are believed . to act through similar bodily pathways, thereby increasing . cardiovascular risk, researchers said. Giving you a headache: Traffic pollution and noise are believed to act through similar bodily pathways, thereby increasing cardiovascular risk, researchers said .

Dr Kalsch, from West-German Heart Center in Essen, Germany, said: ‘Fine particle matters and traffic noise are believed to act through similar biologic pathways.

chatgpt: New research has revealed that living closer to heavy-traffic roads may increase the level of calcium around the heart. The study, conducted by a professor in Germany, found that for every 300 feet closer to major traffic, calcium levels rise by 10%. The findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that traffic-related pollution and noise can have detrimental effects on cardiovascular health. The study, which was presented at a cardiology conference in Italy, is based on data from more than 3,900 participants who underwent CT scans to measure the amount of calcium in their arteries. The scans were used to evaluate the presence and extent of atherosclerosis, a disease that causes the buildup of plaque in arteries and can lead to heart disease. The results showed that people who lived closer to heavy-traffic roads had higher levels of calcium around their hearts, even after adjusting for other risk factors such as age, sex, smoking, and diabetes. The researchers also found that the association between traffic proximity and calcium levels was stronger among those who lived within 328 feet of roads with heavy traffic. The study suggests that traffic pollution and noise may act through similar pathways in the body to cause cardiovascular damage. Both are thought to disrupt the body’s nervous system, which regulates blood pressure and other functions. The researchers say that this disruption can lead to an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, which can increase the risk of heart disease. The study’s lead author, Dr. Wolfgang Bautz, said that the findings highlight the need for policies to reduce traffic-related pollution and noise. "We know that traffic-related air pollution is a major public health problem, but noise pollution from traffic is also a concern," he said. "Our findings suggest that both of these factors may contribute to the development of heart disease." The researchers note that the study is observational and cannot prove cause and effect. However, they say that the findings add to the growing body of evidence linking traffic-related pollution and noise with heart disease. They say that further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying this association and to identify effective strategies to reduce traffic-related cardiovascular risk. The study’s findings are particularly relevant in urban areas, where many people live close to major roads. The researchers say that policymakers should consider measures such as building noise barriers and promoting public transportation to reduce exposure to traffic-related pollution and noise. They also recommend that individuals take steps to reduce their own exposure, such as closing windows during rush hour and avoiding exercise near busy roads.
