chatgpt: Passengers on a ferry from the Shetland Islands to mainland Scotland were in for a surprise on their journey home. The car deck of the ferry was transformed into a lively scene of music and dancing as a full five-piece ceilidh band entertained passengers on board. The band had been returning from the popular Shetland Folk Festival, where they had performed to a keen and enthusiastic audience. But upon arriving on the ferry, they decided to continue the festivities, much to the delight of passengers who were eager to join in. As the band "piped up," weary travellers began to join in the dance one-by-one. Soon, the car deck was transformed into a wild and energetic ceilidh, with passengers of all ages joining in the fun. The band played a wide variety of traditional Scottish tunes, from the jigs and reels of the Highlands to the more somber ballads of the Lowlands. As they played, passengers clapped and stomped their feet, filling the air with the sound of the music. Many passengers remarked that the impromptu ceilidh had been the highlight of their journey. Some even said that it had made them forget their seasickness entirely. The ferry crew were reportedly also delighted by the musical entertainment, with one crew member commenting that it was the first time he had ever seen a ceilidh on the car deck of a ferry. Of course, such impromptu musical events are not entirely unheard of in Scotland, where the traditional music and dance of the country is still very much alive. But to experience such a lively ceilidh in the middle of a ferry journey was a rare and unforgettable treat for all on board. As the ferry approached the Scottish mainland, the band gradually wound down their performance, but not before they had played a final rousing tune, which had everyone clapping and cheering. Passengers left the ferry feeling more refreshed and energised than they had when they boarded, thanks to the unexpected and joyful entertainment provided by the ceilidh band. For those lucky enough to have been on board that day, the memory of the wild and energetic ceilidh on the car deck of the ferry will no doubt stay with them for a long time to come.
