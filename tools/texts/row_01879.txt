article: (CNN) -- Young Messiah, the "happiest baby in the world," according to his mother, is blissfully unaware that a judge ruled that his birth name promises to offend many in his Tennessee community. His mother, Jaleesa Martin, and father, Jawaan McCullough, who are not married, couldn't agree on a last name for their baby, now 7 months old. That's why they ended up in the courtroom of Child Support Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew. Ballew ruled last week that not only should little Messiah's last name be changed -- from Martin to McCullough -- but also that his first name should be changed. In her ruling, Ballew wrote: "'Messiah' is a title that is held only by Jesus Christ" and that naming him this "places an undue burden on him that as a human being, he cannot fulfill." Her ruling also noted the large Christian population in the Tennessee county where the child was born. Speaking to CNN affiliate WBIR, Ballew, wearing earrings in the shape of a cross, said this was the first time she had ordered a name change. Martin, whose family is Baptist, said there was no religious motivation behind her pick; rather she'd heard the name on one of her favorite TV shows and thought it'd be a good name for her son. She also wanted another "M" name to go with her other two sons, Mason and Micah. CNN could not reach McCullough for comment. Heartbroken and shocked, Martin told CNN Ballew gave the parents a one-hour recess to pick a new name and then issued the new name when she and the baby's father couldn't come up with one. The judge's pick: Martin DeShawn McCullough. Martin said that she'll keep calling her son Messiah and that she has heard from supporters all over the country. She's also upset about reports she is being attacked online as a bad mother. The Tennessee American Civil Liberties Union is following the case, saying it supports Martin and calling the judge's ruling unacceptable. "The bench is not a pulpit, and using it as one, as this judge did, violates the parents' rights and our sense that people of all faiths will be treated fairly in the courtroom," Executive Director Hedy Weinberg said. According to U.S. Social Security Administration statistics, Messiah was the fourth-fastest growing name for boys in the United States from 2011 to 2012. It ranks at Number 387, between the decidedly traditional names Scott and Jay. Ballew declined CNN's request for comment. Martin has appealed the court's decision; it will go before the Cocke County chancellor next month.

chatgpt: In an unusual court case in Tennessee, parents found themselves in a legal battle over what their newborn should be named. The disagreement between the couple began when they couldn't decide on what last name to give their baby. It eventually escalated to a courtroom where the judge raised objections over the baby's first name. The name in question was 'Messiah,' a title that holds significant religious significance. The judge stated that 'Messiah' is a name only befitting Jesus Christ, and it would be improper for the couple to name their child such.  This unexpected ruling left the stunned mother appealing the judge's ruling, saying that she did not anticipate such an event in court. She had chosen the name Messiah based on what she thought was the uniqueness and beauty of it. After the appeal was lodged, the mother received an outpouring of support from across the country, with many stating that they, too, had named their children after biblical characters. Some called the judge's decision an infringement of the couple's constitutional right to religious freedom and freedom of speech. The couple also argued that the judge's ruling would set a precedent that would violate the parents' right to name their child as they wish. They argued that the name is not blasphemous, and it was not intended as a religious statement; it was just a name they believed was beautiful. The Tennessee judge's ruling is not the first time that American courts have become embroiled in baby-naming cases. Often, parents can't agree on the name of their new child, and it can end up in the court system to decide. The judge's ruling against the name 'Messiah' has sparked a national conversation about baby-naming rights and religious freedom. It is not uncommon for parents to choose uncommon and unique names to bestow on their offspring. However, if it is considered inappropriate or offensive, it can lead to legal action. As the appeal process continues, it remains unclear whether the infant's name will change or not. The case will undoubtedly prompt a more comprehensive discussion on how far the state can dictate what parents can and cannot name their children. In conclusion, Josef Stalin once said: "The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic." However, in the case of baby Messiah, a simple choice of a name became a battleground for religious freedom and parental rights. While the case continues to play out in the courts, the precedent set by this case will shape how similar cases will be handled in the future.
