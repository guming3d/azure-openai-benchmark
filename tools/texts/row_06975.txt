chatgpt: NSW Police Organised Crime Squad is currently addressing the issue of match-fixing in the sports world. As per a senior detective from the squad, it is likely that most sports have already been infiltrated by underworld figures who could be making billions of dollars from these operations. However, due to the involvement of criminals from overseas, it has become increasingly difficult to gather evidence and take action against them. Match-fixing is a serious issue that impacts the integrity of sports and results in financial losses for legitimate betters. The rise of online gambling has made it easier for organized crime syndicates to manipulate the outcomes of games and make significant profits. In this case, the NSW Police Organized Crime Squad is trying to identify and prosecute those involved in match-fixing in the state. The senior detective leading the charge has stated that match-fixing is not limited to a particular sport or league, and that most sports have likely been infiltrated. This is worrying news for sports fans and organizations alike, as it could taint the legitimacy of games and undermine the trust of fans. The involvement of criminals from overseas further complicates the matter. It is difficult to investigate and gather evidence against individuals living outside of Australia's jurisdiction. The NSW Police Organized Crime Squad is working with international law enforcement agencies to track down these criminals and bring them to justice. The scope of the problem is immense, and the impact it could have on the sports world is significant. Underworld figures that profit from match-fixing can use the money earned to fuel other criminal activities. This makes it even more critical for law enforcement agencies to take action against those responsible. The NSW Police Organized Crime Squad has assured the public that they are taking match-fixing seriously and are actively investigating suspected cases. They have urged anyone with information related to match-fixing to come forward and assist with their investigations. In conclusion, match-fixing is a serious issue that plagues the sports industry. NSW Police Organised Crime Squad is doing its part to address the matter and bring those responsible to justice. It is a difficult task, but one that is critical to preserving the integrity of sports and the trust of fans. Australians are urged to remain vigilant and report any suspected cases of match-fixing to the authorities.
