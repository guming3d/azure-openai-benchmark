article: Frogggsss in spaaaccceee! Or frog, at least. And maybe not in space, but for certain a wild ride. Look closely at the photo above and you'll see the little guy streaking skyward alongside a 90-foot-tall rocket carrying a moon mission from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on Friday. Another piece of science fiction, you're thinking. But NASA confirms the photo, taken by a remote camera during Friday's launch of the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), is not some trick. "The photo team confirms the frog is real and was captured in a single frame by one of the remote cameras used to photograph the launch," it says on its website. The photo was first posted online Wednesday by Universe Today. It's been hopping around the internet since. And prompting some super puns we have to share. "This frog gives new meaning to "flying leap," (or giant leap)." Universe Today in that original post. "From lily pad to launch pad." The Independent. "An unlucky frog took a giant leap for mankind." News.com.au . "Did it croak?" NBC News . And not to be outdone, a source told CNN the creature's last words were: "Orrrbit, orrrbit." "The condition of the frog, however, is uncertain," NASA says on its website, but these kind of things tend not to end well for amphibians. So how did it get there in the first place? "The launchpad at the Wallops/Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport has a 'pool' for the high-volume water deluge system that activates during launches to protect the pad from damage and for noise suppression, and likely there was a (formerly) damp, cool place that was a nice spot for a frog to hang out," Universe Today reported. While the frog's short trip to the final frontier may be over, LADEE's continues. It is expected to reach lunar orbit on October 6 and then commence gathering "detailed information about the lunar atmosphere, conditions near the surface and environmental influences on lunar dust," NASA said. "A thorough understanding of these characteristics will address long-standing unknowns, and help scientists understand other planetary bodies as well." Follow the LADEE mission .

chatgpt: In an unexpected twist to the launch of NASA's moon mission, a frog was captured in one of the photographs taken during liftoff. The authenticity of the photo has been confirmed by NASA officials, who state that it is not a fake. The photograph, which was taken during the launch of the Apollo 17 mission, shows what appears to be a frog suspended in mid-air just moments after liftoff. The frog is believed to have been caught in a pool of water beneath the launchpad, which was likely used to cool the pad prior to liftoff. As the rocket ignited, the force of the launch propelled the frog into the air, where it was captured on film. NASA officials have stated that while the presence of the frog in the photo is surprising, it does not pose a safety risk to the mission. In fact, the presence of the frog has sparked interest amongst scientists, who are now curious about the effects of launch on local wildlife. NASA has promised to investigate the incident further, and has urged anyone who has information about the frog's fate to come forward. The frog's unexpected appearance in the photo has also attracted attention from the wider public, with many social media users sharing the image and expressing their amusement at the unlikely occurrence. Some have even hailed the frog as a new icon of NASA's space program, with its supposed resilience and adaptability in the face of such extreme conditions. However, not everyone is as amused by the discovery. Animal rights activists have expressed concerns about the welfare of the frog, and have demanded that NASA take full responsibility for the incident. Some have called for greater oversight of NASA's launch procedures to ensure that wildlife is not caught up in the process. For now, NASA officials are working to identify the species of frog captured in the photograph, and are continuing to investigate the potential impact of the launch on local wildlife. Whether or not the frog will become a larger part of NASA's public image remains to be seen, but for now it has certainly grabbed the attention of people around the world.
