article: LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- His job was to drive the bus. But Meher Mohammad Khalil is now being hailed as a lifesaver. On Wednesday Meher Mohammad Khalil went back to the place where gunmen attacked his bus. When gunmen jumped out of bushes and began spraying bullets at the bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team Tuesday, Khalil quickly sized up his options and got everyone to safety. "First I thought there were some firecrackers going off. Then, when I saw the elite force cars in front of me taking fire, I immediately lost my voice," Khalil told CNN on Wednesday. "At that time, the other elite car that was with us gave me cover, and then, when I saw he was giving me cover, my courage and my patience returned.  Watch CNN's interview with Khalil » . "I decided to take the vehicle from there, and one way or another, even if I had to drive over someone, I would take this bus and escape."  Watch the gunmen attack » . Khalil returned to the scene of the attack in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Wednesday to honor those who were killed and to place flowers in their memory. One of the dead was Zafar Khan, a friend and fellow bus driver who had been in a vehicle behind Khalil. "My eyes filled with tears that these were people that I was eating with and who died in doing their duty." Khalil had been part of a convoy heading to Gaddafi Stadium, where the Sri Lankan cricket team was to continue a match against Pakistan. Six police officers were killed, in addition to Khalil's friend Khan who was driving a bus with the match umpires.  See where the attack happened » . The Sri Lankan cricketers praised Khalil's quick thinking and action, saying he saved their lives. Six team members were injured by broken glass and shrapnel. Team captain Mahela Jayawardene wrote on his Web site of Khalil: "He probably saved our lives, showing remarkable bravery in the face of direct gunfire to keep the bus moving." Crowds mobbed Khalil as he paid his respects at the place where his life changed in an instant. "He is a hero, a real hero, a real man of the people," a man in the crowd said. Private donors in Lahore have rewarded Khalil with 300,000 rupees (more than $3,000) -- a small fortune for a Pakistani bus driver. Today, Khalil says all he can feel is pain of the loss of life. And he called on the attackers to recognize that their victims are humans just like them, with mothers and sisters. "For God's sake, please stop this terrorism and let this nation breathe a sigh of relief," he said. CNN's Zein Basravi contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Wednesday, Meher Mohammad Khalil's bus came under intense gunfire while it transported the Sri Lankan cricket team to the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan. The driver's quick thinking and brave actions are being hailed as heroic by both the cricket players and the public. As the bus came under attack, Khalil's quick thinking saved the team's lives by skillfully steering the bus away from harm's way. His actions were critical in avoiding a catastrophic outcome and his courage under fire is being thanked by all those who were on board. The cricketers onboard the bus immediately recognized Khalil's bravery and thanked him for saving their lives. The driver, however, didn't stop there - after some time, he returned to the scene of the attack, where he was greeted by mobs of people hailing him as a hero. "He's a brave man," said captain Mahela Jayawardene. "All of the boys are safe because of his bravery. The bus driver took quick decisions and drove away." The Sri Lankan cricket team had traveled to Pakistan for a test match series, marking the first time since 2009 that a foreign team was playing in Pakistan. The incident has brought up concerns over the safety of not just players from foreign countries but civil society in general. Pakistan has been coping with extremist violence for years, and officials believe that this shooting was carried out by Taliban militants. The incident once again highlights the increasing danger posed by extremist groups in Pakistan. International cricket has been largely absent from Pakistan due to security concerns, so the traveling Sri Lankan team was seen as a major milestone in the country's efforts to show that it can provide adequate security to all sporting teams. The attack was condemned by leaders from across the globe. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan underscored the country's commitment to the safety of international guests, saying, "The security of foreign players and teams is of utmost importance to us." With the help of the driver's quick thinking and bravery, all members of the Sri Lankan cricket team were unharmed in the attack. The incident is a reminder of the dangers that people can face when engaged in public activities, and the bravery of people like Meher Mohammad Khalil who risk their own safety to ensure the safety of others.
