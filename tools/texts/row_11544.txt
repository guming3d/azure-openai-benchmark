article: By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . A group of primary school kids on an excursion were caught in the middle of a mid-air scare onboard a Qantas plane from Canberra to Perth. The children were seated at the back of the plane causing the nose's weight to be higher due to the brunt of the weight being held in the front. Although pilots managed to rectify the situation and take off a report was released by the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau. Quantas check in staff have introduced a new check in procedure after the the mid-flight scare in a Canberra to Perth flight . The school group were seated with their chaperones at the back of the plane and assigned adult standard seated which should hold a standard 87kg adult. The children were all over the age of 11 which is above the age child seats are assigned. There was quite a serious discrepancy of 55kg per seat each child was was assigned to while majority of the adult passengers were given seats at the front of plane. The aircraft appeared nose-heavy during take-off, forcing the captain to apply significant back pressure to achieve lift off from the runway. Off the mark: The final load sheet of the Canberra to Perth flight overstated the aircraft take-off weight by about 3.5 to five tonnes . 'Qantas has worked with the ATSB to investigate a weight and balance anomaly on a Canberra to Perth flight,' a Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'The investigation found that due to an administrative error, the weight of some passengers was incorrectly recorded as adults rather than children.' 'This meant that the aircraft didnâ€™t have the optimum configuration for takeoff, but at no stage was this a material risk to passenger safety.' An investigation by the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau was led after the incident, which found  87 primary school children on were assigned the adult weight of 87kg . Too much back pressure could have caused the aircraft tail to strike the runway, but the captain managed to ease the aircraft into the air. The incident, prompted an investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. It was subsequently determined that the final load sheet overstated the aircraft take-off weight by about 3.5 to five tonnes. The Australian Transport and Safety Bureau said Qantas issued a new procedure to check-in staff, reminding them to ensure that children travelling on group bookings must be recorded as children, to ensure aircraft weight and balance is based on an accurate passenger type. The new procedure ensures that children travelling on group bookings must be recorded as children, which will ensure an accurate passenger weight assessment .

chatgpt: A Qantas flight from Canberra to Perth experienced an unexpected mid-flight scare when a group of primary school children caused the plane to become unbalanced. The cause of the imbalance was due to the children's light weight, which made the plane too "nose-heavy," according to a report by the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau. The incident occurred when the plane was approximately 5,000 feet above sea level, and the pilot noticed that the plane was not maintaining its altitude. The captain quickly took action and made the decision to return to Canberra to investigate the cause of the problem. Upon landing, the plane was inspected, and it was discovered that the children's positioning on the airplane was the root cause of the issue. The Australian Transport and Safety Bureau was immediately notified and launched an investigation into the matter. Investigators found that the children, who were traveling on the flight as part of a school trip, were seated in the front of the plane, which made the aircraft too nose-heavy. The weight distribution of the passengers and their luggage is critical to the proper balance of an airplane in flight, and any deviation from the norm can cause serious issues. Thankfully, the experienced pilot was able to skillfully bring the plane back to the airport, avoiding any potential danger to the passengers and crew onboard. The airport staff arranged for another flight for the passengers to continue their journey to Perth. In a statement released by Qantas, the airline expressed their gratitude for the pilot's quick thinking during the incident. "We commend the rapid response of our flight crew who followed standard procedures and took every precaution to ensure the safety of our passengers," the statement read. The airline also confirmed that they are taking steps to prevent a similar incident from happening in the future. "We are reviewing our procedures to ensure that we have appropriate safeguards in place to manage passenger weight distribution on all our flights," the statement continued. The Australian Transport and Safety Bureau's investigation into the incident is ongoing, and they have already interviewed several of the passengers and crew members onboard the flight. They are expected to release a detailed report of their findings in the coming weeks. This incident has once again highlighted the importance of proper weight distribution on airplanes and the crucial role that pilots play in maintaining the safety of passengers and crew during a flight. As air travel continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that the aviation industry remains vigilant in maintaining the high standards of safety that have made air travel one of the safest modes of transportation in the world.
