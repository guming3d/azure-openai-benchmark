article: (CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming "I'm Lovin' It" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix "Mc" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. "We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over," said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. "We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's." The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. "We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court," Suppiah said. "We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food." The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix "Mc" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the "Mc" in McCurry stands for "Malaysian Chicken Curry." A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. "We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment," said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: "Tasty and so Gooood."

chatgpt: Fast food giant McDonald's has suffered a defeat in a symbolic David-and-Goliath match-up against McCurry, a popular fast food chain based in Malaysia. The dispute arose when McDonald's claimed that the use of the prefix "Mc" in the name of McCurry was an infringement of its trademark.  However, the Malaysian High Court ruled in favor of McCurry, dismissing the claim. This comes as a major relief to McCurry, which has been locked in a legal battle with McDonald's for years.  McCurry owner, P. Suppiah, expressed his gratitude after the ruling, saying, "We're very relieved -- much, much relieved. It has been a long, tiring and costly legal battle." For years, McDonald's has been known for aggressively protecting its trademark and the use of the prefix "Mc" in the names of other food chains. The company had claimed that the use of "Mc" in McCurry's name was causing confusion among customers, who might mistake it for a McDonald's outlet.  However, the Malaysian court found that McCurry had been using its name for over a decade and was well-known in the country. The court also noted that McCurry's menu was vastly different from McDonald's, consisting of a range of chicken curries and rice dishes, as opposed to burgers and fries. The ruling is being seen as a victory for small businesses, which often struggle to fight against the might of large corporations in legal battles. McCurry's win also highlights the need for careful consideration when it comes to trademark disputes and the use of prefixes like "Mc." Experts believe that McDonald's may have been too aggressive in its trademark enforcement, which could harm its reputation in the eyes of consumers. This ruling is likely to give other small businesses the confidence to stand up against large corporations that try to bully them on the basis of trademark infringement. It is seen as a victory not just for McCurry, but for all small businesses that face legal battles against big corporations.
