article: This is the shocking moment a callous teenage carer was caught on camera stealing from a vulnerable pensioner's purse. Sheryvone Brooks was filmed reaching into a kitchen drawer at 85-year-old Evelyn Nicholson's house in Stourbridge, Dudley. The 19-year-old's actions were caught on a camera installed by Mrs Nicholson's family who had noticed money going missing from the elderly woman's home. Sheryvone Brooks was filmed taking £30 out of Mrs Nicholson's purse after the elderly woman's family installed a camera when they noticed money going missing from her home . Mrs Nicholson was said to be 'devastated' by the theft and would have given the teenager money if she had asked her for it, her son said . Brooks, who worked for Gateway Health and Social Care Dudley, was found guilty of theft at Wolverhampton Crown Court. In the video, the teenager is seen sitting in a chair in Mrs Nicholson's kitchen talking to another carer. She is filmed opening the drawer then looking around the room to see if anyone is watching her. The teenager then stood up, covering the brown leather purse with her body while she took out £30. The teenager then stuffed the money into the pocket of her hooded sweatshirt before returning the purse to the drawer . She stuffed the cash in her pocket before returning the purse to the drawer. Mrs Nicholson's family said she had been left 'devastated' by the theft, and that she would have given money to the teenager had she asked for it. The teenager (seen leaving court) was fired from her job . Speaking after the case, the 85-year-old's son, Robert Smith told the Express and Star: 'She was devastated and it has affected her health. 'It's absolutely disgusting. It had happened a couple of times before at the end of last year, so I set up the camera on New Year's Day,' said Robert Smith, Mrs Nicholson's son. 'I knew that we would catch the person but the video is still shocking. 'You are supposed to put your trust in carers but then one does something like this, and it destroys that trust. 'I hope she gets a severe sentence for what she has done. In total I think she took something close to £200 over three occasions. 'The video was taken first thing in the morning while the other carer was getting my mum out of bed.' The court heard how Brooks said she needed the money to pay for Christmas presents when she committed the theft on January 6. She has since repaid the money, describing the incident as 'stupid and opportunistic'. Timothy Talbot-Webb, defending, said: 'She knew it was wrong.' While the sum of money stolen was 'minor', magistrates referred the case to crown court because of the breach of trust involved. Brooks, who has been fired from Gateway Heath and Social Care, will be sentenced next month.

chatgpt: A 19-year-old carer has been caught on camera stealing from the home of an 85-year-old woman she was caring for. Sheryvone Brooks was filmed taking Evelyn Nicholson's purse from a kitchen drawer and removing £30 before stuffing it in her sweatshirt pocket. The camera was installed by Nicholson's family after they noticed money had gone missing from the home. Brooks, who was previously a trusted carer to the elderly woman, was caught in the act and has now been charged with theft. Her trial will take place at Wolverhampton Crown Court and she will be sentenced in March. The case has raised concerns about the care of the elderly and the vulnerability of those who rely on caregivers. Many families place their loved ones in the care of professionals, trusting that they will be treated with respect and dignity. However, incidents like this serve as a stark reminder to keep a close eye on those who are entrusted with such responsibility. In an interview with local media, Nicholson's family expressed their shock and disappointment at the incident. They urged others to be vigilant and to install cameras in their homes to ensure the safety of their loved ones. "The care of the elderly is a serious matter, and it is important that we take all necessary steps to ensure their safety and wellbeing," said one family member. The news of the theft has sparked outrage amongst the public, with many calling for stricter regulations and background checks for carers. The incident has also highlighted the need for better training and support for those who work in the care industry. Care homes and agencies have a responsibility to ensure that their staff are properly trained and equipped to care for vulnerable individuals. They must also carry out proper background checks and screening to prevent incidents like this from occurring. In the case of Sheryvone Brooks, it is a sad reminder that some individuals may abuse the trust placed in them. However, it is important to remember that the actions of one person do not reflect the hard work and dedication of countless caregivers who provide essential support to the elderly. As we wait for the verdict in this case, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect the elderly and vulnerable in our society. It is up to all of us to remain vigilant and to demand better care for those who need it most.
