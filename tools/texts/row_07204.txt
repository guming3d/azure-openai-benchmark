A new study shows that about one third of American's don't believe in Evolution and believe that humans have existed in their present form since the beginning of time. The Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of Americans believe that 'humans and other things have evolved over time' but that 33 percent think they were the only human form to ever set foot on the Earth. The study was conducted March 21-April 8, 2013, with a representative sample of 1,983 adults, ages 18 and older. The survey was conducted on landlines and cellphones in all 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. The margin of error was only three percentage points. Creationism versus Evolution: Research has found a widening gap between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to how man came to be . One third of Americans still believe in Creationism versus Evolution . Surprisingly enough, of the group of people who believe in evolution, 32 percent believe that evolution was due to natural selection, and roughly 24 per cent believe that, 'a supreme being guided the evolution of living things for the purpose of creating humans and other life in the form it exists today.' 78 per cent of Mainline Protestants believe that humans and other animals evolved over time reported the Huffington Post. According to PEW, the belief in creationism versus evolution is closely linked to religious background and race. two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants don't believe in evolution whereas half of black evangelical Protestants do. When those people polled were divided by their religious affiliation the results showed that majority of white evangelicals believe that a supreme being guided evolution . There was also a disparity between believing in evolution versus creationism when examining political parties. Currently, 43 per cent of Republicans believe in evolution and 67 per cent of Democrats believe in human evolution. In 2009,a greater number of republicans, 54 per cent, believed in evolution, and 64 per cent of democrats believed in evolution. The study also investigated the differences between demographic groups and alsoÂ  the differences in language. They worded the evolution question in two different ways. One way they phrased it as 'humans and other living things' and the other way they phrased it was as 'animals and other living things.' They found that exchanging animals for humans made very little difference in people's beliefs about evolution. However, the study found that men were more likely than women to believe that humans/ animals and other living things evolved. They also found those who had completed a for of higher education believed in evolution more than people who hadn't. The number of Republicans who believe in human evolution has declined nine percent since 2009 .

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by the PEW Research Center has found that one-third, or 33 per cent, of Americans believe that humans have existed in their present form since the beginning of time. This belief, which is commonly referred to as creationism, is especially prevalent among certain demographic groups and political affiliations. Interestingly, the study found that more Black evangelical Protestants than White evangelical Protestants believe in evolution. This may be due, in part, to the history of slavery in the United States, which saw many African Americans forcibly removed from their native lands and brought to the country as slaves. As a result, some Black evangelical Protestants may be more open to the idea of evolution and scientific discovery as a means of understanding their own history and origins. In addition, the study found that the number of Republicans who believe in evolution has gone down since 2009, while the number of Democrats who believe in evolution has gone up. This trend may reflect the growing divide between the two major political parties in the United States, with Republicans generally taking a more conservative stance on social and scientific issues, while Democrats tend to be more progressive and open-minded. Despite these trends, it is worth noting that the majority of Americans still believe in some form of evolution, whether it be guided or natural. This suggests that while creationism remains a strong belief for many, it is not the only way that Americans understand the origins of the human species. The study also revealed some interesting differences in beliefs by age, education level, and religious affiliation. For example, younger people are more likely to believe in evolution than older people, and those with higher levels of education are also more likely to accept evolution as a scientific fact. Similarly, those who are not affiliated with any particular religious tradition are more likely to believe in evolution than those who identify as evangelical Protestants or Catholics. This may reflect a growing trend towards secularism in the United States, as fewer people identify strongly with traditional religious institutions. Despite these differences, it is clear that the issue of evolution and creationism remains a contentious one in the United States. While scientific evidence seems to overwhelmingly support the theory of evolution, many Americans continue to believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible and the idea of a divine creator. Ultimately, the study by the PEW Research Center highlights the complex and often fraught relationship between science and religion in the United States. While some may see these two domains as inherently incompatible, others argue that they can be mutually enriching and complementary, providing different ways of understanding and responding to the mysteries of existence.
