Thermal cameras could one day pick drunk people out of a crowd, by monitoring the body temperature of various parts of their face. Scientists in Greece have published a paper detailing how two computer formulas, in conjunction with the camera, can spot physical differences, such as the dilation of blood vessels in a drunk's cheek, or the slight increase in heat on a drunk person's nose when compared with their forehead. The concept has been used before in airports to help spot people with infections, such as SARS, but the new twist on the technology could be used as sports events or crowded areas as an aid to security teams or police. Thermal spots: The new software developed in Greece can look at changes in body temperature to determine sobriety . Georgia Koukiou and Vassilis Anastassopoulos, from the University of Patras in Greece, have produced two algorithms to analyse data from cameras. They noted how alcohol causes blood vessel dilation at the skin's surface, so by comparing different spots on the face, they can spot individual pixel-width differences. A second program looks at heat variability across areas of the face, based on observations that the nose becomes relatively hot compared to a cooler forehead when a person is inebriated. Differences such as a warmer nose and inflamed blood vessels in the cheek can all indicate how much alcohol is in someone's system . The authors suggest the system could be used to stop the police or officials making mistakes based on ill-founded assumptions based on someone's appearance or behaviour. Or publicans or shops could use the technology to help them assess whether to serve customers. A similar technology was deployed outside St Paul's Cathedral by police during the Occupation protests earlier this year. However the technology is likely to raise concerns over privacy, particularly if deployed en masse on the general public.

chatgpt: Greek scientists have developed a new technology that could be used to detect signs of inebriation in individuals. The code, which was originally used for disease monitoring at airports, has now been adapted and could potentially be deployed in bars and shops to alert staff of customers who may be showing signs of excessive alcohol consumption. The system works by using a combination of facial recognition and behavioural analysis. Cameras capture facial expressions, such as bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, as well as the way in which individuals move and their overall behaviour. This data is then analysed by the code, which can detect patterns and flag any signs of inebriation. Although the system is still in development, the potential applications are vast. It could not only be used to prevent individuals from being served too much alcohol, but also to alert staff to potential safety concerns. For example, if someone is stumbling or appears disoriented, staff could intervene and ensure they get home safely. The technology could also be used as a preventative measure in situations where excessive drinking is expected. For example, it could be used at sporting events or concerts, where large crowds are likely to be consuming alcohol. By monitoring for signs of inebriation, security personnel could prevent individuals from becoming overly intoxicated and potentially causing harm to themselves or others. In addition to its potential in bars and shops, the technology could also be used by law enforcement. It could potentially be implemented in police body cameras, allowing officers to quickly determine whether an individual is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This would help officers to make more informed decisions when dealing with potentially volatile situations. The use of technology for monitoring inebriation raises some concerns, however. Privacy advocates may fear that the use of facial recognition and behavioural analysis could be used to violate individuals' privacy rights. There is also the potential for the system to falsely flag individuals as being drunk, leading to unnecessary intervention or stigmatization. Despite these concerns, the development of this technology represents an exciting step forward in the field of behavioural analysis. With further development and refinement, it could potentially help to prevent incidents of excessive drinking and improve safety in a range of settings.
