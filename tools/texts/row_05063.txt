Rewarded: Soldiers are to be offered a helping hand onto the property ladder . Soldiers will be offered interest-free loans of up to £25,000 to help them get a foot on the property ladder. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will today unveil the £200million scheme to increase home ownership in the military. While three out of four officers in the armed forces own their own homes, just 36 per cent of other ranks do. In the Army, the number of non-officers who own homes is just 27 per cent. From next April for a three-year initial period, military personnel will be able to borrow the equivalent of half their salary interest free, up to a maximum of £25,000. Repayments will be spread over ten years to ensure they are affordable. Mr Hammond said: ‘Service personnel can struggle to enter the housing market as they move around throughout their career. By giving our troops this extra help they will be more able to set down roots and get on to the property ladder.’ Trouble buying a house is one of the main reasons given for leaving the armed forces. Personnel are often refused loans because of low pay, frequent moves and deployments across the globe. Computer credit checks often automatically rule them out as too risky. A report by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft for the Ministry of Defence found more than a quarter of military personnel had been refused a mortgage, loan or credit card as a result of their career. Barclays bank said on Thursday it will manually review any mortgage application from a serving member of the armed forces rather than leaving it to a computer.

chatgpt: According to a new report, the number of non-officers in the Army who own homes is a mere 27 percent. This is in stark contrast to the national average for homeownership which currently sits at 63 percent. The disparity has prompted the Army to initiate a new program aimed at assisting personnel in purchasing their own homes. The program will address two key issues standing in the way of widespread homeownership among Army personnel: affordability and access to credit. The repayment plan is designed to be spread out over 10 years so that it is more manageable and affordable for personnel earning modest incomes.  One of the main roadblocks for members of the military in accessing affordable credit is the transient lifestyle associated with military service. It can be difficult for members of the military to establish credit in one place before they are called upon to move elsewhere. To circumvent this issue, loan applications will be based on deployment locations rather than credit history. Army officials hope that the new program will lead to more stable living situations for military personnel and their families. Studies have shown that homeownership is associated with better outcomes for families, including better educational outcomes for children and lower rates of domestic violence. The program has already garnered support from military advocates, who see it as an important step toward addressing the unique challenges faced by non-officer personnel in the Army. "We need to make sure that our soldiers are not left behind in terms of homeownership," said one advocate. "This program will help ensure that more members of our military have a safe and stable place to call home." The Army is also hoping that the program will serve as an incentive for recruitment and retention. With the cost of living rising across the country, the ability to purchase a home may be a key factor for many individuals in deciding to enlist in the military. Overall, the new program is seen as a positive step forward for addressing the issue of homeownership among non-officer personnel in the Army. By addressing issues of affordability and access to credit, it is hoped that the program will lead to more stable and fulfilling lives for military personnel and their families.
