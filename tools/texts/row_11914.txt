Impressive Vettel powers to another win . "It's one of the best circuits in the world, and I really think that the arrival of DRS and KERS Hybrid will make this one of the best and most exciting British Grand Prix ever." KERS -- an innovation that stores energy created under braking for user as an additional boost when accelerating -- was reintroduced to the sport in 2011, while DRS (Drag Reduction System) allows the rear wing of Formula One cars to be adjusted in a way that gives a boost of speed in new for the current season.

"Lewis loves this team and he knows the car is capable of winning races," Whitmarsh told British newspaper The Independent. "He's sat with me here in the last 10 days and explained his passion, enthusiasm and desire to remain part of this team. "I've known him since he was 11. I don't think he would look me in the eye and say that if he didn't mean it." Sunday's grand prix will also see McLaren's Jenson Button return to his homeland, where his best finish is fourth place in 2004 and 2010. The 2009 drivers' champion is 12 points ahead of his compatriot Hamilton and sits second in the standings, 77 points behind Germany's Vettel. The 31-year-old is looking forward to experiencing the new-look Silverstone, which has a newly-constructed pit lane and paddock complex and first corner.

"I think they'll confirm Silverstone as one of the best circuits in the world."
