The Royal Mint today unveiled a coin to celebrate the Chinese year of the sheep in 2015. The coin - available in gold and silver - features Chinese symbols and the Yorkshire Swalendale sheep and has been designed by artist Wuon-Gean Ho. The collectable, which marks the 2015 year of the sheep, is the second in the collection, and prices start at £82.50. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coins at The Royal Mint said: 'Following on from the hugely popular Year of the Horse coins range, of which three quarters were sold out in the first few months, The Royal Mint is happy to be bringing its craftsmanship and artistic skills to this latest coin in the collection.' 'Supporting the centuries-old tradition of giving zodiac coins at the Lunar New Year, we’re expecting to see similar demand this year for Wuon Gean’s stunning design.' Last month, the Mint announced that a silver £20 coin has been produced to mark 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War. Designed by sculptor John Bergdahl, it depicts the figure of Britannia watching over the first troops leaving for France in 1914. On the back, it features the current portrait of the Queen. The coin has been minted in fine silver and 250,000 will be issued. The Mint said the coin, which is only the second UK £20 coin it has ever made, has been struck to remember the bravery of those who answered the call to fight for king and country a century ago. The first UK £20 coin was released last year to celebrate the birth of Prince George. That coin, which featured a St George and the Dragon design, was also limited to a run of 250,000 and has sold out.

chatgpt: The Royal Mint unveiled its latest collection of commemorative coins, with the 2015 Year of the Sheep as the focal point. The coin features intricate Chinese symbols and the iconic Yorkshire Swalendale sheep, making it a collector's item for those interested in both Chinese culture and British farming. Available in both gold and silver, this coin is the second in the Royal Mint's collection, following the popular Year of the Horse coin. The Year of the Sheep is known for its characteristics of being gentle, kind-hearted and empathetic, making it an ideal gift for those born under this sign, as well as collectors who appreciate unique pieces of art. The obverse of the coin features the renowned portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, by Jody Clark, while the reverse showcases the Sheep design created by Wuon-Gean Ho. The Chinese symbols for "Year of the Sheep" also appear on the reverse. Claire Maclennan, Divisional Director for the Royal Mint's commemorative coin division, stated, "The Royal Mint is renowned for creating high-quality collectors' coins, and the Year of the Sheep is no exception. The intricate design featuring the Swalendale sheep and auspicious Chinese symbols make it a unique and stunning coin, perfect for those looking to add to their collection." The Yorkshire Swalendale sheep is a rare breed, typically found in the northern part of England. It is one of the oldest breeds in the UK and features prominently in folklore and local history. The breed was almost extinct in the 1970s, but thanks to conservation efforts, it has made a remarkable comeback and is a proud symbol of the region's agricultural heritage. The commemorative coin will be released in limited quantities, making it not only a beautiful piece of artistry but also a valuable investment. It offers an excellent opportunity for collectors to own a piece of British and Chinese cultural heritage. The Royal Mint has been striking coins for over 1,100 years, and its expertise and craftsmanship can be seen in every coin they produce. The 2015 Year of the Sheep coin is a testament to their commitment to creating unique and beautiful collectors' items.
