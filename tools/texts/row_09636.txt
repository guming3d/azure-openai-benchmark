Harry Redknapp is considering investing in a club close to his Dorset home after stepping down as QPR boss . Redknapp, who requires knee surgery, did not rule out a return to management if the right job came up . 'It's something that could interest me, I'd just like to be involved,' Redknapp said. 'I spoke to people about one or two bits and pieces that may come up but at the moment it's not gone that far.' The former Bournemouth, West Ham, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager also refused to rule out a return to the managerial hotseat if the right job came along. He said: 'I'll get my knee sorted, I'll go back and see the specialist for whatever he feels needs doing. 'I haven't really done my rehab, that's been my biggest problem, I'm always too busy to spend an hour getting my quads right.

Chris Ramsey oversaw coaching duties from the home dug-out for Saturday's match with Southampton . Tim Sherwood, the former Spurs coach, is the favourite to take over at Loftus Road . 'I'd miss the buzz of football. It would have to be something I really wanted to do if I was going to have another go. 'If anything came up that was interesting I'd have to look at it.' Tim Sherwood, another former Spurs manager, is the favourite to replace Redknapp and would work alongside caretakers Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey. 'I would think there's every chance Tim would go there,' added Redknapp. The Hoops remain in the relegation zone, a point shy of safety, following their late defeat at home to Southampton on Saturday.

chatgpt: Former Queens Park Rangers (QPR) manager Harry Redknapp has been linked with a consortium considering investing in a football club. The news comes amid Redknapp's recent departure from Loftus Road, where he stepped down as manager to have knee surgery. Despite his recent setback, Redknapp has not ruled out a return to management after his recovery. The veteran coach has made no secret of his passion for football and his desire to continue working in the sport. In the interim, QPR has placed Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey in charge on a temporary basis. However, reports suggest that former Aston Villa boss, Tim Sherwood, is the frontrunner to take over at Loftus Road. It remains to be seen which club the consortium is considering investing in, but Redknapp's experience and connections in the football world could be invaluable to the group. The 67-year-old has managed a range of teams including AFC Bournemouth, West Ham United, Portsmouth, Tottenham Hotspur, and QPR. He has also been in charge of the Jordanian national team. Redknapp's potential involvement with the consortium will be of interest to football fans across the UK. The club in question could benefit from his expertise and the financial backing of the consortium. QPR fans will also be closely watching developments, with many wondering if Redknapp's departure will lead to a change in the team's fortunes. The London-based club is currently in the relegation zone of the English Premier League. Regardless of the consortium's decision, Redknapp's future in football looks bright. His experience and reputation make him a valuable asset to any football club, while his recovery from knee surgery could see him return to management in the near future. In the meantime, fans will eagerly watch to see which club the consortium invests in and whether Redknapp will play a role in the team's future success.
