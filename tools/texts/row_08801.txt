The 24-year-old princess upped dressed up her grey long-sleeved skater dress with two chain necklaces and a sweep of red lipstick. The two looked understandably delighted to be reunited, as Eugenie continues her position with New York based auction house, Paddle8, which keeps the two on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Though it is not known how long the Duchess will remain in New York, it is possible she plans to spend the weekend in the city, allowing her to spend Mother's Day on Sunday with Eugenie.

As well as visiting her youngest daughter, Fergie was in New York to attend the benefit (which saw appraisals being conducted by auctioneers dressed in rather odd red wigs, sunglasses, and with handkerchiefs across their faces) as she had donated one of the prizes. Lucky guests could bid on various experiences, one of which was the chance to attend the Children in Crisis Gala hosted by the Duchess of York as part of a luxury weekend in London, and have a photo taken with her. All proceeds from The Bucket List Auction, which brings together extraordinary experiences to benefit a selection of the world's leading philanthropic organisations will benefit amfAR, Children in Crisis, Gabrielle's Angel Foundation for Cancer Research, The Hamptons International Film Festival, Tuesday's Children and Virgin Unite. Eugenie's new bosses at Paddle8, Osman Khan and Alexander Gilkes, also attended the event and looked to be getting on well with their royal employee's mother as they chatted and posed for pictures together.

chatgpt: Fergie, the Duchess of York, has flown to New York to spend some quality time with her daughter Eugenie. The daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson is currently working for an auction house in the bustling city, and last night, the pair made a stunning appearance at a charity auction. For the special occasion, the mother-daughter duo kept their looks simple yet elegant in grey and black ensembles. Fergie was dressed in a black silk top and a matching skirt, while Eugenie opted for a grey dress that featured a trendy asymmetrical hemline. The event was in aid of several charities, including one that provides assistance to vulnerable communities across New York, but it was also a great opportunity for the two to catch up and spend some quality time together. It was heartwarming to see the close bond between them. It’s no news that Fergie is very close to both her daughters, and she’s never shy about showing her support or affection towards them. The Duchess has often spoken about how proud she is of her girls, and it’s clear that her love and support have served them well. Eugenie, on her part, has been working hard since moving to New York. She is believed to be working with Paddle 8, an online auction house that deals in high-end art, collectibles, and antiques. Her passion for art is well-known, and it’s no surprise that she’d choose to work in a similar field. Although it’s not clear how long Fergie will be spending in New York, it’s likely that the two will enjoy some mother-daughter bonding before she jets back to the UK. Fergie’s trip comes on the heels of her recent interview with Australian television program 60 Minutes, where she opened up about her struggles with criticism and the paparazzi during her time as a member of the royal family. The Duchess also spoke about her ex-husband Prince Andrew and how their family has remained a tight-knit unit despite their divorce. She revealed that they continue to take holidays together and co-parent their daughters, something she believes has helped her girls to become the confident and accomplished women they are today. As the charity auction drew to a close, Fergie and Eugenie made their way out, looking as stunning as ever. The Duchess’ trip to America may have been a brief one, but it’s evident that the time together has only strengthened their unbreakable mother-daughter bond. In conclusion, it was a delightful sight to see Fergie and Eugenie spending time together and attending the charity auction. The simplicity of their outfits only highlighted their natural beauty and the close bond they share. It's heartening to see the ex-royal family flourish and thrive even after facing several challenges.
