Police should help identify high-profile suspects to end inaccurate speculation on the internet, the Government's top lawmaker said last night. It would be 'very sensible' in some cases for forces to confirm to the Press who they have arrested, said Attorney General Dominic Grieve. He added that police have the 'discretion' to reveal the identity of suspects, but warned journalists not to launch 'fishing expeditions'. Attorney General Dominic Grieve has said it would be 'very sensible' in some cases for forces to confirm to the Press who they have arrested . His comments come after Scotland Yard made yet another arrest as part of Operation Yewtree, which was launched following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Dozens of Twitter users inaccurately named the 72-year-old suspect as various celebrities, including a veteran pop star and a businessman. However, sources said the latest arrest – the 13th since the inquiry began – was not a well-known figure. Mr Grieve said: 'Clearly, if the Press have got to know who somebody is who's been arrested and are publicising that, then clearly it might be very sensible for the police to confirm that fact. 'But equally, I don't think we should end up with a process in which the police are being subjected to fishing expeditions with dozens of names being reeled out to them and an obligation to pick one of them. That seems to me to be a matter which must be within the discretion of the police.' Asked if he was concerned that well-known figures could be inaccurately named on social media, Mr Grieve said 'public interest' could free the police to say the wrong person is in the spotlight. 'Under certain circumstances that might be a good reason why the person under arrest should have their name publicised,' he added. The comments come after Scotland Yard made yet another arrest as part of Operation Yewtree, which was launched following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal . He also highlighted the 'odd' situation in which the names of suspects are widely known to the public, but only confirmed by police days later. For instance, the identities of the two suspects in the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby were reported worldwide – but it was up to ten days before Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were named by the Met. The Attorney General is the latest senior Government figure to step into the row over new police guidelines that promote a policy of 'secret arrests'. Following the Leveson report, forces have been told to identify suspects only when it is in the 'public interest' or when it could help prevent or detect crime. Alex Marshall of the College of Policing said the guidance aims to 'strike the correct balance' between privacy and 'open and honest' relations with the media.

chatgpt: Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has said that the police have the "discretion" to reveal the identities of individuals under investigation. However, he has warned journalists not to engage in "fishing expeditions" that could undermine the investigation process. Speaking at a conference on "Fake News and the Law" in London, Grieve acknowledged the importance of transparency in the investigation process. He noted that in certain cases, it may be necessary to disclose the identity of a suspect to the public in order to gather important information or to prevent further harm. "The police have a discretion to release the identity of a suspect when they can establish not only that it is in the public interest but also that it is necessary for the investigation," he said. Grieve also emphasized the need for journalists to be cautious when reporting on ongoing investigations. He cited recent cases of high-profile investigations, including the Operation Yewtree investigation into historic child sexual abuse, in which journalists had faced criticism for their reporting. "People have a right to know what is going on, but at the same time we have to be careful not to allow the process of investigation to be undermined," he said. "Journalists need to be aware of the fact that they could be putting police investigations in jeopardy if they go too far." Grieve suggested that journalists should ask themselves whether they have a valid public interest argument before reporting on an investigation. He also urged them to consider the potential harm that could be caused by publishing certain information. "The public interest is not just about satisfying people's curiosity," he said. "It's about whether there is a real public interest in the information being published, and whether the publication of that information could cause harm." During the conference, Grieve also addressed the issue of fake news, emphasizing the need for a stronger legal framework to combat it. He argued that while freedom of expression was important, it should be balanced against the need for accurate information. "We need to create a legal framework that recognizes the importance of allowing people to express themselves freely, but also recognizes the need for accuracy and truth," he said. Overall, Grieve's comments underscored the importance of balance and caution in both journalism and law enforcement. While transparency and public interest are important principles, they must be balanced against the need to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations and prevent harm to individuals. By emphasizing the need for a legal framework that balances these competing interests, Grieve has added to the ongoing conversation about how to best address these complex issues in the digital age.
