article: Ronald Koeman welcomes three former Southampton players back to St Mary's after warning his current squad to think twice before leaving the south coast. England midfielder Adam Lallana will face the team he spent 12 years with for the first time since his £25million summer move to Liverpool. But while Lallana has become a key part of Brendan Rodgers' Champions League push, fellow ex-Saints Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert have endured frustrating starts to their Anfield careers. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman welcomes back former Saints players to St Mary's . England international Adam Lallana is set for his first return to St Mary's since his £25million summer switch . Dejan Lovren only spent a season at Southampton but impressed in the centre of defence . Rickie Lambert has had to make do with a spot on the bench and came close to joining Aston Villa last month . Rodgers is preferring to use midfielder Emre Chan as a makeshift centre back despite paying Southampton £20m for Croatian international Lovren. Saints legend Lambert is likely to have to watch Sunday's game from the substitutes' bench after finding starts hard to come by since joining his boyhood heroes. Koeman has also cited Calum Chambers' struggles at Arsenal as a reason for sought-after trio Morgan Schneiderlin, Nathaniel Clyne and Jay Rodriguez to consider rejecting the advances of Premier League big-guns. Former Barcelona star Koeman said: 'It is not always for football reasons players' move, maybe it is about money. We cannot pay salaries like the big teams play. 'If you stay you stay for different reasons, because you are sure you will play regularly in the first-team. It is about the age of the players and the experience of the player. It is normal you will lose players if you do not play every season in the Champions League. Lambert, Lallana and Lovren (pictured with Daniel Fox, second left) helped Southampton to eighth last year . 'I said to Calum Chambers: "I don't think this is a good moment to go to Arsenal because you need to develop yourself and you will play much more here than you will at Arsenal."' While Lambert is assured of a heroes' reception from the Southampton supporters, Lallana can expect a much more frosty welcome. Many supporters are angry with the way Lallana forced through his switch to Anfield, with suggestions from club insiders he refused to play for Southampton again. Lallana has refuted those claims and former teammate Schneiderlin is baffled by the animosity directed towards his former captain. Schneiderlin said: 'I know it was hard for Adam to leave the club. He was very emotional about it and I don't know why the fans are so angry with him. 'He gave everything to this football club from the first moment he wore the shirt when he was in the youth team. 'People come and people go. That is part of your career. Adam is a good guy and people should not forget what he did for the club.'

chatgpt: Ronald Koeman, the manager of Southampton, has warned his current squad to carefully consider their decisions before departing for other clubs. His comments came after the recent success of former Southampton players, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, and Rickie Lambert who left the club for Liverpool. While these players may have been pursuing better opportunities elsewhere, Koeman asserted that leaving Southampton can have unforeseen consequences. Lovren and Lambert, in particular, have faced frustrating starts to their Liverpool careers.  The Croatian defender, Lovren, joined Liverpool for £20m, after spending just one season with Southampton. Despite his lofty price tag, Lovren's performances for Liverpool have been disappointing, leaving fans and critics alike questioning his abilities on the pitch. Lovren has yet to fully establish himself as a regular in Liverpool's backline, and his early struggles have put his future at the club in doubt. Lambert, the English striker, joined Liverpool along with Lovren in the summer of 2014 for a fee of £4m. Lambert, who had a successful stint with Southampton, scoring 106 goals in 207 appearances, has struggled to play regularly for Liverpool. The 32-year-old has only made a handful of appearances, and his inability to find the back of the net has left fans wondering whether he was worth the investment. Adam Lallana, another former Southampton player, has fared slightly better at Liverpool since his arrival for a fee of £25m in 2014. However, his progress has been hampered by injuries, and he has yet to fully establish himself as a key player for the club. Koeman's comments come at a crucial time for Southampton, who are currently sitting in the top half of the Premier League table. The Dutch manager has built a strong squad at St. Mary's, and has seen promising performances from players such as Graziano Pelle, Sadio Mane, and Dusan Tadic. However, players leaving for bigger clubs has been a recurring issue for the South Coast side. The departure of Lallana, Lovren, and Lambert to Liverpool were painful blows, but the club has managed to recover by bringing in new talent and developing existing players. Koeman's warning to his current squad serves as a reminder that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Despite the lure of playing for a bigger club, players may overlook the benefits of staying at Southampton, where they can receive consistent playing time and be integral members of a competitive team. In conclusion, Koeman's cautionary words come from a place of experience and knowledge, and they should be taken seriously by the current Southampton squad. While players may be tempted to leave for bigger clubs, they should carefully weigh the potential consequences of such a move. Furthermore, Southampton has proven that they can bounce back from losing key players, and they will continue to do so by developing young talent and bringing in new signings.
