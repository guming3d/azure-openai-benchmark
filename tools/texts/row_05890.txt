article: By . Wills Robinson . Followers of Haiti's most celebrated patron saint have made their annual pilgrimage to a remote waterfall in a bid to cleanse themselves of their bad luck and sins. Voodoo worshippers travelled to Saut d'Eau, 42 miles north of the capital Port-au-Prince, to wash in the water which is believed to have purifying powers. As part of the cleansing ritual, they delivered a list of wishes to improve to their lives and used leaves to wash away negative omens. Lionel Saint-Jean, who attended the gathering, said that after losing his house in Haiti's catastrophic 2010 quake, he asked the saint for a new one and he got one. 'So I came this year to thank her for that,' he said. Haitians have travelled to the same spot for hundreds of years to bathe because the virgin saint is believed to have appeared on a palm tree there in 1847. Voodoo, or Vodou as many practitioners prefer, evolved from West African beliefs and adopted elements of Roman Catholicism.

chatgpt: Thousands of people travelled to the town of Saut d'Eau in Haiti over the weekend to cleanse themselves in the waters of a nearby waterfall. The event drew followers of Saint Our Lady Mount Carmel who believe that the water has purifying powers. The tradition dates back to the 19th century when Catholics arrived in the region and saw a vision of the Virgin Mary on a palm tree. Since then, the waterfall has become a popular pilgrimage site for the faithful. On Saturday and Sunday, men and women dressed in white, carrying baskets of leaves and flowers, gathered at the base of the waterfall. They waded into the water, shouting out their wishes to the Virgin, and using the leaves to wash away their sins. "It's a very beautiful and spiritual experience," said one participant. "It's a time to reflect on our lives and ask for forgiveness." According to tradition, the water at Saut d'Eau has healing powers, and many people believe that it can cure ailments ranging from headaches to cancer. The site is also said to have brought good luck and prosperity to those who visit. While the ceremony is primarily a Catholic tradition, it has also become a symbol of Haitian national identity. The waterfall is located in a remote area in the central part of the country, and the event draws people from all over Haiti. Despite the large crowds, the event was peaceful and well-organized, thanks in part to the efforts of local authorities. "We're here to make sure everyone is safe and that the event goes smoothly," said one police officer. Many participants said that they feel renewed and reinvigorated after visiting the waterfall. "It's like a new beginning," said one woman. "It gives me hope for the future." Others said that the event is a reminder of the power of faith and prayer. "When you're standing there in the water, it's like you're connected to something greater than yourself," said one man. "It's a powerful feeling." As the sun began to set over the waterfall on Sunday, the crowds began to slowly disperse. But for those who had made the pilgrimage to Saut d'Eau, the memories of the weekend will last a lifetime. They will carry with them the hope and faith that they found in the waters of the sacred waterfall.
