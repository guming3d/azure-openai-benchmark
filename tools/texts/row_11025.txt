article: In the space of six weeks, with great displays of importance, India's capital will have hosted two world leaders who no longer speak with each other: the presidents of Russia and the United States. India sits uncomfortably between these two adversaries. Pick your geopolitical topic -- Syria, Iran, Ukraine -- and you can be sure that Moscow and Washington will be at odds with each other. New Delhi has been watching from afar, sitting on the fence. It is fair to ask if India's stance is sustainable. Can you simultaneously court close friendships with two states whose foreign policies are designed to hurt the other? In Narendra Modi¹s worldview, the answer is a resounding yes. When CNN spoke with the Indian Prime Minister earlier this year, in his only interview since assuming office, Modi explained how he saw a changed world order. "If you look closely, you will see that every country is trying to build relations with other countries," he said. They may be part of one bloc, but they also sit with fierce opponents. When pushed specifically on Russia's annexation of Crimea, a hostile takeover New Delhi refused to condemn, Modi pushed right back. "In the world right now, a lot of people want to give advice. But look within them, and they too have sinned in some way." The comment could be seen as a subtle dig at Washington's foreign policy missteps. However, Modi's point was not to admonish the U.S., but to suggest that all nations have their own value systems and perceived flaws. India¹s way of navigating flawed global players was by making friendships and opening channels of opportunity. The subtext to this is simple: economics. The reason why Modi has traveled all over the world in his first few months in office -- Rio, New York, Tokyo, Sydney -- is not because he wants to be a foreign policy leader; Modi wants to bring business to India. So: as you read about and see images of Vladimir Putin¹s grand reception in New Delhi this week, keep an eye not on the rhetoric, but the outcomes and deals struck. Russia is the world's second largest exporter of arms; India is the world's biggest importer. Russia is one of the world's biggest producers of oil and gas; India is one of the biggest consumers. The two sustain each others' needs. And as long as they do, they will court each other, with the United States watching on.

chatgpt: India finds itself in a precarious position, balancing relations between two global superpowers: Russia and the United States. According to CNN's Ravi Agrawal, this delicate diplomatic positioning was underscored by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statements that he saw a changing world order in which every country was trying to build relations with others. Modi's comments highlight India's efforts to foster relationships with a diverse array of nations. However, it is India's relationships with Russia and the United States specifically that are currently under scrutiny, particularly given recent high-profile events. In June of 2017, Indian President Modi welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin to India for a high-level meeting. As Agrawal points out, it is worth reflecting on the outcomes and deals struck during the visit. A particular focus was placed on defense, with India and Russia agreeing to collaborate on building frigates for the Indian navy. Despite this, India's relationship with the United States has also been significant. This was evidenced by Modi's visit to the United States in June 2017, at which he met with President Donald Trump. A number of agreements were signed during the visit, including one that saw the United States approve the sale of 22 Guardian drones to India. The question now is how India can continue to navigate these two relationships without being caught in the crossfire of broader geopolitical tensions. Agrawal points out that both Russia and the United States have demonstrated their willingness to use economic and strategic tools to advance their interests, and India must remain vigilant in protecting its own interests. Maintaining a balancing act between these two global powerhouses is no small feat, but Modi's statements indicate that he is aware of the need for India to foster positive relationships with a range of countries. The prime minister has repeatedly emphasized the importance of India's status as a fast-growing economy and an emerging global leader. Given these pressures, it remains to be seen how India's diplomatic relationships with Russia and the United States will evolve over time. However, as long as India remains committed to fostering strong relationships across a range of nations, it is likely that the country will continue to play an important and influential role on the global stage.
