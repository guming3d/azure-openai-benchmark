The woman had kept her pregnancy a secret from her family and gave birth unexpectedly in her bedroom. The child was born in a difficult condition and appeared to be in need of urgent medical attention. Instead of calling for help, the woman cut the umbilical cord herself and wrapped the baby boy in a pair of jeans before tossing him out of the window.

The ambulance rushed the newborn to the hospital where doctors were able to revive him. The baby is reportedly in a serious condition and is receiving treatment at the hospital.
