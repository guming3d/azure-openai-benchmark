article: By . Anna Edwards . A dangerous driver who led police on a 90mph chase through winding country lanes was finally caught after he crashed into a school bus. James Poole, 20, raced through streets, dodged oncoming traffic and forced other drivers to swerve out of his way. He jumped red lights and sped along the wrong side of the road in a bid to shake off police officers who were pursuing him, a court heard. A dangerous driver who led police on a 90mph chase was finally caught - after he crashed into a school bus . But he was finally caught after he tried to squeeze between a school bus stopped at traffic lights and an oncoming lorry and hit the bus. A judge jailed Poole for 22 months and handed him a three-year driving ban. Prosecutor Edward Phillips told Southampton Crown Court in Southampton, Hants, officers in a patrol car captured the chase on film. PC Mark Bailey was driving an unmarked police car southbound on the M3 near Winchester, Hampshire, and spotted a grey BMW undertaking another car. Video footage played to the court showed Poole then returning to the outside lane before undercutting other vehicles. Poole, 20, raced through streets, dodged oncoming traffic and forced other drivers to swerve out of his way . The officer then turned on his blue lights and sirens, but Poole ignored it and carried on, accelerating to reach speeds of up to 90mph. He then careered off the motorway at Winchester and hurtled down a B road. Officers kept up a running commentary to the police control room as Poole made no attempt to slow down but continued to overtake vehicles at speed. At one point, he crossed double white lines on a blind bend and also jumped village traffic lights at 60mph. Poole, who had passengers in the BMW, ignored 'keep left' bollards and forced oncoming motorists to pull over to avoid a crash, the court heard. But the pursuit ended when he tried to squeeze between stationary cars and oncoming traffic at a junction and crashed into a school bus. An officer turned on his blue lights and sirens, but Poole ignored it and carried on, accelerating to reach speeds of up to 90mph . His passengers ran off but Poole, of no fixed abode, was arrested sitting in the driverâ€™s seat. He admitted using a vehicle without insurance, driving a vehicle without a licence, two counts of theft, and one count of dangerous driving. Recorder Nigel Lickley QC, sentencing, said Poole showed a complete disregard for the safety of other drivers and his passengers. Mr Lickley said: 'This case clearly crosses the custody threshold and a suspended sentence is not appropriate. 'You were very fortunate nobody was seriously injured.' Nichola Attwood, mitigating, said Poole had reached a crossroads in his life and realised he had to change his ways.

chatgpt: A reckless driver, James Poole, made headlines after being chased through the streets by the police. The 20-year-old driver was sentenced to 22 months in prison and banned from driving for three years after admitting to several offences. Poole was caught and charged for driving without a licence and insurance, as well as two counts of theft and one count of dangerous driving. His dangerous driving came to a climax when he tried to pass between a stopped school bus at traffic lights and an oncoming lorry, ultimately colliding with the bus. The incident took place on a busy road, where Poole had been spotted driving erratically, causing concern for other road users. When the police attempted to stop him, he refused to pull over and instead sped away, leading them on a wild chase through the streets. He crashed his car while attempting to overtake a lorry while the bus was stationary. The consequences of his actions were severe, not just for himself but for other road users. He could have caused death and injury for those passengers aboard the school bus. The court imposed the driving ban as a preventative measure to protect the general public from his dangerous behaviour. The judge who presided over the case reprimanded Poole, highlighting the potential seriousness of his actions and the risk they posed to innocent bystanders. They also noted that given his age, he should have known better than to put himself and others in such a dangerous situation. The incident has sparked outrage from members of society, who are calling for harsher penalties for dangerous drivers such as Poole. The police, too, have urged drivers to take responsibility for their actions when on the road. The case serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering reckless driving. Not only is it illegal but the potential consequences can be severe. Road users need to be aware that their actions can cause harm and injury to other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Poole's sentence serves as a reminder of the serious nature of such offences, and the need for drivers to be responsible and accountable for their behaviour on the road. Let this be a lesson to others, that flouting the law and putting others at risk will always have severe consequences.
