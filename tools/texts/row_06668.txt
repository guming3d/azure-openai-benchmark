article: A former University of Wisconsin football player and his twin brother are charged in federal court with one in a string of November robberies at five businesses. Jack Ikegwuonu and his brother, William, were charged Tuesday in U.S. District Court with armed robbery and gun possession. They're also charged in Dane County court with several counts of retail theft for allegedly stealing merchandise from Wal-Mart stores in Madison and Sun Prairie throughout September and October. The brothers were arrested last week after an armed robbery at a dry cleaning business in Middleton. They told police they committed all five armed robberies to help support their heroin use, according to an affidavit filed with the criminal complaint in federal court. Brothers: Jack Ikegwuonu, left, played for the Badgers and was drafted by the Eagles, though he was only active for one regular-season NFL game.

The brothers' arrests took place after police observed an SUV's movements following the armed robbery with a GPS device, Madison police said in a release. The device was earlier placed on the vehicle via a warrant. '[The SUV] had been initially identified through surveillance images as the probable getaway vehicle in recent armed robberies, including two that took place on State [Street],' the release said. A gun, along with money 'and other evidence' was recovered from the vehicle, Madison police said. Jack and William Ikegwuonu are suspected in four other armed robberies in the area between November 13 and 21, and U.S. Attorney John Vaudreuil said they could face more charges when the case is taken to a grand jury. Madison police said in the release 'The investigation indicates much of the money taken during the commission of these crimes was being used to purchase heroin.' The retail theft charges in Dane County Circuit Court include a felony and misdemeanors. A judge entered not guilty pleas to the misdemeanor charges on the brothers' behalf as they stood mute in court Tuesday.

chatgpt: Former college football player Jack Ikegwuonu and his brother, William, were arrested last week in Wisconsin after an armed robbery at a dry cleaning business in the town of Middleton. The brothers are also suspected in four other armed robberies in the area between November 13 and 21. According to an affidavit, the brothers told police that they committed all five armed robberies to support their heroin use. The Ikegwuonu brothers' arrests have shocked the local community, particularly given Jack's background as a successful college football player. Jack Ikegwuonu played for the Wisconsin Badgers as a cornerback from 2005 to 2007. He was considered one of the team's most promising players, and was selected in the fourth round of the 2008 NFL draft. However, he never played a game in the NFL due to injuries. William Ikegwuonu played for Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. He had a less successful college career than his brother, but was still considered a promising player. It is unclear at this time what led the brothers to turn to a life of crime. However, their confession that they committed the armed robberies to support their heroin use suggests that they were struggling with addiction. The Ikegwuonu brothers' arrests have sent shockwaves through the local community, with many expressing disbelief that such promising young men could end up in such a dire situation. However, others are using the case as a reminder of the devastating impact of addiction, and the need for more resources to help those struggling with substance abuse. The Middleton Police Department has issued a statement thanking the public for their assistance in the investigation, and reassuring them that they are working tirelessly to ensure that justice is served. The Ikegwuonu brothers are currently being held in custody pending trial. They have not yet entered a plea to the charges against them, and it is unclear at this time who their legal representation will be. The case has attracted national media attention, with many following the story closely due to Jack's background as a former college football star. However, the focus remains firmly on the victims of the armed robberies, and the impact that the Ikegwuonu brothers' actions have had on the local community. As the investigation continues, many are hoping for answers as to what led the Ikegwuonu brothers to turn to a life of crime, and what can be done to prevent others from making similar choices. For now, the community remains in shock, grappling with the fallout from a crime spree that has left many feeling vulnerable and afraid.
