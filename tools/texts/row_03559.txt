article: Persian cat: Space program official Mohammad Ebrahimi said Iran's next space capsule could carry the Persian cat, breed named after Iran's former name of Persia . As Iran steps up its space programme with plans to send a human into space by 2018, the country has been using animals as test astronauts and may now turn to the distinctive, and locally named, Persian cat. The move comes seven months after Iran claimed it launched a monkey out of earth's atmosphere and successfully returned it home, although the claims were questioned after photos appeared to show different monkeys before the launch and after it allegedly returned. The plan is seen by Western countries as another possible step by Iran's ambitious aerospace programme, which has also raised concerns about spillover military applications. But a senior space program official, Mohammad Ebrahimi, tried to quash doubts over its success in sending a money into space by saying state media had mistakenly sent out a photo of an alternate monkey that was not used in the February launch. He insisted just one monkey, Pishgam or Pioneer, was sent on the 20-minute flight to a height of 72 miles and returned safely. In 2010, Iranian officials said it sent a mouse, a turtle and some worms on a space flight - also part of the country's goals of sending a human into space by 2018 and becoming a leading tech center for the Islamic world. Ebrahimi said Iran's next space capsule could carry the Persian cat, a long-haired, flat-faced breed named after Iran's former name of Persia. He said the launch will happen by the end of Iran's current year, which ends March 21. A mouse and rabbit are also under consideration. Ebrahimi said the next launch would be with a larger, liquid-fueled rocket and and launched 72 miles up. Past launches were done with solid-fueled boosters, whose technology can be used in long-range missiles. He did not explain the reason for the rocket change, but may be an attempt to ease international concerns at a time when Iran's new moderate-leaning president, Hasan Rouhani, is seeking to revive nuclear talks with world powers. Iranian officials insist a monkey, called Pishgam (or Pioneer) pictured, was sent on a 20-minute flight to a height of 72 miles and returned safely . Iran says it wants to put its own satellites into orbit to monitor natural disasters in the earthquake-prone nation, improve telecommunications and expand military surveillance in the region. Earlier this year, the then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he wanted to be Iran's first astronaut.

chatgpt: Iran has taken a significant step towards realizing its goal of becoming a leading tech center for the Islamic world by announcing its plan to launch its first manned space mission by 2018. The announcement comes seven months after Iran claimed to have launched a monkey out of earth's atmosphere, and sets the country's sights higher, aiming to send a human into space.  According to Iranian news outlets, the country's space agency, the Iran Space Agency (ISA), has already selected a team of astronauts who will undergo rigorous training to prepare for the eventual mission. The program will reportedly include survival training, practising emergency scenarios, and intensive physical and psychological training for the potential space travelers. Iran's aspiration to become a space-traveling nation is not new. The country has been investing heavily in its space program over the past few decades, largely motivated by a desire to elevate national prestige within the region and beyond. In 2005, Iranian astronaut Anousheh Ansari became the first Muslim woman to travel into space, although she did so as a tourist onboard a Russian spacecraft.  More recently, former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed his desire to become Iran's first astronaut, a plan that was met with skepticism and derision by many in the international community. The suggestion was widely viewed as a political move by Ahmadinejad, who hoped to boost his popularity prior to the 2013 presidential election. Nevertheless, the announcement of the manned mission is a significant indicator of Iran's ambitions and the progress it has made in its space program. Iran has already demonstrated its capabilities in building and launching satellites, with the launch of its Rasad-1 Earth observation satellite in 2011 and the Navid imaging satellite in 2012.  However, despite its technological successes, Iran's space program has come under criticism from some quarters, who have suggested that its development has been influenced by military aspirations. The United States and Israel have both expressed concern that the technology used by the ISA could be applied in developing long-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.  Iran has vehemently denied any military motivations behind its space program, stressing its peaceful intentions and the benefits that the development of space technology could bring to the country. In addition to boosting national prestige, Iran's space program could facilitate communication systems, disaster management, and environmental monitoring in the future. Whether Iran will be able to achieve its goal of sending a human into space by 2018 remains to be seen. The program faces significant challenges in terms of funding, infrastructure, and technological development. Nevertheless, the announcement is a clear indication of Iran's determination to establish itself as a major player in the rapidly expanding field of space exploration, and its eagerness to assert its place on the global stage.
