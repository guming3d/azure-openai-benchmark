article: Protesters pushed their way past police in rowdy scenes as elite members of Hong Kong's Election Committee decided the city-state's next chief executive. They chose Leung Chun-ying, known as CY Leung, a British-educated chartered surveyor and one of two candidates who were backed by Beijing. Leung beat his nearest rival Henry Tang by a wide margin, after an uncharacteristically dirty campaign which exposed extramarital affairs and allegations of bribery. Leung won 689 of the votes, compared to Tang's 285. A third candidate, Democratic Party leader Albert Ho won just 76. While most of the mudslinging during the campaign was aimed at Tang, Leung ran into his own trouble.

There are also allegations of "black money" -- that his campaign had been in contact with organized crime figures. He also is suspected of being a closet communist, and is thought to hold hardline views on public order and press freedom. According to his website, Leung attended primary school in Hong Kong but left to study Estate Management at Bristol Polytechnic in the United Kingdom. He walked 55 minutes each way to college "in the English weather," it says, and worked in a Chinese takeaway shop to help cover expenses. On returning to Hong Kong in the late 1970s, Leung worked for real estate consulting firm Jones Lang Wootton, before becoming the youngest partner in the firm's 200-year history, the website says. He later opened his own firm, CY Leung & Co. and became involved in Hong Kong's administration through his election to the Executive Committee of the Basic Law Consultative Committee.

chatgpt: In an election process that lasted for several hours, CY Leung has been elected as the new Chief Executive of Hong Kong. The decision was made by the 1,200 members of the Election Committee on Sunday morning. Leung replaces the outgoing Chief Executive, Donald Tsang, whose term expired in June. The election of Leung comes amid protests from hundreds of people who called for a popular vote. The protesters believe that the selection process is not democratic and that the people of Hong Kong should have a say in who becomes their leader. Despite this, the Election Committee chose Leung, who was widely seen as the favourite candidate to win. Leung, 57, is a former government property adviser and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He has also served as a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and as the convener of the Executive Council. Leung has promised to improve the economy and create more jobs in Hong Kong. He has also pledged to tackle housing affordability and improve public housing. As he was announced as the new Chief Executive, Leung pledged to uphold the "one country, two systems" principle, which defines Hong Kong's relationship with China. "I will govern Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law (Hong Kong's legal constitution) and the principle of 'one country, two systems'," said Leung. "I will defend the interests of Hong Kong and bring prosperity to our people." Leung's election marks a new chapter in Hong Kong's relationship with China. The city returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under the "one country, two systems" principle, which allows Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy, including independent legal and economic systems, while remaining under Chinese sovereignty. However, over the years, some Hong Kong people have grown disillusioned with Beijing's influence on the city's political process, and have called for more democracy and autonomy. The election of Leung comes at a time when Hong Kong is also facing economic challenges, such as a slowdown in growth and rising unemployment. Leung has already promised to address these issues and has outlined a number of measures to boost the economy, including investing in infrastructure projects and strengthening the city's strengths in finance, tourism, and innovation. Leung also faces other challenges, such as tackling issues of social inequality and addressing the city's housing crisis. Despite a series of government measures to cool the property market, Hong Kong remains one of the world's most expensive places to live, with many young people struggling to afford their own homes. Leung has promised to allocate more land for public housing and to introduce measures to make buying a home more affordable. In conclusion, CY Leung's election as the new Chief Executive of Hong Kong marks a significant moment in the city's political and economic history. He faces many challenges, such as addressing social inequality and the housing crisis, but has promised to work tirelessly to improve the lives of Hong Kong people. His election also highlights the ongoing debate around democracy in Hong Kong and the delicate balance between local autonomy and Chinese sovereignty.
