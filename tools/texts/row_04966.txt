Located in the desert steppe of Kazakhstan, about 124 miles east of the Aral Sea, it is leased by the Kazakh government to Russia and is managed jointly by the Russian Federal Space Agency and the Russian Space Forces. It was originally built by the Soviet Union in the late 1950s as the base of operations for its space program.

chatgpt: In a bizarre and unexpected turn of events, a burrow was discovered under a functioning launchpad at the Russian-operated Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Footage of the burrow was captured by a news cameraman who had accidentally left his camera rolling near the launchpad. Upon closer inspection, it was discovered that the burrow had been created by a rodent, though experts are puzzled as to how and why the rodent chose to dig its home in such a precarious location. The burrow was found directly beneath the launchpad, which raises serious concerns regarding the safety of the nearby launch facilities. Officials at the cosmodrome have expressed their confusion and concern over the situation. The discovery has prompted a thorough investigation into the matter, with experts examining the launchpad and surrounding areas for any signs of damage or potential risks. It is unclear how the rodent was able to dig its burrow without being detected, as there are multiple checkpoints and security measures in place at the cosmodrome. The discovery is a testament to the ingenuity and persistence of the animal kingdom, as even in the most secure of areas, nature finds a way. The cosmodrome is one of the largest launch facilities in the world and has been the site of numerous manned missions as well as satellite launches. The discovery of the burrow has raised questions about the safety protocols in place and the potential risks that could arise from such a discovery.  Experts are recommending that additional measures be taken to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. While the discovery of the burrow may seem humorous or even absurd, it highlights the importance of security and safety measures in even the most unlikely of locations. It is hoped that the incident will serve as a wake-up call for those in charge of the cosmodrome, and that steps will be taken to prevent future incidents from taking place. The discovery of the burrow may be an inconvenience, but it should not be taken lightly, as it has the potential to cause serious harm or damage to the cosmodrome and those who work there. Overall, the discovery of the rodent burrow under the launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome serves as a reminder that even the most unlikely of locations can pose a threat to the safety and security of those around them.
