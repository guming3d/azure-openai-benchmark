article: By . Martin Robinson . Thief: Carol Payne, 31, stole £11,500 from the private school's minibus fund and has now told police she took cash from a church . A mother who stole £11,500 from a private school's minibus fund to pay her child's tuition fees has also admitted to taking cash from a local church, a court heard today. Carol Payne used her role as treasurer of the parent-teacher association at Highclare School in Birmingham to plunder cash from the group's bank account. The 31-year-old - who was chosen for the PTA role because she has a background in accountancy - then used the money to pay for her child's fees at the school. Payne admitted stealing £11,532 from the private school when she appeared at Birmingham Magistrates Court in February this year. But her sentencing was adjourned at Birmingham Crown Court today after it emerged she had been arrested on suspicion of stealing from a church in Saltley in the city. Defending Payne, Liz De'Oliveira, said the mother had given a 'full and frank admission' to police on March 4 but had not yet been charged with the offence. The court heard the treasurer had stolen around £13,000 from the church and was due to speak to officers again next month. Miss De'Oliveira said: 'She is facing similar matters which are under investigation regarding Saltley Church. 'She has already been interviewed on the 4th of this month and has made full and frank admissions. 'My understanding is it's around £13,000. In my respectful submissions it would be sensible to have all matters before the court together. 'She has managed to get some compensation together. Members of her family have very kindly clubbed together to get some £9,000 in compensation'. Deception: Payne used her role as treasurer of Highclare Schoolís parent teacher association to plunder the group's bank account . Revelations: It also emerged in court today that she has admitted taking £13,000 from this church in Saltley, Birmingham . Recorder Patrick Upward QC adjourned the case and bailed Payne, ordering her to return to court for sentencing for both matters on April 24. He told her: 'This is a very serious matter for which a term of imprisonment is likely.' At an earlier hearing at Birmingham Magistrates Court, Payne pleaded guilty to stealing £11,532 from Highclare School's PTA between September 19, 2012 and October 13, 2012.

chatgpt: A former member of staff at Highclare School in Birmingham has been accused of stealing cash from the school and a local church. The court heard today that Carol Payne used her role within the school to take cash from the school's accounts. The full extent of Payne's alleged theft has not been detailed in court documents, though it is believed to be in the tens of thousands of pounds. Payne appeared at Birmingham Crown Court where she pleaded guilty to one count of theft from Highclare School and one count of theft from St. Luke's Church in Foel. It was revealed that Payne had also admitted to siphoning off funds from the church. The prosecution alleged that Payne used her position as a finance assistant at Highclare School to take money from the school over a period of several years. Prosecutors argued that Payne was trusted to handle cash and that she abused that trust to fund her own lifestyle. The court heard that Payne had used some of the stolen money to pay off bills and personal debts. She had also purchased expensive items, including a trip to New York, and made payments to her family members. Prosecutor Mr Thomas said that Payne had siphoned off a large sum of money from the school and that the theft had affected the education and the opportunities available to the school's pupils. The court was told that Payne had been caught when a colleague at the school noticed that she was living beyond her means. The colleague alerted the school's management team who launched an internal investigation. Payne was dismissed from her position at the school and the police were contacted. She was subsequently arrested and charged with theft. The hearing was told that Payne had expressed regret and remorse for her actions. Her defence counsel argued that she was a first-time offender and should be given a lenient sentence. Payne will be sentenced at a later date. Highclare School released a statement saying that they were deeply disappointed by the theft and the impact it had on the school and its staff. The statement went on to say that the school had taken steps to strengthen its financial controls to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. This case highlights the importance of having proper financial controls in place to prevent fraud and theft from taking place. Trust is an essential part of any financial operation and it is important for organisations to ensure that they have procedures and checks in place to prevent the misuse of funds.
