article: Two endangered grey nurse sharks which are harmless to humans have been found dead on the seabed with bullet holes in their heads. The sharks were discovered at Box Beach, in Port Stephens, on the NSW mid-north coast, on the weekend. One was a baby male while the other was an adult female. The NSW Department of Primary Industries is now investigating what has been described as a 'grisly' random attack, with a spokesperson telling the Daily Mail Australia that they are 'very concerned' about the killings. Two grey nurse sharks were found at Box Beach in Port Stephens NSW at the weekend . 'It is disappointing to see these pictures and this type of action is totally unacceptable,' the spokesperson said. An autopsy on the male, which is 1.92 metres, and the female, which is 2.03 metres, will be carried out and it's hoped the bullets can be recovered to help the investiagtion. The sharks suffered what are thought to be bullet holes in their heads . Toonie Mahto, a Marine campaigner with the Australian Marine Coservation Society, said she was 'deeply saddened' to hear the fate of the two grey nurses. 'It's a deeply tragic situation especially when we know the majority of Australians have a real love and respect for sharks,' she said. Ms Mahto said even thought this type of attack has happened before, thankfully the people who 'do this are in a very small minority'. The Department of Primary Industries now have the carcasses and are investigation the tragic incident . The marine campaigner also said that the killing of one female of such a critically endangered species can have a huge impact on the already dwindling population. 'These are critically endangered sharks and the removal of even one breeding female can have serious implications.' The DPI estimate that there are only 1500 grey nurse sharks still living in NSW waters, and they are committed to the protection of these animals. If people who killed the sharks are found they could face fines of up to $220,000 . In 1984, grey nurses became the first sharks in the world to be protected, by the NSW Government. They are now protected under both state and Commonwealth legislation. Penalties of as much as $220,000 and up to two years in prison can be handed down for those who catch, keep, buy, sell or possess grey nurse sharks without the correct permit. The Department of Primary Industries have referred the matter to NSW Police.

chatgpt: In a tragic incident that has raised serious concerns over marine conservation, two sharks were found dead with bullet wounds in Box Beach, Port Stephens on the NSW coast. The discovery was made by local officials, who immediately contacted the Department of Primary Industries to take the necessary action. According to reports, one male and one female shark were recovered from the beach, both of which had been shot with firearms. The incident has caused outrage among marine conservation groups, with Australian Marine Conservation Foundation describing it as "deeply tragic". The group also called for strict action against those responsible for the cruel act. Sharks, often referred to as the "apex predators" of the oceans, play a vital role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. However, they have increasingly faced brutal harm and threat from humans. Many consider sharks to be dangerous animals and are afraid of them, which leads to acts of violence towards them. The NSW coast is home to a diverse range of shark species, including great white sharks, bull sharks, and tiger sharks. Experts say that indiscriminate killings of these creatures could have serious implications on the ocean's delicate balance, potentially leading to a collapse of the food chain. There is an urgent need for increased awareness around the importance of marine conservation, and the impact of human activities on the ocean environment. The Department of Primary Industries has launched an investigation into the incident, and has urged the public to provide any information they may have that could help identify the perpetrators of the cruel act. Marine conservationists are calling for strict laws to be put in place to protect sharks and other marine creatures from harm by humans. Such laws could include strict penalties for those found guilty of harming marine animals, as well as increased awareness campaigns around the importance of marine conservation. In conclusion, the discovery of two dead sharks with bullet wounds in Box Beach, Port Stephens on the NSW coast has raised serious concerns over marine conservation. It highlights the urgent need for stricter laws and increased awareness around the importance of preserving marine ecosystems, and protecting the delicate balance of the ocean's food chain. This incident serves as a wake-up call for all of us to take responsibility for our actions and ensure that our planet's natural resources are protected for future generations.
