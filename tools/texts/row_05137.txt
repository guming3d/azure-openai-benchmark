But with no electricity or running water and limited furniture, £100,000 may seem a bit steep for those looking to snap up a small piece of the British coastline. The Happy Days hut in Southwold, Suffolk, is on a promenade, adjacent to the widest part of the beach. It is located on one of the most sought-after stretches in the area, and estate agents believe it will fetch more than its already steep asking price. Owners are given a 30-year lease on the property from the council. They can commercially let the hut to holidaymakers on a daily or weekly basis, but cannot sleep in the huts overnight. There is only one room in the hut which has enough space to fit four people, but the buyers can choose to put in furniture or appliances such as gas stoves and generators to make it feel more comfortable.

chatgpt: A unique property has been put up for sale in the charming town of Southwold in Suffolk, and it is causing quite a stir despite its rather unusual attributes. The property includes several huts located on the promenade area, one of the most desirable locations in the town. Despite having no electricity or running water, estate agents Durrants have revealed that it is expected to fetch significantly more than its asking price due to its sought after location. Though the lack of amenities may sound daunting to many, the property's idyllic location and commercial opportunities are expected to draw in potential buyers. Advertised as a peaceful retreat for daily or weekly use, interested parties can commercially let parts of the property to those seeking a simple escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. While the property's huts may lack amenities, they are already furnished, albeit with limited items. The décor is in keeping with the seaside vibe, with calming colours and a lack of technology designed to help visitors truly unplug while they enjoy the view of the stunning beach. Despite the property's many positives, the estates agents have made it clear that permanent residency is not permissible. The property is best suited for people looking for a second holiday home, or who are interested in commercial ventures. Despite the hustle and bustle of the town, the beach provides a sense of isolation from the surrounding area. It is well known that placing oneself next to water has therapeutic attributes, and what better way to soak up the seaside atmosphere than in the comfort of one of the huts on the promenade. Local residents have expressed disbelief that the property is expected to fetch well above the asking price. The charm of the Southwold location is so great that people are willing to put these amenities aside to own a piece of this beloved town. In recent months, several properties near the promenade have been sold for a considerable sum, proving that this particular corner of the town holds significant value. It is undoubtedly a unique opportunity for a buyer with an appreciation of the town's charm to own a piece of its history. Despite the property's rather basic infrastructure, it is evident that the potential within it is vast. The commercial lease opportunities could provide significant financial gain to the right person, while the inherent charm of the town and its location means it will always have significant value.  It is anticipated that the sale of property will generate a lot of interest from buyers who see the unique value proposition in owning a piece of Southwold's history directly on its well-loved promenade. With the potential for financial gain and the opportunity to own a part of one of the most beloved locations in Suffolk, this property may just be the next top-rated commercial venture.
