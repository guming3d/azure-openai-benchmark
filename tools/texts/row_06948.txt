Two dim-witted car thieves were caught after they ran into a police station as they tried to avoid the officers chasing them. The teenagers were being pursued by police through Bromley, south London, after a car had been stolen in Petts Wood, four miles away, at 2.45am. During the car chase, the pair screeched into Mason's Hill, a side road by Bromley Police Station, not realising it was a dead end. No through road: Bromley police station is situated on a dead-end road, much to the misfortune of the fleeing youths . The pair leapt out of the car and dashed into Bromley Police Station, which is open 24 hours a day, looking 'flustered and confused', according to front office staff. Police then arrested them. A police spokesman said officers started chasing the car after it was reported stolen from nearby Petts Wood in the early hours of Saturday and failed to stop. The car chase around Mottingham and Bromley came to an abrupt halt at the police station when the pair ditched the car. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Furphy from Bromley Police said; "To say we were surprised by their choice of attempted escape route is an understatement. 'Next time we'll leave the cell doors open and they can just run straight in. 'If only they were all this daft our job would be so much easier.'

Police revealed details of the arrest on a Twitter feed with the hashtag, or Twitter key word sign, ‘nonetoobright’ on Monday. The tweet stated: 'Two burglars/car thieves arrested after running into Bromley Police Station front office whilst attempting to evade capture! #nonetoobright.' It added: 'Aforementioned two master criminals now charged and off to court.'

chatgpt: In an unusual turn of events, a car that was reported missing in Petts Wood was involved in a car chase in Bromley. According to reports, two teenagers were driving the car at the time of the chase. However, when they were eventually cornered by the police, they decided to abandon the car and run straight to the police station front desk. The incident began when residents in the Petts Wood area reported a missing car to the local authorities. The car, a silver Volkswagen Polo, was believed to have been stolen sometime in the early hours of Friday morning. The police immediately put out a search alert to catch the culprits. Later that day, the car was spotted by patrol officers in the Bromley area. The police then began to pursue the vehicle, which led to a high-speed chase through the town center. Eyewitnesses say that the teenagers driving the car were driving recklessly and even broke several traffic laws. The chase eventually ended when the car was cornered in a dead-end street. Surprisingly, the teenagers decided to abandon the car and run straight to the police station. They did not resist arrest or even try to hide. Instead, they walked straight up to the front desk and surrendered themselves to the police officers on duty. The two teenagers, who have not yet been identified, are currently in custody and are facing charges of theft and reckless driving. The police have commended the residents of Bromley for their assistance in helping them to catch the suspects. This bizarre incident has generated a lot of interest among the local community, with many people expressing their shock at the teenagers' decision to surrender themselves to the police. Some have praised their actions, pointing out that they could have easily escaped if they had tried. Overall, this incident serves as a reminder that crime does not pay, and that the law will eventually catch up with those who break it. While the actions of these two teenagers are certainly unusual, they highlight the importance of taking responsibility for our actions and facing the consequences of our choices. The investigation into this incident is ongoing, and the police have assured the public that they will not stop until all those responsible are brought to justice.
