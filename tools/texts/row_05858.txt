The reality star, who appeared on the show in 2010 and 2012, took to Facebook to share the news with her followers and ask for prayers and support. According to Haynes' post, Tilly was diagnosed with an "extremely rare and aggressive" form of cancer called high-grade glioma. "We are devastated," Haynes wrote in the post. "We have a long road ahead of us, but we don't know how long or how short it will be." Haynes went on to thank her friends and family for their support, saying that she and her husband, Ryan Godwin, were "incredibly blessed" to have such a strong support system. She also asked for prayers and positive thoughts for their daughter. The news has sparked an outpouring of support from Haynes' fans and fellow Big Brother contestants. Season 10 winner Dan Gheesling tweeted his support for Haynes and her family, saying "Sending prayers to you and your family, Britney." Haynes' season 12 co-star Rachel Reilly also sent her love and support, tweeting "We love you Britney and we are praying for sweet Tilly." Haynes first appeared on Big Brother in 2010, finishing in fourth place. She returned to the show in 2012 for Big Brother: All-Stars, but was eliminated early on in the season. Since her time on the show, Haynes has become a popular social media personality, sharing updates and photos of her family with her hundreds of thousands of followers. The news of Tilly's diagnosis has prompted an outpouring of support from Haynes' social media followers, many of whom have shared their own experiences with childhood cancer. "My heart breaks for your family," one follower wrote. "As a fellow childhood cancer mom, I know the path ahead isn't easy. Sending love and prayers." Haynes' heartbreaking news serves as a reminder of the devastating impact childhood cancer can have on families. According to the American Cancer Society, childhood cancers make up less than 1% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States, but they remain the leading cause of death by disease in children under 15 years old. As Haynes and her family navigate this difficult time, they have the support and love of their friends, family, and fans behind them. "We believe in the power of prayer and ask you to please pray for our sweet Tilly," Haynes wrote in her post. "Thank you for loving our family and for your continued support."
