article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- An autopsy to determine why Rodney King was found dead in his swimming pool began Monday morning, but it will be several weeks before the findings are made public, a San Bernadino County, California, coroner's spokeswoman said Monday. King, whose beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was caught on camera and sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved, was found dead at his Rialto, California, home early Sunday, authorities and his fiancee said. He was 47. Rialto police received a 911 call from King's fiancee, Cynthia Kelly, about 5:25 a.m., Capt. Randy De Anda said. Responding officers found King at the bottom of the pool, removed him and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital, police said. Rodney King looks back without anger . A preliminary autopsy report will not be released, coroner spokeswoman Jody Miller said. The coroner will wait until a full report, based on the toxicology exam findings, is available in six to eight weeks, Miller said. There were no preliminary signs of foul play and no obvious injuries on King's body, De Anda said. Police are conducting a drowning investigation, he said. Kelly, who was a juror in King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles in 1994, told police that King was an "avid swimmer" but that she was not, De Anda said. She said the two had just had a conversation and she went inside, but came back out after hearing a splash and saw him at the bottom of the pool. De Anda said he did not see any drug paraphernalia "or anything that would indicate that Mr. King was intoxicated" at the scene. Nearly a year after the rioting in Los Angeles, the four officers stood trial in federal court on civil rights charges. Two were found guilty and sentenced to 30 months in prison, and two were acquitted. King also sued the city of Los Angeles and was awarded $3.8 million in damages.

chatgpt: Rodney King, whose brutal beating by the Los Angeles police in 1991 sparked one of the deadliest riots in U.S. history, has passed away. The 47-year-old was found dead by his fiancee at the bottom of the swimming pool in his Rialto, California, home early Sunday morning. It was a tragic end for King, whose flawed life was often marred with troubles. The police arrived shortly after King's fiancee called the emergency services, but they were unable to revive him. The police also ruled out any preliminary signs of foul play, and there were no obvious injuries on King's body. King became a household name after the infamous beating he received from LAPD officers in March 1991. The incident was captured on video and widely broadcasted. It showed King being beaten repeatedly, even after he was subdued and lying prone on the ground. The brutal attack sparked outrage across America, leading to one of the deadliest riots in U.S. history, claiming the lives of 55 people and causing a staggering $1 billion in property damage. The four LAPD officers involved in the incident were later acquitted, sparking further protests across the city. King's beating set off a wave of violence that rippled through Los Angeles for several days. The riots, fueled by police brutality and racial tensions, forever changed the history of the city. They also prompted a national conversation about police violence, racial profiling, and the need for police reform. King's life was never the same after the beating. He struggled with drugs and alcohol abuse, and his encounters with the law became a regular feature in the tabloids. He was arrested multiple times for domestic violence, drug possession, and DUIs. Despite his troubled life, King became a pivotal figure in the civil rights movement. His beating exposed the deep-seated prejudices that have plagued America's law enforcement agencies for decades. His legacy is not only that of a victim of police brutality, but also a hero whose bravery helped spark a movement towards change. Rodney King's death is a tragic loss for America. It serves as a reminder of the deep-seated cultural problems that still exist within certain areas of America's law enforcement agencies. It also highlights the need for continued activism and reform towards a more just society for all.
