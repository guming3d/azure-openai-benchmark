An eccentric aristocrat eco-activist has broken into a GM research institute in a bid to destroy controversial field trials on genetically modified wheat. Hector Christie, 50, son of the founder of the Glyndebourne opera, is said to have caused ‘significant damage’ during the raid in the early hours of Sunday. The Old Etonian inherited the 6,000-acre Tapeley Park estate in Devon and featured in the Channel 4 series Country House Rescue last year. Break in: Hector Christie is said to have caused 'significant damage' during a raid of a GM research facility . He has a long history of protest and was once arrested in Germany dressed as a potato. The target of Sunday’s break-in was the controversial GM wheat trial at the  Rothamsted Research centre in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. The wheat has been modified to emit chemical signals to drive away aphids, which the institute claims will allow farmers to use fewer chemical pesticides. However, consumers are sceptical of the benefits of such crops and as a result there is no demand for GM wheat in Britain. Protest group Take The Flour Back has been set up to challenge the trial. They are concerned that pollen from the GM wheat will spread to contaminate grasslands in the area. Controversial: The target of Sunday's break-in was the controversial GM wheat trial at the Rothamsted Research centre in Harpenden, Hertfordshire . However, it appears that Christie mounted his own protest by breaking into the laboratories. In a statement Rothamsted said the protester caused ‘significant, random property damage but failed in his attempt to disrupt the experiment’. Director Maurice Moloney described the break-in as an ‘act of vandalism’ and said the ‘illegal activity’ had taken place despite efforts to hold talks with protesters in the hope of allowing the trials to run their course. Eleanor Baylis, a Take The Flour Back spokesman, said they ‘had no information’ about the break-in but said the group was ‘relieved if the quantity of GM pollen released from the trial has been reduced’. Christie is due to appear in court on July 13.

chatgpt: A major research center in Harpenden, Rothamsted Research, was raided by a group of protesters. The group, known as Take The Flour Back, were reportedly protesting against the center's GM trials. The incident caused significant damage to the facility and has raised concerns about the safety and security of research institutes in the UK. Rothamsted Research is a world-renowned center for agricultural research, focusing on sustainable farming and the development of new technologies. Its GM trials have been a subject of controversy in recent years, with some groups claiming that the research poses risks to the environment and human health. The protesters targeted the center in the early hours of the morning, breaking into the facility and causing extensive damage to equipment and research materials. Police were quickly on the scene and managed to apprehend a number of the protesters, who will now face charges relating to the raid. The incident has caused concern among the scientific community, who fear that such attacks could become more common in the future. Dr. Maurice Moloney, Director and Chief Executive of Rothamsted Research, expressed his shock and dismay at the attack and emphasized the importance of scientific research in addressing important issues such as food security and climate change. "We are deeply concerned about the safety of our staff and the integrity of our research," he said in a statement. "Protests are legitimate, but there is no justification for the kind of violence and destruction that we saw last night." The Take The Flour Back group defended their actions, stating that they are committed to challenging what they see as the dangers of genetic modification in agriculture. However, many have criticized their methods, arguing that such attacks only serve to harm innocent researchers and employees. The incident at Rothamsted Research is a chilling reminder of the challenges faced by research institutions in the UK and around the world. It is imperative that steps are taken to protect scientific research from such attacks in the future, while also addressing legitimate concerns surrounding emerging technologies like genetic modification. The full extent of the damage caused by the raid is not yet known and it remains to be seen what impact this will have on the center's research projects. However, what is clear is that the incident at Rothamsted Research is a stark reminder of the importance of scientific research and the need to protect it from those who seek to undermine it.
