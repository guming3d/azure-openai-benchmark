chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a little girl plummeted from the window of a flat in Plymouth yesterday. The child fell around 65ft and was rushed to a nearby hospital with serious internal injuries. Despite the severity of her injuries, the young girl is said to be in a stable condition. The incident occurred at a residential complex in Stonehouse, Plymouth in the late morning hours on Monday, September 13th. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident are unclear at this time, though local authorities are investigating the incident as an accident.  Eyewitnesses reported hearing screams coming from the vicinity of the flats before seeing the child fall from the window. Emergency services were called to the scene, and the young girl was rushed to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth for treatment.  Medical personnel at the hospital described the girl's injuries as serious, but noted that she was in a stable condition. Hospital staff continue to closely monitor the patient, who is receiving specialized care for her internal wounds. The young girl's family has understandably been left devastated by the incident. Police arrived at the scene and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine the exact circumstances that led to the child's fall.
