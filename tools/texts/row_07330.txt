article: (EW.com) -- The major broadcast networks are deep in the trenches of upfronts week, rebuilding their fall lineups for the future. But some people remain trapped in the past â€” specifically last week, when NBC finally canceled "Community" after five seasons of almost canceling "Community." Rumors immediately began to circle that "Community" would get picked up for a long-prophesied sixth season by someone â€” Hulu, or Comedy Central, or I guess now WGN America is a thing? Those rumors led in turn to counter-rumors that Community showrunner/messiah/demonic inspiration Dan Harmon didn't actually want "Community" to continue. And there were probably other rumors, like the rumor about how "Community" star Danny Pudi's appearance in "Captain America 2" was intended to set up a future Marvel spin-off directed by Justin Lin where it turns out the characters on "Community" were the New Warriors the whole time. EW: Community' season 5 - A visual analysis . Harmon has now taken to Tumblr to clarify his position, in a surprisingly serene post directed at Community fans. "I'm getting tweets from some anxious sounding fans," writes Harmon, "Tweets that make me anxious because I feel like I've made THEM anxious with my silence." He admits to some reticence to continue with the show: "When Sony called me on Friday with the news, there was brief discussion at the end of the call about the concept of the show living elsewhere, and I was definitely in the 'eh' column." But don't assume too much from that: "I said 'eh' on a Friday afternoon, I will change it to a 'sure, let's talk' on Monday morning and Sony can do their thing. I'm not going to be the guy that recancels cancelled Community." EW: 'Community' canceled . Harmon cautions that "there are lots of reasons a Community resurrection could be difficult." But he also has a nice message for "Community" fans: . "I honestly think you can totally sit back and relax for this chapter. I know you don't feel relaxed but I mean you don't have to worry that someone on this planet isn't aware of this show's value to its audience. There are actually astronauts on a space station right now saying "we get it, you love Community" in Chinese. You have done your thing." It's worth reading Harmon's whole post, which features, among other things, Harmon expressing a bit of skepticism about how the new system of TV can actually wind up exploiting fanbases, "like a corporation is doing you a favor by feeding you low grade opiate through a regulated tube." Meanwhile, rumors persist that NBC is in development on a new limited-run straight-to-series British Import drama starring Katherine Heigl, Feeding You Low Grade Opiate Through a Regulated Tube.

chatgpt: Fans of the popular television show "Community" have been buzzing with excitement and speculation after rumors began circulating about a possible revival of the beloved series. However, the show's creator, Dan Harmon, has thrown cold water on these rumors, saying that bringing back "Community" would be a difficult task. Speaking to a group of reporters at a recent press event, Harmon explained that reviving the show would require a lot of effort and resources. "I mean, look, I'd love to do it," he said. "But there are so many factors to consider. We'd have to get all the actors back on board, figure out a story that makes sense, find a new network to air it on…it's just a lot." Harmon went on to express his gratitude to the show's dedicated fanbase, who have been the driving force behind the rumors of a revival in the first place. "I mean, you guys have done your thing," he said. "You've been so passionate and supportive of the show, and that means the world to all of us who worked on it. But at the end of the day, we have to be realistic about what's possible." For fans of "Community," this news may come as a disappointment. The show, which aired on NBC from 2009 to 2014, followed a group of students at a fictional community college as they navigated their way through classes, romance, and various shenanigans. Despite its cult following and critical acclaim, "Community" struggled with low ratings and was cancelled after its fifth season. Since then, fans have been clamoring for a reunion or revival of the show, fueled in part by the success of other beloved series like "Arrested Development" and "Gilmore Girls" being brought back years after their original runs. The rumors of a "Community" revival began to pick up steam earlier this year, with reports that Harmon was in talks with various networks about bringing the show back. However, even if a revival is not in the cards, fans of "Community" can take solace in the fact that the show's legacy lives on. In addition to its passionate fanbase, "Community" has also had a lasting impact on television as a whole, with its innovative storytelling, biting humor, and meta-commentary on the medium influencing a generation of shows that have followed in its wake. As for Harmon himself, he remains optimistic about the future of "Community," even if it never returns to the airwaves. "Look, we had a great run," he said. "And I'm so grateful to have been a part of it. If that's all we ever get, I'll be happy with that."
