chatgpt: In what can only be seen as a brilliant bit of foresight, Rory McIlroy's father, Gerry, has cleaned up at the bookies to the tune of £100,000, having placed a £200 bet on his son to win the Claret Jug within the next 10 years all the way back in 2004. Sure enough, young Rory fulfilled his father's dreams in 2014 when he won the Open Championship at just 25 years of age. Gerry McIlroy was reportedly over the moon when his son won the famous tournament, not just because it cemented Rory's place as one of the game's greats, but also because it meant he'd won an incredible sum of money. Two of Gerry's friends also placed bets on Rory, at £200 a pop, and they each walked away with £80,000 in winnings. The elder McIlroy was quick to point out that the bets weren't fuelled by any kind of gambling addiction - simply a belief in his son's talent. "Back in 2004, when Rory was just 15 years old, he wasn't even close to being a household name. But as a father, I always believed in him," Gerry said after the win. "I'm absolutely ecstatic. I don't think he has any idea what he's done for us!" Rory made a slow start at the 2014 Open, but roared back to storm to victory, finishing a full two strokes ahead of his closest competitor. The win marked Rory's third major championship, and many have since speculated that it could be the start of an extended period of dominance on the course for the Irishman. Despite his success, Rory remained humble about his win, saying that he was simply "happy to have my dad here to see it". Speaking about his father's bet, Rory said, "He doesn't care about the money. It's just the fact that he has the bragging rights over his friends for the next year or so." It's hard to argue with either Rory or Gerry's sentiments - a father's love and belief in his son can pay off in more ways than one. Here's hoping that this win is just the first of many for the McIlroy family.
