Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell is on trial accused of abusing the baby for about 15 hours in March last year, including inflicting third-degree burns and bruises. On Thursday, Mr Bell, denied burning the child and said that he did not recall the baby having any injuries before he took him from Broome. While testifying, Mr Bell told West Australian Supreme Court the bruises on the baby's body were presumably caused when he fell out of a moving car. Mr Bell, who knew the child's mother, said he panicked and was upset. 'I was crying because he had fallen out of the car,' Bell testified. He told the court the boy was hurt so he cradled him against his chest, but did not inspect the 10-month-old baby for injuries or take him to a hospital. 'I just tried to comfort him, that's all,' he said. 'I didn't think he was that bad.' Mr Bell said the babies burns came from touching hot rocks while at a swimming spot. He said while under the water for 20 seconds he felt a kick to his leg, and when he came up, he found the baby head-first in the water. Water came out of the child's mouth and Mr Bell, who was in shock, performed CPR until the ambulance arrived, the court heard. While testifying, Mr Bell told West Australian Supreme Court the bruises on the baby's body were presumably caused when he fell out of a moving car . 'It was like he was choking,' Bell said.'I pumped on his chest a couple of times.' 'He just wouldn't breathe.' 'It just happened so fast,' he repeatedly said. Mr Bell told the court he did not think the mother took care of her baby and admitted the pair argued the evening before the baby died. He said the altercation began when the woman humiliated and slapped him. 'I may have assaulted her. I'm not 100 per cent sure,' he said. Mr Bell said he tore off her clothes but denies trying to run her over in his car. 'I wanted to humiliate her,' he testified. The judge-alone trial continues.

chatgpt: In a devastating case that has evoked shock and disgust, Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell is currently on trial, accused of murdering and sexually assaulting a 10-month-old baby. The trial, which is being heard by a judge alone, has gripped the Australian public and has cast a spotlight on the issue of child abuse and violence. According to the prosecution, Mr Bell was the babysitter for the child on the day of the incident. The prosecution alleges that Mr Bell sexually assaulted the baby before drowning him in a bathtub. The prosecutor argued that the evidence pointed towards Mr Bell being responsible for the baby's death, including the fact that the baby had injuries consistent with sexual assault and drowning. However, Mr Bell has vehemently denied the charges and maintains his innocence. During his testimony, Mr Bell stated that he had never harmed the baby and that he had been looking after him. He claims that he found the baby head first in the water and had attempted to revive him by performing CPR. Mr Bell argued that he had called an ambulance as soon as he realized the baby was not breathing and that he had done everything in his power to save his life. Despite Mr Bell's testimony, the prosecution has argued that his account of events does not line up with the evidence. They pointed out that Mr Bell did not call an ambulance immediately after the child went into cardiac arrest, and that he had previously lied about the circumstances that led to the baby's death. The prosecution has also noted that Mr Bell had a history of sexual offenses and that his DNA was found on the baby's body. The trial has brought to the surface a number of difficult questions around child abuse and its prevention. It has highlighted the need for better protections for children and for increased awareness around the issue. The case has also sparked a debate within the legal community around the effectiveness of judge-alone trials, with some arguing that the absence of a jury can lead to bias. The trial continues, with Mr Bell maintaining his innocence while the prosecution presents its case. The heartbreaking nature of this case serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance in the protection of the young and vulnerable. As the trial progresses, the public will be watching closely, hoping that justice will be served for the baby who tragically lost his life.
