Butt-sted: A DNA sample from a discarded cigarette led the police to solve the 14-year-old crime . A man has been convicted of a violent rape committed 14 years ago after police found his DNA on a cigarette. Lerio Guerrero, 34, pleaded guilty to the rape and robbery of a 28-year-old college professor in the Lower East Village, Manhattan in 1998 after police linked him to the crime over a decade later. The cigarette was found whilst police investigated the scene of another sexual assault in 2011 where they encountered Mr Guerrero. After arresting him for trespassing and possession of a knife, they took DNA from the cigarette â€“ and discovered a match with the 1998 case. According to reports, Mr Guerrero had nothing to do with the 2011 case and was merely trying to get a closer look at the crime scene. In November 1998, Leiro Guerrero, of Staten Island, attacked the college professor as she entered her New York apartment building. After pushing in through the door, he raped her before robbing her. When he found the contents of her wallet unsatisfying, Mr Guerrero held a piece of broken glass against her neck and forced her to take him to an ATM, where she emptied her account. She managed to retrieve $800 but, still unhappy, Mr Guerrero dragged her to a second cash machine. She was able to break free and seek help. Police say DNA was recovered from blood found on the victim's jacket, left there when her assailant cut himself on the shard of glass he was using as a weapon. At the time, no-one was convicted of the attack and the case went cold. Caught: The NYPD were able to match the DNA found on the scene of a 2011 sexual assault to Mr Guerrero after which he admitted to the 1998 crime . Mr Guerrero was arrested several . times over the following years, including a drink-driving conviction and . possession of marijuana. Each time, however, he was not linked to the 1998 case. It was not until he trespassed at the 2011 rape scene and left behind the remains of his cigarette that New York . Police could link him to the crime 13 years earlier. Mr Guerrero was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty which reduced the sentence from 25 years. The case echoes a similar situation in Montgomery County, Maryland, where a DNA sample from a convicted serial rapist helped solve a 25-year-old case. DNA obtained from a scene where a 20-year-old woman had been brutally raped in 1988 was matched to a sample in the national DNA database CODIS from William Joseph Trice. In turn, this sample could be linked to two more cold case rapes of which Mr Trice had been convicted in 2008.

chatgpt: Nearly 23 years after the crime was committed, justice has finally been served for the victim of a 1998 rape and robbery in Manhattan. Lerio Guerrero, who was linked to the case through a cigarette found at the scene of a different crime, was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The victim, a 28-year-old college professor, was walking home late at night when Guerrero attacked her from behind, dragged her to a nearby park, and assaulted her. He then stole her purse and fled the scene. Despite DNA evidence showing that the attacker was male, the case went unsolved for over two decades. In 2018, Guerrero was arrested for a different crime and his DNA was taken. It was then that the DNA was linked to the 1998 Manhattan rape case, thanks to the cigarette that was found at the scene of the other crime. Guerrero denied any involvement in the rape and robbery, but a jury found him guilty in February. At the sentencing hearing, the victim spoke out about the impact that the attack had on her life. She described how she had to leave her job, move to a different city, and undergo years of therapy to cope with the trauma. She also expressed relief and closure now that her attacker had been identified and held accountable for his actions. The case highlights the importance of DNA evidence and the tireless work of law enforcement officials in solving crimes, even years after they are committed. It also sheds light on the ongoing issue of sexual assault and violence against women, and the long-lasting effects that these crimes can have on victims. Guerrero's conviction and sentencing serve as a reminder that justice can still be served, no matter how much time has passed since a crime was committed. It is also a testament to the bravery and strength of the victim, who endured years of uncertainty and fear as her attacker remained at large. As the #MeToo movement continues to draw attention to the prevalence of sexual violence, this case serves as a small but important victory in the fight for justice for victims. It is a message that perpetrators of these crimes will be held accountable, no matter how long it takes, and that the voices of survivors will not be silenced.
