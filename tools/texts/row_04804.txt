article: (CNN) -- A designer clothing store, a comic book store, a tattoo parlor and a ... women for sale store. This unusual window display shocked shoppers at a busy Tel Aviv mall last week when among the run-of-the-mill shops, they came across a group of young women standing in a storefront. On them were price tags detailing their age, weight, height, dimensions and country of origin. Organizers said the campaign is designed to bring awareness to women trafficking. It aims to collect enough signatures to pressure the Israeli justice ministry to back legislation that makes it a crime for men to go to prostitutes. This legislation is the next important step in the fight against women trafficking, said attorney Ori Keidar, one of the founders of the task force against the problem. "The legislation against the prostitutes' customers will bring a reduction in the demand for prostitution and it will be a less lucrative business for crime organizations," Keidar said. "This in turn will bring a reduction in the trafficking of women." Keidar said the legislation is modeled after similar legislation in Sweden that has drastically reduced trafficking and prostitution. Over the past decade, about 10,000 women have been trafficked into Israel in what Keidar calls "modern slavery." The women are locked, beaten, raped, starved and forced to receive 15-30 men a day 365 days a year, according to the attorney. About three years ago, Israeli police greatly reduced women trafficking by pouring resources into the problem. Security forces have also helped by stepping up patrols on the Israeli-Egyptian border as a result of al Qaeda presence in the Sinai. This 300-kilometer border was the main route for smuggling women into Israel, Keidar said. "This legislation against the customers will bring a further reduction in trafficking and with a little more pressure we can make this go away" Keidar said.

chatgpt: A new campaign in Israel is selling women with price tags attached to their clothing in order to raise awareness about the issue of prostitution. The tags display the woman's age, weight, height, dimensions, and country of origin. The goal of the campaign is to gather enough support to pressure the Israeli justice ministry to create legislation that would make it illegal for men to purchase sex from prostitutes. The "Price Tag" campaign has been launched in Tel Aviv, with women wearing the tags as they walk around the city. The organizers of the campaign hope that the tags will shock people into considering the dehumanizing nature of prostitution and the exploitation of women involved in the industry. They believe that by creating more awareness about the issue, they can begin to effect change in the legal system. The organizers of the campaign have stated that they want to see criminal charges filed against people who pay for sex. They argue that prostitution is a form of modern-day slavery, which often involves coercion, trafficking, and abuse. The campaign hopes to encourage lawmakers to create legislation that would put an end to this practice in Israel. The organizers have also set up a petition, which they plan to send to the Israeli justice ministry once they have collected enough signatures. They hope that this will prompt the ministry to take action and create a law that addresses the issue of prostitution. According to the campaign's organizers, the issue of prostitution in Israel is particularly concerning because the country has become a hub for human trafficking. Many of the women who are involved in the sex industry are brought to Israel from other countries, often under false pretenses, and are forced into prostitution. The "Price Tag" campaign has already sparked a great deal of public debate in Israel, with supporters and opponents of the campaign expressing their views through social media and other channels. The organizers believe that this is a positive development, as it is helping to raise awareness about the issue and create a broader dialogue about how to address it. In conclusion, the "Price Tag" campaign in Israel is using a novel approach to draw attention to the issue of prostitution and spark action in the legal system. While there are concerns about the effectiveness of such a campaign, its organizers are hopeful that it will create a groundswell of support that will lead to real change in the fight against prostitution and human trafficking.
