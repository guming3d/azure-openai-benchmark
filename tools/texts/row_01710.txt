article: Berlin, Germany (CNN)  -- A bomb scare that affected about 100 flights at Munich Airport in Germany on Wednesday may have been a false alarm, German police told CNN. Police launched a huge manhunt Wednesday after a passenger appeared to flee from security officers when his laptop computer bag tested positive for explosives, they said. Police originally said authorities wanted to take the man in for further testing after his bag set off suspicions, but he ran. They said a bomb squad was testing the bag to see if it really contained explosives. But authorities later said the man may simply have been in a hurry, grabbed his things and left the airport. They do not have the laptop case, they said. They are still trying to find the man, they said, but are no longer describing the search as a huge manhunt. Police earlier said they were reviewing airport security videos to try to figure out where the man went. It was not clear if that was what caused them to change their evaluation of the situation. Police did not know which flight the man was booked on. Part of the airport was shut down after the suspect fled, but was later reopened. All planes in the area of Terminal 2, where the incident took place, were evacuated and all luggage was removed, police said. The passengers had to leave the secure area and be rescreened, an airport representative told CNN, adding that the airport was otherwise operating normally. About 100 flights were affected by the security measures. Some were canceled and others were delayed, the airport said, adding that activity has slowly begun to return to normal. The airport Web site was still showing some delays to flights leaving Terminal 2 several hours after the incident. The incident took place as a United States Senate committee debated the foiled Christmas Day attack aboard a plane bound from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan. The committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, said it is "infuriating" that the December 25 suspect, Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, was able to board the plane in the Netherlands with a U.S. visa. Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, said AbdulMutallab "was not on the no-fly list, which would've flagged him to be prevented from boarding, nor was he on the selectee list, which would've flagged him for secondary screening." "Furthermore, the physical screening performed by foreign authorities at airports in Nigeria and the Netherlands did not detect explosives on his body," Napolitano said. "As this incident underscores, aviation security is increasingly an international responsibility." She said top Homeland Security Department officials are embarking on a multicontinent tour to meet with international counterparts about airline and airport security. She said she would leave Wednesday evening for Spain and a meeting with European Union officials. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Police in Minneapolis are searching for a man who allegedly left a security checkpoint on Monday after his laptop bag tested positive for explosives. According to reports, the man may have just been in a hurry and not actually fleeing. The incident occurred at Terminal 2 of the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Passengers were asked to leave the terminal and undergo rescreening, causing delays and disruptions for around 100 flights. While the man set off alarms during the security check, police are hesitant to label the incident as a "big manhunt." Authorities are still actively searching for the individual, but they believe he may have simply been in a rush to catch his flight. "We don't want people to think that we're looking for someone who's a threat to the airport or a threat to the community," said a spokesperson for the Minneapolis Police Department. "We don't have that belief or concern at this time." Nevertheless, the situation has caused significant inconvenience for travelers. One passenger told reporters that she was "frustrated" with the delay, but understood why the authorities were taking extra precautions. "It's better for us to be safe than sorry," she said. Other travelers expressed similar sentiments, noting that security measures are an important part of air travel in the post-9/11 era. Despite the disruption, airport officials say that they are working to minimize the impact on passengers. Terminal 2 has resumed normal operations, though some flights may still experience delays. The incident comes just weeks after another security scare at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. In that incident, a man attempted to board a plane with a loaded gun in his carry-on luggage. The man was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor. While the airport has rigorous security measures in place, incidents like these serve as a reminder of the importance of being vigilant when traveling. Passengers are advised to arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare, to follow all security guidelines, and to report any suspicious behavior to airport authorities. As for the man who left the security checkpoint on Monday, police are continuing to search for him. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is urged to contact the Minneapolis Police Department. The incident has left many questioning the effectiveness of airport security measures. While it is impossible to prevent every potential threat, experts say that frequent drills and exercises can help strengthen response times and minimize the impact of incidents like these. In the meantime, authorities are reminding the public to remain calm and vigilant, and to work together to ensure the safety of all travelers.
