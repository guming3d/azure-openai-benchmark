It came after a 26-year-old woman arrested at Heathrow with him was released without charge. The pair were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Mr Cantlie, who had worked for the Sunday Times, and Mr were both held hostage for a week in July. Mr Cantlie later said that one of his captors had claimed to be an NHS doctor. He told the Daily Mail that treating badly injured fighters in Syria would be good training for when he returned to the UK because he wanted to specialise in trauma. Mr Cantlie said: ‘I asked for . his help... but he refused to even send a text to my girlfriend to say . we were alive. He said he would be beheaded if he did.

The charge alleges Islam, with others, unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans against their will, contrary to common law and section 63B of the Terrorism Act 2000.

chatgpt: Journalist Jeroen Oerlemans and fellow reporter John Cantlie were taken hostage in Syria on July 17, and were held captive for nine agonizing days before finally being freed on July 26. The exact details of their harrowing ordeal have not been revealed, but it is understood that they were kidnapped while investigating the war-torn country. Their captivity sparked a massive manhunt, with authorities leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to track down the kidnappers. The search eventually led police to arrest a man named Shajul Islam on suspicion of kidnapping the two reporters.  Mr. Islam, 26, was taken into custody last Tuesday and charged with imprisoning the two men against their will, according to police sources. The arrest marks a major breakthrough in the case, and has brought a sense of relief to the families of the hostage journalists. The charges against Mr. Islam are a serious matter, and are likely to be viewed as such by the courts. If convicted, he could face a lengthy prison sentence. However, it is important to remember that the legal process is designed to ensure that justice is served, and that Mr. Islam is entitled to a fair trial. In the wake of the kidnapping, there has been widespread concern over the safety of journalists who are covering the conflict in Syria. The risks are high, and the situation is volatile. However, brave reporters like Jeroen Oerlemans and John Cantlie continue to put their lives on the line in order to bring the truth to the world. Their imprisonment serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding press freedoms, and of the vital role that journalists play in keeping us informed about events around the globe. While we applaud the efforts of law enforcement officials to bring the kidnappers to justice, it is equally important to recognize the bravery of those who put themselves in harm's way in order to do their job. It is hoped that the release of Jeroen Oerlemans and John Cantlie will be the first step towards a lasting peace in Syria, and that the country will eventually be able to move forward from its current state of chaos and violence. In the meantime, we must continue to support those who strive to shed light on the situation in Syria, and work towards finding a solution that will bring an end to the suffering of the Syrian people.
