Last game it was nine, so we are progressing. ‘I have four midfielders missing: Herrera, (Marouane) Fellaini, (Jesse) Lingard and (Michael) Carrick. So it’s a little bit thin in midfield. ‘Herrera (was hurt) yesterday in training but it is too early to make a scan.

I never had that experience before — nowhere.’

chatgpt: Manchester United's latest signing, Marcos Rojo, has been hailed as a versatile and talented defender by his new manager, Louis Van Gaal. The Argentinian player was acquired from Sporting Lisbon for a fee of £16 million, making him one of the most expensive defenders in the history of the club. Rojo's arrival at Old Trafford has been greeted with excitement by United fans, who are hoping he can help the team bounce back from a disappointing season. The 24-year-old defender is known for his ability to play in the centre of defence or as a wing-back, making him a valuable asset for Van Gaal's tactical plans. According to the Dutch manager, Rojo's style of play is "exactly what we need" at United. "He is a very physical defender, but he also has the technical ability to contribute to our attack," Van Gaal said. "I was enchanted by his performances in Portugal and in the World Cup, and I am sure he will prove to be a fantastic addition to our team." However, Rojo's debut for United has been delayed due to paperwork issues. The defender is not yet eligible to play for the team, which means he will have to wait until the next game to make his first appearance in the Premier League. According to reports, the paperwork issue is related to Rojo's work permit, which is still pending approval from the British authorities. While his absence is likely to be felt on the pitch, Rojo is taking the situation in his stride. "I am disappointed that I cannot play, but I understand that these things happen," he said. "I am excited to be here, and I am looking forward to proving myself to the fans and the manager." Rojo's signing is part of a major overhaul at United, as Van Gaal seeks to rebuild the team following the departure of several key players in the summer. The Dutch manager has already brought in a number of new faces, including Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Angel Di Maria. Despite the challenges that lie ahead, Rojo is confident that he can help his new team achieve success. "I am here to win," he said. "I know that Manchester United has a great history, and I want to be a part of that. I will work hard to help the team in any way I can, and I hope the fans will support me as I begin this new chapter in my career."
