Castrating a male dog is a traumatic but necessary procedure, for the animal and the owners – but a new era of neutering beckons for family hounds the world over. New York-based Ark Sciences has developed a compound that sterilises the dog and so avoids the need to lop off the testicles. It’s called ‘Zinc Neutering’, which involves a mixture of Zinc Gluconate,  L-Arginine (an amino acid) and purified water being injected into the dog’s scrotum. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . It's a dog's life: Ark Sciences has developed a formula that sterilises a hound within 30 days . In the mix: The compound contains Zinc Gluconate, L-Arginine (an amino acid) and purified water . Ark Sciences claims this method causes ‘permanent sterilisation with no adverse reactions needing medical treatment nearly 99 per cent of the time’. At the moment the Zinc Gluconate procedure is available for dogs three to 10 months old, with Ark Sciences expecting their compound to approved by the U.S Government for all dogs over three months old before the formula hits the shelves this year. So far 300 animals have received the treatment. The company’s website explains that the compound works by killing off sperm and permanently blocking the tubes in the testicles.

Ark Sciences admits that there have been some minor side effects in a small number of cases, such as vomiting and loss of appetite. There have been no reports so far of any long-term ill-health. The company said: ‘We followed 40 dogs for over two years and have data on many of these dogs for over five years. Since 1999, when the initial clinical studies were performed, there have not been any reports of long-term side effects.’ Surgical castration has a number of disadvantages, aside from the anguish for some proud owners of taking away part of their dog’s masculinity. The procedure has been linked to the onset of cancer, hair loss and obesity. However, it’s carried out to stop dogs overbreeding and to prevent animal shelters becoming overwhelmed. It’s also used to subdue overly aggressive dogs.

chatgpt: A new sterilisation method called "Zinc Neutering" could revolutionize the field of sterilization. The treatment involves the injection of a solution containing zinc into the scrotum, rendering men infertile for up to a year. This has sparked interest among the scientific community as well as men who are looking for a less invasive form of contraception. According to a study at the University of Adelaide, Australia, Zinc Neutering is a safe and effective way to prevent pregnancy. The researchers involved in the study reported that the procedure was painless, had few side effects and was almost 100% effective. This is a significant improvement on existing male contraceptives, such as vasectomy, which can cause pain and swelling, and is often irreversible. Zinc Neutering, on the other hand, can be reversed by flushing out the zinc solution and is cheaper than vasectomy. The zinc solution works by stopping the production of sperm. When injected into the scrotum, the zinc blocks the flow of sperm, effectively sterilizing the recipient. The procedure takes only minutes to perform and requires no general anesthesia, making it a relatively simple and pain-free alternative to traditional forms of sterilization. However, the procedure is not without controversy. Some have expressed concern over the long-term effects of the solution in the body. The safety of the procedure has not yet been fully assessed, and some have warned that there could be unknown health risks associated with it. In addition, Zinc Neutering does not protect against sexually transmitted infections, and so it is still important to use other forms of protection. Despite these concerns, the study at the University of Adelaide suggests that Zinc Neutering could provide a viable alternative to traditional male contraception. The researchers involved in the study believe that Zinc Neutering could prove particularly useful in developing countries, where vasectomy is often unavailable or unaffordable. The availability of a simple and painless form of male sterilization could also have significant implications for women's reproductive health. With more men able to take responsibility for contraception, women could have more control over their bodies and reproductive choices. Overall, the development of Zinc Neutering is an exciting advancement in the field of male contraception. While further studies are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the procedure, the potential benefits of this new form of sterilization could be significant for individuals and for society as a whole.
