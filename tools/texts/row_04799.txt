A fighter pilot was forced to turn on his weapon system in a desperate bid to locate a passing passenger plane during a near-miss incident. The F15-E jet passed just 1,200ft from the Eastern Airlines Jetstream JS41 passenger plane which was had 28 passengers and three crew on-board. The fighter pilot was conducting a 'rapid climb' at 379knots (436mph) from a low level when he was alerted to the presence of an aircraft nearby on May 16, this year. After frantically scanning the skies . from his cockpit, the fighter pilot was unable to spot the other . aircraft and switched on the gun radar to locate it. His attempt failed, but luckily the civilian plane, travelling from Aberdeen to Humberside, was already behind him. The UK Airprox Board labelled the miss as ‘Class B’ which means the safety of the two planes were compromised. In . his comments, the JS41 pilot said he thought the risk of collision was .

He said: 'The crew of the aircraft had descended to 7,500ft when the aircraft’s Traffic Collision Avoidance System have two alerts. 'The first advised them of traffic nearby and the second alert instructed them to climb immediately, which they did to maintain separation. 'The findings of the Airprox Board report concluded that the Jetstream crew’s actions were appropriate.'

chatgpt: In a startling incident that occurred on Tuesday, an F15-E jet came terrifyingly close to a passenger plane in the UK. The jet passed just 1,200ft from the Eastern Airlines Jetstream JS41, causing panic among the passengers and crew on board. According to reports, the fighter pilot was carrying out a rapid climb when he was informed of the presence of the Eastern Airlines Jetstream JS41 in the vicinity. The pilot couldn't see the passenger plane initially and turned on the gun radar to locate it. However, in doing so, the jet came dangerously close to the passenger plane. The incident has raised serious concerns about flight safety and the protocols that need to be followed to avert such close calls. Eyewitnesses claim that the passengers on board the Eastern Airlines Jetstream JS41 were extremely frightened, with many of them screaming and crying. The UK Civil Aviation Authority has launched an investigation into the incident and has sought details from the authorities concerned. The authorities have assured that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. Air traffic controllers have also been asked to take extra precautions and ensure that all pilots are aware of the protocols that need to be followed in order to avoid such close calls. In particular, they have been advised to keep an eye out for other planes in the vicinity, especially those flying at different altitudes. The incident has also highlighted the importance of air traffic control and how it can play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of passengers and crew. Air traffic controllers play a vital role in managing the airspace and ensuring that planes stay on course and do not come too close to one another. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adherence to strict procedures and protocols to ensure the safety of air travel. Pilots must be aware of the regulations and guidelines in place, and should take every possible precaution to avoid such close calls. Fortunately, in this incident, no harm was caused to either the passengers or the crew. But, it has raised serious concerns about the need for stricter regulations and protocols to avoid similar incidents in the future. The F15-E jet pilot has since been grounded pending the outcome of the investigation, and there were no injuries reported from the incident. However, the incident has brought the issue of flight safety to the forefront and highlighted the need for stricter regulations and adherence to protocols to ensure that such close calls are avoided in the future.
