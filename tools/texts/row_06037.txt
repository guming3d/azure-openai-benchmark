article: (CNN) -- Patriarch Bartholomew is the living embodiment of one of the world's oldest institutions -- the Greek Orthodox Church in Constantinople. But he could be the last to hold the title in what is modern-day Istanbul, in secular but Muslim majority Turkey. CNN's "World's Untold Stories" examines the dwindling Greek Orthodox community in Turkey and how they are faring. There has been a patriarch in Constantinople for 14 centuries, ever since it was the capital of Byzantium and the Eastern Roman Empire, ruling over the Eastern Mediterranean and much of the Middle East. To this day, Orthodox Christians around the world recite prayers to the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the "first among equals." Some describe him as the equivalent of the "pope" for the world's Orthodox Christians. But Bartholomew, who is now 70, may become the last in a line of some 270 bishops in Constantinople. The Turkish government refuses to recognize Bartholomew's title as "Ecumenical Patriarch." Twenty-five years ago, the Turkish government shut the seminary where Greek Orthodox clergy traditionally trained. Greeks who do not hold Turkish passports are barred from becoming clerics. Instead of being the spiritual leader of his faith, Bartholomew has become a symbol of the dwindling community of ethnic Greeks still living in modern-day Istanbul. There are only around 2,000 ethnic Greeks left in Istanbul. The last members of this community are gradually dying out, but they cling tenaciously to the churches and schools their ancestors built in what was once the capital of a Greek empire.

chatgpt: The future of the Greek Orthodox Church in Constantinople, also known as Istanbul, hangs in the balance. Patriarch Bartholomew, who has held the title for years, may be the last to do so. The title dates back 14 centuries, but with the closure of the seminary 25 years ago and a stark decline in the number of Orthodox Greeks living in Istanbul, the future of the Church and the position of Patriarch are in doubt.  Bartholomew has become a symbol of the dwindling community, working diligently to preserve the history and traditions of the Church. He has also been a vocal advocate for religious freedom, expressing concerns over the persecution of Christians in the region.  The Turkish government closed the Halki Seminary in 1971, which was the only school for the training of Orthodox priests in Turkey. The closure dealt a major blow to the Church, as it has been unable to train new priests to keep up with demand. It has led to a shortage of priests and a decline in the number of Orthodox Greeks practicing in Istanbul. The number of Orthodox Greeks living in Istanbul has dropped significantly, from around 100,000 in the early 20th century to just 2,000 today. This is due to a combination of factors, including emigration and discrimination against minorities. Greek Orthodox Christians faced persecution in Turkey during the 20th century, which led to many leaving the country. Bartholomew has managed to keep the Church alive and relevant despite the challenges it faces. He has built bridges with other faiths and raised awareness about the importance of protecting religious minorities. For many Greeks, he is a source of hope and inspiration in a difficult time. However, the future of the Church and the position of Patriarch remain uncertain. Without a way to train new priests or grow the community, the Church in Istanbul may eventually disappear. While Bartholomew has done all he can to preserve the Church, the fate of the ancient institution ultimately rests in the hands of the Turkish government and the Orthodox community that remains in Istanbul.
