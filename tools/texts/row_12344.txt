chatgpt: Two women from the United States have applied to the Guinness World Records for the lowest salary, hoping to bring attention to the issue of income inequality. The two women, who work as servers at a small diner in Mississippi, earn just $2.13 per hour, the federal minimum wage for tipped employees. The women, who have requested to remain anonymous, say they have been working at the diner for several years and have never received a raise. They say their paychecks are barely enough to cover their rent and bills, and they often have to rely on tips to make ends meet. "We're not trying to make a statement about ourselves, but about the larger issue of how people in low-wage jobs are struggling to survive," one of the women told reporters. According to the National Employment Law Project, nearly 70% of tipped workers in the United States are women, and they are more likely to live in poverty than non-tipped workers. The minimum wage for tipped employees has not been increased since 1991, when it was set at $2.13 per hour. The women say they decided to apply to the Guinness World Records after learning about a man in India who had applied for the record for the lowest salary. The man, who works as a security guard, earns just $30 per month. The women hope that their application will shine a light on the issue of low-wage jobs in the United States. "We want people to know that there are millions of people in this country who are working hard and barely making enough to survive," one of the women said. "We want to start a conversation about how we can do better as a society to ensure that everyone earns a fair wage." The Guinness World Records team says they are currently reviewing the women's application and will make a decision soon. If approved, the women will become the official record holders for the lowest salary in the world. The issue of income inequality has been a growing concern in recent years, with many advocating for higher wages and stronger labor protections for low-wage workers. In response, several cities and states in the United States have raised their minimum wage, and some have even passed laws guaranteeing paid sick leave and other benefits for workers. However, critics argue that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses and hurt small businesses. They also argue that some workers, such as teenagers or those without a high school diploma, may be priced out of the job market if wages are set too high. Regardless of the debate, the two women from Mississippi hope that their application to the Guinness World Records will draw attention to the plight of low-wage workers and inspire action to address the issue of income inequality.
