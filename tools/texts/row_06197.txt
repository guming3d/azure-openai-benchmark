Snared: Suspected paedophile Walter Lee Williams, 64, who was arrested in Mexico yesterday after he was named one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted . A former professor at the University of Southern California suspected sexually abusing young boys and producing child pornography was yesterday arrested in Mexico. Walter Lee Williams, 64, was captured yesterday evening while drinking coffee near a park in the beach town of Playa del Carmen, on the country's Carribean coast. He was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for charges of sexual exploitation of children and travelling abroad for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts with children. Local prosecutor Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres said it wasn't clear how long Williams had been living in Playa del Carmen. The fugitive also had an address in nearby Cancun, said the prosecutor, where he was taken and turned over to Mexican immigration officials. Mr Garcia did not say whether Williams is suspected of committing any crimes in Mexico. A federal arrest warrant was issued for the former Palm Springs, California, resident in Los Angeles in April, according to the FBI website. The indictment alleges Williams travelled from Los Angeles to the Philippines in January 2011 to engage in sex acts with two 14-year-old boys he met online in 2010, said the U.S. Department of Justice. While in the country he allegedly engaged in sex acts with both boys and produced sexually explicit photos of one of the boys. The paedophile suspect fled the Los Angeles area approximately one week after returning from the Philippines, the DoJ added. Williams was until 2011 a tenured professor studying gender development at the University of Southern California. He was also affiliated with the Buddhist Universal Association of Los Angeles, California, according to the FBI. 'Williams has an extensive history of travel throughout the South East Asia region, specifically the Philippines,' the FBI said. 'He has reportedly resided in Indonesia, Polynesia and Thailand.' The FBI had only added Williams to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on Monday. In a video about Williams posted on the FBI's website to bring attention to the case, Special Agent Jeff Yesenky said: 'I analysed the computers and the camera that belong to Williams and found child pornography.' 'He preys on the most vulnerable children,' Yesensky added.

chatgpt: Walter Lee Williams, a wanted former University of Southern California professor accused of sexually abusing two boys, has been captured in the beach town of Playa del Carmen, Mexico. The 64-year-old fugitive had been on the FBIâ€™s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. According to a statement issued by the FBI, Williams was captured on Tuesday in Playa del Carmen, a popular tourist town located along the Caribbean coastline just south of Cancun, by authorities from the Mexican Federal Police. He is accused of sexually exploiting children and producing child pornography. The former professor had been on the run since 2013 when a federal warrant was issued for his arrest in Los Angeles. The FBI launched a manhunt for Williams, adding him to their list of most wanted fugitives in 2018. Williams' whereabouts remained unknown until the Mexican Federal Police were tipped off that he was hiding in Playa del Carmen. The Mexican police tracked down Williams to an apartment complex in the Colossio neighborhood of Playa del Carmen, where he was living under a fake name. They arrested him without incident, and he is now awaiting extradition to the United States. Williams had a long history of international travel and had lived in various countries, including the Philippines, where he is accused of sexually exploiting two children between ages 9 and 12. Williams allegedly lured the boys into his Manila apartment with promises of food, gifts, and money. According to court documents, Williams photographed the boys engaging in sexual conduct with him and each other for his personal gratification. He is also accused of producing child pornography and distributing it to others via the internet. After leaving the Philippines, Williams moved to Mexico, where he continued to travel frequently. It is not clear how long he had been living in Playa del Carmen before his arrest. The FBI thanked the Mexican government and its law enforcement agencies for their assistance in apprehending Williams. Special Agent Scott Brunner, who led the investigation, said that Williams' arrest is a testament to the power of international law enforcement agencies working together to bring fugitives to justice. Williams now awaits extradition to the United States, where he will face multiple charges of sexual exploitation of children and producing child pornography. If convicted, he could face life in prison.
