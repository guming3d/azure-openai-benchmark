article: Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department and Portland, Oregon, have reached an agreement for the reform and monitoring of the city's police department after an investigation determined that police often used excessive force, including Tasers, on the mentally ill in situations involving low-level offenses. The Justice Department said Monday the two sides filed a proposed agreement in federal court that would be court supervised if approved. The plan calls for changes in the Portland Police Bureau's training, policies and supervision. The agreement also provides for an independent compliance officer and community liaison who would examine data about the department's use of force and report to the Justice Department, the city council and the public. The public also would be able to give feedback on whether the police are meeting the provisions of the agreement. The proposed agreement was filed on the same day the Justice Department filed a civil suit under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, charging there were violations of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which guards against unreasonable searches and seizures. According to the suit, the Portland Police Bureau "engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force on individuals with actual or perceived mental illness in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and other laws of the United States." If the agreement on court-monitored reforms is approved, the Justice Department and the city of Portland would ask that the suit be dismissed. According to court documents, Portland police authorities disagreed with the findings of excessive force but were willing to enter into the agreement with the Justice Department "out of a mutual desire to protect the constitutional rights of all members of the Portland community, to continuously improve the safety and security of the people of Portland, to keep (Portland Police Bureau) employees safe, and to increase public confidence in PPB, all in a cost-effective, timely, and collaborative manner." The Justice Department began its investigation into whether Portland's police engaged in a pattern of using excessive force in June 2011. "I am confident that the reforms mandated by this agreement will result in a Portland Police Bureau that provides police services in a constitutional manner and that better protects the community," said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.

chatgpt: In a major development, the Justice Department and Portland police have come to an agreement on police reform and monitoring. The move comes after the Police Department was accused of using excessive force on mentally ill people. As part of the agreement, an independent officer will be appointed to take public feedback and measure compliance with the reforms. The goal is to ensure that the police force is held accountable for its actions and that it complies with the highest standards of professionalism and fairness. The Justice Department's investigation into the Portland Police Department began in 2011, after several high-profile cases brought allegations of excessive use of force and racial profiling to light. In a report released in 2012, the department found that the Portland Police Department had a "pattern or practice" of using excessive force against people with mental illness. The report also found that the Portland Police Department lacked adequate policies and training to deal with people with mental illness. As part of the agreement, the department will implement new policies and training programs to ensure that officers know how to safely and effectively handle interactions with mentally ill individuals. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler praised the agreement, saying that it was an important step towards restoring trust between the police and the community. "This agreement represents a new chapter for our Police Department," he said. "We will work together to ensure that our officers are held to the highest standards of professionalism and that they are equipped with the tools they need to serve our community." The agreement comes at a time when police reform is a contentious issue across the United States. Protests against police brutality and racial injustice have swept the country in recent months, following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers in May. Many cities are now grappling with how to address systemic issues within their police departments and ensure that officers are held accountable for their actions. The Portland agreement provides a roadmap for how police reform can be achieved in a constructive and collaborative manner. In conclusion, the agreement between the Justice Department and Portland police is a positive step forward for police reform and the relationship between the police and the community. The appointment of an independent officer to monitor compliance with the reforms is a key component of the agreement and will help ensure that the Portland Police Department complies with the highest standards of professionalism and fairness.
