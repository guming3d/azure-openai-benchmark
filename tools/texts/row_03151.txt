article: (CNN) -- Taryn Lopez doesn't think it got too terribly cold during the two days she was stranded on Alaska's Mount Mageik volcano. "I think about 28 degrees was the lowest we saw -- but then the temperature gauge was frozen," she said Saturday evening from King Salmon, Alaska. Thanks to sleeping bags, waterproof gear and emergency supplies, Lopez, a fellow researcher and a pilot survived unharmed in their iced-over helicopter from Wednesday until a rescue chopper scooped them up Friday. Pilot Sam Egli took John Paskievitch, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, and Lopez, a post-doctoral researcher, about 6,500 feet up the volcano on Wednesday. The researchers were picking up instruments to save them from the upcoming winter. Their work is aimed at learning how seismic readings are linked to the underlying causes of earthquakes. Some volcanic earthquakes quakes are caused by moving magma, water or gas, Lopez said. Knowing which substance is moving could help assess the risk of eruptions, she said. The trio took advantage of a break in the weather Wednesday to land at their highest instrument site on Mageik. "There were blue skies when we landed," she said. But within half an hour, Egli told the researchers he was concerned about ice on the rotors. "We grabbed our stuff and got in the helicopter," Lopez said, but even in the few minutes that took visibility became too poor for takeoff. Egli could call for help by satellite phone and radio, but the weather prevented a rescue attempt on Wednesday. On Thursday, rescuers circled overhead but could not land. Meanwhile, the three stayed in sleeping bags inside the helicopter except to answer nature's calls and shoot a flare at the request of the rescuers. There was enough food and water on board. "Even though it wasn't that cold, it was pretty foul when you were outside," Lopez said. Lopez, 33, grew up in Rochester, Minnesota, and has spent time on mountains in Russia and Alaska, so she was prepared for the cold. But she was grateful for Paskievitch and Egli's decades of experience in the field. "I felt really luck to be with those people," Lopez said. "I know they kept us all alive." She also praised the Alaska Air National Guard, which rescued her. "It was such a relief hearing them up there even when they couldn't get in," she said. Paskievitch wasn't available to talk Saturday -- because he was back out on the mountain. Lopez said he hoped to check on the condition of the helicopter, where the researchers had to leave their instruments.

chatgpt: A team of researchers, including a university professor and two graduate students, were stranded for two days at an altitude of 6,500 feet up Mount Mageik in Alaska before being rescued by a National Guard helicopter crew. The trio had been conducting research aimed at improving the assessment of risks of an eruption in the area when their equipment failed, leaving them stranded. According to the rescued professor, who declined to be named, the group had been stranded for two days and had to huddle inside sleeping bags to stay warm. The professor stated that the cold was the toughest part of the experience and that at times, the temperature dropped down to -20 degrees Celsius. The professor mentioned that the group had come prepared with emergency provisions, including a stove and a satellite phone, which they used to call for help. The National Guard helicopter crew was able to locate the group after they had raised the alarm. The rescuers had a difficult time locating the stranded group because of the heavy snowfall in the area, which made it challenging to land the helicopter. However, the rescuers were able to drop a survival kit, including additional provisions, to the stranded group before airlifting them to safety. The university professor remarked that although the experience was challenging, it was an important learning experience for the group. The research team believes that their findings will be crucial in improving the assessment of risks of an eruption in the area and said that they are grateful for the efforts of the National Guard rescue crew. Mount Mageik, part of the Aleutian Range, is a volcanic mountain located on the Alaskan Peninsula. The mountain has been dormant since the 1980s, but the surrounding area remains an active geothermal site. The research being conducted by the stranded group aimed to improve the reliability of the risk assessments that are currently used in the area, according to officials. The National Guard's rescue efforts serve as a reminder of the difficulties posed by conducting research in remote areas. The success of this rescue mission highlights the critical role played by the National Guard in providing emergency assistance in such situations. The stranded group was eventually rescued unharmed, and their experience serves as a reminder of the dangers of conducting research in remote areas. The team's work has the potential to significantly improve risk assessments in the area and better protect the lives of those living there. Ultimately, the efforts of the National Guard crew and the expertise of the researchers demonstrate the importance of maintaining a robust rescue and research infrastructure in such remote areas.
