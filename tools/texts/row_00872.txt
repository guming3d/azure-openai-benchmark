chatgpt: Wayne Rooney, the star striker of Manchester United, has reportedly agreed to the fundamental details of a new £300k-a-week contract. However, the deal is being held up due to issues related to image rights. Sources close to the situation have revealed that Rooney's team is currently negotiating with the club over the usage of his image in commercials and other marketing materials. The details of these negotiations are not yet known, but the situation has created some uncertainty around the signing of the new contract. Despite the hold-up, it is expected that the contract will be signed by Wednesday or Thursday of this week. However, there is a possibility that the signing may have to wait until after Manchester United's crucial Champions League game with Olympiacos next week. The delay in finalizing the contract is not expected to affect Rooney's status with the team or his playing time in upcoming games. The striker has been in excellent form this season, scoring 15 goals in 23 appearances for Manchester United. Rooney joined Manchester United in 2004 from Everton and has since become one of the club's most legendary players. He has won numerous titles with the team, including five Premier League titles, one Champions League title, and two League Cup titles. The new contract would make Rooney one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League, with only a few other players earning more than his proposed salary of £300k-a-week. Fans of the club will no doubt be thrilled to see Rooney committing to the team for the long-term. The star striker has been a key part of Manchester United's recent success and his continued presence on the field will be crucial to their future prospects. Despite the uncertainty around the signing of the contract, it is clear that Rooney remains a key player for Manchester United and a vital part of their future plans. Fans of the club will no doubt be eagerly awaiting news of the signing and looking forward to seeing Rooney in action in the weeks and months ahead.
