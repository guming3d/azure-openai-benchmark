Japan responded immediately by recalling its ambassador from South Korea, according to a Kyodo news agency. Japan has also summoned the South Korean ambassador to Tokyo. Scroll down for video . President Lee Myung-bak, pictured, has fuelled tensions with Japan by visiting islands both countries lay claim to . The two countries have also postponed an annual meeting between their finance ministers as an apparent consequence of the visit. The islands are small, however they lie in fishing grounds which could also contain large gas deposits. Quoted by the BBC, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said: 'Today South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited Takeshima. It is contrary to our nation's stance that Takeshima is historically - and under international law - an integral part of our national territory, and is completely unacceptable.' Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, pictured, has reacted quickly to the South Korean visit . He continued: 'I believe it is necessary for the Japanese government to take a resolute stance on this matter.' Since 1954 South Korea has stationed a small coastguard attachment on the islands. The South Korean premier's visit was the first since 2008 when then Prime Minister Han Seung-soo visited, sparking a similar row. In 2008 South Korea withdrew its ambassador to Japan after an Japanese educational book claimed Japan owned the islands. And last month the diplomatic tensions were raised after a South Korean man rqmmed his truck against the Japanese embassy, in protest over the latter's claim to the islands. Security was stepped up by South Korea for today's visit, according to the country's Yonhap news agency. The tensions flared as the two countries prepared to face each other today on the football pitch at the London 2012 Olympics, playing for a bronze medal.

chatgpt: The dispute over sovereignty of the islands located halfway between Japan and South Korea has taken a contentious turn, with Japan announcing on Monday that it would recall its South Korean ambassador. This latest move by Japan underscores the heightened tensions between the two nations, which have been arguing over the islands for nearly a century. Known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, the islands are a group of small islets and rocks located in the Sea of Japan. Although the islands are relatively small in size, their disputed status has caused significant political tensions between the two Asian nations. The dispute dates back to the early 20th century, when Japan annexed the Korean peninsula and surrounding islands, which included the islands in question. However, when Japan surrendered to the Allies at the end of World War II, the islands were not included in the surrender agreement, leading to their disputed status. South Korea has long maintained a military presence on the islands, while Japan has disputed their ownership and attempted to reinforce its claims. The two countries each have their own historical and legal reasons for claiming ownership of the islands, and diplomatic attempts at resolving the dispute have thus far been unsuccessful. This latest move by Japan, announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, signals an escalation in the ongoing dispute. Motegi stated that the recall of the ambassador was a protest against a South Korean court ruling last year that ordered Japanese companies to compensate Korean workers who were conscripted to work for them during World War II. South Korea has condemned the ambassador recall, calling it a "unilateral and unreasonable" move that only worsens the already strained ties between the two countries. A spokesperson for South Korea's foreign ministry also reiterated the country's stance that the islands are an "integral part of Korean territory." The islands have become a symbol of national pride for both countries, and public sentiment on the issue is often strong. However, many analysts worry that the dispute could further escalate and potentially even lead to military conflict between the two nations. At present, both governments remain committed to diplomatic means of resolving the dispute. However, the ongoing tensions suggest that a peaceful resolution may be difficult to achieve, and both sides may need to make significant concessions if they hope to finally put the long-standing dispute to rest.
