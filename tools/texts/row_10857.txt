The pain from the injuries gave Miss Livingstone sleepless nights and has made her nervous of going outside, a court heard. Officers arrested Henry, of no fixed abode, who later appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court where she pleaded guilty to common assault and received a six-week suspended prison sentence. Mark Price, defending, said: 'When this offence happened she was faced with a crowd of mothers and pushchairs and couldn’t get past. 'So she forced her way through forcefully - it wasn’t a reckless assault.' In a statement read to the court, Miss Livingstone said the assault left her unable to sleep for three nights because of the pain and she lost her confidence when out walking. Henry was told: 'This offence was committed in a group of ladies with children around. 'The abusive language you used was totally unacceptable and resulted in the lady being totally and utterly intimidated.' After the case Miss Livingstone, a part-time shop assistant, said: 'I was with some other mums and we had seen the woman go into an off-licence. 'We had about 20 minutes until we had to pick up the children from school. 'Then the woman came down the road and approached us. She elbowed me so hard that I fell over. 'I was in absolute shock, she could have easily avoided me but she knew what she wanted to do. 'I went to collect my children from school and when I got there I burst out crying and had a cup of tea with one of the teachers who called the police. 'The next day I went to hospital and discovered I had severe whiplash and a chipped bone in my shoulder. My arm was in a sling for two weeks because of it.'

chatgpt: A woman has admitted to common assault after attacking a mother in front of her young children in Southbourne, Dorset. The incident occurred on the morning of the 21st of September, when Kirsty Livingstone, 28, was walking to her daughters' school to pick them up. In a shocking turn of events, Telicia Henry, 34, was said to have started shouting and swearing at Ms. Livingstone before physically assaulting her. The young mother was knocked down and left injured, prompting panic among parents and commuters in the area. Ms. Livingstone's daughters, Ella and Lillie, aged seven and five respectively, were present during the ordeal and were said to be in tears. The police arrived on the scene shortly after the attack and arrested Ms. Henry at the scene. She was charged with common assault and taken to Bournemouth Magistrates' Court, where she pleaded guilty to the offence. The court hearing, which took place on Tuesday, revealed that Ms. Henry had a history of mental health issues and had been hearing voices on the day of the attack. She had been off her medication for several days, which may have contributed to her behaviour. The presiding magistrate acknowledged Ms. Henry's mental health problems but stated that they could not be used as an excuse for her actions. Ms. Henry was sentenced to four weeks in prison, suspended for six months, and was ordered to pay a £50 fine, court costs and compensation to Ms. Livingstone. Ms. Livingstone spoke out following the hearing, revealing the long-term effects that the attack has had on her and her family. She said that she suffered from anxiety and was scared to leave the house alone, while her daughters were said to be afraid of going to school. The attack has sparked outrage in the local community, with many calling for tougher sentences for those who assault others in public. Online petitions have been launched calling for stricter sentences and increased police presence in the area. Southbourne Councillor, Lisa Lewis, has spoken out about the incident, stating that it is unacceptable for anyone to be assaulted in public. She has called for greater awareness and understanding of mental health issues, as well as better access to support and treatment for those who need it. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of addressing mental health issues and the impact that they can have on individuals and their families. While Ms. Henry's sentence may have been lenient due to her mental health problems, it is important that those who commit violent crimes are held accountable for their actions. Ms. Livingstone and her family deserve justice and support as they come to terms with the aftermath of this traumatic event. It is hoped that the local community can come together to offer them the support they need and work towards preventing future incidents like this from occurring.
