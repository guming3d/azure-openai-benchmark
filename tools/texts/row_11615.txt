article: It's the stuff you might expect only to see on TV or in movies -- the upbeat kind with happy endings. Thankfully, that is just what happened in Burbank, California -- the Southern California city that's home to Warner Brothers and Walt Disney studios -- as a toddler fell from three stories up into a stranger's arms and onto a box spring mattress. "It feels like I watched a TV show, like it didn't happen to me," Konrad Lightner, who identified himself as the man who caught the child and fell with him, told CNN affiliate KABC. Sunday was moving day for Lightner and wife Jennifer, a typically exhausting if not momentous endeavor. Until, that is, they spied a youngster hanging out of a third-story window of an apartment building and called 911. According to Burbank fire Capt. Peter Hendrickson, calls for help came shortly after 5:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET), after witnesses saw the child crawling out of the window. Enter the box spring. It was placed under the window, and although Hendrickson did not name the Good Samaritans, the Lightners said it was their mattress and Konrad Lightner's arms that came to the rescue. The toddler fell only to be caught, and together the toddler and the catcher fell onto the box spring. Jennifer Lightner told KABC that the whole episode "didn't seem real until he was hanging from (a) chord, because there was no way he was going to get back." It was then, she added, that the couple threw down their box spring mattress. "It (was) now up to Konrad to catch him," Jennifer Lightner added. That's exactly what Konrad Lightner said he did, putting his arms around the falling child "and lower(ing) him real fast to the box spring." Photos taken a short time later and posted on MyBurbank.com showed a man -- clad in a T-shirt, shorts and no shoes -- cradling what appeared to be his child on the box spring. Another shows the same man carrying the child, surrounded by toys like Minnie Mouse and SpongeBob SquarePants dolls and as Jennifer Lightner holds the box spring upright. The youngster appeared to be dressed in footsie pajamas, with no signs of trauma or obvious injuries. The child was transported to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, said Hendrickson of the Burbank fire department. Another photo shows a firefighter helping the Lightners carry away their box spring, and one pictures Konrad Lightner being thanked by a firefighter. Jennifer Lightner described the happening as "very surreal," all the more so considering the couple resumed the mundane task of moving not long after. "I'm not a hero," her husband told KABC. "I just walked by and just tried to help. Just something happened and were there. "We were lucky to be there." 5,000 kids a year hurt in falls from windows .

chatgpt: A child's life was saved on Thursday afternoon as a group of quick-thinking individuals came together to rescue a youngster who was precariously dangling from a third-floor window in Burbank. According to witnesses, the drama began when they heard a child crying and looked up to see the youngster clinging onto the window ledge three floors above the ground. Immediately, they called for help while pleading with the child to hold on. The situation seemed hopeless- until one of the onlookers came up with an ingenious idea. A box spring mattress was placed under the window to cushion the fall, and just in time. As the crowd was gathering below the building, a stranger appeared on the scene, running towards the building. Without hesitation, he caught the child as he fell from the third-story window, before falling backward onto the mattress. One of the witnesses, who wished to remain anonymous, recounted the dramatic incident, saying, "It was surreal. It feels like I watched a TV show or something. It all happened so fast. It was a miracle." Eyewitnesses reported that the man who caught the child was just walking by and did not hesitate for even a moment when he saw what was happening. He sprinted to the building, jumped over the fence, and positioned himself under the window with the box spring mattress, ready to catch the child. The identity of the child has not been revealed, but it is known that he was not injured in the incident. The man who caught the child was shaken but otherwise unharmed, and reportedly left the scene after speaking with police. The Burbank Police Department praised the quick thinking of the onlookers and the bravery of the man who caught the child, saying that their actions undoubtedly prevented a tragedy. "This is an incredible story of heroism and quick thinking," said Burbank Police Captain, Merrill S. Hodge. "We are incredibly grateful to everyone involved for their quick thinking and bravery in what could have been a truly tragic event. Our officers are currently investigating the matter, but they are not expecting any charges to be levied against the man who caught the child." The incident was a reminder of the dangers faced by children and the need for onlookers to be vigilant and quick-thinking when young lives are at stake. Fortunately, in this instance, a child's life was saved thanks to the courage and quick thinking of those who were there to lend a helping hand.
