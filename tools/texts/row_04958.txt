article: (CNN) -- Two Minnesota state lawmakers said Friday that they have reached a deal to compensate victims of the Interstate 35 bridge collapse that killed 13 people in Minneapolis last year. Thirteen people were killed and dozens were injured in last year's collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. State Sen. Ron Latz and state Rep. Ryan Winkler told CNN Radio that the deal totals $38 million and will be presented to the Legislature for approval. Latz said the deal would expedite compensation to victims who chose to take their portion of the settlement and waive their right to sue the state. The plan addresses a key sticking point in negotiations: preserving a state liability cap on awards to individual victims, Latz said. Winkler said victims will be able to collect up to $400,000 and people whose damages exceed $400,000 will be able to pull from a supplemental pool of more than $12 million. "There are a 182 potential claimants out there," Winkler said. "There were 13 dead, and there were 12 catastrophic injury cases." Gov. Tim Pawlenty said he would welcome the deal for survivors and relatives if the Legislature approves it. "I look forward to signing this legislation into law," Pawlenty said in a statement. "It provides needed relief and support for victims and family members directly impacted by the I-35W bridge tragedy. I'm pleased that Senator Latz, Representative Winkler, my office and others were able to work together to craft this legislation." The bridge collapsed during afternoon rush hour August 1, sending dozens of cars tumbling into the Mississippi River. Photos of the scene showed cars, trucks and a school bus lingering on the bridge's uneven remnants. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating why the bridge collapsed. In January, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said investigators studying the bridge found that 16 gusset plates, which strengthen the junctions of steel beams, were fractured. The bad gussets were found at eight joints in the main center span. "When one element began to fail, it's like dominoes falling down," Rosenker said. But he emphasized, "We have not yet determined the probable cause of this accident." The final report should be ready by the end of the year, he said. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: A deal that would speed up the compensation process for victims of the state has been proposed in the Legislature. The deal is worth $38 million and will only be available for those who waive their right to sue the state. The proposed terms state that victims can collect up to $400,000. For those who have damages exceeding this amount, they can access the supplemental pool. This deal aims to expedite the process of compensation for victims of the state, who may face difficulties in claiming compensation for damages they have suffered due to the actions of the state. The proposal has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it places an unfair burden on victims to waive their right to sue the state, while others argue that expediting the compensation process is a key priority. The current compensation process can be lengthy and difficult, and many victims may opt not to pursue compensation due to the level of bureaucracy involved. The proposed deal aims to address this issue by streamlining the process and making compensation more accessible to victims. Under the proposed terms, victims can collect up to $400,000 in compensation. This is seen as a fair amount that can provide some level of support to victims who have suffered damages. For those with damages exceeding this amount, they can access the supplemental pool, which will provide additional compensation. The deal is expected to be met with some resistance from victims and their families, who may feel that they are being forced to give up their right to sue the state. However, others argue that the deal is a step in the right direction towards making compensation more accessible to victims. The proposal now heads to the Legislature for approval. If approved, it will be a significant step forward in ensuring that victims of the state are provided with the compensation they are entitled to. The deal underscores the importance of providing support for victims and their families, particularly in cases where the state is responsible for the damages they have suffered. In conclusion, the proposed deal for expedited compensation for victims of the state is a significant development. While it may be met with some resistance, it represents an important step forward in providing support for victims and their families. It is hoped that the Legislature will approve the deal, paving the way for a more accessible and streamlined compensation process for victims.
