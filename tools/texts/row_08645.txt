article: Tokyo (CNN) -- One year after a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck northeast Japan, killing nearly 16,000 people and sparking the world's worst nuclear crisis in 25 years, the country will pause Sunday to remember the exact moment the earth shook. At exactly 2:46 p.m. local time (12:46 a.m. ET), a moment of silence will be held to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the 9.0-magnitude quake -- a tremor so great, it literally shifted the earth's axis. Observances will be held across the country, with a main ceremony at the New National Theatre in Tokyo. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda is expected to attend that event and offer remarks. He spoke to CNN recently about the country's rebuilding efforts, which represent Japan's greatest challenge since the end of World War II. Total damage has been estimated at about 25 million yen, or roughly $300 billion so far. "The Japanese people are united in working with the government to put all our might towards working on the reconstruction," Noda said this month. Read iReporters' reflections on the anniversary . "The debris cleanup, the building of temporary houses and daily support for the disaster victims -- we have been making steady progress on all those issues," he said. Besides wrecking havoc itself, the earthquake triggered one of the worst tsunamis in recent years, unleashing a wall of water that swept away lives, homes and sent millions of people fleeing for higher ground.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility was knocked offline, resulting in a meltdown of three reactors, with radiation leaking into the air and contaminated water spilling into the sea. While no deaths were attributed to the nuclear disaster, more than 100,000 people remain displaced from the towns where its long-lived fallout settled.

More than 3,000 others are still missing. But the country, the prime minister said, is committed to rebuilding and emerging as a strengthened nation. Read about the 'low-tech' disaster cleanup . "I would like to accelerate the reconstruction and by doing so energize Japan as well," Noda said. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On March 11, 2011, a catastrophic 9.0-magnitude earthquake hit northeast Japan, triggering a massive tsunami that devastated the coastal regions. The disaster also led to the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years, as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered damage from the earthquake and tsunami, leaking radioactive materials into the environment. To pay tribute to the victims of the earthquake and tsunami, a moment of silence will be held at the exact moment of the quake on its 10th anniversary. The Japanese government has declared March 11 as "Disaster Prevention Day," and the commemoration ceremony will be held at Tokyo's National Theater. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will attend the ceremony and express his condolences to the victims and their families. The disaster claimed the lives of over 18,000 people, with thousands more reported missing. Many homes and buildings were destroyed, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless. The tsunami also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and train tracks. As Japan continues to recover from the disaster, the government has been focusing on cleanup and reconstruction efforts. In a press conference ahead of the anniversary, Prime Minister Suga stated that "steady progress" is being made on the cleanup and reconstruction efforts. He also highlighted the importance of preparing for future disasters and stated that the government is working to improve its disaster prevention and response capabilities. However, the cleanup and reconstruction process has not been without its challenges. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remains a major area of concern, as the decommissioning process is expected to take decades to complete. The Japanese government has committed to supporting the recovery efforts in the affected regions, but many local residents continue to express frustration over the slow pace of progress. Ten years on from the earthquake and tsunami, Japan continues to remember the tragedy and its impact on the country. The moment of silence on March 11 is a reminder of the lives lost and the ongoing challenges faced by those affected by the disaster. Despite the challenges ahead, the Japanese government and people remain committed to rebuilding and ensuring the country is prepared for future disasters.
