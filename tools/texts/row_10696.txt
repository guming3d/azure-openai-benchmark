chatgpt: Georgia May Jagger, the 27-year-old model and daughter of rock legend Mick Jagger and supermodel Jerry Hall, shared her excitement on social media after revealing images for the iconic fragrance Angel on her Instagram account. The young model proudly posed next to promotional shots of the fragrance's signature blue bottle, which was first introduced in 1992 by Thierry Mugler. What made the moment even more special for Jagger was the presence of her mother, who was the face of Angel from 1995 to 1997. This marks the first time the mother and daughter duo have appeared together for the perfume brand, despite having previously starred in several joint campaigns. Sharing the news with her followers, Jagger wrote: "So excited to share these images for the iconic fragrance Angel. It is an honour to follow in my mother's footsteps and be part of the Mugler family. Thanks to everyone who made this possible!" In the images, Jagger is seen wearing a glittering silver minidress and high heels, standing confidently next to the perfume's unmistakable blue bottle. Her long blonde hair cascades over her shoulders, as she gazes confidently into the camera lens. Meanwhile, Hall looks stunning in a black blazer and trousers combo, accentuated by a striking white shirt and a necktie. She too appears to be delighted with the family partnership, proudly standing behind her daughter with a beaming smile. The Angel fragrance has long been a favourite of many, with its unique and recognisable scent a staple of the perfume industry. The scent contains hints of bergamot, vanilla, and patchouli, and comes in a wide range of accompanying products, such as deodorants and body lotions. Mugler is no stranger to using famous faces to promote its products, having previously worked with other iconic figures such as Lady Gaga and Beyonce. However, the decision to enlist the help of the Jagger-Hall family was an inspired one, given the models' popularity and the fragrance's long-standing presence in the market. Jagger has made a name for herself in the fashion industry over the past decade, having worked with the likes of Chanel, Miu Miu, and Versace. She has also been a regular in campaigns for cosmetics giant Rimmel London. Meanwhile, her mother Hall shot to fame in the 1970s, becoming one of the most recognisable faces of the era. She has since gone on to work as an actress, appearing in films such as Batman and, more recently, Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie. The joint appearance for Angel is likely to be a proud moment for the mother and daughter duo, marking the continuation of their family's legacy in the world of fashion and style. Fans of the fragrance and Jagger family alike can look forward to the official release of the new campaign in the near future, with the images set to appear in print and online across the globe. For now, however, the sneak peeks on Instagram will have to suffice, giving fans a glimpse of what is sure to be an iconic campaign for the iconic scent.
