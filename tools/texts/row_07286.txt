article: A teenager has been suspended from school after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager. Nikita Morrison, 13, was in a French lesson when she put the bottle of Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy on her desk while unpacking her school books. But teachers immediately confiscated the 500ml drink and within minutes she was sent home after being excluded for three days. Controversy: Nikita Morrison, 13, who has been suspended from Gloucester Academy for bringing in the drink . She claims staff at Gloucester Academy considered the soft drink to be alcohol - despite the product’s website stating it is suitable for children. The alcohol content of the drink is less than 0.5 per cent - not enough to legally qualify as an intoxicating liquor and it is sold in the soft drinks aisle in shops. Ms Morrison, who has never been excluded before, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. ‘You see kids at school drinking it all the time, even the Year 7s, there is nothing wrong with it. ‘The teachers told me I wasn’t allowed to bring it into school because it is lager. I told them it was pop but they just wouldn’t listen.’ Anger: Nikita's mother, Amanda (right), has described her suspension as 'absurd' and complained that she is now behind with her lessons . Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy contains 12 per cent beer but is sold in the soft drink aisle in shops. No ID is needed to buy it and it is officially classed as a soft drink by the UK Food Standards Agency. Her mother Amanda, 38, said the incident on Wednesday was ‘absolutely ludicrous’. ‘It is absurd, the staff were saying it was alcohol. ‘She has missed quite a few lessons now, it is ridiculous. She is special needs so she is dropping behind even more. Safe: The shandy that Ms Morrison brought into school contains less than 0.5 per cent alcohol and is sold in the soft drinks sections of shops . ‘It find it absolutely ludicrous that she is missing out on education because of a bottle of pop. ‘Despite the fact we have explained, and proven, that it is not alcohol the school won’t listen at all.’ The stay-at-home mum-of-nine added: ‘There is nothing wrong with taking that drink into school at all. ‘I tried to explain that it was my mistake and I bought it from the supermarket but that was not good enough.’ Alan Armstrong, interim headteacher at Gloucester Academy, defended the exclusion. He said: ‘This school and all schools never exclude a student lightly or for trivial reasons. Schools have a duty of care to ensure all students are kept safe.’ A Ben Shaw’s spokesman said: ‘Shandies with less than 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume are defined as soft drinks and as such have no restriction on their sale or consumption. ‘All products we manufacture under the shandy name are less than 0.5 per cent and this is stated on labelling.’

chatgpt: A 13-year-old schoolgirl in Gloucester has been excluded for bringing a non-alcoholic beer to school. Nikita Morrison brought Ben Shaw's Bitter Shandy to a classroom at the Gloucester Academy, and she says that she had no idea that doing so would result in her being excluded for three days. The product's website describes it as being suitable for children, since it contains less than 0.5% alcohol, which is not enough to be classed as intoxicating. However, it seems that the school does not share this opinion, since Nikita has been reprimanded for breaking the school's rules. Nikita claims that she was not aware that the drink was prohibited, and that she simply enjoyed drinking it. She was not drunk or disruptive, and she did not offer the drink to anyone else. However, the school has taken a firm stance on the matter, excluding her for three days as a punishment. In response to the incident, a spokesperson for the Gloucester Academy said: "We have clear rules around the consumption of alcohol on our school premises, and students are not allowed to bring any form of alcohol onto the site. We take these rules very seriously, and we will always take action to ensure the safety of our students." However, some people have questioned the school's reaction to the incident. Some have argued that the punishment was too severe given the circumstances, and that the school should have taken the opportunity to educate Nikita about the dangers of alcohol, rather than simply punishing her. Others have pointed out that the school's rules are not entirely clear, and that Nikita was simply unaware that she was breaking them. It seems that this incident has sparked a wider debate about the role of alcohol in schools, and about the best way to educate young people about the risks associated with drinking. While some argue that a zero-tolerance approach is necessary in order to maintain discipline and safety, others believe that a more nuanced approach is required, one that takes into account the individual circumstances of each case. For Nikita, the incident has been a difficult and upsetting experience, and she has expressed her regret for her actions. "I didn't mean to cause any trouble," she said. "I just wanted to have a drink that I enjoyed. I'm sorry for what I did, and I hope that the school can forgive me." Despite the controversy surrounding the incident, it seems that most people agree on one thing: that young people need to be educated about the potential dangers of alcohol, and that schools have an important role to play in this process. Whether this education takes the form of strict rules and punishments, or a more open and supportive approach, is a matter for debate. But what is clear is that young people like Nikita need to be given the guidance and support they need in order to make informed decisions about alcohol and its effects on their health and wellbeing.
