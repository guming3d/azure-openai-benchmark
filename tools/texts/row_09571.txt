Dismissed: PC Jordan Powell, who was jailed for 15 months for having sex with a domestic violence victim while on duty, has been sacked by his force . A married policeman who had sex with a domestic violence victim while on duty has been sacked by his force. Jordan Powell, 31, was jailed at Gloucester Crown Court last month after admitting three counts of misconduct. The court heard Powell, a married father of two, was arrested in July last year after sending text messages to three women asking for sex. West Mercia Police said PC Powell had now been dismissed without notice at a special case hearing chaired by chief constable David Shaw. The force’s deputy chief constable, Simon Chesterman, said in a statement issued after the hearing: 'The outcome of this case highlights the serious nature of the deliberate, calculated and predatory conduct involved and should act as a reminder to all officers and staff of the importance of maintaining professional boundaries at work. 'The vast majority of our officers and staff are honest, hard-working individuals who are dedicated to serving our local communities. 'Incidents of this nature have the potential to seriously damage the trust placed in us by those communities.' Powell, from Tipton, West Midlands, was jailed for 15 months after pleading guilty to three charges of misconduct in a public office committed between May and July 2012. Gloucester Crown Court had heard that father-of-two Powell had a 'large sexual appetite', which led him to repeatedly cheat on his wife. The day before Powell was arrested in July last year he sent - as he arrived at work - text messages simultaneously to three women asking for sex. Powell was caught when his own force became suspicious and set a trap using an undercover female officer. The officer, known only as Roxy, pretended to be a victim of domestic violence and rang police in June last year for assistance. Jailed: PC Jordan Powell, who covered up as he arrived at Gloucester Crown Court,was sentenced to 15 months in prison . Powell was dispatched to her home - fitted with covert recording equipment - to investigate her complaint. Within a couple of hours of leaving Roxy’s home in Kidderminster, Powell had sent her flirtatious text messages from his personal mobile phone, the court heard. Powell sent text messages containing kisses and flirtatious comments, asking whether Roxy had a 'smile on that pretty face'. The conversation then became more sexual, prosecutor Sarah Regan said. The PC joined West Mercia Police in October 2004 and received a written warning in 2008 for having an inappropriate relationship with a female victim of crime.

chatgpt: West Mercia Police have confirmed that PC Jordan Powell, 31, who was jailed for 15 months in September, has been sacked without notice after his predatory behaviour was uncovered. Powell, who had been working as a police officer for more than four years, was sentenced after he admitted to engaging in sexual activity with vulnerable women while on duty. He was also found guilty of disclosing confidential information and misconduct in a public office. The force's deputy chief constable, Julian Moss, has described Powell's behaviour as "predatory" and said that it was completely unacceptable for a police officer to abuse their position in order to exploit vulnerable people. "We are absolutely committed to ensuring that our officers uphold the highest possible standards of behaviour and conduct," Moss said. "Jordan Powell's behaviour was a complete betrayal of the trust that was placed in him by the public and his fellow officers." Moss also said that the force had launched a thorough investigation into Powell's conduct and had found evidence of other instances of inappropriate behaviour. "We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour from any of our officers, and we will continue to take strong action against anyone who abuses their position in this way," he said. The news of Powell's sacking has been met with relief from the victims of his abuse. One woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, said that she had been "completely taken advantage of" by Powell and that she was glad that he would no longer be able to prey on vulnerable women. "I hope that his sacking sends a strong message to other police officers who might think they can take advantage of their position," she said. "Nobody should have to go through what I went through, and I'm relieved that justice has finally been served." The case has also raised questions about the way in which police forces vet and train their officers. A spokesperson for the Police Federation, the UK's largest police staff association, said that they were "deeply concerned" by the case and that they would be working closely with West Mercia Police to ensure that all officers are properly trained to understand the importance of maintaining professional boundaries. "It's vital that we ensure that all of our officers understand the importance of upholding the highest possible standards of behaviour and conduct," the spokesperson said. "We will be working closely with West Mercia Police to make sure that this case serves as a warning to all officers about the consequences of abusing their position." Overall, the sacking of Jordan Powell marks a significant victory for the victims of his abuse and sends a clear message that police officers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and professionalism when carrying out their duties. The case also highlights the need for police forces to continue to review their vetting and training procedures to ensure that all officers understand the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and acting in the best interests of the public.
