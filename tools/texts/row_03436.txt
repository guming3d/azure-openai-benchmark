article: By . Martin Robinson . A group of Christian and Muslim parents are in revolt after they were told their children would have to attend a Hindu school that bans meat and offers regular meditation and yoga. A shortage of places in South Woodford, east London, has led to more than 20 children being placed in Avanti Court Primary School. But 11 sets of parents have declined the places, leaving their children, aged four and five, with nowhere to go this September. Row: Christian and Muslim parents are angry their children have been offered places at Avanti Court Primary School, a Hundu school that insists on vegetarian meals, yoga and meditation . Liz Beck, of South Woodford, was 'not comfortable' with the school's 'strict no meat policy' and practice of yoga and meditation, so she turned down her child's place. She added: 'Culturally it's quite different and even though we don't want to shelter our son we feel it would be difficult for him to be in that environment where it's quite different from what we believe.' Muslim mother Naz Qureshi, also from South Woodford, told the BBC Asian Network she was outraged that her four-year-old daughter had been refused a place at all six of her chosen schools. She said: 'I didn't want her to go to a Hindu school so I am surprised the council would think I would accept a faith school which I didn't even apply for.' Another parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'Tolerance of other faiths and ways of life should be taught in schools. I'm just taking exception with the fact they want to restrict my child's diet. 'I'd demand to put what I want in packed lunches, but in winter who wants a sandwich? I want my child to have a hot, meaty dinner.' Delicious: This weekly menu from the school shows what its typical lunches consist of, but parents are unhappy about the restrictions on diet because it is completely vegetarian . A Redbridge Council spokesman said: 'On the few occasions where it is not possible to offer one of the preferred schools, Local Authorities are required to offer an alternative place, which is usually based on the geographical proximity to the child's address. 'This will include any faith schools that have not been filled at allocation.' Children aged four to 11 at the school are taught the standard curriculum, as well as many specialist Hindu faith-based classes, including Sanskrit and yoga. The school website states: 'Character formation will be achieved through provision of classes in yoga and meditation, and a vegetarian diet that is healthy and freshly cooked.'

chatgpt: Avanti Court Primary School in East London has been hit by controversy after eleven parents refused to send their children to the institution due to the school's policy banning meat. The school, which has been dubbed 'vegetarian-only', has caused concern for some parents who believe their children should have the choice to eat a hot, meaty meal. One mother who wished to remain anonymous stated, "I want my child to have a hot, meaty dinner. I don't think it's fair to force a certain lifestyle upon them. I understand that some families may be vegetarian or vegan, but it should be a choice rather than a requirement."  The decision to ban meat was made by the Avanti Schools Trust Board, which oversees schools in England and Wales. The trust aims to provide a healthy, sustainable diet for its students and reduce the carbon footprint of its schools. The trust cited a Food and Agriculture Organisation report that stated the meat industry contributes to almost 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a significant contributor to climate change. However, some parents argue that they should have been given the opportunity to vote on the issue. A parent who has withdrawn her child from Avanti Court Primary School said, "I was never informed of this policy during the admission process. I feel misled and disappointed that my child's education has been affected by this." The school has defended its decision, stating that vegetarian diets can provide all the necessary nutrients for children to grow and develop healthily. Avanti Court Primary School also offers a range of vegetarian options for its students, including vegetable lasagne and lentil shepherd's pie. The issue has divided opinion among parents and the wider community. Some supporters of the school's policy believe it is a step in the right direction towards a more sustainable future, while others see it as an infringement of individual choice. In response to the controversy, Avanti Schools Trust CEO, Nitesh Gor, said, "We are committed to providing a healthy, sustainable diet for all our students, and we believe a vegetarian diet can be an excellent choice for children. We are also committed to working with parents to find solutions that work best for them and their children." Despite the backlash from some parents, Avanti Court Primary School continues to stand by its policy. The issue has raised important questions about the role of schools in promoting sustainable living and the balance between personal choice and environmental responsibility.
