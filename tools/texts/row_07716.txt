article: Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan cable television providers dropped a channel Sunday that has been critical of President Hugo Chavez, citing violation of broadcast laws. Radio Caracas Television, which lost its broadcasting license in 2007 and became a cable-only channel, disappeared shortly after midnight on Saturday. RCTV was the only station that did not air the entire speech of Chavez during pro-government marches earlier on Saturday. Diosdado Cabello, director of the national agency regulating electronic media, had called on cable and satellite providers to stop offering channels deemed to be in violation of the law. Cabello said RCTV did not broadcast the Venezuelan national anthem as required and failed to provide warnings before programs featuring violence. The channel denied the violations in a news release Sunday. It said the move to drop it was illegal and questioned the National Commission of Telecommunications' authority to regulate subscription-based TV. The government "illegally targeted the subscription services by asking them to exclude RCTV International's signal," according to the statement from RCTV. The action by the regulatory agency is illegal because "if the government believes that RCTV International has committed an infraction, what follows is to open an administrative complaint against the channel, giving RCTV International the opportunity to defend itself, as the constitution mandates and guarantees," RCTV said. Five other channels were also taken off the air, according to the Venezuelan Chamber of Subscription Television. They were Ritmo Son, America TV, Momentum, American Network, and TV Chile. The chamber's president, Mario Seijas, said the organization's position was to comply with the telecommunication rules that are in place in Venezuela. Chavez has accused RCTV of violating broadcast laws and supporting a botched coup against him in 2002. Before it lost its license in 2007, it had been on the air for 53 years and was one of several private broadcast stations that openly criticized the government. Relations between Chavez's government and private broadcasters have been tense. Last year, Chavez closed 32 privately-owned radio stations and threatened to close more than 200 others for a variety of infractions, including working with expired permits and operation by unauthorized personnel. The Venezuelan government says the closures are an effort to get all broadcasters to abide by regulations that are on the books, while station owners say the closures are politically motivated. The moves against the media have worried organizations that defend freedom of the press, as Chavez has also expressed support for legislation that would mandate prison sentences for people who commit "media crimes."

chatgpt: Radio Caracas Television (RCTV), a Venezuelan network known for its critical coverage of the government, has denied allegations that it violated broadcast laws, and is fighting back against a move by cable providers to drop it from their lineups. RCTV has been a target of the Venezuelan government's media crackdowns for years, with its critical coverage of former president Hugo Chavez leading to its broadcast license not being renewed in 2007. Now, cable providers in the country say that RCTV violated broadcast laws and must be removed from their services. However, RCTV is fighting back against these claims, arguing that they have not violated any laws and that the move to drop them from cable is illegal. In a statement released on Wednesday, RCTV said that it "rejects and repudiates the illegal decision of the cable operators" to drop them from their lineups. The network also argues that the move is politically motivated, and is part of a larger crackdown on media in the country. "This is nothing more than an act of political persecution against a channel that has always upheld the values of democracy and freedom," the statement said. The move to drop RCTV from cable comes after five other channels were taken off the air in recent days, reportedly for similar violations of broadcast laws. Critics of the Venezuelan government say that these moves are part of a broader crackdown on dissent in the country, and are aimed at silencing voices critical of the regime. Opponents of the regime have criticized the decision to drop RCTV from cable, saying that it is emblematic of the government's efforts to clamp down on dissent and control the flow of information in the country. "This is just the latest in a series of attacks on free speech and press freedom in Venezuela," said one activist. The move to drop RCTV from cable is also likely to be met with criticism from international organizations that support free speech and press freedom. Many members of the international community have already spoken out against the crackdown on media in Venezuela, and this latest move is likely to draw renewed attention to the issue. For its part, RCTV says that it will fight the decision to drop it from cable, and will continue to stand up for free speech and press freedom in the country. "We will not be silenced," the network said in its statement. "We will continue to fight for the rights of all Venezuelans to speak freely and express themselves without fear of persecution."
