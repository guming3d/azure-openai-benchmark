Another 'injured' serviceman to greet the Duchess was Leading Aircraftsman Nathan Hart, who shook hands with the 66-year-old from the comfort of one of the brand new beds. Camilla, who was wearing a pale green coat and a pair of neat tan court shoes, later shook hands with a group of excited children who had waited outside to meet her. Mr Shand, the Duchess of Cornwall's younger brother, died in a freak accident in New York last month.
