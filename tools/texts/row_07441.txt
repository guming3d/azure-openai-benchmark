article: A fridge-sized asteroid has crashed into the Moon, in the largest lunar collision with a space rock ever captured on video. Incredible video footage has emerged of the spectacular fireball created as the asteroid impacted the Mare Nubium, a lava-filled basin on the moon. Spanish astronomer Jose Maria Madiedo, a Professor at the University of Huelva, Britain's Royal Astronomical Society, witnessed the incident on September 11 last year, according to AFP reports.

At one stage, the flare was almost as bright as the Northern Hemisphere's Pole Star, according to the RAS. The flash would have been visible to the naked eye for anyone who was looking at the Moon at that moment in clear viewing conditions, the RAS said. After the impact there was an afterglow that lasted a further eight seconds, which was the longest and brightest incident of its kind ever recorded.

Bright flare: Footage shows afterglow following the impact that lasts for eight seconds . 'At that moment, I realised that I had seen a very rare and extraordinary event,' Madiedo told the RAS. Two videos have captured the event, including one which features actual footage and another that was posted by the researchers, which includes computer-generated graphics that explain the event in great detail. Madiedo's team estimate the asteroid hit the moon at about 61,000 kilometres an hour. It was so fast,the rock turned to molten and vaporised, creating the flash and a crater 40 metres in diametre. The impact energy was equivalent to an explosion of around 15 tonnes of TNT, more than triple the largest previously seen event, claimed by NASA in March 2013. As a measure of comparison, the asteroid that hit Chelyabinsk, Russia, in February last year, is believed to have been about 20 metres wide, weighing 13,000 tonnes. It is considered to have been at the lower end of medium-sized asteroids. Madiedo and colleagues estimate the rock had a mass of around 400 kilograms, with a diameter of between 60 centimetres and 1.4 metres. The team  of researchers estimate that asteroids of this size may strike Earth about 10 times more frequently than was initially thought. However Earth is protected by its atmosphere and asteroids of this size burned up as meteors. The Spanish observation is published in the RAS journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

chatgpt: In a breakthrough discovery in the field of astronomy, a Spanish astronomer has filmed the impact of an asteroid on the moon. The event which occurred on the 7th of September created the longest and brightest afterglow ever recorded, leaving the scientific community endlessly intrigued. According to reports, the asteroid hit the moon at an astonishing speed of 61,000 kilometres an hour, resulting in a powerful explosion and shockwaves that rippled across the surface of the moon. Dr. Jose Maria Madiedo, an astronomer at the University of Huelva in Spain, captured the event using high-resolution cameras which were set up to monitor the lunar surface in real-time. “This is the largest and longest glow from a lunar impact seen to date,” said Madiedo. “Usually, lunar impacts are faint and brief, but this one was so intense that we were able to observe it for almost eight seconds. It was almost as bright as the Pole Star, which made it easy to see, even with a small telescope.” The footage from the observation site, which is located on the southern coast of Spain, has been hailed globally as one of the most remarkable occurrences in the history of lunar studies. Astronomers and other experts have been carefully analysing the footage, seeking to understand the composition and characteristics of the asteroid itself. According to experts, the asteroid is estimated to have been at least a metre in diameter, and the force of its impact caused a crater which measured about 10 metres wide. The explosion also released a significant amount of energy, equivalent to that of approximately 15 tonnes of TNT. Other observations from the footage have provided valuable insights into the mechanics of lunar impacts. For instance, despite the asteroid hitting the moon's surface at an extremely high speed, it only penetrated a depth of about 40 centimetres, highlighting the resilience of lunar rocks and confirming the protective role of the moon against asteroid strikes on Earth.  Dr. Jose Maria Madiedo, who was thrilled with the extraordinary discovery, said he plans to continue his observations of the lunar surface in the hope of capturing more significant astronomical events. Overall, the latest revelations from the lunar impact assessment project are bringing humankind a step closer to unraveling the mysteries of the universe. As scientists continue to uncover wonders in the field of astronomy, the world can only wait with bated breath for more information about the asteroid and what it may mean for the future of space exploration.
