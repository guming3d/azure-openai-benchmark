article: (CNN) -- Canada came to a standstill when a gunman killed a soldier outside a war memorial in Ottawa -- then stormed into parliament, sending lawmakers hiding behind barricaded doors. The incident has raised a concern: how secure is the nation's seat of power. A patchwork of jurisdictions . Unlike in the United States where the Capitol police is responsible for security at the U.S. Capitol, four different agencies are charged with ensuring the safety of various parts of the parliament building in Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police -- the national police force -- covers the parliament grounds while a House security detail is in charge of buildings under the House jurisdiction. A Senate security detail is responsible for one area of the building while the Ottawa Police keeps an eye on the surrounding streets. This could make communication a major challenge. Two years ago, Canada's auditor general issued a report recommending a unified security force. It wasn't acted upon. Communication breakdown? Authorities investigating Wednesday's attack will likely look at why the security agencies at the parliament did not tighten security after Ottawa police received a 911 call at nearby National War Memorial. It is there that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed Nathan Cirillo, a reservist guarding a tomb for the country's fallen, injured two others and then headed for the parliament. John Manley, a former deputy prime minister, said it's too early to make conclusions on whether there was a communication breakdown. "In order to assess whether there was a failure of the security or whether it was inadequate, we need to know more about what happened," Manley told the Globe and Mail newspaper. "But if this is linked to religious extremism, we've significantly changed the security game in Canada." Easy access . Visitors have to go through metal detectors, but once they go through one set, they have easy access to most parliamentary offices. It's unclear how the gunman got past the metal detectors and into the building. "Somebody who decides that they want to rush the building can walk up ... and then rush into the building before anybody can really effectively do anything," lawmaker Marc Garneau told CNN partner network CTV. He would like to see the security checkpoints moved to the "edges of the parliamentary precinct, so that when people enter onto the grounds itself, they've already been screened." Intensified security . In the past two decades, Canada has intensified security in government buildings after a man drove a bus into Parliament Hill in 1989. In 2009, environmental protesters made it to the top of two buildings. Each incidents led to calls for more security restrictions. A delicate balance . Still, lawmakers are loathe to see draconian measures imposed that will limit public access in favor of greater security. "I just think what's really important to remember from this is that Parliament Hill is an incredible public place that's open for people to play football and come and protest and sit and have their lunches, do their yoga," Charlie Angus told CTV.

chatgpt: Canada's seat of power, the Parliament Hill, is known for its impressive architecture and historical importance, but it's also one of the most secured buildings in the country. The Parliament Hill is home to Canada's federal government, and it houses the House of Commons, the Senate, and offices of elected officials. The impressive structure, with its Gothic-style buildings and central Peace Tower, is surrounded by numerous layers of security. Security cameras, metal detectors, and physical barriers discreetly placed in and around the building, are some of the multiple measures put in place to ensure the safety of everyone who visits the Parliament Hill. However, in recent years, concerns about the balance between security and public access to the building have risen. Government officials believe that while it is essential to secure the building and its occupants, it is equally important to get the balance right, given that it is ultimately the people's house. In the past two decades, the Canadian government has stepped up security in government buildings, including the Parliament Hill, following several high-profile security incidents. The September 11 attack in the United States was a catalyst for governments worldwide to review security protocols in public buildings. The Canadian government enacted legislation to create the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the Integrated Terrorism Assessment Center to help deal with security threats. Ottawa, the capital city, also implemented the Security Perimeter, which enables a large area of the city center to be secured during key events. The current security measures put in place at the Parliament Hill have also been a result of several security incidents. Most notably, the October 2014 Parliament Hill attack, in which a man shot and killed a soldier before entering the building, resulting in a lockdown and the evacuation of the building. The ongoing struggle to establish the right balance between public access and the security of the building has been a cause for concern for the public, particularly tourists who visit the Parliament Hill. However, the Canadian government has taken measures to increase public access while maintaining security. For instance, the Canadian government has made some of the areas surrounding the Parliament Hill open to the public, enabling visitors to enjoy the landmark from a distance while still keeping the entire building secure. Furthermore, to increase public access, guided tours have been introduced, ensuring that visitors can learn about Canada's democracy and its architectural history while still adhering to the necessary security measures. Canada has always been known for its open, inclusive society, and balancing security measures with public access to landmarks such as the Parliament Hill is the Government's continuous work in progress. As the need for tightened security becomes more significant, the Government is also placing a premium on ensuring that the public continues to have access to its seat of power.
