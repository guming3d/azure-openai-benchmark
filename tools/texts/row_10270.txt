Chinese government have repeatedly infiltrated the computer . systems of U.S. airlines, technology companies and other firms . involved in the movement of U.S. troops and military equipment, . a U.S. Senate panel has found. The Senate Armed Services Committee's year-long probe, . details of which were made public on Wednesday, found that the . military's U.S. Transportation Command, or Transcom, was aware . of only two out of at least 20 such cyber intrusions within a . single year. The committee's investigation also found gaps in reporting . requirements and a lack of information sharing among U.S. government entities. That in turn left the U.S. military largely . unaware of computer compromises of its contractors, it found. A US Senate report says there were about 50 hacker intrusions into a single military contractor's computers over a 12-month period . 'Unit 61398' of the Peoples Liberation Army of China is reportedly the site of origin for hacking attacks, but the Chinese government denies it . 'These peacetime intrusions into the networks of key defense . contractors are more evidence of China's aggressive actions in . cyberspace,' Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the . committee's chairman, said in releasing the report. The investigation focused on the U.S. military's ability to . seamlessly tap into civilian air, shipping and other . transportation assets for rapid troop deployments and the timely . arrival of supplies from food to ammunition to fuel. In a 12-month period beginning June 1, 2012, there were . about 50 intrusions or other cyber events into the computer . networks of Transcom contractors, the 52-page report stated. At least 20 of those were successful intrusions attributed . to an 'advanced persistent threat,' a term used to designate . sophisticated threats commonly associated with governments. All . of those intrusions were attributed to China, the report stated. Senate Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the committee's top . Republican, called for a 'central clearinghouse' that makes it . easy for contractors, especially small businesses, to report . suspicious cyber activity. Among the investigation's discoveries was that a 'Chinese . military intrusion' into a Transcom contractor between 2008 and . 2010 'compromised emails, documents, user passwords and computer code.' At least 20 cy ber attacks were attributed to an 'advanced persistent threat' and linked to China . In 2012, an intrusion was made into multiple systems of a . commercial ship contracted by Transcom, the report said. The Senate probe could further increase tensions between the . two world powers over cyber spying. Officials with the Chinese embassy in Washington were not . immediately available to comment. The results of the investigation were revealed months after . U.S. authorities in May charged five Chinese military officers . and accused them of hacking into American nuclear, metal and . solar companies to steal trade secrets. Last month, Community Health Systems, one of the . largest U.S. hospital groups, said Chinese hackers had stolen . Social Security numbers and other personal data from some 4.5 . million patients.

chatgpt: A Senate report has brought to light the alarming number of cyber intrusions into a single military contractor's computers. According to the report, there were approximately 50 incidents in the span of 12 months, which compromised a significant amount of sensitive data. The exact identity of the military contractor remains undisclosed, but the report highlights how the company's computers were breached multiple times, resulting in the theft of emails, documents, user passwords, and computer code. In May this year, the United States charged five Chinese military officers with hacking into American nuclear, metal, and solar companies to steal trade secrets. Michigan Democrat, Gary Peters, has criticized China's aggressive actions in cyberspace, stating that "we must continue to quarantine corporate and government networks from Chinese intrusion." The Senate report on the cyber intrusions has further highlighted the scale of China's hacking operations, which have been ongoing for years. The report emphasizes the need for better cybersecurity measures and a more robust response to state-sponsored hacking attempts. The report's findings come amid growing tensions between the United States and China on multiple fronts, including trade, territorial disputes, and human rights issues. Cyber espionage has been a growing concern for many years, with both countries accusing each other of engaging in hacking and cyberattacks. In response to the recent cyber intrusions, many cybersecurity experts are calling for stricter government regulations to protect companies and the public from cyber adversaries. The Senate report notes that the contractor in question was compliant with government-mandated security measures, yet it was still vulnerable to attacks. The security breach comes at a time when cyberattacks are becoming more prevalent and sophisticated. Companies and government institutions have been investing heavily in cybersecurity measures to prevent these attacks, but the report suggests that more needs to be done to stay ahead of the curve. It is hoped that the findings of the Senate report will serve as a wake-up call for both the government and the private sector to take cybersecurity seriously. With state-sponsored hackers becoming increasingly brazen and creative, there is a clear need to invest in robust and proactive cybersecurity measures. In conclusion, the Senate report has exposed the scale of cyber intrusions into a single military contractor's computers and highlighted the growing threat of state-sponsored hacking attempts. With tensions between the United States and China showing no signs of abating, there is an urgent need to adopt more stringent cybersecurity measures to protect companies, government institutions, and society as a whole.
