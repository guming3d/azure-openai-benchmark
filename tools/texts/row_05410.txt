article: ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Scientific tests prove bones housed in the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome are those of the apostle St. Paul himself, according to Pope Benedict XVI. Pope Benedict XVI looks at the tomb of St. Paul at the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome in 2007. "Tiny fragments of bone" in the sarcophagus were subjected to carbon dating, showing they "belong to someone who lived in the first or second century," the pope said in a homily carried on Italian television. "This seems to confirm the unanimous and undisputed tradition that these are the mortal remains of the Apostle St. Paul," Benedict said in Sunday's announcement. The tomb also holds "traces of a precious linen cloth, purple in color and laminated with pure gold, and a blue colored textile with linen filaments," the pope said. The tests were carried out by inserting a probe into a small opening in the sarcophagus, "which had not been opened for many centuries," the pontiff said. The probe "also revealed the presence of grains of red incense and traces of protein and limestone." Separately, archaeologists have uncovered an image of St. Paul which "could be considered the oldest icon of the apostle known to date," the Vatican's official newspaper reported Sunday. The painting, in the St. Tecla Catacomb, is "among the oldest and best-defined figures from ancient Christianity," according to the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology, L'Osservatore Romano reported. St. Paul is one of the most significant figures in Christianity. Originally a persecutor of early Christians, he became a follower of Jesus after seeing a vision on the road to Damascus, according to Christian tradition. "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" the vision of Jesus asks Paul, using the apostle's birth name, in the Acts of the Apostles. Saul then took the name Paul and became a missionary. His letters, or epistles, to early Christian communities around the Mediterranean form a significant portion of the New Testament. Paul was beheaded by Roman authorities sometime between 65 and 67 A.D., according to the Catholic Church. He was buried a few miles away, and when the Roman Empire stopped persecuting Christians some 250 years later, the Emperor Constantine had a basilica built over his grave. It currently lies under a marble tombstone bearing the Latin inscription PAULO APOSTOLO MART (Apostle Paul, martyr), according to the Web site of the basilica. A papal altar stands over the tombstone, which is visible through a window-like opening, the Web site says. Monday marks the end of a year of celebration in honor of the 2,000th anniversary of St. Paul's birth. It also happens to be the feast day of Saints Peter and Paul. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.

chatgpt: After years of speculation and testing, the Vatican has confirmed that the bones found in a tomb believed to belong to St. Paul are indeed his, according to a statement released by Pope Francis. The announcement was made after scientific tests were performed on the bones, which were found in the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls in Rome. The tests were conducted by inserting a probe into a small opening in the sarcophagus holding the remains of St. Paul. After scanning the bones, experts were able to confirm that they date back to the first or second century and belong to a man who died at approximately age 60, which is consistent with the age of St. Paul when he passed away. The Vatican also revealed that the tomb holds "traces of a precious linen cloth," which is thought to have been used to wrap the bones of St. Paul. The linen cloth was analyzed and determined to date back to the first century, further supporting the belief that the bones belong to the apostle. The discovery and subsequent confirmation of the bones of St. Paul is a significant discovery for the Catholic Church. St. Paul, who was a vital figure in the early Christian Church, is known for his missionary work throughout the Mediterranean region and his numerous writings, which inspired and shaped Christian theology. Throughout history, many have questioned whether the bones found in the tomb were truly those of St. Paul. However, the Vatican's latest announcement puts any doubts to rest and further solidifies the Church's belief in the importance of relics and their connection to spiritual figures. In his statement, Pope Francis emphasized the significance of the discovery, stating that "this provides a valuable opportunity for the faithful to deepen their faith and understanding of St. Paul's life and legacy." He also thanked those involved in the scientific testing and excavation of the tomb. The discovery of the bones of St. Paul is just one of many recent archaeological explorations taking place in Rome. In recent years, researchers have uncovered an array of ancient relics and tombs, including one believed to belong to St. Peter, one of Jesus' disciples and the first pope. Overall, the discovery of the bones of St. Paul marks an important moment in the history of the Catholic Church and provides further insight into one of Christianity's most important figures. With ongoing research and exploration taking place, it's likely that more significant discoveries will be made in the years to come, further illuminating the rich history and heritage of the Church.
