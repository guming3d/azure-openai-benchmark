Horror in the nursery: The two-year-old girl was spotted with the class A drug during a play session at Charlestown and Lower Kersal Sure Start Centre (pictured) in Salford . She was one of eight youngsters attending Oakland Day Nursery at the centre, on St Aidan’s Road. Salford mayor Ian Stewart said staff had acted ‘quickly and professionally’ by removing the package and informing police. He said: 'The package was intact and still sealed so thankfully there was no indication that any children had been harmed by the powder. However, we do take situations like this very seriously and we are doing all we can to support the police with their investigation.' The children are understood to have been in a public area of the Sure Start centre at the time, and were being supervised by two members of nursery staff. The class A drug was discovered and immediately sent to the police, who are investigating . The horrified mother of one toddler who was in the class said: 'I got a call saying that they had found a bag of cocaine and they had no idea where it came from. 'It’s disgusting. It’s a nursery. You expect your kid to be safe when they are there and you place your trust in them.' Julia Johnston, manager at the Oakland Day Nursery, said: 'Safeguarding procedures were, as always, in place. The safety of our children is paramount. Our staff are very vigilant and spotted that the girl was holding the bag straight away.' Detective Chief Inspector Dave Riddick said: 'We understand that any parent will be concerned by this, but I want to reassure them that no child was harmed. 'Also there is no indication that anyone has been using or dealing drugs in the centre’s grounds. Inquiries are ongoing.' The centre, housed in a newly refurbished building in Lower Kersal Primary School, offers a baby clinic, baby massage and parents group as well as other family-based group sessions.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident at a play group in Salford, Greater Manchester, a little girl was spotted holding a bag of powder. Horrified staff members immediately contacted the police, who are now conducting an investigation to determine what the substance might be and where it came from. The incident occurred last Thursday afternoon, as several children played together at a local play group. One staff member noticed the little girl holding a small bag of white powder and immediately approached her to ask what it was. The girl, who appeared to be around five or six years old, hesitated before saying that she wasn't sure. Quick-thinking staff members took the bag away and reported the incident to the police, who arrived shortly afterwards to collect the bag and speak with the staff and parents. The girl's parents were called to the play group and were reportedly "very surprised and concerned" by the incident. Local authorities have declined to comment on the investigation, but sources say that police are currently testing the bag of powder to determine what it is and whether it poses any danger to children. The play group has since been closed for safety reasons, and parents are advised to keep their children away until further notice. News of the incident has sparked widespread concern among parents and community members in Salford, who worry about the safety of children in their neighborhoods. Local politicians and community leaders have called for increased awareness and vigilance when it comes to the safety of children in play groups and other public spaces. In a statement, Salford City Council leader John Merry said: "We are deeply concerned about this incident and are working closely with the police to ensure that all necessary precautions are taken to ensure the safety of children in our city. "We urge parents to remain vigilant and report any concerns they may have about the safety of their children, and we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all children in our city are safe and protected." It remains unclear at this time how the bag of powder ended up in the hands of the little girl, and police have not announced any suspects or leads in the investigation. However, officials say that they are taking the incident very seriously and are doing everything in their power to ensure that justice is served and that similar incidents do not occur in the future. In the meantime, parents in Salford and other nearby cities and towns are advised to exercise caution when it comes to the safety of their children in play groups and public spaces. Officials say that anyone who sees anything suspicious or concerning should contact the police immediately, as this could help prevent potential harm or danger to children.
