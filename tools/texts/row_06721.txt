article: (CNN) -- Forget the new black. This is the real black. A British nanotech company has created what it says is the world's darkest material. It is so dark the human eye can't discern its shape and form, creating what has been called a black hole. Vantablack, made out of carbon nanotubes, is designed by Surrey NanoSystems and absorbs 99.96% of all light that hits it. Conventional black, such as black paint or fabric, absorbs between 95% and 98% of light. The company says Vantablack was the darkest material ever tested by the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, as well as the Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. The material is made up of millions of carbon nanotubes, each measuring two or three nanometers -- or roughly one millionth of a millimeter. It is grown on aluminium foil. Creases and bumps on the foil are easily picked up by the human eye. But once covered with Vantablack, all wrinkles and roughness seem to disappear. "Some people describe it as a hole, because there is literally not enough light coming from the surface to allow the eye to discern the contours that are in that foil," Surrey NanoSystem's Steve Northam told CNN. Sound like the ultimate slimming little black dress? Actually, no. A Vantablack dress would render the curves and contours of the human body invisible and cause "the wearer to look like a two-dimensional cardboard cut out," Northam said. Instead, the material is designed to help air-borne cameras, telescopes and infrared scanning systems work more efficiently by reducing stray light. Military clients are lining up to buy it, as is the space industry. The benefits, Northam said, are that "your systems can see fainter objects further away, you improve the sensitivity and you improve the signal to noise ratio in these systems." The material, whose development was backed by the UK's Technology Strategy Board, was launched at this year's Farnborough Airshow in southern England. According to Ben Jensen, chief technology officer of Surrey NanoSystems, it was a "major breakthrough by UK industry in the application of nanotechnology to optical instrumentation." So far, Surrey NanoSystems has only grown Vantablack on foil. It plans to grow it different materials and on three dimensional shapes. Read more: Britain's spaceport ambitions revealed .

chatgpt: Surrey NanoSystems, a British nanotech company, has successfully created the world's darkest material, which absorbs 99.96% of all light that hits it. Named Vantablack, this revolutionary material is poised to change the game in the field of infrared scanning systems and airborne cameras. In the quest for efficient systems, these cameras and scanners require materials that can absorb stray light and improve their efficiency in capturing images. Vantablack comes as the solution to this challenge. Its ability to absorb all but 0.04% of light energy makes it a perfect addition to these systems. Vantablack's unique properties are attributed to its layers of microscopic carbon nanotubes. When light hits this coating, it penetrates the tubes, reflecting and being absorbed along the way. This allows it to achieve one of the highest absorption rates ever recorded, giving it unique properties that no other materials can match. Apart from the previously mentioned applications, Vantablack is also projected to have exciting new possibilities in various fields such as aerospace and architecture. Architects can use Vantablack to create optical illusions that mimic the voids of space, which adds a new dimension to building design possibilities. Similarly, aerospace experts have expressed excitement about Vantablack's ability to enhance the stealth capabilities of military planes. The application of Vantablack on a jet could entirely change its visibility to the naked eye, making it appear as if it's part of the sky itself. Furthermore, the rare material has also found its way to the field of art, where it's been used to create various optical illusions. Artists have praised Vantablack for its ability to distort and manipulate space in ways that conventional materials have failed. The Surrey NanoSystems team is excited to see the many new applications that Vantablack's discovery will unveil going forward. Since its creation, the team has received requests from different industries that seek to understand the new possibilities for their sectors. Therefore, the team is continuously innovating to make Vantablack applicable to various sectors that require such properties. In conclusion, Vantablack is a revolutionary material that has redefined light absorption capabilities, making it the world's darkest material. Whether used in camera systems or architectural designs, its unmatched absorption rates between light and matter have given it exceptional properties that have endless possibilities.
