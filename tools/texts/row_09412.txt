chatgpt: After days of an extensive search for missing hiker, Mike Herdman in California's Los Padres National Forest, authorities have announced that the rescue effort will be scaled back. The search crews have put in almost 5,000 hours of work while scouring the vast forest area on foot, horseback, and by air, covering an estimated 50 square miles in search of the missing man. Herdman, who was camping with a friend, ran after his dog, Duke, who ran away on June 13. The 36-year-old chased after his pet barefoot and wearing only shorts, and since then, there have been no traces of him. Concerns about his safety have risen as it is believed Mike may not have had enough supplies to deal with the harsh conditions of the forest. The search crew was optimistic after the discovery of Duke on Sunday in the parking lot where Herdman had parked his vehicle. However, there have been no indications or clues regarding Herdman's whereabouts. As a result, the search efforts will now be scaled back, and authorities have warned the public to be cautious. Authorities have urged people to stay away from the area, which remains a vast expanse of land susceptible to a range of challenging environmental conditions. The discontinuation of the search does not mean that authorities are giving up on finding Mike entirely. Any new leads that turn up regarding his whereabouts will be followed up by the search crew. One possibility is that Mike may have been injured or incapacitated, unable to move, and out of the reach of the search team. The idea of someone lost in a vast, dense forest without adequate supplies is frightening, and the search operators have expressed their hope that Mike will be found alive and well. The search for Mike Herdman has been one of the most extensive rescue efforts in recent times, involving multiple search teams with different roles, like foot patrols, horseback patrols, and aerial search teams. The search has been arduous, but the search team remains optimistic that a lead will be found, and Mike will be rescued. As the search is scaled back, the hope is still high that Mike Herdman will be found alive and well. Meanwhile, the authorities have requested anyone with potential leads or information to come forward, and the search crew will be keenly looking to make sure no lead is left unexplored.
