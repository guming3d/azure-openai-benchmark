article: (CNN) -- Mobile users who have gotten used to chatting with their friends via Facebook will soon have to make sure they've downloaded the social-media giant's app designed specifically for that. Facebook has begun notifying mobile users that they'll no longer be able to text via its core app. Instead, they'll need to download Messenger, the dedicated texting app Facebook rolled out in 2011. The company started notifying some users last week. The update will roll out first to Android and iOS users in a handful of European countries, according to a Facebook spokeswoman. "Messenger is a much faster and better experience and we've found that people get replies 20% faster on Messenger than on Facebook," the spokeswoman said in an e-mail. "Taking messages out of the Facebook app also lets us focus on making Messenger even better for everyone rather than working on two separate Facebook messaging experiences." In November, after Facebook launched Messenger 3.0, the company discontinued messaging in the core Facebook app for people who already had Messenger. The good news for people still using just the Facebook app is that they'll be able to message friends in much the same way they do now. Once both apps are installed, tapping the "message" icon on the Facebook app will simply send the user to Messenger. They'll be able to return via a "return to Facebook" icon. Facebook and mobile messaging have been linked in many folks' minds since last month, when the company shelled out a staggering $19 billion for WhatsApp, a texting app far more popular overseas than it is in the United States. Despite speculation, Facebook said at the time that it has no plans to merge WhatsApp, which lets users send unlimited messages for no more than 99 cents a year, with Messenger. Both are part of a maturing set of apps that are marginalizing cellular plans that charge for texting. Unlimited texting is already standard with many mobile plans in the U.S., but not so much in places like India, Africa and South America, where WhatsApp is most popular.

chatgpt: Facebook has made the decision to require users to utilize its separate texting app, Messenger, for sending messages. The social media giant started notifying users of the change last week, and the new requirement is expected to take effect in the coming months. This news may come as a shock to some users who have become accustomed to sending messages from within their Facebook app. If you don't already have the Messenger app downloaded, you will need to do so in order to send messages going forward. Previously, users could perform all messaging functions within the Facebook app, but this will no longer be the case. If you already have both apps, then you will not experience any changes. According to Facebook, the new requirement is a part of an effort to simplify and streamline messaging for users. Messenger is currently packed with features that are not available within the traditional Facebook app, and the company is hoping that requiring its use will help users discover the benefits of the platform. Some users have expressed concerns about privacy, as Messenger requests access to information such as the camera, microphone, and contacts on a user's smartphone. However, Facebook has made assurances that the app is secure and that users' information is protected. The company has also pointed out that most messaging apps require similar access. Many users have already made the switch to Messenger and are enjoying the app's features. The platform offers real-time chat, voice and video calls, games, and other interactive features. Additionally, users can easily share photos, videos, and other content with each other on the app. It remains to be seen how users will react to this change, but it seems likely that the vast majority will eventually make the switch to Messenger. Facebook has made a calculated decision in requiring the use of the app, and it will undoubtedly lead to increased usage and engagement. In conclusion, users of Facebook's messaging platform will soon be required to use the Messenger app for sending messages. This change is part of an effort to streamline messaging and offer users new features and benefits. Although some users may experience privacy concerns, Facebook has stated that the app is secure and protected. If you haven't already done so, it's time to download Messenger and start enjoying its many benefits!
