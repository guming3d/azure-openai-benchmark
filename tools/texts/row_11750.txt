article: Since mid-August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed more than 100 cases of Enterovirus D68 in 12 states: Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, New York and Oklahoma. Yet the real number of severe respiratory illnesses caused by this virus is probably even higher, the CDC says. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in the early fall. The CDC estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year. These viruses usually present like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But Enterovirus D68 appears to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. "Children less than 5 years old and children with underlying asthma appear to be at greatest risk of having medical complications from EV-D68," Oklahoma epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. "If a child develops a cold or a cough, parents and caregivers should just watch the child a little more closely. ... If wheezing or asthma-like symptoms develop, medical care should be accessed immediately." What parents should know . The virus is hard to track, as many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms and hospitals generally do not test for specific types. But the CDC has asked hospitals across the country to send in samples if workers suspect that Enterovirus D68 has caused a patient's severe respiratory illness. Alabama, Indiana and Oklahoma are the latest to join the growing list of states with confirmed cases, health officials say. Seven of 24 specimens sent to the CDC from Oklahoma hospitals and laboratories have tested positive for Enterovirus D68, the Oklahoma State Department of Health announced Tuesday. The state has seen an increase in pediatric admissions at hospitals in its central region. Enterovirus infections difficult to track . The Alabama Department of Public Health also sent six samples from Mobile County to the CDC for testing; four came back positive for Enterovirus D68. One of the other samples was Coxsackievirus B3, and the remaining one was negative, the department said in a news release. Health care providers in the state have been asked to report clusters of severe respiratory illness. Four children in Lake County, Indiana, were sickened by Enterovirus D68 and were treated at University of Chicago Hospital, according to a news release from the Indiana State Department of Health; all four have since been discharged from the hospital. Lake County is in the northwest corner of the state. Other states including Michigan, Georgia, Ohio and Utah are also investigating clusters of respiratory illnesses. Several have sent samples to the CDC for testing.

chatgpt: Oklahoma health officials have confirmed seven cases of Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in the state. The virus has been linked to worsening breathing problems, particularly among children with asthma. EV-D68 is a strain of enterovirus that can cause severe respiratory illness, with symptoms ranging from a mild cold to wheezing and difficulty breathing. In some cases, the virus can lead to hospitalization or even death, especially in children who already struggle with respiratory problems.  Health officials in Oklahoma are urging parents to seek medical attention if their child develops symptoms such as a high fever, cough, runny nose, or difficulty breathing. They are also reminding parents to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus, including washing hands frequently and staying home when sick. This announcement comes just days after four children in Lake County, Indiana were sickened by the virus. Three of the children required hospitalization, and one remains in critical condition.  Alabama has also confirmed four cases of Enterovirus D68. “Parents and caregivers need to be vigilant in watching for respiratory symptoms in their children, especially those who have asthma,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC has been tracking EV-D68 since August 2014, when a cluster of severe respiratory illnesses was first reported in the Midwest. While the virus is rare, it has been reported in nearly every state and has caused a handful of deaths. For parents of children with asthma, the risk posed by EV-D68 is especially concerning. Children with asthma are more likely to develop severe symptoms if they contract the virus, and may require hospitalization or even intensive care. In response to the outbreak, health officials are urging parents to make sure their children’s asthma is well-controlled, and to make sure they are up-to-date with their vaccinations, which can help protect against other respiratory illnesses.  The EV-D68 virus is spread through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva, mucus, or sputum, from an infected person. This could include touching objects contaminated with the virus or coming into close contact with someone who is infected. While the virus is concerning, health officials say there is no need for panic. “We want to reassure everyone that we are doing everything we can to respond to this situation and to prevent the spread of this virus,” said Dr. Frieden. “We will keep working closely with our partners to monitor the situation and provide guidance to parents, caregivers, and healthcare providers.” For now, the best thing parents can do is keep a close eye on their children’s health, seek medical attention if they develop symptoms, and take steps to prevent the spread of the virus by practicing good hygiene and staying home when sick.
