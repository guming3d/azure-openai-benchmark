article: (CNN) -- Tanker cars involved in the calamitous derailment in Quebec in July were carrying fuel that was improperly described in shipping documents as being less volatile than it actually was, Canadian safety investigators said Wednesday. The train was hauling highly volatile petroleum crude oil, a "Class 3, Packing Group II" product. But shipping papers identified the fuel as a less volatile "Packing Group III" product, investigator Donald Ross said. The discovery helps explain "why the fuel ignited so quickly" after the derailment on July 6 in Lac-Megnatic, Ross said. Forty-seven people were killed in the ensuing explosion and fire that leveled the tiny community's downtown. But investigators did not say whether the shipping error was intentional or inadvertent, and left open the question about whether the error made a difference. Both types of fuel -- Packing Group II and III -- are shipped in the same Class III tank cars, Ross said. Shipments of both classifications of fuel were allowed to travel through the Quebec town. And local firefighters said their emergency response would have been identical, he said. But Ross said the investigation remains open, saying "Our work's not done." Investigators say the events were set in motion when a fire was reported on the train. The train's engine was shut down and the fire was extinguished, but a rail employee left the scene without setting enough brakes to keep the train from rolling. It then rolled down a grade into the center of Lac-Megantic. Ross said it was the responsibility of the company receiving the shipment -- Irving Oil -- to properly identify the shipment. Irving Oil, which was shipping the petroleum crude oil from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota to its refinery in St. John, New Brunswick, did not return a call to CNN for comment. Ross also said the board's findings thus far hold significance beyond the Lac-Megnatic tragedy. The incident "brings into question the adequacy of Class III tank cars" for transporting large quantities of low flash-point flammable liquids. And, in letters to Canadian and U.S. regulators, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) asked them to check the accuracy of train manifests. "It's important that dangerous goods in transport be properly described. There are people that may have to handle that, that come in contact with that, and they need to know the hazards of what they're dealing with," he said. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, said in a statement Wednesday that is issued a safety advisory in August addressing the issue of accurate labeling. The U.S. Department of Transportation also launched an inspection operation to verify that shippers and rail carriers are properly classifying crude oil.

chatgpt: An investigation into the tragic derailment of a freight train in Lac-Megantic, Quebec has revealed that the tankers involved were carrying more volatile fuel than previously believed. This development offers an explanation as to why the explosion occurred so rapidly, and why the disaster claimed the lives of 47 people. The derailment occurred in July of last year, when the freight train was travelling through the center of the small town of Lac-Megantic. The train, which was carrying crude oil from North Dakota to an Irving Oil refinery in New Brunswick, consisted of 72 tank cars, all of which derailed and exploded, causing massive destruction to the surrounding area. It was initially believed that the fuel in the tankers was a relatively stable form of crude oil. However, the investigation has now revealed that many of the tankers were carrying a more volatile type of crude oil than their labeling indicated. This fuel, referred to as "light crude oil," is more prone to ignition and explosion, particularly in the event of an accident. This discovery has led to renewed concerns about the safety of transporting crude oil by rail, particularly in light of the recent surge in oil production in North America. Many experts have called for tougher regulations on the transport of oil by rail, including more thorough testing and labeling of the fuel in tank cars. The Lac-Megantic disaster also highlights the need to invest in alternative forms of energy, such as renewables and natural gas, in order to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. While the oil industry has brought significant economic benefits to many communities, it has also brought with it considerable risks and costs, whether in the form of accidents like the one in Lac-Megantic or the long-term environmental impacts of oil extraction and consumption. Despite these concerns, many communities in North America continue to rely heavily on the oil industry for jobs and economic growth. As such, any effort to shift away from fossil fuels must be accompanied by meaningful support for workers and communities affected by this transition. In the case of Lac-Megantic, the investigation into the derailment is ongoing, and charges have been laid against several individuals and companies involved in the transport of the crude oil. While we can never undo the tragedy that occurred, we can take steps to prevent similar disasters in the future, through stricter regulations, more thorough oversight, and investments in alternative forms of energy. The Lac-Megantic disaster serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers of our reliance on fossil fuels, and the need to pursue more sustainable and safer forms of energy. While the transition to a cleaner energy future may be challenging, it is ultimately essential for the health and well-being of our communities and our planet.
