article: (CNN) -- People talk about all kinds of things on social media: Their day-to-day lives, articles generating a lot of buzz and the things they ate for breakfast. Some of the conversations by Facebook's 128 million daily users revolve around the news, and CNN now has the ability to take a peek into this world. Facebook has given CNN access to demographic data that tells us how many people have mentioned a topic along with age, gender and location information. We aren't actually reading through conversations, but rather looking at numbers that show us trends. Since we've just gotten this information, we thought we'd try something new. Each day, we'll be comparing two topics that show interesting trends in their demographic data. You might see that more women are talking about a particular topic than men, or that younger age groups are mentioning one news event versus another. While this isn't a scientific study, we hope pitting two topics against each other will give some perspective on these results. Sometimes, these numbers can show us things we don't expect. For example, we recently learned that many of the Facebook users talking about Iran were young people, especially internationally. We also found a similar trend in ages among the people talking about the government shutdown. Looking at Facebook mentions can give us insights that would be hard to get in any other way. Check back here to see new charts about topics in the news and popular conversation, and if you have ideas you want us to look into, let us know in the comments below.

chatgpt: It is now easier for CNN to know what topics people are talking about on Facebook. The social media giant has granted CNN the ability to see how frequent particular topics are mentioned on its platform. CNN says that the data is broad and does not include specific conversations but shows demographics. This development comes at a time when people are turning to social media for news about important events happening around the world. With millions of users on Facebook, it has become a hub for people to share their thoughts and opinions on various topics, from politics to sports, entertainment, technology, and more. The data that CNN is now able to see will help the news organization to understand what issues are important to its audience and how they can better serve their viewers. By analyzing the data, CNN can determine which topics are the most talked about by age, gender, location, and other factors that can provide insight into what stories to cover and how to present them. Facebook mentions are also a great way for businesses to understand the trends on the social media platform. By monitoring the mentions of their brand or products, the companies can have a better idea of what their customers are saying about them. They can also use this information to improve their business strategy and address any issues their customers may have. However, it is important to note that Facebook mentions can be misleading because they only capture a subset of the population. Not everyone uses Facebook, and not everyone who does will share their thoughts on the platform. Nonetheless, this information is a valuable tool for those who want to understand the general sentiment of the population. In conclusion, the ability to see how often certain topics are mentioned on Facebook will give CNN and other organizations a broader understanding of the issues that are important to their audience. While not a perfect source of data, it is a valuable tool that can help shape the news and how it is presented to the world.
