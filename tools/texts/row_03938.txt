article: By . Adam Duggan . It’s normally competitors, not spectators, who put themselves in danger at extreme sport events. However, this wasn’t the case at the UCI World Cup in Cairns on Saturday, where one man was lucky to escape without life-threatening injuries after taking a brutal fall riding an injured cyclist’s bike downhill. Pro rider Adam Brayton was involved in a severe crash during the event which left him with a broken leg and in need of hospital treatment. Disaster: Adam Brayton's friend decided to ride the competitor's bike down the track instead of wheeling it away at the UCI World Championship event in Cairns . A member of the crowd - who has not been identified - offered to look after his bike while he was being treated. But he was unable to resist trying out the track himself - and then suffered a brutal fall as he was traversing a difficult part of the track known as the ‘whoops’. 'I only met him after my crash as he offered to take my bike down the hill for me,' Mr Brayton said. 'I think he's ok though he was in my ambulance on a spine board and was pretty k'od but that's all I know I'm going to pop down to hospital tomorrow and see how he's doing,' Mr Brayton told online biking magazine PinkBike. Professional downhill mountain biker Steve Peat posted to Instagram on Sunday that he spoke with the injured spectator, who is recovering in hospital with two broken vertebrae and a dislocated shoulder. Heavy rain took its toll on the tropical far north Queensland track, with some parts of the mountain bike course being turned into mud. Queensland Health have confirmed that a 28-year-old man transported to Cairns Hospital on Saturday afternoon is in a stable condition. Slow-and-steady: A spectator, riding Adam Brayton's bike, rounds a corner nearing the 'whomps' at the UCI Championships in Cairns . Easy does it: The spectator slips, taking the bike on a tumble with him. Lying in pain: After taking a fall, and being hit with his own bike, the man is left waiting in pain for paramedics to arrive.
