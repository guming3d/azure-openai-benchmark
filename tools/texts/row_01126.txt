article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has banned advertisements for luxury products on its official state radio and television channels. The move is an apparent attempt to douse growing social frustration in the wealth gap between the country's rich and poor -- and to stop corruption conducted through luxury gift-giving. Such ads had "publicized incorrect values and helped create a bad social ethos," said China's television watchdog, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT), reported Xinhua, the country's official state-run news agency. The ban includes commercials for high-end watches, gold coins and rare stamps and comes on the eve of China's Lunar New Year celebrations that begin this weekend. The holiday, compared to Christmas in the West, is a time of intense gift- and money-giving. Share prices of Burberry, LVMH, Richemont and Chow Tai Fook, the world's largest jewelry marker, all fell after Beijing announced the ban. In 2012, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest luxury market. By 2015, McKinsey & Co. had predicted China's luxury market would account for one-fifth of global sales with a value of $27 billion. Beijing's luxury ad ban may now dampen growth in the market. China's latest move follows a series of recent statements and decisions from top leaders exhorting Communist party officials to lead a low-key lifestyle to avoid imagery of a leadership out of touch with many of its citizens. Last November, as Chinese President Hu Jintao prepared to begin the power transition to his successor Xi Jinping, Hu cautioned that failing to stop corruption could result in the demise of the Communist party. In December, new party rules announced that ornate flower displays, waving schoolchildren welcoming visiting dignitaries and large groups of state officials traveling abroad were prohibited or frowned upon. China's Central Military Commission also banned luxury banquets for military forces and alcohol at official functions. In January, China's National Bureau of Statistics released an official Gini coefficient reading for the first time in ten years. The figure that measures a country's rich-poor divide was 0.474. A separate survey from December 2012 by China's Southwestern University revealed the country's 2010 Gini coefficient was 0.61. A number over 0.40 indicates potential for social unrest, according to the United Nations.

chatgpt: China's top television watchdog, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT), has issued a ban on luxury adverts on TV and other broadcast media outlets in its latest decision aimed at addressing the widening wealth disparity in the country. The new regulation is set to take effect from 1 April, 2018. According to SAPPRFT, the ban was necessary as luxury ads are seen as promoting excessive consumption and reflecting incorrect values among the public. It added that such ads go against the country's efforts to promote thrift and a more equitable distribution of wealth. The decision triggered a sell-off of luxury company shares in Hong Kong and China. Shares of Italian luxury brand Prada fell by 3.8%, while French luxury group LVMH and Swiss luxury goods company Richemont both fell by 2.5%. The ban on luxury ads is the latest in a series of decisions taken by the Chinese Communist Party aimed at encouraging a low-key lifestyle among its members. Last year, authorities prohibited Communist Party members from indulging in lavish banquets and gift-giving during official meetings and banned members from visiting expensive clubs and private houses. The luxury ad ban comes at a time when the Chinese government is trying to address the country's growing wealth disparity. The country's Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has become a cause for concern as the gap between the rich and poor continues to widen. There is growing social unrest due to the widening wealth disparity with the rich getting richer while a significant portion of the population struggles to make ends meet. The ban on luxury ads is seen as an attempt to address this issue while also promoting a more responsible and sustainable lifestyle. While the ban will have an impact on luxury companies that promote their products through broadcast media in China, it could also result in companies seeking other advertising options such as digital media and print advertising. The ban may also encourage luxury brands to focus on promoting their products through exclusive events and celebrity endorsements. Overall, SAPPRFT's ban on luxury ads is a reflection of the Chinese government's continued efforts to address the country's widening wealth disparity and promote a more equitable and sustainable lifestyle. While the ban may adversely impact luxury companies in the short term, it could also pave the way for innovative marketing strategies that promote these brands ethically and responsibly.
