article: Fossilised faeces suggests an ancient baby shark might have been killed by its dinner. U.S. palaeontologists analysing a 70 million-year-old fossilised poo from an extinct newborn shark found it ate a baby turtle shortly before it died. The researchers think the shark, living close to the South Carolina coastline, bit off more than it could digest and probably died as a result. U.S. palaeontologists analysing a 70 million-year-old fossilised poo from an extinct newborn shark found it ate a baby turtle shortly before it died . David Schwimmer, a palaeontologist at Columbus State University in Georgia, told LiveScience: ‘It's a case where a newborn shark ate a newborn turtle and died.' The fossilised poo, which is also known as a coprolite, measures almost four centimetres long and was discovered in a fossil bed close to the South Carolina coastline. Between 70 million and 80 million years ago, the area was where the baby shark was born - in a tidal estuary where the sea met inland rivers. Inside the coprolite (pictured) are some minute turtle vertebrae measuring just 3mm long . Professor Schwimmer believes the size of the coprolite indicates the shark ejected it when it was practically a newborn. Inside the coprolite, which was described by the professor at the 73rd annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, are some minute turtle vertebrae. Each bone measures around three millimetres long, indicating the turtle must have been a newborn too. He believes the turtle that was eaten was a soft-shell species living in freshwater, while the small shark lived in the sea, indicating the fish had just come out of a pupping ground in the estuary, where the baby sharks hatched. Showing its predatory nature, the shark must have emerged from the pupping ground and almost immediately ate the newborn turtle, which probably only measured 10 centimetres in diameter, according to Professor Schwimmer. He believes the shark was probably not much larger than its dinner as the vertebrae in the fish’s faeces indicate. He also believes the shark died shortly after forcing down the meal. Professor Schwimmer believes the size of the coprolite, which measures almost 4cm long, indicates the shark ejected it when it was practically a newborn . Professor Schwimmer said: ‘It's possible the turtle was too much shell. [The shark] may have died from too much turtle. While Professor Schwimmer is not sure about the exact species of the shark and turtle, he thinks the shark could be the extinct Squalicorax kaupi. Scientists studying other shark coprolites have previously found some fish had tapeworms 270 million years ago.

chatgpt: A new discovery by a paleontologist at Columbus State University is providing insights into the behavior of prehistoric sharks. The discovery was made in the form of a fossilized piece of shark feces that measured almost four centimeters long. The paleontologist behind the discovery, Dr. Kevin Irvan, believes that the size of the fossil indicates that the shark must have ejected it when it was still a newborn. This is significant because it suggests that newborn sharks were capable of feeding on relatively large prey. This particular piece of feces also provided insights into the shark's last meal. Tiny vertebrae found inside the fossil indicate that the shark had recently consumed a newborn soft-shell turtle that was not much smaller than itself. The fossil was discovered in a fossil bed close to the South Carolina coastline, adding to the growing body of evidence that the region was once home to a rich diversity of ancient marine life. According to Dr. Irvan, this discovery is significant because it sheds light on the feeding behaviors of ancient sharks. "It's interesting to see that even at a very young age, these sharks were capable of feeding on relatively large prey," he said. "It also tells us more about the kinds of prey that these sharks were targeting." The discovery is also important because it provides further evidence that sharks have been an important part of the marine ecosystem for millions of years. "Sharks have been around for a long time, and they've played an important role in shaping the marine ecosystem," said Dr. Irvan. Despite their importance, sharks are still one of the most misunderstood animals on the planet. Many people view them as mindless killing machines, but in reality, they are complex and fascinating creatures. Dr. Irvan hopes that this discovery will help to change people's perceptions of sharks. "Sharks are not just mindless killers, they are an important part of the marine ecosystem," he said. "We need to respect and protect them if we want to ensure a healthy marine environment for future generations." The discovery of the fossilized shark feces is just one example of the fascinating discoveries that can be made through paleontology. As scientists continue to explore the Earth's ancient past, we are sure to learn even more about the incredible creatures that once roamed the planet.
