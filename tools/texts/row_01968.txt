article: The owner of a coach company was stunned after council bosses fined one of his staff for driving in a bus lane - even though he was in a bus. John Henderson, owner of Henderson Travel, was baffled after the driver was slapped with a £60 penalty charge by Glasgow City Council. The fine, which is reduced to £30 if it is paid within 14 days, was issued after a vehicle from his bus fleet drove on a city centre road designated for buses, taxis and cyclists only. I'm a bus! Coach operator owner John Henderson was amazed when one of his drivers was fined for driving a bus in a bus lane. Glasgow City Council has since realised the mistake and cancelled the charge . The number 329 bus was 'caught' on the morning of February 5 as it drove along Cathedral Street, when a council CCTV cameras snapped the registration plate. John, 57, from Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, said he and his wife Linda were 'speechless' at the fine. He said: 'It is sheer stupidity that a bus can be fined for driving in a bus lane. This was a proper bus. 'It's a small to medium sized bus with 27 seats - but it's still a bus. It's an over-zealous attack by the council.' Cathedral Street has been revealed as the second most prolific money-generating street in Glasgow after a council crackdown on the illegal use of bus lanes. More than £500,000 in fines has been made after almost 20,000 motorists were caught driving in the bus lane between April 23 - when the council launched its CCTV crackdown on bus lanes - and December 31 last year. The city's biggest cash generator is Glassford Street's bus lane, which has netted around 28,000 drivers, allowing the council to rake in nearly £700,000 from fines.

The bill for £60 (right) John, who has owned the company for 30 years, accused council bosses of using the lanes as a way of raking in cash. He said: 'This has reinforced to me that bus lanes are one big money-making exercise. 'This has nothing to do with trying to keep traffic running smoothly, which is what bus lanes are meant for.' A Glasgow City Council spokesman said the fine was sent out in error. He said: 'Another vehicle was in the lane behind the bus lane and it was included in the picture taken by the bus lane camera. 'A notice was sent out by mistake and it has now been cancelled.'

chatgpt: The owner of a Scottish bus company was left "speechless" after receiving a hefty penalty charge notice for one of his drivers using a designated lane in Glasgow. The driver had been operating a 27-seater bus at the time, and the lane in question had earned the council a whopping £500,000 in just eight months. The incident highlights the ongoing issue of penalty charges and fines in the UK, with many drivers and companies feeling that they are being unfairly targeted by local authorities. Bus operators in particular argue that they are often left with little choice but to use designated lanes and are being punished for doing so. The bus company owner, who wished to remain anonymous, said he was shocked to receive the penalty charge notice and described the fine as "outrageous". He claimed that his driver had only entered the designated lane due to traffic congestion on the main road and was not aware of the restrictions in place. The Glasgow street lane in question is part of a wider network of designated lanes and roads which are designed to ease traffic congestion and improve journey times for public transport users. However, critics argue that councils are using such restrictions as a tool to generate revenue rather than to genuinely benefit commuters. Since the introduction of the Glasgow lane, the council has seen a significant increase in revenue generated through penalty charges. In the eight months since its introduction, the lane has netted the council an eye-watering £500,000 in fines. This has led many to question whether the council's motives are purely financial, rather than genuinely aimed at improving the city's transport infrastructure. A spokesperson for the council defended the use of such lanes and restrictions, stating that they are an essential component of the city's transport strategy. They went on to say that the fines generated through penalty charges are reinvested back into the transport network and used to fund improvements and upgrades. Despite these claims, however, many drivers and transport companies remain unconvinced. They argue that the penalties and fines are excessive and that the restrictions in place are too strict and inflexible, leading to a sense of frustration and disillusionment among commuters and transport providers alike. In conclusion, the case of the Glasgow lane highlights the ongoing tension between local authorities and transport providers over penalty charges and fines. While councils argue that such measures are necessary to improve transport infrastructure, many drivers and operators feel that they are being unfairly targeted and punished for issues beyond their control. As such, it is likely that this issue will continue to be a contentious one for some time to come.
