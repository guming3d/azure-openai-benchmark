article: Young people who get drunk several times a week are at risk of suffering a mental illness, doctors have warned. While it's no secret that binge drinking can cause major health problems,  too much alcohol can have a dangerous effect on mood disorders and slow brain development. Sydney experts found young people who already suffer mental health problems, can worsen their symptoms. Scroll down for video . Too much alcohol can have a dangerous effect on mood disorders and slow brain development, doctors warn . Drinking alcohol on a weekly basis could affect the structural and neurochemical changes to the parts of the brain responsible for long-term memory and decision making, according to ABC. Dr Daniel Hermens from the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI) told ABC that between the ages of 16 and 25 brains are undergoing a lot of change and alcohol can impair that growth. 'If you're a young person with depression, a history of depression, or even a family history of depression, then you may be at an even greater risk of brain changes, changes in your concentration and your memory if you misuse alcohol,' Dr Hermens said. Drinking alcohol on a weekly basis could affect the structural and neurochemical changes to parts of brain . But good news is that the young brain is 'best equipped to recover', according to Dr Daniel Hermens . ABC reports the Brain and Mind Research Institute wants to develop a cognitive screening test for hospitals and GPs to detect the subtle neurological impacts of alcohol misuse in young people's brains. 'The really good news about all this though is that the young brain is best equipped to recover,' Dr Hermens said. Psychiatrist Dr Elizabeth Scott from Headspace told ABC that without early intervention, young people are in danger of developing more persistent and chronic problems that have a major impact on their adult life. 'Young people with mental health problems are two to three times more likely to use drugs and alcohol compared to their peers of the same age in the general community,' she said. 'The mix of mental health problems and drugs and alcohol problems can lead to vicious cycles of illness and disability.'

chatgpt: Doctors are warning that too much alcohol consumption can have dangerous effects, particularly on mood disorders and brain development. According to a new study, drinking alcohol on a weekly basis could have negative effects on the structural and neurochemical changes to the parts of the brain. The study found that young people who already suffer from mental health problems can worsen their symptoms with alcohol consumption. The research team analyzed brain scans of both adults and young adults who drank various amounts of alcohol. They found that even moderate drinking can impact the area of the brain responsible for decision-making and impulse control. This could lead to elevated risk-taking behaviors, which are common in people who struggle with mental health issues. Additionally, chronic alcohol use can also interfere with the healthy growth and development of the brain. This is concerning for adolescents and young adults, who are still in the process of developing brain functions. Damage to the brain during this crucial period can have long-lasting effects, with some studies suggesting it may increase the risk of developing neurological conditions later in life. However, there is some good news. According to Dr. Daniel Hermens, the young brain is "best equipped to recover." This means that, even if young people do suffer from mental health issues and have been drinking regularly, they have a good chance of reversing the damage and recovering over time. It's essential that people are aware of the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption, particularly in the case of mental health disorders. Young people who are experiencing symptoms such as anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder should be extra cautious about their alcohol intake, and should seek help from a mental health professional if necessary. The study serves as a crucial reminder that we need to protect our brains, and especially those of young people. While it may be tempting to indulge in alcohol to cope with mental health symptoms, it can ultimately exacerbate the issue, leading to lasting negative effects. Instead, we need to focus on healthy coping mechanisms and seek support when we need it. By doing so, we can safeguard our brain health and minimize the detrimental effects of alcohol on mental health.
