article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . The National Science Foundation has suspended a researcher after the organization discovered that the unnamed employee was using powerful, government-funded supercomputers to mine bitcoins, the popular virtual payment system, according to a government report published earlier this year. The researcher's scheme was revealed in the agency's semi-annual report to Congress compiled by the NSF's Office of the Inspector General. 'We received reports describing a researcherâ€™s abuse of NSF-funded . supercomputing resources at two universities to conduct bitcoin mining . activities,' the report said. Miner: The NSF suspended a researcher who used government-funded computers to mine bitcoins . The benefits of mining bitcoins is described by Fox News as an 'alternative to buying bitcoins on an exchange.' 'The so-called "miners" are rewarded with the virtual currency for using their processing power . to verify transactions, a task which requires significant compute . resources. Because the cryptocurrency has no central authority or banks, . transactions are managed and bitcoins are issued collectively across a . peer-to-peer network.' According to the report, the researcher misused more than $150,000 in supercomputing equipment. The bitcoins generated were valued between $8,000 and $10,000. Scam: According to the NSF, the researcher misused more than $150,000 in government-owned supercomputers . 'Both universities determined that this was an unauthorized use of their IT systems,' the report states. 'The researcher asserted that he was conducting tests on the computers, but neither university had authorized him to conduct such tests.' According to the report, the unnamed universities found that the researcher had accessed the supercomputers remotely in an attempt to conceal what he was doing. In one example, he accessed the computer through a 'mirror site' located in Europe. In addition to the government-wide suspension, the NSF terminated the researcher's access to all NSF-funded supercomputers. Bitcoin: Each unit of the popular digital currency is worth about $652 in U.S. currency . According to the Harvard Crimson, a similar mining of virtual currency was discovered at Harvard University earlier this year. In the Harvard case, a researcher was using the university's supercomputers to mine Dogecoin, a type of digital currency similar to bitcoin.

chatgpt: A researcher funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) has been found to have generated Bitcoins worth between $8,000 and $10,000 using government-funded supercomputers. The revelation came from a government report that claimed the researcher had misused more than $150,000 in supercomputing equipment. As a result of the findings, the researcher has been banned from using any government-funded supercomputers. The investigation into the incident began in 2014 when the NSF's Office of Inspector General received information alleging misuse of NSF-funded supercomputers at two universities. During the investigation, it was discovered that the researcher had used the computing resources to generate Bitcoins. However, the report did not indicate if the Bitcoins were generated for personal use or if the researcher was using them for academic purposes. The report also claimed that the researcher had violated the NSF's Acceptable Use Policy, misused government resources, and disregarded federal laws and regulations. The researcher has not been named in the report. In a statement, the NSF stated that it takes allegations of improper use of its resources very seriously and that it conducted a thorough review of the incident. The NSF also stated that it has taken steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. "NSF has implemented new measures to improve the oversight and monitoring of its supercomputing resources, including enhanced training for users, stricter access controls, and the development of an online system for reporting suspected misuse of government resources," the agency said. This incident highlights the challenges that government agencies face when it comes to managing their computing resources. Supercomputers are valuable tools that can be used for both academic and commercial purposes. However, they are expensive to operate and maintain, and their misuse can lead to significant costs for taxpayers. The ban on the researcher from using government-funded supercomputers is a clear indication that agencies will not hesitate to take action if they suspect their resources are being misused. As the use of supercomputers continues to grow, it is essential to implement measures to prevent future incidents of this nature.
