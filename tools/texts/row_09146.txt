article: A Darwin man knew it was no laughing matter when he spotted a kookaburra wedged into a parked car's numberplate. Russell Crow, 50, found the beautiful blue-winged kookaburra jammed into the vehicle bumper at Humpty Doo United servo, 40 km south of Darwin. After noticing the bird was still alive, Mr Crow managed to move the animal from harm's way with some unlikely utensils, reports NT News. The blue-winged kookaburra was found wedged into the front of a parked car's bumper at Humpty Doo United servo . Mr Crow assumed thought the animal was long dead when he first noticed it. 'Even when I walked over to it, I could see it had an eye open but I still thought it was dead — it was pretty still,' he told NT News. After photographing the peculiar scene, the kookaburra moved its head. But when Mr Crow attempted to freeit with his hands, the bird attacked him. 'I was trying to pull it out with my hands, but he kept trying to bite me,' he said. Kookaburras have extremely strong beaks which they use to soften their food. In turn, they can inflict a painful bite. Mr Crow resolved to use a mop and bucket to free the captive bird, which was miraculously unharmed. The blue winged kookaburra is susceptible to being hit by cars on country roads due to being a slow flyer . 'I used the mop to pry him out, and it worked. I was expecting him to have a broken wing or to be injured in some way, but as soon as he hit the ground he flew off and into a gum tree.' Mr Crow left a note on the car advising them to check their grille after striking an animal on the road. The blue winged kookaburra is native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea. Due to being slow flyers, they are susceptible to being hit by cars on country roads. The  assistant curator for Territory Wildlife Park Damien Stanioch said the car was travelling between 60-70km/h when it hit the bird. The bird was found at Humpty Doo United servo, 40 km south of Darwin in the Northern Territory .

chatgpt: 50-year-old Russell Crow came across an unusual scene while traveling in his car earlier this week. He found a blue-winged kookaburra, a bird species native to Australia, wedged into the grill of a car. The bird had been hit by the vehicle and was unable to free itself. The blue-winged kookaburra is known to be a slow flyer, making them particularly susceptible to being hit by cars. This fact sparked Mr. Crow's concern for the bird's well-being. Using a mop and bucket, Mr. Crow was able to free the bird from the vehicle. The bird appeared to have minor injuries, but was conscious and able to fly away. Territory Wildlife Park was called in to assess the bird's injuries. They estimate that the car was traveling between 60-70km/h when the bird was hit, which could have had much more serious consequences. According to Territory Wildlife Park officials, blue-winged kookaburras are not uncommon in the area, but they are often hit by cars. The birds are a beloved species in Australia, known for their distinct, laugh-like call. Thankfully, due to Mr. Crow's quick thinking and compassion for wildlife, this particular bird was able to receive medical attention and be released back into the wild. This incident serves as a reminder for all drivers to remain vigilant on the roads and to be aware of wildlife in their area.
