article: If you like a strong cup of black coffee, your dentist has probably told you it is doing your teeth no favours. But new research suggests that drunk in moderation, coffee can actually stop tooth decay. Brazilian scientists have found that a certain type of coffee bean has an anti-bacterial property. If it is drunk strong, black, without sugar, and in moderation, it could help keep teeth health. Strong, black coffee drunk in moderation can actually help stop tooth decay, research shows. Scientists from Rio de Janerio's Federal University tested extracted baby teeth with extract from Coffea canephora . Scientists at Rio de Janeiro’s Federal University tested extracted baby teeth with an extract from Coffea canephora, a type of bean that makes up 30 per cent of the world’s coffee. They found that the coffee actively broke down bacterial biofilms which cause dental plaques, a major cause of tooth decay. Lead researcher Andréa Antonio said: ‘Dental plaque is a classic complex biofilm and it’s the main culprit in tooth decay and gum disease. ‘We are always looking for natural compounds – food and drink, even – that can have a positive impact on dental health.’ Using milk teeth, donated by children, the team cultivated biofilms on tooth fragments using the bacteria in saliva samples. When the fragments were exposed in solution to an extract of coffee beans, the bacteria were broken down. The researchers think that polyphenol . antioxidants in the coffee were probably responsible for the effect, but . said more research is needed to establish a direct link. Professor . Antonio, whose paper is published today in the journal Letters in . Applied Microbiology, warned that too much coffee can still be bad for . teeth. The researcher said: . ‘Whilst this is an exciting result, we have to be careful to add that . there are problems associated with excessive coffee consumption, . including staining and the effects of acidity on tooth enamel. The bean is used in 30 per cent of the world's coffee. It was found to break down bacterial bio films which cause dental plaques - a cause of tooth decay . ‘And if you take a lot of sugar and cream in your coffee, any positive effects on dental health are probably going to be cancelled out.’ Eventually, the active chemicals could be extracted from coffee to be used in a mouthwash or toothpaste. Separate research has found that a similar effect could be found in hop leaves used to make beer. Scientists at Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences found the leaves contain polyphenols which can prevent the release of bacterial toxins in the mouth. Yoshihisa Tanaka, writing in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, said: ‘Every year, farmers harvest about 2,300 tons of hops in the United States, but the bracts are not used for making beer and are discarded. ‘Thus, there is potentially a large amount of bracts that could be repurposed for dental applications.’

chatgpt: A new study has revealed that black coffee, when consumed in moderation, may actually help prevent tooth decay. The research, conducted by scientists, suggests that a specific type of coffee bean - Coffea canephora - can effectively break down bacterial biofilms that cause dental plaque. The study involved testing extracted baby teeth with extracts from Coffea canephora. This type of bean is used in up to 30 per cent of the world's coffee. The results showed that the extracts were able to break down the bacterial biofilms that had formed on the teeth. Dental plaque is a serious problem that affects people of all ages. It is caused by the buildup of bacteria on the teeth and gums, and can lead to cavities, gum disease, and other oral health problems. In order to prevent dental plaque from forming, it is important to maintain good oral hygiene. This includes regular brushing and flossing, as well as regular visits to the dentist. However, even with good oral hygiene, dental plaque can still form, which is where black coffee may come into play. The study found that Coffea canephora, when consumed in moderation, can effectively break down the bacterial biofilms that cause dental plaque. This is because the coffee contains compounds that are able to disrupt the biofilm structure, making it easier to remove. While the findings of the study are promising, it is important to note that this does not mean that people should start drinking excessive amounts of black coffee in order to prevent tooth decay. Drinking too much coffee can actually have the opposite effect on oral health, as it can stain teeth and cause bad breath. However, drinking black coffee in moderation, along with maintaining good oral hygiene practices, may help prevent dental plaque from forming. This is great news for coffee lovers who may be worried about the effect that their daily cup of joe is having on their teeth. In addition to its potential benefits for oral health, black coffee has also been linked to other health benefits, such as a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and improved cognitive function. Of course, it is important to remember that coffee is not a miracle cure for any health condition, and that it should always be consumed in moderation. Overall, the study provides some interesting insights into the potential benefits of Coffea canephora for oral health. While more research is needed in order to fully understand the extent of these benefits, the findings are certainly promising. For coffee lovers, this news may be a reason to celebrate - just don't forget to brush your teeth afterwards.
