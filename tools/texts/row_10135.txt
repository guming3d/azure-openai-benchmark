article: A 75-year-old man was left lying on the freezing cold pavement for more than two hours waiting for an ambulance after a fall - even though passers-by had called 999 five times. The pensioner was found on the ground outside Teeside Magistrates' Court in Middlesbrough having fallen and hit his head. Passers-by found him shortly after the fall - at 7pm on Monday - and covered him with blankets in a bid to keep him warm as temperatures dipped as low as 4C. A 75-year-old man was left lying on the freezing cold pavement for more than two hours waiting for an ambulance after a fall . But an ambulance did not arrive on the scene until 9.10pm - and only turned up after the people caring for him had called 999 five times. One man, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'We got here about 7.25pm and saw the man lying on the floor. 'There were quite a few people gathered around him, so we went to get blankets and hot water bottles. We have already put in about four phone calls to the ambulance but they are still not here.' Around 7.50pm, three Middlesbrough street wardens arrived to offer their help to the man, who is believed to have been from the North Ormesby area of the town. After a fifth phone call to the emergency services an ambulance arrived at 9.10pm and the pensioner was taken straight to hospital. Ambulance bosses have apologised and said the service was experiencing 'exceptional pressure' that evening. A Met Office spokesman said temperatures that day ranged from 2C to 6C in Middlesbrough but estimated it would have been around 4C at the time of the incident. An ambulance did not arrive on the scene until 9.10pm - and only turned up after the people caring for him had called 999 five times . One street warden, who wished to remain unnamed, said: 'We got here and the man was just lying there and you could tell he was freezing. 'These three young people were already here and really it was them who did all the work. 'They are students who have just finished a 12-hour shift so they could have just walked past but they stopped to help. A spokesperson for North East Ambulance Service said: 'We would like to say sorry to the patient, and apologise for not being able to reach him sooner. 'Over the last few days ambulance services across the UK have been experiencing exceptional pressure, and this has meant that some patients have had to wait longer than normal for a crew to become available. 'There are six levels of alert for UK ambulance services and on Monday it went up to level four, which means extreme pressure. 'Nearly all of the other UK ambulance services are the same. 'We would also like to thank the three students who stayed with the patient during this time for their kindness and concern.'

chatgpt: A Pensioner was found lying on the ground near the Magistrates' Court in Middlesbrough on Monday night. According to reports, he had fallen and hit his head around 7pm and was discovered shortly after. It is said that passers-by came to his aid and kept him warm, making repeated calls to the emergency services. As many as five separate 999 calls were made by concerned members of the public, alerting the authorities of the pensioner's condition. However, much to the dismay of those on the scene, it took almost two hours for the ambulance crew to arrive at the location. The North East Ambulance Service has since issued an apology for the delay, citing "exceptional pressure" on their emergency services on Monday night. A spokesperson for the organisation has expressed regret for the delay in treating the pensioner and has stated that they are working hard to address the issue. The delay in the arrival of the ambulance has sparked concern among members of the public, with many questioning the response time of the emergency services in the area. The incident has particularly raised questions about the pressure faced by the ambulance service and whether they have enough resources to respond to all emergencies in a timely manner. The CEO of the North East Ambulance Service, Helen Ray, has confirmed that the service is currently facing a significant pressure due to the increased demand for emergency healthcare in the region. She further added that the organisation is working closely with its partners to ensure that response times for emergency services are improved. Ms Ray acknowledged that the delay in the arrival of the ambulance was not ideal and noted that the service was dealing with a "number of high-priority calls" at the time. She further expressed her gratitude towards the passers-by who had come to the pensioner's aid, kept him warm and made repeated calls to the authorities. The incident highlights the importance of members of the public stepping up and providing assistance in emergency situations. In this case, it was the efforts of the passersby that helped the pensioner remain warm until the ambulance could arrive. The episode also illustrates the need for better coordination and response times from the emergency services in the region. The pensioner's condition at this point is not known, but it has been noted that he had hit his head and needed prompt medical attention. It is hoped that he will make a full recovery and that no other person in the area has to endure a similar delay or unfortunate incident in the future. In conclusion, the delay in the arrival of the ambulance at the scene of the incident has raised concerns, but the incident has also highlighted the importance of public support in providing assistance in emergency situations. The North East Ambulance Service is expected to carefully review their service delivery and response times to ensure that such occurrences are prevented in the future.
