chatgpt: In a gruesome incident, a Texas woman was arrested on charges of child abuse. Elizabeth Escalona, 23, allegedly dragged her two-year-old daughter by her feet, before gluing her tiny hands to the wall until they bled. The incident allegedly occurred in September 2011, however, the details came to light recently after the trial began.  According to the police, Escalona was frustrated with her daughter's potty training and took out her anger on the child. The victim, Joselyn, suffered from bleeding from her hands due to the cruel punishment meted out to her by her mother. A photograph presented in court showed the little girl with both hands bandaged, and her eyes swollen shut.  Escalona has been charged with causing serious injury to a child, which can lead to a life sentence. Prosecutor Eren Price told the courtroom that Escalona's behavior was "unforgivable and twisted." "Only a monster would do something like this to a child," she added. The case was first brought to the police's attention when Escalona's mother called the officers. The incident was so extreme that the child's grandfather was in tears when he testified. After the trial began, a neighbor of Escalona admitted to having seen the mother punch her little girl on her stomach as the child refused to eat. Other people had witnessed Escalona using a stick to hit her daughter in the head, pulling her hair, and dragging her around by her feet. The victim's siblings, Angelica and Araceli, reportedly told the doctors that their mother was mean to their sister. The sisters also said that they were scared of their mother and that she would threaten them if they told anyone about the abuse. During the trial, the defense tried to portray Escalona as a victim of abuse herself, who suffered from drug addiction. The judge, however, reminded the defense that it was Joselyn who was the victim in the case. Escalona has not yet been sentenced, but she could face life in prison. Joselyn, now five years old, lives with her father after undergoing reconstructive surgery. The incident has shocked the nation, with people expressing outrage at the brutal treatment of a little girl. Many are calling for stricter laws and harsher punishments to protect children from such abuse.
