article: (CNN)Limpet teeth may contain the strongest biological material ever discovered, say researchers in the UK. The aquatic, dome-shaped creatures that are found clinging to rocky shores have set a new record previously held by spiders. "Until now we thought that spider silk was the strongest biological material because of its super-strength and potential applications in everything from bullet-proof vests to computer electronics," Professor Asa Barber who led the study said in a statement. "But now we have discovered that limpet teeth exhibit a strength that is potentially higher." The researchers from the University of Portsmouth's School of Engineering said they used atomic force microscopy to pull apart the material, almost 100 times thinner than the diameter of human hair, right down to the atom. The findings were published in the Royal Society journal Interface. They are not only surprising, but Barber said they are a source of inspiration for engineering, setting the blueprint for structures such as Formula One racing cars, boat hulls and aircrafts. "All the things we observe around us, such as trees, the shells of sea creatures and the limpet teeth studied in this work, have evolved to be effective at what they do," said Barber. The key substance in the tiny teeth is a hard mineral known as goethite, which forms in the limpet as it grows and enables them to move over rock surfaces and feed on algae while the tide is in. And the teeth maintain their strength regardless of their size. "Generally a big structure has lots of flaws and can break more easily than a smaller structure, which has fewer flaws and is stronger. The problem is that most structures have to be fairly big so they're weaker than we would like." said Barber. " Limpet teeth break this rule as their strength is the same no matter what the size."

chatgpt: Limpet teeth may have just surpassed spider silk as the strongest natural material known to man, according to researchers in the UK. The discovery was made when scientists at the University of Portsmouth examined the small teeth of limpets, which are molluscs commonly found on the shores of oceans and seas.  Prior to this discovery, spider silk was thought to be the strongest material known to man. However, the resilience and durability of limpet teeth significantly surpassed that of spider silk, proving to be ideal for engineering purposes. The study has found that limpet teeth are able to endure pressures close to 5 gigapascals, making them stronger than spider silk by a magnitude of around four to five times. The research team used atomic force microscopy to observe and test the teeth’s components, which are known as goethite nanofibres. Dr. Asa Barber, the lead author of the study, stated that these components “are much stronger and harder than any biological material, even exceeding the properties of spider silk”. It is hoped that this discovery will pave the way for new and enhanced engineering practices, such as those used in the manufacturing of F1 cars and aircrafts. The unique composition of limpet teeth inspired Dr. Barber, who believes that the findings could have a lasting impact on engineering applications. He stated, "Nature is providing us with inspiration for new materials that could be used to solve problems faced by humans. The strength and toughness of these limpet teeth are very interesting from an engineering perspective and we are looking into the possibility of mimicking their properties using man-made materials." The study has also provided valuable insights into the evolutionary process, with the researchers suggesting that limpet teeth’s strength is the result of 500 million years of adaptation to the ocean's rough and unpredictable conditions. The findings of this research have been published in the journal Royal Society Interface and are expected to gain widespread attention from engineers and material scientists alike. The discovery of limpet teeth’s extraordinary strength is a testament to the power of evolution and could revolutionize the way we think about material design. Scientists will undoubtedly turn to nature in their search for new materials capable of meeting the demands of the future. The results of this study highlight the importance of a deep understanding of the natural world in finding new solutions to engineering challenges.
