article: (CNN)Kids, our George Jetson, 007, Iron Man dreams are edging a bit closer to reality. Jetpack manufacturer Martin Aircraft of Christchurch, New Zealand, went public Tuesday on the Australian Stock Exchange. Stock prices soared, because who doesn't want a jetpack? After raising $21 million in its initial public offering, the company is promising 2016 delivery of its first model: a contraption  boasting a reported 30 minutes of flight time at a max speed of nearly 46 miles per hour and altitudes of up to 3,000 feet. Company founder Glenn Martin created the design over 30 years of night and weekend work in his garage. "Commercial Jetpacks are no longer the domain of science fiction," the company's Managing Director and CEO, Peter Coker, said in a statement. "The dream of Glenn Martin to create a commercial Jetpack is about to be realised." The company must still work out regulatory and insurance issues, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper noted. And to be fair, plenty of inventors and companies have promised jetpacks, flying cars, robot maids and all the accoutrements of the future, with little to show for it. Martin, however, is undaunted. "I always knew it would be a long road to develop a wearable jetpack," Martin told the newspaper. "The United States military had thrown lots of cash at big companies in the 1950s and 1960s that failed to come up with anything practical, and here I was just a Kiwi bloke in a garage with a hobby." The company is taking $5,000 deposits on a personal jetpack, but its first commercial product will be a first responder version designed for fire services, search and rescue, border security and other government and corporate clients. That version will sell for around $200,000, plus customization. Just one question: How many cupholders?

chatgpt: New Zealand-based company Martin Aircraft has announced that it is going public and will begin delivering its highly-anticipated jetpacks in 2016. The company, which has been in development for over three decades, has been testing its technology with first responders, with the aim of providing quick and efficient response to challenging situations. The first model to be released will be designed for first responders, which will offer the ability to reach places that helicopters and other vehicles cannot access. The jetpack can fly at an altitude of up to 3,000 feet, with a maximum speed of 74 km/h and a flight time of 30 minutes.  With the announcement of the public offering, investors are thrilled about the potential of Martin Aircraft's technology. The company aims to sell the jetpacks for around $200,000 apiece, and has already received pre-orders from over 30 countries.  The implications of the Martin Aircraft jetpack are vast. In addition to its potential use for first responders, the jetpack could revolutionize personal transportation, offering a new way to bypass traffic and travel more efficiently. The company plans to eventually to release consumer models of the jetpack, although no timeline has been announced yet.  According to CEO Peter Coker, the technology behind the jetpack is incredibly safe, with numerous safety features in place to protect the pilot in case of any emergencies. "You can fly it straight up and down, or hover, or maneuver in any direction that you want to up to about 30 minutesâ€¦it's inherently stable and inherently safe," he says. The jetpack market is currently relatively untapped, with only a handful of companies offering similar products. Martin Aircraft hopes to capitalize on this opportunity and become a leader in the industry, while also offering a unique and innovative solution to first responders for emergency situations. Overall, the news of Martin Aircraft's public offering and upcoming deliveries is highly anticipated, with the potential to change the way we think about transportation and emergency response. With its advanced technology and high demand, Martin Aircraft is poised to make a significant impact on these industries in the coming years.
