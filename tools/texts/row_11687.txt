Mayor Don Guardian told ABC News he worries the incident – and two other pending lawsuits – could scare tourists away. He said: ‘This is a city that needs to be hospitable. That type of activity can’t occur. When that occurs, we’re in the wrong business.’ Two other guests – Robert Coney and Sean Oaks – are also taking legal action with accusations that Harrah’s security officers used excessive force in separate incidents.

A separate video shows a handcuffed Oaks, who suffered a facial wound, being led into an elevator. Paul D’Amato, a lawyer representing the Binns, Coney and Oaks, told ABC News the incidents were unprovoked. He said: ‘No sane person can explain the conduct that we see in those videos.’ Mail Online Travel has contacted Caesars Entertainment, the owner of Harrah's, for comment.
