article: Tim Sherwood admitted this defeat in his first match as Aston Villa manager was one of the lowest moments of his career, but insisted his current group of players will escape relegation. The contrast with Sherwood’s buoyancy at his unveiling last Monday could not have been starker. Victor Moses’s penalty in the third minute past the 90 sapped the joy from Villa Park, on a day that became one of Sherwood’s worst. ‘Yeah, it’s low, I’m low,’ he said.

The match was heading for a draw until Ron Vlaar made the miscalculation that saw Villa slip to a sixth successive Premier League defeat. He brought down Moses in the area and received a red card for his troubles. So the bounce expected by owner Randy Lerner in appointing Sherwood failed to materialise. Villa actually dropped a place. Their next games, against Newcastle, West Bromwich, Sunderland and Swansea, must yield points. ‘I want them to play a bit more relaxed in the final third, get on the ball and go and express themselves,’ said Sherwood. ‘I think we’ve got a group who are capable of doing that. It’s about delivering on match day. ‘We know we need to improve and we need to start improving very quickly.’ Scott Sinclair put Aston Villa ahead at Villa Park in new manager Sherwood's official first game in charge .

His performance on the left wing was full of energy and his header to open the scoring was dispatched like a striker who has been banging in goals all season. Sinclair said the squad exchanged heated words in the dressing room. ‘They came in shouting and there was all the stuff you think of when players are angry after conceding in the last minute,’ he said. Mark Hughes was delighted by Stoke’s fifth away win, aided by Mame Biram Diouf’s equaliser just before half-time. He said Sherwood would get it right. ‘I think they have made a good appointment in Tim. He is a positive guy and that’s what they need,’ he said.

chatgpt: On Saturday afternoon, Aston Villa suffered a heartbreaking 2-1 defeat at the hands of Stoke City. Despite dominating much of the game, Tim Sherwood's side was ultimately defeated by a stoppage-time penalty from Stoke's Victor Moses, leaving Villa empty-handed. The match started off on a high note for Aston Villa, with striker Rudy Gestede scoring the game's opening goal in the 24th minute. However, Stoke City quickly equalized just nine minutes later through a goal from Marko Arnautovic. Both teams had their chances in the second half, but it wasn't until the dying minutes of the game that the decisive moment arrived. Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar brought down Stoke's Victor Moses in the penalty box in the 93rd minute, earning himself a red card and giving Stoke City a golden opportunity to win the game. Moses stepped up to the spot and calmly dispatched the penalty, sending Villa's hopes of securing a draw crashing to the ground. The defeat was a bitter pill to swallow for Aston Villa, who had played well throughout much of the game. However, their inability to hold on for a draw will no doubt be a source of frustration for Sherwood and his players. Speaking after the game, Sherwood was understandably disappointed with the result. "It's a tough one to take, losing in stoppage time like that," he said. "We had our chances to win the game, but unfortunately we couldn't convert them. Credit to Stoke, they fought hard and took their chance when it came." The defeat leaves Aston Villa languishing in 17th place in the Premier League table, just one point clear of the relegation zone. With tough fixtures against the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool coming up in the next few weeks, Sherwood will need to rally his troops and find a way to start picking up points if Villa are to avoid the drop this season. Despite the disappointment of the defeat, there were some positives for Aston Villa to take away from the game. Gestede's goal was his third of the season and showed that the striker has the ability to find the back of the net at this level. In addition, Villa's defense looked solid for much of the game, with Vlaar and co. doing a good job of keeping Stoke's attack at bay. Looking ahead, Aston Villa will need to put this defeat behind them and focus on the challenges that lie ahead. With a tough run of fixtures coming up, it's crucial that Sherwood's side find a way to start picking up points if they're to pull clear of the relegation zone and secure their Premier League status for another season.
