chatgpt: University of Arkansas football coach Bobby Petrino has admitted to an extramarital affair after a police report revealed that his girlfriend, Jessica Dorrell, was with him during a motorcycle crash that left him injured on Sunday. Initially, Petrino had told the police and the public that he was alone at the time of the crash, but the presence of his girlfriend has prompted an investigation into the matter. The university’s athletic director, Jeff Long, said at a press conference on Tuesday that he had placed Petrino on paid leave while the matter was being investigated. Long added that he would not speculate on Petrino’s future with the team or the university but emphasized that the coach had knowingly violated the university's policy regarding sexual harassment. The revelation of Petrino's affair and deception has come as a shock to the Arkansas community, which has long revered him for his coaching abilities. Petrino has been the Razorbacks' head coach since 2008 and led the team to an 11-2 record last season, including a Cotton Bowl win over Kansas State. The crash occurred on a rural stretch of road in Madison County, Arkansas, on Sunday evening. Petrino was hospitalized with a broken rib and other injuries and was released on Tuesday morning. Dorrell, who works in the university’s football department, was also injured in the crash but not hospitalized. The circumstances of the accident have raised questions about Petrino’s judgment and integrity, and the university has launched an investigation into the matter. Long said that he first learned of the incident on Monday morning and immediately initiated a review of the situation. He said that Petrino had initially told him that he was alone in the crash, but later admitted that Dorrell was with him. Long emphasized that his decision to place Petrino on leave was based on the coach’s deception rather than the affair itself. “He made a choice to violate the trust of his family and the university,” Long said. “He has expressed remorse for his actions and has apologized for the harm he has caused.” Petrino released a statement on Tuesday apologizing to his family, the university, and the Razorback fans. “I'm sorry for my actions and for the pain that I've caused to everyone involved,” he said. “I understand that I have let my family down, and I will work to regain their trust and respect.” The university’s investigation into the matter is ongoing, and Long said that he would provide updates as more information becomes available.
