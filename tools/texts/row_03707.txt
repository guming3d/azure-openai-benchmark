'The defendant admitted to police that she had an alcohol problem and that she sought help in relation to this.' Ms Emery told the court that Ms Kenny had suffered from anxiety since the age of 14 and had contacted her psychiatrist prior to being stopped by police. She said that Ms Kenny had begun drinking to 'self-medicate' when a relationship of hers failed two years ago. 'But it is a problem that she recognises and she has some insight in relation to as she was obviously extremely co-operative with police and very open and honest about that,' Ms Emery said.
