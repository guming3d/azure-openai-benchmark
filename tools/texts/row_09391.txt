Victor Manguel allegedly became disruptive mid-flight, causing concern for the safety of the other passengers and flight crew. According to reports, Manguel's behavior became increasingly erratic as the flight progressed, and he ultimately began making threats towards the flight attendant. Fearing for her safety, the flight attendant called upon four first class passengers to assist in retraining Manguel. The passengers successfully subdued Manguel, allowing the plane to complete an emergency landing in Memphis, Tennessee. However, upon landing, Memphis police and the FBI stormed the plane and took Manguel into custody. Following his arrest, Manguel was charged with interfering with a flight crew, a federal offense that carries severe penalties. The FBI is currently investigating the incident to determine the full extent of Manguel's actions during the flight. Passengers onboard the diverted flight were forced to spend the night in Memphis, with many expressing frustration and disappointment over the unexpected delay.
