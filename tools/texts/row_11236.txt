article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Whether you're a fan of any sport, or even just a keen music follower -- you've probably visited a major stadium. The ugliest stadiums in the world? Have a look at our list and tell us what you think of the choices. Like all buildings with any form of public use, stadiums tend attract more than their fair share of criticism. It's hard to visit a massive venue that has possibly seen millions of dollars of taxpayer money poured into it, without forming an opinion. While usability, safety, comfort for players and fans, and the ability to generate a steady income are probably the most important factors for modern-day stadiums, there is one other aspect that is sometimes forgotten: how they look. We have scanned the world for some of the ugliest stadiums in the world, and we've drawn up a first XI of the less attractive venues. The stadiums come from all corners of the globe and have been built under all types of budgets. Some of these structures may have been referred to by others as "ugly", they may be facing the threat of being torn down, or we may have just decided that they aren't so easy on the eye.

Some examples that made it into the list include the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which was built in 1987 and lays claim to having the biggest stadium roof in the world. But sadly does not boast the most attractive structure. The choice of Wembley Stadium in London, England, may be a controversial one, however, it was named in a list of Britain's ugliest buildings by Britain's The Times newspaper as "a bloated middle-aged office block with a pitch attached."

chatgpt: CNN, a prominent news network, has released a list of the world's ugliest stadiums. This compilation includes stadiums from around the globe, ranging from Britain to Bangkok. The list has been generating a lot of buzz and has sparked conversation among sports fans worldwide. The list includes several recognizable stadiums such as Stade Velodrome in Marseille, France, which CNN describes as a "concrete monstrosity." Another notable stadium on the list is San Siro, which is located in Milan, Italy. According to CNN, San Siro is an "architectural abomination." CNN's list has not come without criticism, as some fans believe it is subjective and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Nevertheless, the publication has invited readers to share their thoughts on the choices and suggest any stadiums they believe have been missed. It is worth noting that many of the stadiums on CNN's list were built decades ago and were not designed with aesthetics in mind. Functionality and affordability were often the primary concerns for many stadium constructions of the past. Despite this, many modern stadium designs prioritize both functionality and aesthetic appeal. For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany is known for its sleek, modern appearance and has won several design awards. As sports fans around the world continue to debate CNN's list, it is clear that stadium design will continue to be an important topic in the world of sports. In conclusion, CNN's list of the world's ugliest stadiums has generated conversation and debate among sports fans worldwide. While some may disagree with the choices, the list serves as a reminder that aesthetics remain an important aspect of stadium design. As stadium construction continues to evolve, we can expect to see more innovative and visually appealing designs in the years to come.
