chatgpt: On Tuesday, filmmaker Michael Moore and his ex-wife and producer, Kathy Glynn, finalized their divorce after 22 years of marriage at Antrim County Circuit Court in Bellaire, Michigan. The former couple owns nine properties across the United States, including a 10,000-square-foot mansion on Torch Lake in Michigan worth $2 million and a multi-unit condo in Manhattan.  During the legal proceedings, Moore reportedly placed the blame for the costly extension on their Torch Lake property on Glynn. The couple had reportedly been renovating the property for years, and Moore cited the expense of the project as a factor in the dissolution of their marriage.  Moore and Glynn were known for their collaborative efforts in the film industry, with Glynn frequently serving as producer on Moore’s documentaries, including “Fahrenheit 9/11” and “Bowling for Columbine,” both of which won Academy Awards.  Moore split his time between their two primary residences in Detroit and New York, where the couple owned a multi-unit condo that was once three separate apartments. The value of their Manhattan property has not yet been disclosed.  Despite the end of their marriage, Moore and Glynn are still credited as co-producers on Moore’s upcoming documentary, “Fahrenheit 11/9,” which is slated for release on September 21.  It is unclear how the former couple’s assets will be divided following the divorce, including the properties they jointly owned. Their Torch Lake mansion is known for its stunning lakefront views and luxurious amenities, including a private boat dock and sprawling outdoor patio.  Moore and Glynn were known for their activism and support of progressive politics, with Moore famously endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential election. Glynn is also known for her work as a social justice advocate and was a key organizer of the Women’s March on Washington.  The dissolution of their marriage comes as a surprise to many in their social and professional circles, with the couple having been together for over two decades. It is unclear whether they will continue to work together professionally or how their split will affect their activism efforts.  Moore and Glynn have not yet released a statement regarding the details of their divorce, including how their assets will be divided and whether alimony or child support will be awarded. The division of their properties and financial assets is likely to be a lengthy and complicated process, given their extensive real estate holdings and high net worth.  Overall, the end of their marriage marks a notable shift for the couple, who were once known for their close collaboration both in and out of the film industry. How they will each move forward, both personally and professionally, remains to be seen.
