article: For a week each spring, the heart of Internet culture relocates to Austin, Texas. And this year, one lucky Web startup will get some help making the move to the tech hotbed a permanent one. At this year's South by Southwest Interactive Festival, considered a sort of mashup of the Super Bowl and spring break for the tech elite, Austin startup accelerator Capital Factory is launching a contest to "move your company to Austin." Ten startups will be chosen to compete for the chance to relocate their business to the Texas capital. The winning company will receive a package of prizes worth around $100,000 donated by Austin area businesses. They include $15,000 for housing, $25,000 of venture capital investment, $24,000 worth of server hosting and $6,000 in moving expenses, a year's worth of free storage and even six months' worth of groceries. Capital Factory will provide free work space for six months. The contest is the brainchild of Josh Baer, managing director of Capital Factory.  He's been nicknamed the "Austinpreneur" for his efforts to to nurture Austin startups and attract new ones. "The idea came from thinking about how to make the most of all the awesome entrepreneurs coming to Austin for South by Southwest and to capitalize on the large influx of people to Austin and Texas," he said. The South by Southwest Festival, which begins March 8, keeps getting bigger and Austin has benefited from its success. Previous festivals have served as a launching pad for companies like Twitter and Foursquare, and tech giants from around the world have taken notice. Over the past few years companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook have all opened offices in Austin. The five days of the interactive festival, which coincides with movie week and comes a week before the festival's trademark music showcase, attracts many of the biggest names and brightest minds in startups. This year over 25,000 people from all over the world are traveling to Austin for networking, demoing products, and to find out what's next in tech. Silicon Valley may have a larger tech scene,  but with a low cost of living, a business friendly tax code, and South by Southwest, Austin has become a serious player, advocates like Baer say. For Shawn Bose, Vice President of Global Business for uShip, the reason for Austin's rise is easy to define. "More than anything, Austin's an excellent launching pad for tech entrepreneurs because it's a great place to live," he said. Bose, whose company is providing the moving funds, says the contest is a way for tech companies to "pay it forward" to others just starting out. "We were once bootstrapped ourselves, so our goal is just to offer some resources and advice to other companies that want to make it happen in Austin," he said. The deadline for entry is February 24, and the contest will be held at the Startup Village at SXSW on March 8. Companies can enter by going to the Capital Factory website.

chatgpt: A new contest for web startups has emerged, with a unique offer to pay a young company to move to Austin. The contest features a grand prize of $100,000 to aid in the move and support a startup during South by Southwest. Capital Factory, a startup accelerator in the tech-savvy city, is sponsoring the contest, and participants are calling it a way to give back to up-and-coming startups in the tech field. The contest is open to all web startups, regardless of their origin, and the goal is to help build and foster the startup scene in Austin. Over the years, Austin has become a hub for startups, and the decision to move a business there can be daunting. This contest provides an incentive for young companies to consider Austin as a viable location. Capital Factory's Investor Relations Manager, Kimberly Plaskett, spoke about the contest during an interview, saying "we want to see the best and brightest startups flock to Austin, and we're willing to pay them to do so. By providing financial support to a young company, we're hoping to alleviate some of the financial burden that comes with starting up and moving to a new state." The contest is providing a much-needed boost for startups, which have been struggling to secure funding due to the current economic climate. By offering a substantial cash prize, participants now have a chance to jumpstart their businesses and get their feet off the ground. One participant in the contest is Mosaic, a startup that provides a platform for businesses to collaborate and share ideas amongst their team. Mosaic's CEO, Joshua Hample, spoke about the contest during an interview. "We're excited to participate in this contest and move our business to Austin. We've always admired the startup scene in Austin, and this contest provides the financial support we need to make the move." According to Kimberly Plaskett, "The contest is a way for Capital Factory to give back to the startup community. We believe that by supporting young companies, we're investing in the future of tech and entrepreneurship." Some skeptics have raised questions about the contest, asking if it's ethical to pay companies to move to a specific location. However, Plaskett asserts that this contest is entirely lawful and transparent. Furthermore, it is providing much-needed support to startups that might otherwise struggle--and potentially fail--due to financial and logistical difficulties. In conclusion, the contest for web startups, which offers a cash prize of $100,000 to move and support a startup during South by Southwest, is providing much-needed support to young companies in the tech field. By alleviating some of the financial burden associated with starting up and moving to a new state, the contest is helping to jumpstart businesses and bolster the startup scene in Austin. Ultimately, the contest is a positive development for the tech field, representing a way for larger, established businesses to pay it forward and invest in the future of tech and entrepreneurship.
