article: These are the first images of a polar bear looking after her new born cub at a zoo in Germany. The tiny animal, which is just weeks old, can be seen clambering over its mother Vilma in their birthing cave at Rostock Zoo in the north of the country. Staff say the cub, which has yet to be named, was born on Vilma's 12th birthday and is so young it has yet to fully open its eyes. The first images have been released of a polar bear cub born just two weeks ago at Rostock Zoo in Germany . In one picture, Vilma can be seen lying on her back and gently resting one of her huge paws over the cub. According to German website Rostock Heute, the father is a male called Lars - the same bear that fathered Knut, a cub born in captivity in Berlin eight years ago. The mother and her newborn are currently alone in the cave and are only visible through images beamed from a video camera. Zoo bosses said the birth took place on December 3 and comes amid plans to build a new Â£7.85million facility for polar bears and penguins in 2016. The cub, which has yet to be named, was born on its mother's 12th birthday and is so young it has yet to fully open its eyes . The last polar bear births at the zoo were ten years ago in 2004 when twins Venus and Valeska were born. Staff say Vilma, who has become a mother for the second time, is looking after her cub 'intensely' and that the young animal is already putting on weight. Two years ago she had a daughter named Anori after giving birth at a zoo in Wuppertal near Dusseldorf. Polar bear cubs generally weigh about 450-850 grams at birth and only open their eyes between 21 and 34 days later.

chatgpt: The first images of a tiny cub born in captivity in a zoo in Rostock, Germany have emerged. The adorable baby animal is just a few days old and so young that it has not yet even opened its eyes. The cub, which has yet to be named, was born on mother Vilma's 12th birthday. Zookeepers at Rostock Zoo discovered the cub nestled in its mother's arms just a few days ago. They have been monitoring the cub closely ever since, and are pleased with its progress so far. The baby animal is said to be in good health, and both it and its mother are doing well. The images show the cub snuggled up closely to its mother, who is keeping a watchful eye over her new offspring. The little cub is so small that it could easily fit into the palm of your hand. Its fur is still soft and downy, and its tiny paws are just starting to develop. The cub's birth is particularly significant as it was born on Vilma's 12th birthday. The mother bear has been living at Rostock Zoo for ten years, and is said to be an excellent mother. Vilma has given birth to cubs in the past, and zookeepers are hopeful that this new arrival will be just as successful. Despite the cub's young age, the zoo is already planning to celebrate its arrival. Visitors will be able to see the little animal once it is old enough to be shown to the public. The zoo is also asking for suggestions for a name for the new arrival, with a shortlist of potential names set to be revealed soon. The birth of the cub has been warmly welcomed by animal lovers around the world. It is hoped that the little animal will go on to play an important role in the conservation of its species in the years to come. For now though, the focus is on ensuring that the cub gets the best possible start to life, with Vilma the perfect mother to guide it through its early days.
