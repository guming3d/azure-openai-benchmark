Murder probe: Dr Gary Hughes was found dead at his home in Feock, and his wife Marion is believed to have been arrested . The wife of a GP has been arrested by police on suspicion of murder after her doctor husband was stabbed to death at their Â£700,000 home. Gary Hughes, 60, was found dead in the coastal village of Feock, Cornwall, at 7.40am today and his wife Marion is believed to have been held by police. Officers said they found the body of a man with stab wounds to the chest and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Mrs Hughes also suffered injuries and was taken to hospital but police said her wounds were not life threatening. Mr Hughes was a GP in the Camborne and Redruth area of Cornwall. Detective Inspector Ben Beckerleg of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'This is the beginning of an investigation. 'But early indications suggest this was a domestic incident and no-one else is being sought at this time. 'An investigation had now begun to fully understand the circumstances and events leading up to this man's death.' Neighbour, Chris Young, said: 'When it comes so close to your doorstep it is very worrying. This is a very quiet area with very few passers-by.' Villager Cynthia Vanstone said: 'He was a lovely doctor. He was willing to help anyone'. Dr Hughes, qualified in 1977, was a Senior Partner at the Clinton Road NHS surgery in Redruth, Cornwall. The surgery's website lists his interests are obstetrics and family planning and said in his spare time he liked to go sailing. Probe: Police have sealed off Dr Hughes' property in Feock, Cornwall, where he was found with stab wounds . Dr Hughes, who had two sons, had continued a proud family tradition by following both his parents to become a GP. His late mother treated the survivors of the infamous Belsen concentration camp at the end of World War II. Dr June Hughes, who died in February last year at the age of 91, started her medical training in 1939 and was called up to serve as an Army doctor in 1944. After the war she became one of the first female doctors in Cornwall and married fellow GP Edward Hughes. They both worked as family doctors in picturesque villages around Truro from Chacewater to Feock. Gary, who was known to the family as 'Tiger', was their only son but her and his wife had six daughters: Rona, Anne, Jessica, Marion, Norna and Nina. The family home at Feock was used as a medical practice from 1962 and Dr Hughes and her husband carried out weekly surgeries in nearby St Day and Ponsanooth.
