article: (CNN) -- American Airlines will cancel more flights from its daily schedule through mid-November. "American Airlines is extending its previously announced schedule reductions through the first half of November by approximately 1%," said American spokesman Matt Miller in a statement. "Although we are beginning to see improvements in our operations, we are taking this proactive step to allow us to get our performance back to the levels our customers deserve and expect." The new cuts of about 31 flights per day out of the airline's total network of 3,500 daily flights will not affect holiday travel, Miller said. Previously, the airline announced an up to 2% reduction in the number of seat sales through the end of October. The airline declared bankruptcy last year and has been mired in contract negotiations with unions. Airline executives convinced a bankruptcy judge to throw out the pilots' contract last month. In the past month, more than 1,000 American flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed. Some travel agents and business travelers have told CNN they can't count on American flights to take off or -- when they do take off, to land on time. Some American customers are starting to book flights on other airlines. Airline management blamed the situation on pilots filing what it claims are frivolous reports about aircraft problems as part of a slowdown. The pilots' union denied management's assertion, arguing that company mismanagement has led to increased maintenance problems. "These mechanical items are all of American management's making," American Airlines Capt. Carl Jackson, a representative of the Allied Pilots Association, told CNN on Thursday as several dozen American pilots conducted an informational picket at Washington's Reagan National Airport. "They have old planes," Jackson said. "They have a shortage of mechanics, here in the near term it's going to be a severe shortage of mechanics, and we're just trying to do the best we can to get the public safely to where they need to be." The airline also faced questions about its maintenance after seats on three American Airlines flights have come loose in flight, requiring the airline to fix floor mounts in 48 of its 757s to prevent seats from coming loose again. Although American management and pilots resumed negotiations last week, the three major American employee unions have already reached conditional agreement with US Airways, should a merger of the two airlines take place.

chatgpt: American Airlines has announced that it will cancel about 1% of its flights every day due to ongoing struggles with delays and labor issues. The cancellation of approximately 31 flights per day will be in effect through mid-November. The airline has been grappling with operational difficulties for over a year now. In recent months, American Airlines has had to cancel hundreds of flights due to maintenance issues and staff shortages, leading to frustrated passengers and employee unrest. This latest announcement comes as a part of the company's decision to extend its capacity cuts through mid-November, as the airline seeks to provide its customers with more reliable and consistent service. As per the airline, the capacity cuts are being made as a precautionary measure to ensure that American Airlines can continue to provide customers with a high level of service. The airline hopes that by reducing its capacity, it can maintain a better schedule and minimize disruptions. The latest capacity cuts are expected to affect flights across the airline's network, with destinations including the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. American Airlines spokesperson confirmed that customers who are affected by cancellations will be notified about it as early as possible, and the airline will work with them to find alternative travel arrangements. Despite the airline's efforts to mitigate the impact of the capacity cuts, customers may still face disruptions, particularly those with connecting flights. American Airlines has advised such passengers to check their flight status regularly and to reach out to the airline for assistance in case of any confusion. American Airlines has also been facing labor issues over the past year, with its pilots and flight attendants expressing frustration over their working conditions and compensation. The airline has been in talks with its employee unions to address these concerns, but so far, no resolution has been reached. The airline's reputation has suffered in light of the ongoing delays and cancellations, and the latest announcement is unlikely to improve its public image. However, the extended capacity cuts will hopefully allow the airline to focus on resolving its operational and labor issues, and ultimately provide its customers with the reliable service they deserve.
