He's most famous for bending spoons and mixing with the rich and famous, but a new documentary claims Uri Geller has also been leading a secret life as a CIA spy. And the controversial paranormalist has even admitted he was once asked to use telepathy to stop a pig's heart, but he refused as he suspected he would next be asked to perform the act on a human. Geller's life as a covert spy has been revealed in a new documentary by Vikram Jayanti, The Secret Life of Uri Geller - Psychic Spy? Uri Geller's secret life as a CIA spy has been revealed in a new documentary . The film explores work Geller is said to have carried out for military and intelligence agencies across three continents. The film, which was premiered at the Sheffield Doc Fest and will be broadcast by the BBC later this year, includes interviews with those who had first-hand knowledge of Geller's work, including former CIA officer Kit Green and retired army colonel John Alexander, who featured in journalist Jon Ronson's book The Men Who Stare At Goats. Geller, who attended the premiere, has said he is concerned at the way he is revealed as a spy in the film. Speaking to The Independent, Geller said: 'I didn’t realise that Vikram was going to do such a thorough job of tying all the loose ends... making that the little hints I dropped throughout my career were real.' Geller has admitted he was asked to stop a pig's heart but he refused as he feared he would next be asked to perform the act on a human . He also said he refused to carry out 'dark things' and only executed 'positive' missions. The film suggests Geller attempted to erase the contents of floppy disks being carried by Soviet diplomats in Mexico back to Russia and even disable radar when Israeli commandos stormed a hijacked plane during the 'raid on Entebbe'. Film-maker Jayanti suggests the US recruited Geller during a 'psychic arms race' with the Soviet Union, although it is believed he came to the attention of the CIA while he was already working for the Israeli military. While Geller remains coy about his involvement in covert operations during the film, he is happy to reveal how he obtained his surprise Mexican citizenship - by pinpointing where to drill for oil. The spoon-bender is believed to have first come to the attention of the CIA while working for the Israeli military . Geller has said he first became aware of his abilities at the age of five when a spoon curled up in his hand and broke during a meal. He says he went on to develop the powers by demonstrating them to pupils at his school . His mother meanwhile believed he inherited them from distant relative Sigmund Freud.

chatgpt: A new documentary has uncovered the secret life of Uri Geller, revealing that the well-known psychic was also a spy for the US government during the 1970s. The film, which is directed by Vikram Jayanti, suggests that Geller was recruited by the CIA during a period of heightened interest in psychic abilities, known as the "psychic arms race." According to the documentary, Geller was used by the CIA to try to remotely view and gather information on foreign locations and events. He was apparently even asked to use his powers to stop the beating heart of a pig during an experiment, but refused. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Geller confirmed that he had been approached by the CIA but said he could not confirm or deny any involvement with them. "I cannot confirm nor deny anything. All my life I have been under suspicion. I've proven that I am totally clean, I have nothing to hide," he said. Geller shot to fame in the 1970s for his supposed ability to bend spoons and read minds. He has always maintained that his powers are real and not just illusions. However, the documentary suggests that Geller's psychic abilities could have been exaggerated by his handlers in an attempt to create a public image as a powerful spy. Jayanti, the film-maker behind the documentary, said he was interested in exploring the question of what happens when someone with unproven abilities is put into positions of power. "What I was interested in exploring was the moral and ethical questions around putting someone with no real abilities into positions of power and to what extent that could be dangerous," Jayanti said. The film has already stirred up controversy, with some critics arguing that the documentary is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to discredit Geller and his psychic abilities. However, Jayanti said his intention was not to debunk Geller's powers but to explore the question of whether someone with unproven abilities should be given access to classified information and used in sensitive operations. "The film is not about psychic abilities. It's about the question of what happens when someone is put into positions of power and influence with no real ability," he said. Despite the controversy surrounding the documentary, Geller remains popular with many people around the world who view him as a powerful psychic and spiritual leader. Whether or not his alleged involvement with the CIA will change people's opinion of him remains to be seen, but it is certain that the documentary has shed new light on the life and career of one of the world's most famous psychics.
