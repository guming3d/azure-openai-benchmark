article: (CNN)Alabama's governor apologized for what he called an "unfortunate use of excessive force" by a police officer against an Indian man, even as the officer in question pleaded not guilty to assault. Gov. Robert Bentley wrote a letter to the consul general of India in Atlanta, Ajit Kumar, offering an apology to the government of India for the "tragic incident." Bentley was referring to an encounter where a Madison County, Alabama, police officer forced a 59-year-old man to the ground, causing partial paralysis. "I wish to assure you and the government of India that we will see that justice is done," Bentley wrote. On Tuesday, the officer, Eric Parker, entered a plea of not guilty in court. Parker, 26, has been charged with third-degree assault, a Class A misdemeanor. He waived arraignment, according to Limestone County court documents. CNN reached out to Parker's attorney, Robert Tuten, for comment, but didn't get an immediate response. Parker posted bail of  $1,000 last week and was released from jail. Sureshbhai Patel needed spinal fusion surgery to repair damage to his back after Parker forced him to the ground. Video from the dash cameras of two police cars recorded the encounter, which took place the morning of February 6. Patel was walking through a neighborhood in Madison when Parker and another officer answered a call about a suspicious man. When police responded, there was a language barrier. Patel, who is helping take care of his developmentally delayed 17-month-old grandson, speaks little English. A police statement said Patel was taken to the ground after officers attempted to pat the subject down and he attempted to pull away. An attorney for the Patel family said Tuesday the grandfather was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on  Monday. "He has a long, difficult and uncertain rehabilitation process ahead of him," Hank Sherrod wrote in an email to CNN. A trial by judge is scheduled for April 29.

chatgpt: Eric Parker, a former police officer from Madison, Alabama, was released last week after posting a $1,000 bail. He was accused of assaulting Sureshbhai Patel, a 57-year-old Indian man, while on duty in February of 2015. Patel was stopped by the police after a suspicious person report was filed. The incident left Patel with serious injuries and in need of spinal surgery.  The incident with Patel had left the Indian community in Madison and beyond, outraged. Patel's son expressed shock over the incident and said that his father had come to the U.S. to help his son and his family. He also said that his father couldn't speak English and was walking in the neighborhood to get some fresh air.  The police officer, Parker, faced a trial in which several videos of the incident were presented by the prosecution. The videos clearly showed Parker shoving Patel to the ground, leaving him with severe injuries. However, Parker's defense argued that Patel had resisted arrest and that his actions were in line with standard police protocol.  Despite the defense's claims, the jury found Parker guilty of depriving Patel of his civil rights. This verdict was met with applause and relief from the Indian community, who had been following the case closely. Justice had been served, and Parker was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  However, this was not the end of the story. Parker's appeal for a new trial was granted, and he was released last week after posting a $1,000 bail. This has left Patel's family and supporters feeling disappointed and frustrated. They had hoped that Parker would serve his sentence and be held accountable for his actions.  The case has raised many questions about police brutality and race relations in the United States. It has also highlighted the importance of ensuring that those in positions of authority are held accountable for their actions. While Parker may have been released on bail, the fight for justice and accountability for Patel's injuries continues.
