article: (CNN) -- Thousands of people were evacuated from the coast of southern Spain on Friday as a wildfire menaced the wealthy resort town of Marbella, local authorities said. About 4,000 people were evacuated from the village of Ojen and an additional 2,000 people from the eastern part of Marbella, said Maria Jose Figueira, a spokeswoman for Marbella's government. The fire has been brought under control in Marbella but continues to rage out of control north of Marbella near Ojen and Coin, Figueira said. At least one person is feared dead after a charred body, thought to be that of an elderly man, was found in Ojen, she told CNN. An injured German couple has been admitted to the Carlos Haya Hospital in Malaga, she added. The wildfire started Thursday in Coin, to the north of Marbella, Figueira said. It was at its most intense at noon Friday near the villages of Ojen, Coin and Monda, Spain's Efe news agency reported. A racetrack in Marbella and a sports center in the Monda area have been set up as shelters for those forced to leave their homes, the news agency said. However, those previously ordered to leave their homes in Marbella can now return, Figueira said. The Costa del Sol, in Spain's Andalucia region, is popular with visitors for its Mediterranean beaches and sunshine, and is home to large numbers of expatriates, particularly from Britain. The UK Foreign Office said it was working with Spanish authorities. "We estimate that several hundred British nationals have been evacuated, including some 300 who have been relocated to evacuation centers in the La Cala de Mijas and Calahonda areas," a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. Marbella, studded with luxurious villas, is known as a destination for the rich and famous. Monda and Ojen lie in the foothills of the Sierra de las Nieves, a mountainous area designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1995, according to the Costa del Sol Tourist Board.

chatgpt: A forest fire in the Marbella area of the Costa del Sol has forced the evacuation of thousands of residents and tourists. The blaze broke out last Thursday to the north of the resort town and has been burning out of control for several days. Local authorities have confirmed that one charred body has been found and two people have been injured in the inferno. The cause of the fire is not yet clear, although officials believe that it may have been started accidentally. Strong winds and dry conditions in the region have helped the blaze to spread quickly, making it difficult for firefighters to bring it under control. Residents and tourists have been forced to flee their homes and hotels, seeking refuge in emergency shelters set up by the local authorities. Many have expressed concern for their safety, as the fire rages on and continues to spread. Despite the efforts of firefighters to contain the blaze, it has already caused significant damage to the local environment. Thick smoke has filled the air, making it difficult for drivers to see and causing respiratory problems for some people. Local authorities have urged people to stay away from the affected area and to avoid unnecessary travel. They have also called for patience and understanding from those who have been forced to evacuate, assuring them that everything possible is being done to bring the fire under control and ensure their safety. The Marbella area of the Costa del Sol is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world. Its beaches, restaurants, and nightlife attract millions of visitors each year, making it an important source of revenue for the local economy. However, the current forest fire is likely to have a significant impact on the region's tourism industry. As firefighters continue their battle against the blaze, the local authorities are working to provide support and assistance to those affected by the disaster. With the situation still unfolding, it remains to be seen how long it will take to bring the fire under control and what the full extent of the damage will be.
