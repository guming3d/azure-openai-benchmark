article: Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- To anyone shopping at Nairobi's Westgate Mall, it would likely have seemed just another store. But according to a Kenyan intelligence official, the small shop concealed an ominous secret. It was rented by the Al-Shabaab terrorists, or their associates, who within a year would carry out an attack on the upscale shopping mall. The information -- revealed Friday to CNN by the source, who is close to the investigation into the attack -- suggests the Somalian terror organization had been planning the operation at least that long. How the team of terrorists got their weapons and explosives into the mall without notice is a central part of the investigation into the attack, which left at least 67 people dead and parts of the upscale mall in ruins. The Kenya Red Cross said Friday that 61 people remain unaccounted for. Some could be buried in the rubble of the partially collapsed mall. At least five of the terrorists also died before Kenyan forces were finally able to bring the siege to an end on Tuesday. The terrorists stormed the building Saturday. On a Twitter account believed to be run by Al-Shabaab, the group promised more attacks to come. "The mesmeric performance by the #Westgate Warriors was undoubtedly gripping, but despair not folks, that was just the premiere of Act 1," according to a tweet posted Thursday. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the tweet, but CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said the account, which has also posted links to statements from Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, appears to be legitimate, even if not "100% authenticated." Several Twitter accounts attributed to Al-Shabaab have been shut down in recent days, likely for violating the company's rules against promoting violence in tweets. While Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku said Friday that eight suspects are being held for questioning in the attack, authorities are increasingly concerned that some of the attackers managed to escape alongside fleeing civilians in the aftermath of the initial attack, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN. On Thursday, a Kenyan counterterrorism source told CNN that one of the suspects is an injured Kenyan who was being evacuated when a machine gun magazine fell out of his pocket, leading to suspicion he was among the automatic-weapon toting terrorists who roamed the mall killing civilians. He is being held in a military hospital, the source said. Among the suspects are three people picked up near the Ugandan border, the Kenyan official who revealed information about the mall store told CNN. CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Nima Elbagir reported from Nairobi; CNN's Neda Fashbaf also contributed to this report .

chatgpt: A possible Twitter account linked to Al-Shabaab, a Somali-based extremist group, has issued a warning that the attack at the Westgate mall in Nairobi was only "Act 1." This new development has raised concerns about the possibility of another attack in the near future. According to investigators, the attackers rented a store in the past year which they used to store weapons and other supplies that were used in the attack. The discovery of the store has given investigators some critical leads, including the identification of one of the attackers who rented the store. Despite the fact that eight suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the attack, there are concerns that some of the attackers may have escaped. The possibility of more of the attackers being at large is a source of great concern for the security forces and the public. The death toll from the attack currently stands at 67, with as many as 61 people still unaccounted for. The number of fatalities is expected to rise as more bodies are recovered from the rubble of the mall. The tragedy has brought the country to its knees and left the families of the victims grieving. The Westgate mall attack is without a doubt one of the deadliest in Kenya's history. The ruthless gunmen who executed the attack spared no one and showed no mercy to their victims. The scale of the attack has shocked the entire country and sparked a wave of anger and frustration. The authorities have been working around the clock to bring the situation under control, and they have made some significant progress in the investigation. However, much work is still to be done to bring those responsible to justice and prevent future attacks. The security forces have intensified their operations in the region, and there have been several raids in different parts of the country targeting suspected Al-Shabaab operatives. The authorities are also working with their counterparts in Somalia to track down any individuals or groups linked to the extremist group. Kenya is not the only country that has been hit by Al-Shabaab. The group has carried out several attacks in the region, including in Somalia, Uganda, and Tanzania. The group is known for its ruthless tactics and its determination to establish an Islamic state in the region. The Westgate mall attack was a wake-up call for Kenya and the region as a whole. It has exposed the vulnerability of public spaces and the need for more robust security measures. The tragedy has also highlighted the importance of regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism. In summary, the discovery of a possible Al-Shabaab Twitter account warning of another attack, the links to a store rented by the attackers, and the possibility of some of the attackers escaping have raised concerns about the security situation. Despite the arrest of eight suspects, the death toll stands at 67, with many still missing. Kenya and the region need to come together to address the security threats posed by extremist groups like Al-Shabaab.
