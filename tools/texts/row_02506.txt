article: (CNN) -- CSKA Moscow will play its next home European Champions League match with part of its stadium closed as punishment for racism offenses. Manchester City complained its players had been subjected to "monkey chants" during a match against CSKA at the Arena Khimki on October 23. European football's governing body UEFA announced the sanction on Wednesday, warning CSKA that further incidents of racism would results in graver punishments. "The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body has handed down sanctions to CSKA Moscow following incidents during their UEFA Champions League home game against Manchester City," read a UEFA statement. "Specifically, the Control and Disciplinary Body has decided to close sector D of the stadium during the club's next UEFA competition home match. "CSKA's next home fixture is scheduled against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League on 27 November in Moscow. "The fight against racism is a high priority for UEFA ... All forms of racist behavior are considered serious offenses against the disciplinary regulations and are punished with the most severe sanctions." City's Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure declared himself "furious" in a post-match interview with the club's TV channel, calling on UEFA to "ban them (CSKA) for a couple of years." Two former Premier League footballers were far from impressed with the sanction meted out to the Russian club, taking to Twitter to criticize the decision. "Wow. Partial closure of stadium for 1 match for racist abuse for CSKA Moscow! Those boys at UEFA are sooo tough!" opined former Southampton player Matt Le Tissier, who now works as a football pundit. Another former player who has also gone into broadcasting - Stan Collymore - was similarly scathing. "I'm a racist. I'm going to move to section E against Bayern ... more Uefa clownery," wrote the former Nottingham Forest and Liverpool player. Nonetheless, UEFA regulations state that a first racism offense should be punished with a partial stadium closer, a second incident of discrimination would results in a full stadium closure for one match and a â‚¬50,000 ($68,000) fine. Any club found guilty of racism a third time faces the prospect of multiple matches behind closed doors, the forfeiting of a match, deduction of points or expulsion from a competition.

chatgpt: UEFA has announced that it will punish CSKA Moscow for their racism offenses during a recent Champions League game against Manchester City. The punishment includes playing the next game with part of the stadium closed. The Russian club was found guilty of racist behavior during the October 23 match against Manchester City. Several incidents of racist abuse were reported during the game, leading to a UEFA investigation. The organization found that CSKA Moscow violated regulations against discriminatory behavior. The punishment comes in the form of a partial stadium closure during the next Champions League game. This means that a portion of the stadium will be empty during the game to discourage racist behavior by fans. The extent of the closure has not been announced, but it will likely include at least one section of seating. UEFA has taken a strong stance against racism in recent years, implementing strict regulations and punishments for clubs found guilty of discriminatory behavior. This is not the first time that CSKA Moscow has been punished for this type of behavior. In 2013, the club was fined and forced to close part of their stadium for a Europa League match for racist incidents during a game against Viktoria Plzen. The decision to punish CSKA Moscow has been met with mixed reactions from fans and members of the football community. Some argue that the punishment is not severe enough and that stronger measures should be taken to deter racist behavior. Others believe that closing part of the stadium is an effective way to discourage this type of behavior. The incident has also sparked a larger conversation about racism in football and society as a whole. Many are calling for increased education and awareness to combat discriminatory behavior, both on and off the pitch. UEFA and other football organizations have a responsibility to take a strong stance against racism and work towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all players and fans. In conclusion, UEFA's decision to punish CSKA Moscow for their racist behavior during a recent Champions League game sends a clear message that this type of conduct will not be tolerated. The organization's decision to close part of the stadium for the next game is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to combat racism in football and society.
