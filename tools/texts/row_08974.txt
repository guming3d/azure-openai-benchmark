Paul Lambert signs new Aston Villa contract that will keep him at club until 2018 . A new three-year deal was originally discussed back in February but was put on the back-burner as Villa fought for their top-flight survival. American owner Randy Lerner put the club up for sale once last season was finished but has been re-energised over the summer and is making arrangements for the long-term future of Villa. He shares a strong relationship with Lambert, who moved from Norwich in 2012 and was tasked with streamlining the playing budget. ‘This is a massive football club, a fantastic football club,’ said Lambert. ‘I knew the first two years would be tough but we've made progress and now we're beginning to see the benefits of all of that hard work. Aston Villa's young side are, so far, undefeated in the Premier League this season . ‘We're in a much healthier position on and off the pitch and, with a continued sensible approach, we believe we're on the right road to build upon the strong start we've made this season in the Barclays Premier League. ‘The bar had to be raised, everyone has stepped up and there will be continued improvement. ‘We can look to the future with real optimism and a determination to make this season successful, and the seasons that follow. ‘On a personal note I'd like to express my thanks to the chairman for his continued support and to the fans who have been really supportive towards myself, the staff and, most importantly, the team.’ Gabby Agbonlahor and Alan Hutton have also signed contract extensions with the club . New chief executive Tom Fox added: ‘I am delighted that we have extended manager Paul Lambert's contract to the end of the 2017-18 season. ‘Paul and Randy had been in discussions regarding this move when I came on board and we concluded our agreement last week. ‘We have a long-term vision for Villa and Paul is completely integrated into our plan to manage the club carefully and ambitiously back to a position in the Barclays Premier League appropriate to our history and collective expectations.’

chatgpt: Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has been handed a contract extension following his team's impressive start to the 2021/22 Premier League season. The Scottish coach has led his team to an unbeaten start, with impressive wins against Arsenal and Liverpool in the opening weeks of the campaign. The Villa board have been suitably impressed with the early performances of the team and have acted swiftly to reward Lambert's contributions to the club. The new contract will keep him at the helm until at least June 2018, giving him a platform to continue improving the team's fortunes over the next few seasons. Speaking about the new deal, Lambert said: "I'm delighted to have signed this extension and I'd like to thank the club's board for their faith in me. We've made a good start to the season, but there's still a long way to go and a lot of hard work to do." Lambert arrived at Villa Park in 2012, and has had a mixed spell in charge of the West Midlands club so far. Although he led the team to two consecutive mid-table finishes in his first two seasons, the 2014-15 campaign saw Villa languishing near the bottom of the league for much of the year before a late surge helped them avoid relegation. However, this season has been a different story altogether. Villa have picked up 10 points from their first four fixtures, with standout performances from the likes of midfielder Emi Buendia and striker Danny Ings. The team's defence has also been solid, with summer signing Axel Tuanzebe impressing on loan from Manchester United. Lambert will now hope to build on this early success and establish Villa as a top-half team in the Premier League. The club's board have been putting their faith in young players in recent seasons, with the likes of Jack Grealish and Tyrone Mings emerging as key figures in the team. With the new contract now signed, Lambert will have a degree of stability in his job that he has perhaps not enjoyed in previous seasons. He will be hoping to build on this positive start to the campaign and guide Villa to a successful season in the Premier League. Villa next face Everton at Goodison Park, with Lambert's men looking to continue their unbeaten start to the season against a solid Toffees' team. The Villa faithful will be hoping that their team can maintain the impressive form that has seen them move up to third in the Premier League table. Overall, it seems that Aston Villa are in a good place right now, with Lambert's contract extension providing some stability and a sense of continuity at the club. With promising young talent and an experienced manager at the helm, the future looks bright for Villa fans.
