article: Toddlers pushed around town in buggies are 'vulnerable' to car pollution, a Cabinet minister warned today. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said parents had raised fears with him that the pollution from busy roads was damaging their children's health. He said the level of harmful diesel soot pumped out of exhaust pipes near children was dangerous. Thick smog hit London last month - leading the Energy Secretary Ed Davey to accuse Boris Johnson of failing to tackle the problem . In an interview with The Evening Standard, the top Lib Dem called singled out London Mayor Boris Johnson for particular criticism. He urged the Tory Mayor to step up the battle against dirty air with a quicker switch to electric vehicles. Mr Davey called on the Mayor put 'smog alerts' on bus stops to alert families to the danger of venturing out. The Lib Dem accused Mr Johnson of 'flim-flamming about' on improving air quality. Mr Davey stressed children were particularly at risk from traffic pollution. He said: 'If you had electric vehicles, they would not be exposed. If you had low emission vehicles, they would not be exposed. 'But at the moment they are vulnerable if they are being pushed down congested high streets. In a buggy they are at near exhaust pipe level. 'It’s vital for the health of our children that we take this issue far more seriously.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey said car fumes were a danger to toddlers being pushed around in buggies . He accused the Mayor of 'not delivering' on a pledge to put London at the forefront of the electric car revolution. 'London needs to go electric and we need to start with the buses,' he added. 'Boris’ record on electric buses is hopeless.' But Mr Johnson’s allies blamed the Government - and even Mr Davey himself - for ignoring the Mayor's pleas for help. One ally said: 'This is the same Climate Change Secretary who has repeatedly ignored Boris’ entreaties to help us improve air quality.' The Mayor’s senior environmental adviser Matthew Pencharz insisted Mr Johnson was delivering the most ambitious set of measures in the world to tackle air pollution, including an ultra low emission zone. He said: 'He is pulling every lever that he can – it’s not unreasonable to ask the Government to do its bit too. 'Since being elected, he has driven down emissions across London, leading to a halving of the number of people living in areas with poor air quality.' But Mr Davey accused Mr Johnson of being 'lackadaisical'. He said: 'If there is a smog problem in London, he should be looking every single way possible to get that message over to people. 'If they have got asthma, they can take mitigating effects. If they want to help out, they can change their transport plans – so maybe they would say "alright I’ll work at home".'

chatgpt: The recently appointed leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, has slammed London Mayor Boris Johnson for not doing enough to address the issue of smog from cars, which he says is putting children's health at risk. He called for a swift transition to electric vehicles to replace petrol and diesel motors to counteract the situation. Davey's comments came amid recent reports that air pollution levels in London were at levels higher than recommended by the World Health Organization. The issue has persisted even as the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant reduction in traffic congestion. In a heated interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the new Lib Dem leader drew attention to the health implications of smog from cars, especially on children's respiratory systems. He argued that the path to a cleaner transportation system lies in the replacement of petrol and diesel engines with electric vehicles. "The mayor needs to take action now to make sure we are not destroying children's lungs and killing people," Davey stated. "The technology is there. It’s affordable, it’s efficient, and it’s clean. It’s time we take urgent action to make that switch." Davey's criticism of Mayor Johnson centers on the lack of significant action taken to address the issue of smog in London. He accuses the mayor of being 'lackadaisical' and failing to show any real urgency on the matter. "The mayor has declared various air quality emergencies, and yet he has failed to take any real action to address them. This is not good enough," Davey insisted. Davey's call for electric vehicles to be quickly spread is not a new one, however. Environmental activists have long pushed for the phasing out of petrol and diesel motors to reduce pollution in urban environments. While the market for electric vehicles continues to grow, it still faces considerable obstacles, including high purchase costs, a lack of charging infrastructure, and consumer awareness. Despite this, Davey believes that the urgency of the situation requires immediate action. He suggests that steps could include tax incentives to encourage the transition to electric vehicles, the establishment of charging stations in urban centers, and penalties for owners of polluting vehicles. While Davey's proposal resonates with some, critics argue that it remains impractical given the current state of the market. Electric vehicles still make up only a tiny percentage of new car sales, and many consumers cannot afford the upfront cost of new electric models. Despite the challenges, Davey remains resolute in his stance, calling on policymakers at both the local and national level to take urgent action. "The longer we wait, the more vulnerable our children and families are to dangerous levels of pollution," he stated. "It's time to act now and make that switch to electric vehicles to help protect our planet and the health of our communities."  In conclusion, the issue of air pollution continues to concern policymakers and environmentalists worldwide, with calls for action on climate change taking center stage. The debate over the viability of electric vehicles as a solution to pollution is likely to continue, with policymakers under increasing pressure to tackle the issue head-on to protect public health.
