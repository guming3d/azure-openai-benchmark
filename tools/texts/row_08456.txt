The machine is the oldest three-reeled slot on the MGM gaming floor and has the highest level of 'occupancy,' or daily time played, of all 1,900 of the casino's machines, Justin Andrews, the MGM's executive director of slots, told the Wall Street Journal. The cult slot machine even has a Facebook page and a Twitter account with the description: 'Tracking the MGM Lion's Share â€“ the progressive slot machine that still hasn't hit!' 'This game probably gets played about five times more than the average game on our casino floor,' Andrews told the Wall Street Journal, adding that staff are constantly being asked where the machine is by curious visitors.

The San Jose, California native says she's constantly on tenterhooks that somebody else will score the big prize and monitors the machine's payouts constantly. 'Every time you get an email notification you're like oh s***. Did somebody win?' she says.

chatgpt: In a city that never sleeps and is always buzzing with excitement, there is one slot machine in Las Vegas that has been harboring a jackpot of $2.3 million for almost two decades. The Lion's Share progressive slot machine, located on the gambling floor of the MGM Grand, has defied all odds by not producing a jackpot in nearly 20 years.  The Lion's Share is the last of 50 identical machines that were installed at the MGM Grand when it was first built. Since then, each of the machines has paid out multiple jackpots, with the exception of the mysterious Lion's Share. The machine boasts a 1 in 50 million chance of hitting the jackpot, making it one of the most elusive machines in the casino. MGM Grand management states that the Lion's Share is the most popular machine on the gambling floor, despite its lack of payouts. The machine has become somewhat of a tourist attraction, with guests flocking to take a picture with it or try their luck at winning the elusive jackpot. Under Nevada law, the Lion's Share cannot be disposed of until it has divested itself of its jackpot. This is due to strict regulations surrounding gambling in the state. The machine must continue to operate until the jackpot is won, even if it means going another 20 years without a payout. The Lion's Share's popularity has only increased in recent years, with its story gaining international attention. Many people believe that the machine's lack of payouts is due to a faulty mechanism or a glitch in the system, but MGM Grand management assures that the machine is checked regularly and has been declared to be in perfect working condition. Despite the odds being against them, visitors to the MGM Grand continue to try their luck at winning the Lion's Share jackpot. The machine's popularity has led to long lines and wait times, but patrons persist in the hopes of being the lucky one to finally hit the jackpot. It's not just casino-goers who are interested in the Lion's Share, though.

Some have even called it the "most famous slot machine in the world." As for who will be the lucky winner, it's anyone's guess. With the odds stacked against them, it's a game of pure chance. But that doesn't stop the crowds from gathering around the machine, hoping that they will be the ones to finally hit the jackpot and make history. Until that day comes, the Lion's Share will continue to captivate tourists and gamblers, and remind us all of the thrill and excitement that comes with playing the slots in Las Vegas.
