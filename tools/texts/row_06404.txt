article: (CNN) -- Prepare a pot of damn fine coffee and enjoy a slice of cherry pie: "Twin Peaks" is coming back. The offbeat TV series, created by David Lynch and Mark Frost, will be returning to television in 2016, according to a strange (of course) video posted on Showtime's YouTube channel. The original show ran on ABC in 1990 and 1991 and spawned a 1992 theatrical film directed by Lynch, "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me." "Dear Twitter Friends... it is happening again ... #damngoodcoffee," Lynch tweeted. According to a press release from Showtime, "Twin Peaks" will be a limited series of nine episodes. Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine. When it debuted, "Twin Peaks" was like nothing else that had ever aired on television. Lynch (then best known as the director of "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet") and Frost -- who had written for "Hill Street Blues" -- created an eerie story starring Kyle MacLachlan as FBI agent Dale Cooper, who had come to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The murder mystery was only the entry point into a bizarre world, one that was alternately drily witty and brutally violent. The straight-arrow Cooper was fond of a diner's "damn fine coffee" and pie to an almost absurd degree. The show featured a one-armed man, a dancing dwarf, rumblings at the local lumber mill and a malevolent spirit named BOB. The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti's ghostly theme music. In addition to MacLachlan, the show starred Ray Wise, Lara Flynn Boyle, Peggy Lipton and Joan Chen. "Twin Peaks" started off a huge hit, but as the plot became more obscure and the mood became darker, the audience dwindled, especially in the second season. However, those who stayed with it were a hardcore bunch, enough to prompt the theatrical film so Lynch could tie up some loose ends (or not, being Lynch). Despite diverse reviews, the show remains one of the most influential in television history, with its involvement of a noted movie director, its willingness to take audiences to far-out places, its deliberate pace and its obsessed-about plot points and character tics. In many ways, it was ahead of its time. Showtime plans to show the entire run of the TV series before the premiere of the new "Twin Peaks" episodes. "What more can I say -- 'Twin Peaks' with David Lynch and Mark Frost on Showtime in 2016!" said Showtime President David Nevins. "To quote Agent Cooper, 'I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.'"

chatgpt: David Lynch and Mark Frost are bringing back the critically acclaimed television drama "Twin Peaks," which originally aired on ABC from 1990-1991. Fans of the show, which has become a cult classic, had long speculated about the possibility of a reboot or continuation of the story. Now, Lynch and Frost have confirmed that the groundbreaking show will indeed return in 2016. "Twin Peaks" was way ahead of its time when it first aired, challenging many of the traditional norms of television storytelling. The show followed the investigation into the murder of Laura Palmer, a popular high school student in a small town in Washington state. As the investigation unfolds, the audience is introduced to a wide range of quirky characters, many of whom have their own secrets and motives. The show was known for its surreal and dreamlike visuals, its use of non-linear storytelling, and its subversion of traditional TV tropes. It was also notable for its casting, which included a mix of established actors like Kyle MacLachlan and newcomers like Sherilyn Fenn and MÃ¤dchen Amick. "Twin Peaks" was a critical hit and a pop culture phenomenon when it first aired. It spawned a range of merchandise, including books, videos, and even a tie-in soundtrack. However, the show's ratings declined in its second season, and it was ultimately cancelled after just two seasons. Despite its relatively short run, "Twin Peaks" has remained popular with viewers and has continued to influence TV shows and movies in the years since its cancellation. There have been numerous attempts over the years to revive the show, but none have been successful until now. The new season of "Twin Peaks" will consist of nine episodes, and Lynch will direct them all. The original cast members are expected to reprise their roles, with MacLachlan returning as FBI agent Dale Cooper. The show will be produced by Showtime, which announced the revival at the Television Critics Association press tour in January. Many fans of "Twin Peaks" are excited about the show's return and are curious to see how Lynch and Frost will approach the story in 2016. It remains to be seen whether the show can recapture the magic of the original, or whether it will feel like a nostalgia-fueled cash grab. Regardless of what happens, the fact that "Twin Peaks" is coming back is a testament to the show's enduring appeal and its lasting impact on pop culture. It will be interesting to see whether the show can find a new audience in the age of streaming and binge-watching, or whether it will appeal mainly to those who remember it fondly from its original run. In any case, "Twin Peaks" is sure to generate plenty of buzz and excitement as it returns to the small screen in 2016. For fans of the show, it's a dream come true, and for newcomers, it's a chance to discover a groundbreaking piece of television history.
