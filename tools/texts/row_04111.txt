A Maoist sect leader has appeared in court charged with 25 offences including false imprisonment, rape and child cruelty. Aravindan Balakrishnan, 74, was arrested in Lambeth, south London, in November last year. He faces one count of cruelty to a person under the age of 16, one count of false imprisonment, 19 counts of indecent assault and four counts of rape. The charges relate to three women between January 1980 and October 2013. Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London today, his lawyer, Adam Wiseman, indicated that Balakrishnan would plead not guilty to the alleged offences. Balakrishnan, of Edmonton, north London, spoke only to confirm his name, age and address during the brief 20-minute hearing. He was dressed in a blue waterproof jacket, grey cardigan and peach-coloured scarf, wearing glasses and with his grey hair in a mullet style. The child cruelty charge states that between January 6 1983 and January 7 1999 Balakrishnan 'wilfully ill-treated, assaulted, and neglected' a child in a manner 'likely to cause unnecessary suffering to said child or injury to its health'. A 67-year-old woman, understood to be Balakrishnan's wife, Chanda Pattni, was arrested with him in November last year. In September, after 10 months on bail, she was told she would face no further action and was released without charge. District Judge Howard Riddle said the next hearing was set for Southwark Crown Court in London on December 31. 'There are 25 separate allegations against you,' the judge said. 'These allegations are sent for trial to Southwark Crown Court and you have bail with conditions.' Mr Wiseman said he would be applying to adjourn the next hearing to the week starting January 5. Balakrishnan was released on bail with conditions that he must live and sleep at his home address, not apply for international travel documents, not contact five women, who cannot be named, and not enter Lambeth unless accompanied by his solicitor.

chatgpt: Aravindan Balakrishnan, a 74-year-old man from Lambeth, was arrested in November 2013 and has recently appeared before a court in London. He faces a plethora of charges including one count of cruelty to a person under the age of 16, one count of false imprisonment, 19 counts of indecent assault and four counts of rape. The charges are related to three separate women who were allegedly assaulted between January 1980 and October 2013. During the hearing, the court heard disturbing details of Balakrishnan's alleged actions against the women. Prosecutors described how he had subjected the women to physical and emotional abuse over a period of decades, including forcing them to perform "bizarre and humiliating" acts. The women were reportedly isolated from the outside world and lived in "constant fear" of Balakrishnan. Balakrishnan, who is also known as "Comrade Bala", was the leader of a communist group in the 1970s and 1980s, which operated from a house in south London. The group was known for its extreme views and for isolating its members from the outside world. Balakrishnan's daughter, who was born into the group, later revealed in a book that she was kept in the house for her entire childhood and was not allowed to attend school or have any contact with the outside world. The case against Balakrishnan has been ongoing for several years, with the police first launching an investigation in 2013 after one of the women managed to escape from the house and alert authorities. It is believed that the other two women were also rescued from the house shortly after. The trial is expected to last for several weeks, and Balakrishnan has denied all charges against him. His defense team is expected to argue that the women were not held against their will and that any sexual contact between them and Balakrishnan was consensual. The case has shone a light on the issue of cults and their potential for abuse. It is hoped that the trial will provide some closure for the victims and help to prevent similar cases from happening in the future.
