article: By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Mail Online Reporter . A New Jersey woman who worked four jobs died while apparently napping in her car. Elizabeth police say it appears 32-year-old Maria Fernandes of Newark was overcome by a deadly mixture of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gasoline container. She kept the extra gas in her 2001 Kia Sportage because occasionally she ran out of gas, authorities said. Maria Fernandes of Newark was overcome by a deadly mixture of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gasoline container while trying to rest between one of her four jobs . Lt. Daniel Saulnier tells The Star-Ledger of Newark it sounds like someone who tried desperately to work and make ends meet and met with a tragic accident. She worked four jobs, including two shifts at separate Dunkin Donuts. Saulnier says an autopsy failed to determine the cause of death and police are awaiting toxicology test results. No foul play is suspected. Police believe Fernandes pulled over for a nap in a parking lot early Monday. The Star-Ledger reports she often drove from job to job and caught a few hours sleep on the road between. She apparently left the car running while she tried to rest. Police were called later that afternoon. She was found with the windows and the doors to the vehicle shut, and when emergency workers burst in they reported a chemical odor. Hazmat was called to the scene upon determining Fernandes was dead. Fernandes was found near this Wawa shop with her car's engine still running and a strong chemical odor filling the air . The Star-Ledger notes that Fernandes was only of tens of thousands of New Jersey workers employed at multiple jobs. 'These are folks who would like to work full-time but they can't find jobs,' Carl Van Horn, director of John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, told reporters. 'They wind up in these circumstances in which they are exhausted. More commonly it creates just an enormous amount of stress.' At least 7.5 million people nationwide are working multiple jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. For those who lost their jobs in the recession of 2008, many now working multiple positions still make less than their full-time wages and with little or no benefits. 'The average person who lost their job took a 10 per cent pay cut, (after returning to the workforce),' Van Horn said.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck Newark, New Jersey yesterday when 32-year-old Maria Fernandes was found dead in her car. Police say she had been overcome by a combination of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gas can. Fernandes was known for keeping extra gas in her car because she often ran out as she tried to make ends meet. It appears that Fernandes had pulled over for a nap when the deadly mixture overtook her. Her body was discovered after her employer became concerned when she failed to show up for work. Fernandes worked multiple jobs to make ends meet, and her death has shocked those who knew her. Fernandes' friends and family are in shock over her sudden passing. "Maria was always such a hard worker," said her sister-in-law, Mary Fernandez. "She was always trying to make ends meet, but she never complained. It's just so sad that she didn't get the chance to see things get better for her." Fernandes' death highlights the struggles faced by many Americans who are working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. The economic difficulties of recent years have made it increasingly difficult for people to get by, and many are forced to work long hours just to pay the bills. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious issue that can affect anyone, and it's important for people to be aware of its dangers. The gas is odorless and invisible, making it impossible to detect without special equipment. Overexposure to carbon monoxide can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, and even death. It's important for people to take steps to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, especially during the colder months when heaters and other devices are in use. Simple precautions like installing a carbon monoxide detector and keeping heaters and other appliances in good working order can help prevent tragedies like the one that occurred in Newark yesterday. For Maria Fernandes, it's too late to take these precautions. Her death is a tragic reminder of the struggles many people face as they try to make ends meet in a difficult economy. She will be missed by those who knew her, and her passing serves as a reminder of the importance of taking care of oneself and being aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.
