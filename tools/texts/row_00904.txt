A female called ‘Nala’, eventually starved to death while the other, a male called ‘Simba’, stayed alive by eating her remains, . Appearing at Buxton Magistrates Court yesterday, Potts, from High Peak, Derbyshire, admitted two animal cruelty charges. The dogs were discovered by RSPCA inspector Lorna Campbell after a call from a concerned member of the public. She said: 'When I saw Simba at the window it was obvious he was emaciated and when I looked in I saw what I thought was a toy he’d chewed up. 'It took a moment before I realised the full horror of what it actually was, the remains of Nala. It was devastating.' The RSPCA had offered advice to Potts in July 2011, given him neutering vouchers and re-homed a third dog which he had at that time but had no complaints since.

The court heard that Potts and his children had moved into his mother’s house in Chapel-en-le-Frith. He hadn’t been back to his own property for more than four weeks. RSPCA Inspector Campbell said: 'That Simba survived is a miracle. When police gained access he raced past us to a bowl of dirty water in the garden with cigarette butts in it and tried to drink from it. 'The conditions in the house were terrible. The place was covered in faeces and the floor was slippery with urine. 'There was a shredded dog food bag on the floor, an empty tub of gravy granules and chewed towels and of course what was left of his companion. 'Tragically, there was a bag of dog biscuits on the worktop which it looked as though the dogs had been trying to reach but it was just too high.' Potts’ solicitor told the court he was finding it difficult to manage his responsibilities and had moved in with his mother to help. He’s due to appear at Buxton Magistrates Court on August 21 for sentencing. After being signed over to the RSPCA, Simba has recovered and has been happily re-homed.

chatgpt: A man from Rochester, Shane Maurice Potts, has been found guilty of neglecting and mistreating his dogs. Potts left his pets unattended after moving to his mother's house with his children. The dogs were left in appalling conditions, with no access to food, water, or proper care. According to witnesses, the dogs were confined to a small room without any ventilation, sunlight or clean water. The animals were unable to move freely and were forced to live in their own filth. The conditions were made worse by the fact that Potts had left a bag of dog biscuits just out of their reach, adding to their suffering. The situation came to light when neighbors noticed the dogs were howling constantly and alerted the authorities. When animal welfare workers arrived at the scene, they were shocked by what they saw. They described the scene as "one of the worst cases of animal neglect they had seen in years." The dogs were immediately seized and taken into protective custody. Potts initially claimed that he had arranged for someone to feed and care for the dogs while he was away. However, investigations revealed that this was not the case. Potts had left the dogs alone without even checking on them once during his absence. During the trial, Potts pleaded guilty to charges of animal cruelty and neglect. His actions were condemned by the judge, who described his behavior as "inhumane and unacceptable." Potts was sentenced to community service and fined for his actions. He also received a lifetime ban on owning animals. Animal welfare groups have welcomed the verdict, but have also expressed concern about the high numbers of animal neglect cases in the region. They are calling on pet owners to take their responsibilities seriously and to seek help when needed. The incident has sparked a debate about the importance of responsible pet ownership. Many owners are often unaware of the proper care their pets require, leading to situations like this. The message is clear: owning a pet comes with a significant responsibility that cannot be ignored. In conclusion, the plight of these dogs serves as a reminder of the need for active intervention in cases of animal neglect. The authorities are taking a more stringent approach to cases of cruelty and neglect in pets, but owners need to take the initiative themselves. Together, we can ensure that animal welfare remains a top priority in our society.
