article: (CNN) -- The family of a Georgia student suspended for the rest of the school year for hugging a teacher has filed an appeal with the school board, the teen's mother told CNN on Wednesday night. Sam McNair, a 17-year-old high school senior in Duluth, Georgia, was suspended December 3 for sexual harassment. Surveillance video captured the hug in question, showing Sam placing his arms around the teacher and giving her a hug. The teacher then pushes him away. McNair told "Piers Morgan Live" that he had hugged that teacher at Duluth High School before. "Four or five times," he said. "I hug all my teachers. It's to show appreciation for what they do for me." He denied that the teacher had told him before to not hug her again. He also said that his lips and cheeks definitely didn't touched the teacher's neck, as is alleged in a discipline report obtained by CNN affiliate WGCL. In a statement earlier this week, Sloan Roach, a spokesperson for the Gwinnett County Public Schools, told CNN, "Hearing officers consider witness testimony, a review of the known facts, and a student's past disciplinary history -- including long-term suspensions that result in alternative school placement -- when determining consequences." "If a parent has concerns about the outcome of a panel, he or she is entitled to appeal the decision to the Gwinnett County Board of Education," Roach added. Since this is a discipline issue, the law prohibits the district from sharing details about the student's situation or the student's past discipline history, said the spokeswoman. McNair acknowledged he had also been suspended for lengthy periods in the seventh and ninth grades, but said the first incident was from a BB gun that another student placed in his bag, and the second stemmed from medicine a teammate gave him for an injury. He had a bad reaction and it caused a "big school disruption," he said. April McNair, Sam's mother, said she was never notified that her son's behavior this year was a problem. "Sam is a lovable kid," she said, adding that he treated everyone that way. She said an appeal was sent Wednesday to the school board. She remains concerned this will negatively impact her son's future. "This is his senior year," April McNair said. "You've stripped that of him." Sam McNair said he is more cautious about he now greets people and if they seem hesitant he passes on the hug. "I make sure I present myself as a gentleman," he said.

chatgpt: A Georgia high school senior, Sam McNair, has been suspended for sexual harassment after school officials claimed he hugged a teacher inappropriately. McNair denied the allegations and said that he has never been instructed not to hug his teachers before. His mother, April McNair, filed an appeal on Wednesday to have the suspension removed from her son's record. According to reports, the incident took place in a crowded hallway at Duluth High School. McNair said he hugged a teacher he had known for years while other students were present. After the incident, the teacher reported the incident to school officials, who investigated the matter. Following the investigation, the school suspended McNair and claimed that his actions constituted sexual harassment. However, McNair's mother was both surprised and adamant that her son's behavior was not a problem. "I was never told that my son's behavior was an issue," she said. "He's never had any disciplinary actions against him." She went on to say that the school's decision to suspend her son was unfair and urged the school to reconsider its decision. "I want them to understand that this is not right," she said. "He's a good student, he's a good son, and he's a good citizen. This is not fair to him." The McNairs' appeal will be reviewed by the school district's disciplinary hearing officer, who will make a final decision on whether the suspension should be removed. The family is hopeful that the appeal will be successful and that McNair's suspension will be removed from his record. The incident has sparked a heated debate among parents and students at the school, with some arguing that McNair's actions were harmless and others saying that he should have been more mindful of the teacher's personal space. Regardless of the outcome of the appeal, the situation serves as a reminder of the importance of clear communication between students and teachers when it comes to physical contact in schools. As school policies continue to evolve to address issues of harassment and bullying, it is important for both students and teachers to be aware of these policies and to adhere to them to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment for all.
