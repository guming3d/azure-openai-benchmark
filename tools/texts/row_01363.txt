chatgpt: Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku is set to complete his move to Everton from Chelsea, with the 21-year-old on his way to England to finalise the deal. Lukaku spent last season on loan at Goodison Park, scoring an impressive 15 Premier League goals for the Toffees. Despite interest from several other clubs, it appears that Everton have won the race to sign Lukaku on a permanent basis. The reported fee for Lukaku is around £28 million, which will make him Everton's record signing. The club's previous record transfer fee was £31.8 million paid for midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson in 2017. Lukaku is expected to sign a five-year deal worth £75,000-a-week, making him one of Everton's best-paid players. Everton made no secret of their desire to sign Lukaku permanently, with manager Marco Silva keen to build his team around the talented striker. Speaking earlier this month, Silva said: "We know what we want and what is our aim, but the market is not easy. It is not easy to find the right players. We want to improve our squad and our team, for sure, but we will do that when we can do it." It appears that Everton have managed to secure the services of their top target, with Lukaku set to return to Goodison Park for the new season. Everton fans will be delighted with the news, as Lukaku's performances last season were a key factor in the team's impressive campaign. Lukaku joined Chelsea in 2011 but struggled to establish himself as a first-team regular, spending time on loan at several clubs before moving to Everton on a temporary basis. It was at Everton where Lukaku truly found his form, showcasing his finishing ability and physical prowess to score a string of crucial goals. The prospect of Lukaku partnering with the likes of Richarlison and Bernard in Everton's attack is an exciting one for Toffees fans, who will be hoping that the team can build on last season's eighth-place finish. With further additions expected before the transfer window closes, Everton could be a team to watch in the upcoming season. Lukaku's departure from Chelsea will be a blow for manager Frank Lampard, who is looking to build a team capable of challenging for the Premier League title. However, Lampard has a number of promising young forwards at his disposal, including Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic, and it remains to be seen whether or not the loss of Lukaku will have a significant impact on Chelsea's season. Overall, Lukaku's move to Everton is an exciting one for both the player and the club, with the striker set to return to a place where he has enjoyed success in the past. If he can replicate his form from last season, Lukaku could prove to be the missing piece in Everton's attacking puzzle.
