article: Google has done a U-turn on its plans to crack down on pornography, after bloggers complained that they need to publish explicit photographs in order to ‘express their identities’. Earlier this week the web search giant told people who publish explicit videos and images on its Blogger platform that it would hide their posts from public view if they didn’t clean up their act. It gave them a month to delete any offensive posts, or face having their accounts made ‘private’ so that they could only be viewed through the author’s own account. Google had previously announced changes to its Blogger platform banning graphic images from public view . The move was widely welcomed by campaigners who fear that pornography is too easily accessible on the internet, including by children. However, the American company rowed back on its promise just three days later following a backlash from bloggers. Many of the people who post explicit material said they needed to express themselves, and complained that Google would be erasing collections of explicit material that they had built up over the course of ten years. Google responded that it would revert to its previous policy, which allows bloggers to publish offensive sexual images and videos as long as they are placed behind a page warning viewers that it is adult content. But the American company rowed back on its promise just three days later following a backlash from bloggers . ‘We’ve had a ton of feedback, in particular about the introduction of a retroactive change (some people have had accounts for 10+ years), but also about the negative impact on individuals who post sexually explicit content to express their identities,’ the company said. ‘So rather than implement this change, we’ve decided to step up enforcement around our existing policy prohibiting commercial porn.’ The web search giant will only ban content that is illegal, or has been published without the consent of the people it features. It had never threatened to ban nude photographs that offered ‘substantial public benefit’ on artistic, educational or scientific grounds. The company’s Blogger platform does not account for every blog on the internet. However, it includes accounts ending in ‘blogspot.com’, a free service with millions of users.

chatgpt: After facing backlash from bloggers and free speech advocates, Google has reversed its decision to hide pornographic material from public searches. The web search giant had originally informed bloggers to clean up their act or risk having their posts hidden from the public. However, the company's plans were met with criticism from those who valued freedom of speech. Google had made the initial promise in response to concerns over the easy access to pornographic material on their search engine. Some critics had argued that such content should only be accessed with specific filters or parental controls. In response, Google informed bloggers who hosted provocative content that their posts would no longer appear in public searches. While the company's intentions were well-intended, it soon became clear that such a move would infringe on the rights of bloggers and content creators. For many, hiding posts from public searches would limit their reach and reduce the amount of traffic they received. This would ultimately harm their ability to make a living as independent content creators. Moreover, the decision to hide pornographic material could be seen as censorship by some. Free speech advocates argued that the move could set a dangerous precedent in which individuals and corporations have the power to suppress certain types of content. They highlighted the importance of access to information and the potential for censorship to limit the free flow of ideas. Following these concerns, Google has rowed back on its promise to hide pornographic material. The company has recognized that the decision was not the best way to tackle the issue of easy access to adult content. Instead, it will continue to work to improve its filters and controls to ensure that only appropriate content appears in public searches. This move has been widely praised by free speech advocates and bloggers alike. It is seen as a victory for those who value the ability to create and consume content without fear of censorship or suppression. However, some critics argue that the decision could lead to increased exposure to pornographic material for younger audiences. In conclusion, while Google's initial intentions were well-intentioned, the company's decision to hide pornographic material from public searches was met with criticism from bloggers and free speech advocates. The company has now rowed back on this decision and will continue to work on improving its filters and parental controls. This move has been widely praised, but it remains to be seen how it will impact the debate around free speech and censorship.
