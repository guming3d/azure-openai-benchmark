article: Youth unemployment has increased in the UK at a faster rate than any country in the G8 since the start of the recession and cannot be blamed solely on the economic downturn, a new report claims. A study by the Work Foundation found that the UK is now only behind Spain and Greece for youth joblessness in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. The problem cannot be attributed just to the recession because other countries have fared better, said the research group. Problems: A study by the Work Foundation found that the UK is now only behind Spain and Greece for youth joblessness in OECD countries. A JobCentre Plus in Cambridge is pictured here last February . The Government was urged to follow the lead of other countries such as Germany and Denmark by taking measures including more apprenticeships and increased training. Lizzie Crowley, the report's author, said: 'In many other developed nations, youth unemployment has remained low despite the global downturn. 'However, in the UK youth unemployment as a proportion of 15 to 24-year-olds has increased at a faster rate over the course of the recession than both the European and OECD averages. 'While the reasons for this are complex, it's clear that the UK can learn from the experiences of those countries that have fared much better in terms of youth unemployment. Going up: This graph shows youth unemployment as a proportion of the population aged from 15 to 24 . 'The Government should focus on those policies that have been shown to work, cherry-picking the best responses from other countries and adapting them to the needs of the UK labour market.' 'The UK can learn from those countries that have fared much better' Lizzie Crowley, report author . Youth unemployment among 15 to 24-year-olds had increased in the UK by 35 per cent to 916,000 between 2008 and 2011. That is compared to an average of 15 per cent in the G8 countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, UK and the U.S. Germany, Russia and Japan had seen a drop in youth unemployment in the same period.

chatgpt: A new report by Work Foundation research group has revealed that the United Kingdom now ranks third highest among 35 developed countries for youth joblessness within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The only countries with worse rates than the UK are Spain and Greece.  Surprisingly, the study found that the problem is not purely a result of the recent economic recession, as some other countries have faired better during the same period. This suggests that there may be other underlying factors affecting the UK's youth employment rate. The rise in youth joblessness has been a concern for policymakers, given the numerous negative effects it can have on individuals and the wider economy. Unemployment in early adulthood can have long-lasting effects on mental and physical health, as well as reducing lifetime earnings potential. Additionally, it can also lead to increases in crime and social unrest. The study found that there is a strong correlation between education and employment outcomes for young people, with unemployment rates being much higher for those with lower levels of education. This highlights the vital role that education and training play in preparing young people for the world of work, and in reducing the risk of them becoming trapped in lifelong unemployment. Government initiatives to address the issue of youth joblessness have included the introduction of apprenticeships, offering young people the chance to gain valuable work experience while also studying. Another program, called the Work Programme, has aimed to provide tailored support to help young people find sustainable employment. Despite these efforts, the UK's youth employment rate has continued to lag behind its European counterparts, with the report finding that almost one in five young people are currently out of work. This is a worrying trend, and one which will continue to be a challenge for policymakers and educators. It is clear that the issue of youth joblessness cannot be solved through a single policy solution, but requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of the problem. The report's findings suggest that investment in education and training, as well as tailored support for young people, will be crucial if the UK is to effectively tackle the problem of youth unemployment.
