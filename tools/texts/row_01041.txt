article: PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French Senate began debate Tuesday on a law that would mark a significant cultural shift -- allowing many more shops across the country to open on Sundays. The law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones. The bill passed the lower house, the National Assembly, last Tuesday by a vote of 282 to 238, a partial victory for President Nicolas Sarkozy, who backs it. What seems routine in much of the Western world has been fiercely resisted in France, where Sundays have officially been set aside as a day of rest for more than a century and where a 35-hour workweek remains the norm. The new legislation, if approved by the Senate, would overturn a 1906 law that forbids Sunday trading in all but the largest cities. It is part of a raft of reforms Sarkozy has pushed for since becoming president. While the change is significant, it is not as much as the government originally hoped because Sarkozy had to deal with opposition from both the left and the right. Socialists filed thousands of amendments to the president's original version of the law. Leftists and unions said it would effectively introduce a seven-day working week and allow bosses to force employees to work Sundays. Members of the president's own ruling conservative party opposed the law despite assurances it would boost economic activity, saying it would instead deprive families and church groups of their dedicated day. The law would permit shops, department stores and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones of what are called "exceptional commercial" centers near three of the country's largest cities: Paris, Marseilles, and Lille. Additionally, 29 areas involving about 500 cities and towns would be added to the list of tourist areas, which already allow some economic activity on Sundays. The new law will, among other things, straighten out a somewhat chaotic situation in which some stores managed to obtain exceptions from the old law and others didn't, and where some stores found it made more sense financially to accept fines for breaking the old law because the income from Sunday sales more than made up for the penalties. Opinion polls in France show that slightly more than half the population want shops to have the freedom to open on Sundays, according to Time magazine. The Senate debate is scheduled to last three days, with a vote expected late on Thursday. CNN's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The French Senate is currently debating a new law that would allow more shops to open on Sundays, a move that would overturn a 1906 law that forbids Sunday trading. The proposed legislation has drawn opposition from both the left and right of the political spectrum. President Nicolas Sarkozy has championed the changes, arguing that they are necessary to boost the French economy and to make life easier for consumers. However, many on the left argue that the law would erode workers' rights and lead to greater income inequality. Supporters of the new law argue that it would give workers the option of working on Sundays, which would allow them to earn more money and to have greater control over their schedules. They also argue that the changes would lead to greater competition among retailers, which would ultimately benefit consumers. However, opponents of the law argue that it would lead to the commercialization of Sundays and that it would hurt smaller retailers who would struggle to compete with larger chains. They also argue that the law would place undue pressure on workers to work on Sundays, even if they did not want to. Despite the opposition, many observers predict that the law will ultimately pass, given the support of President Sarkozy and his ruling party. The changes would bring France more in line with other European countries, many of which have already liberalized their laws on Sunday trading. The debate over the law has also highlighted wider tensions within French society, particularly around issues of work-life balance and economic inequality. Many on the left argue that the government needs to do more to support workers and to address the country's high levels of unemployment. Others point to the trend of "consumerism" that has taken hold in many Western societies, arguing that the push for greater commercialization is eroding traditional values and harming community cohesion. Whatever the outcome of the debate, it is clear that the issue of Sunday trading is likely to remain a contentious one for some time to come. The pressures of modern life, combined with the need for economic growth, mean that many countries are grappling with similar issues around work, leisure, and commercialization. The French Senate's decision on this matter will undoubtedly have implications for the wider European debate on this issue.
