article: Devecser, Hungary (CNN) -- Rescue workers searched Wednesday for six elderly people missing at Kolontar, one of three villages in southwest Hungary that was hit Monday by a wave of toxic red sludge from an alumina plant reservoir that burst. Wearing chemical protection suits, the workers used metal sticks to poke through muck three-feet deep (1 meter) for the presumed victims, reported MTI, Hungary's official news agency. At least 116 people were injured, eight of them seriously, when the mishap occurred Monday afternoon, the agency said. Most of them were flown to hospitals in the capital, Budapest. The reservoir has been repaired and the flow from the pool has halted. But the material that flowed out of the reservoir continued to pose a threat. On Wednesday, more than 500 National Disaster Management Authority staffers and soldiers and employees of Hungarian Aluminum Production and Trade Company (MAL), the company that owns the alumina plant's reservoir, were trying to halt the advance of the sludge before it reaches the Danube River's tributaries, said Jeno Lasztovicza, head of the defense committee, according to MTI. The sludge had already reached the Marcal River, which flows into the River Raba, which empties into the Danube. It was expected to show up in the Danube as soon as this weekend, said Imre Szakacs, head of Gyor-Moson-Sopron County's defense authority, MTI said. Emergency workers were pouring plaster and fertilizers into the Marcal River in hopes that it would bind with the sludge and counter its alkalinity before it reached the Danube, the continent's second-longest river, some 70 km (43 miles) north, reported MTI. But the material will have been neutralized by the time it reaches the Raba, Interior Minister Sandor Pinter told reporters. Untreated, the sludge contains heavy metals, which cause burns and eye irritation, he said. Four people -- two children ages 1 and 3, an elderly woman and a 35-year-old man whose SUV overturned in the sludge -- have been confirmed dead in the environmental disaster, which occurred 160 km (99 miles) west of Budapest, near the town of Ajka. Residents were advised not to eat produce from gardens that were covered when the dam burst, releasing at least 1 million cubic meters of thick red mud. It was not clear when residents evacuated from affected areas in the villages of Kolontar, Devecser and Somlovasarhely would be able to return home, nor were the long-term consequences clear. A state of emergency has been declared in three counties, the State Secretariat of Governmental Communications said. In a statement on its website, MAL said it "offers its honest condolences to the relatives of all of the victims who lost their lives in the catastrophe." CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this story.

chatgpt: In a devastating turn of events, 4 people have been declared dead and 6 others are still missing after a toxic waste spill occurred in the southwest region of Hungary. The incident has left 116 people injured and has prompted rescue workers to frantically search for any possible survivors. The spill occurred from a reservoir that contained toxic waste material, which spilled over into nearby towns and villages. The spill was reportedly caused due to a breach in the reservoir, which is owned and managed by a local refinery company. The spill has caused major damage and destruction to property and infrastructure in the region. Rescue workers have been diligently searching for any remaining survivors using metal sticks to poke in the wet mud in the hopes of finding anyone who may have been trapped beneath the muck. The spill has also put local water supply sources in jeopardy in the affected areas, as the contaminated flow may reach the Danube River. The Hungarian government and local authorities have been working tirelessly to contain the situation and provide aid and support to the affected communities. The government has declared a state of emergency in several districts in the region, and has allocated resources to help those affected by the spill. The Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orb√°n, visited the site and assured the public that the government is doing everything in its power to manage the situation. He has also promised to provide financial assistance to those affected by the spill. The toxicity of the waste material that has spilled has created a major health hazard, and the clean-up effort underway is being treated as a top priority by the authorities. Several teams of specialists have arrived at the site from surrounding countries to provide assistance and expertise in managing the spill. The scale of the spill and resulting damage is yet to be fully assessed, and the government has warned residents in the affected areas to take necessary precautions and stay away from the affected areas until the situation is under control. This is a developing story, and the authorities are urging residents to keep updated with any information pertaining to the spill through official government channels. The Hungarian government is working closely with other international agencies to manage the situation and find a solution to contain the toxic waste spill as soon as possible.
