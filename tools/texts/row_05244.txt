Canadian scientists have discovered artificial sweeteners in water samples collected from the Grand River in Ontario. The sweeteners - found in everything from diet soda to flavored yoghurts - pass through waste-water treatment systems and are then discharged into waterways. In other words: humans consume them, expel them, and they wind up in our waterways. Sweet nothings: Artificial sweeteners are used in low-calorie foods and sodas as a sugar alternative but they persist through sewage treatment and wind up in rivers and waterways . The researchers write in a paper published on PLOS ONE that the sweeteners got into the Grand River from the 30 sewage treatment plants that empty into the river and its tributaries. The Researchers, from Environment Canada and the University of Waterloo sampled the Grand River at 23 separate locations along more than 150 miles of its course. They found concentrations of four sweeteners: cyclamate, saccarin, sucralose and acesulfame, the last of which is particularly resistant to removal. The scientists say its very persistance and the fact that it comes solely from human waste makes acesulfame a good candidate for tracing the movement of treated sewage after it is expelled into rivers and waterways. The Grand River: The large river in Southern Ontario, Canada, is impacted by agricultural activities and urban centers . 'Given the persistent nature demonstrated here and solely human source, we expect that acesulfame will become the most reliable detector of wastewater presence, dilution, and transformation in surface and ground waters,' write the researchers. The researchers write that the concentrations they measured for sucralose, cyclamate, and saccharin are the 'highest reported concentrations of these compounds in surface waters anywhere in the world.' And acesulfame persists at elevated concentrations over a distance of 300km. Having survived the sewage treatment plants, the compounds also persisted through water purification to be found in trace amounts in municipal tap water from homes that draw water from the River Grand. Traceable: The persistence of artificial sweeteners means they're a good way to trace where waste water ends up . The researchers say the effects of artificial sweeteners on aquatic life are largely unknown. But, they write, 'We demonstrate here that aquatic organisms likely experience long-term exposure to significant concentrations' of artificial sweeteners if they reside downriver from water impacted by urban activities. The report is just part of a growing body of evidence that the chemicals humans ingest - anti-depressants, sweeeteners, antibiotics and many other prescription drugs - wind up in our waterway and drinking supplies. So far, researchers are unsure of the longterm effects for humans and the environment are.

chatgpt: Canadian scientists have discovered heightened concentrations of artificial sweeteners in the River Grand, Ontario, alongside finding these harmful compounds in the drinking water. Concerns arise over the possible effects of consuming these man-made flavor enhancers in both aquatic life and humans. The environmental impact of the sweeteners is, as of yet, unknown, but the possibility of dangerous outcomes cannot be overlooked. The introduction of artificial sweeteners into our food system has led to a rise in their usage and use of such compounds in a variety of products. However, the common use of such synthetic ingredients in food has caused dramatic effects on wildlife and waterways. Artificial sweeteners are highly resistant to microbial breakdown, which makes them an environmental threat and dangerous to aquatic life. Scientists have recently discovered the presence of these chemicals in both the River Grand and drinking water. The discovery has raised questions on the safety of water systems and the environmental impact of human activity. Marked levels of these compounds have been found in the water system and pose a threat to aquatic life and public health.  Artificial sweeteners are known to trade off calories for long-term health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. They are most commonly found in diet soda, sugar-free chocolate, and sugar alternatives, among other food products. These sweeteners provide an illusion of health benefits, but the long-term hazards cannot be overlooked. The impact of these chemicals on the environment, and on the entire ecosystem, is not yet known. The discovery of artificial sweeteners in the River Grand signifies the many environmental problems caused by human activities. These human-made substances will persist in our environment for a long time, which will cause significant changes to the ecosystem in the long run. The effects of their presence in the environment will be harmful and long-lasting. The impact of artificial sweeteners on the environment and public health must be addressed, with steps taken to eliminate these harmful substances from our food and environments. The ultimate aim is to promote sustainable and healthy living for all. The creation of policies to ban the use of synthetic substances that are potentially harmful to the environment should be enacted. Sustainable solutions, such as the promotion of natural sweeteners, should be implemented. The discovery of artificial sweeteners in the River Grand is a warning of the dangers of our actions and the consequences of our choices. The price of our actions may be greater than we might imagine, and it is up to us as a society to take the necessary steps to protect our health, environment and future.
