article: (CNN) -- Most of us have agreed to share a cab with a stranger while traveling, but we haven't wound up in jail as a result. That wrong-place-wrong-time nightmare scenario, however, is apparently what's happened to Stacey Addison, an American veterinarian from Oregon, who has been traveling solo around the world since January 2013. According to the Oregonian newspaper and Addison's Facebook page, on September 5, Addison traveled from Indonesia into Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) and shared a cab from the border crossing at Batugade to the capital city of Dili. "Along the way, another passenger asked to pick up a package at a DHL office," reports the Oregonian. "Police, acting on a tip from Indonesian authorities, were watching and found methamphetamine in the parcel. "Addison and everyone else in the cab were arrested." "I was held in the Dili Detention Center for four nights then released after an initial hearing," Addison later posted on Facebook. "The judge ordered that my passport be held until further investigations have been completed." "(Addison) was conditionally released September 9 but wasn't allowed to leave the country," according to the Oregonian. "Prosecutors told her she was needed as a witness for an investigation that could take a year." Solitary confinement, hair chopped . After an October 29 court appearance, Addison was jailed again without explanation or warning, and spent five days in solitary confinement. It's unclear when Addison will be released. The Oregonian reports that local U.S. consular officials have visited twice with Addison in prison and that U.S. State Department officials will meet with the Timorese ambassador on Friday. Addison's mother, Bernadette Kero, has established a Facebook page PleaseHelpStacey. On November 1, Kero posted the following update: . "Yesterday I spoke with Josh at the U.S. Embassy in Dili after his visit with Stacey at Gleno prison. "He said that conditions are basic but decent. ... She is in 'Induction' period so alone for 5 days and her hair has been cut short per prison protocol. She will be moved to the Female Unit on Monday. "He told me she was being strong. ... She (said) how difficult it was to be all alone in a small cell with nothing to do but worry all day." "I am trying to keep busy and keep the anxiety at bay, but the uncertainty is always there," Addison posted on Facebook on October 19, between her first and second incarcerations. "This isn't how I had imagined I would be spending my time during the trip of a lifetime. I hope it is all over soon."

chatgpt: A travel nightmare has come true for American tourist Stacey Addison, who was recently arrested in Timor-Leste for unknowingly sharing a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine. Addison's nightmare began in mid-September when she was detained by authorities in Timor-Leste, a small Southeast Asian nation. Addison had been traveling in the country as part of a backpacking trip and had shared a taxi with another passenger she had just met. It wasn't until Addison arrived at her destination that she was approached by police officers who informed her that the other passenger in the taxi had been carrying methamphetamine. Although Addison had no knowledge of the drug, she was taken into custody as a key witness in the case. Since her arrest, Addison has been held in what she describes as "unimaginable" conditions in a small cell in a police station in Timor-Leste's capital city of Dili. She has reported being kept in isolation and subjected to poor living conditions, including a lack of food and clean water. Adding insult to injury, Addison has also faced significant legal challenges. Although she has not been formally charged with any crime, Timor-Leste authorities have said that she will need to remain in the country as a witness in the case, which they say could take up to a year to fully investigate. The U.S. State Department has become involved in Addison's case, and officials from the department are set to meet with Timor-Leste's ambassador to the United States later this week. The hope is that they will be able to secure Addison's release or at least improve her living conditions while she remains in the country. The situation highlights the risks that travelers face when visiting foreign countries, particularly those with strict drug laws. While it may seem like a relatively innocuous act to share a taxi with a stranger, even unwittingly being associated with illegal drugs can lead to significant legal repercussions. Addison's family and friends in the United States are urging authorities to intervene and help secure her release as soon as possible. They describe her as a dedicated and experienced traveler who has visited over 40 countries in her lifetime, and they say that she does not deserve to be punished for a crime she did not commit. For now, Addison remains stranded in Timor-Leste, facing an uncertain future. And while her case is certainly extreme, it serves as a stark reminder of the importance of being aware of the legal risks involved in traveling to foreign countries.
