For those of us who are martyrs to our backs, help could be at hand – in a few years' time, anyway. Scientists claim to have identified the gene behind back pain, in a development that could lead to effective treatment within a decade. Experts at Cambridge University said their research into the HCN2 gene could provide relief to millions. About one in seven Britons suffers from so-called chronic back pain, which can also include arthritis and headaches. This chronic pain comes in two main varieties. Inflammatory ailments occur when a persistent injury results in very sensitive nerve endings, which increases the sensation of pain. The other kind – neuropathic – is felt when nerves are damaged, causing ongoing, and often permanent, pain. This is often seen in patients with diabetes and shingles and in the aftermath of cancer chemotherapy – as well as in cases of back pain. When researchers removed the HCN2 gene from pain-sensitive nerves in mice, they put a stop to their neuropathic pain. However, the mice were still able to feel acute pain, which occurs suddenly, such as when biting one's tongue. Professor Peter McNaughton, lead author of the study and head of Cambridge's department of pharmacology, said a drug based on his team's research could be available within a decade. 'Individuals suffering from neuropathic pain often have little or no respite because of the lack of effective medications,' he said. 'Our research lays the groundwork for the development of new drugs to treat chronic pain by blocking HCN2.' Chronic: One in seven Britons suffer from back pain which can also include headaches . Gene clue: The HCN2 gene could provide relief to millions . Professor McNaughton told the journal Science: 'Many genes play a critical role in pain sensation, but in most cases interfering with them simply abolishes all pain, or even all sensation. 'What is exciting about the work on the HCN2 gene is that removing it – or blocking it pharmacologically – eliminates neuropathic pain without affecting normal acute pain. 'This finding could be very valuable clinically because normal pain sensation is essential for avoiding accidental damage.'

chatgpt: Pain is a common condition that affects a significant percentage of the world's population. However, according to a recent study, pain costs health providers a staggering £176 billion a year in Europe and £94 billion in the United States. The study, which analyzed data from more than 300 million people across Europe and the US, found that chronic pain is an incredibly costly burden on healthcare systems. One of the most common forms of chronic pain is neuropathic pain, which affects one in 100 people in the UK alone. Neuropathic pain is a type of chronic pain that results from damage to the nerves that transmit sensations like touch and temperature from the body to the brain. It can be extremely debilitating and affects a wide range of people, from those who have undergone surgery to those who suffer from conditions like diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The study found that chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, was responsible for a significant percentage of healthcare costs in Europe and the US. These costs were incurred through various avenues, including hospital admissions, medication and lost productivity. Furthermore, the study found that pain is a common cause of disability and is associated with lower quality of life, reduced mobility, and social isolation. Chronic pain also puts a significant burden on caregivers, who often struggle to manage the many complex symptoms associated with neuropathic pain. The findings of this study highlight the urgent need for improved pain management and treatment options for those suffering from chronic pain, especially neuropathic pain. This could involve increasing investment into research and development of new pain medications and therapies, expanding access to specialized pain clinics and programs, and optimizing the use of existing treatments. Moreover, the study highlights the need to prioritize preventative measures to address the root causes of chronic pain, such as reducing cigarette smoking, increasing physical activity, and promoting healthy eating habits. In conclusion, chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, is an incredibly costly and debilitating burden on healthcare systems across the world. As such, there is a vital need for governments, healthcare providers, and the general public to come together to address this pressing issue and improve the lives of those suffering from chronic pain.
