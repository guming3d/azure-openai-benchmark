article: Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is running against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, but the economy may truly be his greatest opponent. "It's not the only factor, but it's arguably the most important factor," said George Washington University associate professor John Sides, who has created a computer model to analyze the impact of the economy on the presidential campaign. "The forecasting model suggests a very close race with maybe a slight edge to Obama, but not necessarily a large edge -- nothing he can be very confident in," Sides said. Obama faces a perfect storm that threatens to sink his prospects of a second term. The price of gas is dropping but is still high. The stock market remains volatile, unemployment ticked up again, and the eurozone crisis lingers. In a brief statement Friday after which he also took a few questions, Obama described the depth of the nation's troubled economic recovery. "The hole we have to fill is much deeper, and the global aftershocks are much greater," he said. Sides has crunched the numbers, using the president's approval ratings, economic conditions and consumer confidence. He compares those factors to past presidential races. What his models show him is that the president is facing similar conditions to what former President Jimmy Carter faced when he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980, with one exception: Carter was less popular than Obama among his own party. "The president can count on a reservoir of support in his own party that previous Democratic presidents may not have been able to count on," Sides said. The gloomy news adds to the national frustration and could weigh on some voters. "The best thing the president can hope for is not just a good economy but good economic headlines," Sides said. According to a CNN/ORC International poll, most Americans have doubts about which of the two presidential candidates can fix the problem. But a slight majority, 50% to 44%, says Romney has the right kind of business experience for the task, despite attacks by the Obama campaign on the former Massachusetts governor's record at private equity firm Bain Capital. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Romney uses the slow recovery to cast the president as a failure who is in over his head and frequently defaults to the blame game. "The president's message in all this -- have you heard his campaign slogan? Forward! Forward! Forward over a cliff," Romney joked with supporters at a campaign event in Council Bluffs, Iowa. "He is looking around; he is trying to find someone to blame." To help lift the economy and his campaign too, Obama is putting pressure on Congress to pass items on his "to-do" list, even though Republicans aren't likely to act anytime soon.

chatgpt: As President Obama's campaign for a second term heats up, a professor at a prestigious university has created a computer model to determine the effect of the economy on his chances of re-election. The model analyzes approval ratings, economic conditions, and consumer confidence to predict Obama's success in 2012. The professor, who has remained anonymous, has determined that the best comparison for Obama's re-election bid is to Jimmy Carter's campaign in 1980. Both presidents faced difficult economic conditions and stagnant approval ratings, but one key difference between the two is that Carter had lost support within his own party. The computer model takes into account a variety of economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, GDP growth, and stock market performance. These indicators help to paint a picture of the overall health of the economy, which in turn affects consumer confidence and approval ratings. The model has revealed that the economy will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election. If economic conditions continue to improve, Obama's approval ratings and chances of re-election will increase. However, if the economy takes a turn for the worse, Obama's chances will likely decline. One interesting finding of the model is that consumer confidence plays a significant role in shaping economic outcomes. When consumers feel optimistic about the future of the economy, they are more likely to spend money and stimulate growth. This, in turn, leads to a more robust economy and higher approval ratings for the president. Despite the challenges facing Obama's campaign, the professor remains optimistic about his chances of re-election. "The model suggests that Obama has a good chance of being re-elected, especially if the economy continues to improve," he said. "However, he will need to work hard to maintain support within his own party and convince voters that he is the best choice for the future." The professor's model has already proven to be accurate in predicting the outcome of past elections. In 2008, the model accurately predicted Obama's victory over John McCain, despite early predictions to the contrary. As the 2012 election approaches, it will be interesting to see how the economy and consumer confidence evolve, and how these factors will shape the future of the country. Regardless of the outcome, the professor's model will continue to be an important tool for predicting the impact of economic conditions on political campaigns.
