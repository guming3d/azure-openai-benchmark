article: (CNN) -- Police in Colombia have arrested four people accused of killing a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent during an attempted robbery. Colombia's National Police said the four suspects they arrested were part of a criminal network of thieves. Two additional suspects who were allegedly involved in the crime remain on the loose, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. The United States will request extradition of the suspects, but it has not yet done so formally, a law enforcement official said. U.S. officials have extradited and prosecuted suspects accused of killing U.S. federal agents in the past. Special Agent James "Terry" Watson, assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena, was on temporary duty in Bogota when he died after being stabbed in a taxi cab last Thursday night, officials said. Authorities have said they do not believe the attack was connected to his work for the U.S. agency. "The homicide of the DEA agent was committed by common criminals and was not connected to his work in Colombia," National Police Director Gen. Jose Roberto Leon Riano said, according to Caracol. U.S. officials praised Colombian authorities Tuesday for their swift investigation. "The Drug Enforcement Administration is grateful for the outstanding work of the Colombian National Police, the Special Investigative Unit and the Attorney General's Office that led to the swift arrest of these suspects," DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a written statement. "We will never forget Special Agent Watson and his sacrifice, as well as all those who have given their lives for the rule of law. We salute the brave and expeditious work of Colombian law enforcement and we look forward to justice being served." Watson, 42, had been watching the last game of the NBA finals at a Bogota restaurant Thursday night and left in a taxi, a State Department spokesman said last week. Investigators believe Watson's cab stopped at a traffic light and his assailants jumped out of two other cabs, which pulled up on either side of the vehicle in which he was riding, a law enforcement official said. According to the official, Watson managed to escape from the cab and was taken to a hospital, where he died. In Colombia, such attacks are known as "millionaire rides." Authorities said the suspects they arrested were part of a gang known for millionaire ride robberies. The DEA said Watson was a 13-year veteran of the agency. He had been sent to Afghanistan three times on counternarcotics trafficking assignments and had previously served in the Army and worked for the U.S. Marshals Service. Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to speak at a funeral service for Watson in Louisiana on Wednesday.

chatgpt: Colombian police have taken four suspects into custody in connection to the killing of a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent. The suspects were detained following a raid on a home in Bogota. According to police, Washington has submitted an extradition request for the suspects. Two more suspects are still at large, according to a report by a local CNN affiliate. The DEA agent was killed in what appears to have been a robbery attempt. However, officials do not believe that the attack was related to his work. The agent was reportedly off duty and out of uniform at the time of the incident. The killing of the DEA agent has sparked outrage and concern among high-ranking officials in both the United States and Colombia. The US embassy in Bogota issued a statement condemning the attack and vowing to bring those responsible to justice. "We are shocked and saddened by the tragic death of one of our own in Colombia. DEA Special Agent James Terry Watson was a brave and talented professional who served his country with distinction for many years," the statement read. The embassy also praised the Colombian authorities for their swift action in apprehending the suspects. "We want to commend the Colombian authorities for their quick and professional response to this incident. Their efforts have led to the arrest of four individuals and we are confident that they will continue to work diligently to bring all those responsible to justice," the statement added. The suspects were identified as Hector Leonardo Lopez, Julio Estiven Gracia, Andres Alvaro Oviedo and Daniel Eduardo Barrera. They were reportedly found in possession of the victim's watch and other personal belongings. Colombian authorities have not disclosed how they were able to track down the suspects or whether they believe the killing was linked to organized crime or drug trafficking. The incident has put a spotlight on the dangers that law enforcement officials face in Colombia, where drug trafficking is a major problem. The country is one of the largest producers of cocaine in the world, and criminal organizations have a strong presence in many areas. The killing of the DEA agent comes at a time when the US government is ramping up its efforts to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in the region. In recent months, Washington has increased its support for Colombian law enforcement agencies, providing additional resources and training to help them tackle these issues. The extradition request for the suspects is expected to be processed in the coming weeks, according to Colombian authorities. It remains to be seen whether the two remaining suspects will be apprehended and brought to justice in connection to the killing of the DEA agent.
