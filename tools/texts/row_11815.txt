article: Dog owners have healthier hearts than people who don’t have pets, research suggests. And those who already have cardiac problems may be more likely to survive if they have the companionship of a pet. The American Heart Association reviewed studies from around the world and concluded pet ownership, particularly dog ownership, ‘is probably associated with a decreased risk of heart disease’. Research suggests dog owners walk far more than other people, which could help descrease the risk of heart disease . The strongest data comes from studies which show that dog owners walk far more than other people. Research also credits pets with relieving stress and having a beneficial effect on obesity and cholesterol levels. Glenn Levine, who led the study, said there may also be a psychological benefit from simple companionship. The American Heart Association said the research doesn’t actually prove that the benefits come directly from the pets. For instance, it may be that healthier people are particularly likely to be animal lovers.

Dr Levine, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said the benefits may come from a range of physical factors, including exercise and stress relief. Speaking as he walked his three dogs, he said: ‘A person may take better care of themselves if they have a good bond with a pet and feel better about themselves and are more motivated to live longer.’ He added that pet owners still need to take care of their heart in other ways. ‘The primary reason you should adopt or rescue or buy a pet is to give that pet a loving home and to derive enjoyment from the relationship . ‘We don’t want people to go out and adopt a dog or a cat and then sit on the couch eating potato chips and smoking a cigarette and assume they are now going to live longer.’

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by the American Heart Association (AHA) has found that pet ownership can be 'probably associated' with a reduced risk of developing heart disease. The study reviewed various studies from around the world that focused on the relationship between pet ownership and cardiovascular health. According to the AHA, the strongest data linking pet ownership with decreased risk of heart disease was found in studies that showed dog owners walked more. One study found that dog owners walked an average of 22 minutes more per day than non-dog owners. The study also found that owning a pet, particularly a dog, can help lower blood pressure, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve overall heart health. These benefits are thought to be related to the increase in physical activity and emotional support that pet ownership provides. The AHA review also showed that pet ownership can bring other health benefits, including improved mental health, reduced depression, and increased social interaction. The study suggests that these benefits may be especially important for older adults, who may feel isolated and lonely. While the study showed promising results, the AHA cautioned that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between pet ownership and heart health. The study was not able to determine whether the benefits of pet ownership were due to the physical activity associated with owning a pet or the emotional support provided by a furry companion. Despite some lingering questions, the study suggests that owning a pet, particularly a dog, can have significant health benefits. For those looking to improve their heart health, adopting a furry friend may be a helpful step. In response to the study, animal welfare groups have pointed out that the health benefits of pet ownership extend beyond heart health. By adopting a pet, individuals not only improve their own health but also provide a loving home for an animal in need. The findings of this study provide further evidence that pets truly are a man's best friend. From providing companionship to improving heart health, owning a pet is a decision that can benefit both humans and animals alike.
