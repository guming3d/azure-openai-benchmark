'They're all the things you don't really fully experience until you're on-site and able to see the track for the very first time. That'll be my priority on Thursday.' Assessing the venue from what he has seen so far via a simulator, Button added: 'From what I've seen of the place it's sort of a mix between the tracks we raced on in Valencia and Korea.

'There are plenty of long, fast straights hemmed in by concrete walls and high barriers, and a selection of medium-speed corners that seem to have been designed to test the abilities of a car. 'As with all these new venues, they only really begin to unlock themselves once you get out on the track for the first time. 'I've lost none of my enthusiasm for going to new places, so I'll be keen to get out there on Friday and get a feel for the place.'
