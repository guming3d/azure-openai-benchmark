article: (CNN) -- Last year was the safest in aviation history for passengers flying on Western-built jets, an international aviation trade group said Wednesday. The 2010 global accident rate was 0.61 per million flights, a rate equating to one accident for every 1.6 million flights, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). That is just below the previous historic low rate of 0.65 rate in 2006, and a "significant improvement" over the rate of 0.71 recorded in 2009. There were 17 plane accidents -- or hull losses, in the lingo of the business -- involving Western-built jet aircraft in 2010, compared to 19 the previous year. A hull loss is an accident in which a plane is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. There were 786 fatalities in passenger aircraft compared to 685 in 2009, IATA said. As in the past, there were significant regional differences in the accident rates, with North America having relatively low rates and Africa having the worst rate. While Africa's hull loss rate was 7.41 -- four Western-built planes crashed in Africa -- it was lower than the 2009 rate of 9.94. IATA Director General Giovanni Bisignani said African systems must improve. "Flying must be equally safe in all parts of the world," Bisignani said. "An accident rate in Africa that is over 12 times the global average is not acceptable." He said African carriers should make use of an IATA audit system to improve safety. Runway excursions -- instances when a plane leaves the runway during take-offs or landings -- accounted for 21 percent of the worldwide accidents, IATA said, saying the number has dropped because of attention to the problem. Some of the accidents occur when planes land on wet runways; others when the aircraft approaches too fast, too high or touches down beyond the desired spot on the runway. IATA said it is working with the industry and regulators to address the issue. IATA said 2010 had the following results: . 2.4 billion people flew safely on 36.8 million flights. 94 accidents for all types of aircraft -- Eastern and Western built -- compared to 90 in 2009. 23 fatal accidents for all passenger aircraft types, compared to 18 in 2009. IATA represents some 230 airlines comprising 93 percent of scheduled international air traffic.

chatgpt: According to the latest report from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the year 2010 witnessed a total of 17 accidents involving commercial airplanes across the world. While the figure is relatively low compared to previous years, it has once again drawn attention to safety concerns in the airline industry. Of the 17 accidents recorded, Africa had the highest number, accounting for over one-third of the total tally. This is a worrying trend that industry leaders and safety regulators must address immediately. The continent's safety record has been a concern for years, and these latest numbers only serve to reinforce that fact. In response to these statistics, Alexandre de Juniac, the Director-General and CEO of IATA, called for the industry to remain vigilant in addressing safety risks. He emphasized that safety should remain a top priority for all aviation stakeholders and that the industry could not afford to let its guard down. The IATA chief encouraged governments, airlines, and regulators to pursue a collaborative approach to safety improvements. He also underscored the need for continued investment in education, training, and development programs, so that the aviation industry can stay abreast of evolving safety risks and respond proactively. The IATA has been taking steps to improve safety in recent years, including the implementation of the IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) program, which helps airlines enhance their environmental performance while reducing the risk of accidents. The association is also active in promoting safety culture and accident prevention through its Safety and Flight Operations division. However, despite these efforts, accidents continue to occur, with Africa's aviation industry performance proving to be a major cause for concern. The continent's aviation industry has been plagued by issues such as inadequate infrastructure, weak regulatory oversight, and limited resources. These factors have combined to make flying in Africa a dangerous proposition. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further worsened the state of aviation safety globally, with reduced traffic leading to reduced maintenance, training and maintenance, all of which lead to increased risks.  In conclusion, the airline industry must redouble its efforts to improve safety across the board, with particular attention to the African continent. Industry participants, governmental regulators, and public institutions must work together to adopt best practices, raise safety awareness and proactively manage risks. Only then can we ensure that aviation remains one of the safest modes of transportation worldwide.
