Worrying: Countries with emerging economies - such as Brazil, pictured - are at risk of of slowing down because of tighter U.S. monetary policy, it has been claimed . It warned that advanced economies led by the United States will increasingly drive global growth . In a surveillance note obtained by Reuters and prepared for the G20 meeting in St. Petersburg, the IMF urged strengthened global action to revitalise growth and better manage risks, warning that some downside risks have become more prominent. Emerging economies are seen particularly as being vulnerable to a tightening of U.S. monetary policy and the IMF recommended that policy makers be ready to handle a rise in financial instability. 'Policy makers should allow exchange rates to respond to changing fundamentals but may need to guard against risks of disorderly adjustment, including through intervention to smooth excessive volatility,' the IMF said. The U.S. Federal Reserve may start tapering its stimulus programme as early as this month, the IMF noted. 'The greatest worry may well be a prolonged period of sluggish global growth (a plausible downside),' the IMF said, adding it was revising downwards its near-term projections for emerging economies. Way forward: Advanced economies led by the United States will increasingly drive global growth, the IMF has said. This is a file picture of Times Square in New York . But with the United States and other advanced economies picking up speed, the IMF said it still expected global growth to accelerate in 2014 from this year, helped by the highly accommodative monetary conditions in the rich world. Private demand, underpinned by recovering labour and housing markets, should further bolster the U.S. economy next year, though growth in Japan may become more subdued as a consumption tax increase takes effect and stimulus spending slows. The IMF said it expected a continued recovery in the euro zone in the third quarter but said the 17-nation currency area needed to boost the supply of credit by repairing its banks' balance sheets and making progress towards a banking union. The euro zone's economy expanded 0.3 per cent in the second quarter on the back of stronger exports and a return to spending by households and governments, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said today. To help reduce global economic imbalances, the IMF urged surplus economies such as China and Germany to stoke domestic demand while deficit countries such as the euro area periphery and Britain should improve their external competitiveness. Leaders of the G20, which groups the world's largest economies, will meet in Russia's second city of St. Petersburg on Thursday and Friday.

chatgpt: The global economy has undergone a significant shift in recent years. The growth of emerging markets such as Brazil, China, and India has been a major driving force behind global economic development. However, these economies, once thought to be unstoppable, are now showing signs of vulnerability. According to experts, the growing economies of Brazil, China, and India are all susceptible to volatility, as they struggle to navigate the challenges of globalization, market liberalization, and structural reforms. These challenges have led to political instability, economic slowdowns, and financial crises. At the same time, the more advanced economies, led by the United States, are increasingly driving global growth. With their relatively stable political systems, advanced infrastructures, and flexible labor markets, these economies have shown a remarkable resilience to global economic shocks. The United States, in particular, has emerged as the dominant player in the global economy. Its technological advances, energy independence, and thriving consumer market have made it an attractive destination for foreign investors. At the same time, the country's leadership in science and innovation has spurred the growth of new industries and helped to drive economic competitiveness. Furthermore, the US economy is supported by its strong financial system, which has helped to stabilize the global economy during times of crisis. The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has been an important source of stability and has provided liquidity to global markets during times of stress. As advanced economies continue to drive global growth, emerging markets must adapt to the changing economic landscape. This means investing in education and infrastructure, improving governance, and adopting policies that promote economic stability and growth. In China, for example, policymakers have recognized the need for structural reforms, including reducing the country's dependence on export-led growth and increasing domestic consumption. The government has also implemented measures to address the country's high levels of debt and to improve the regulatory environment for businesses. In India, the government has launched a series of economic reforms aimed at improving infrastructure, increasing foreign investment, and reducing bureaucracy. These measures are intended to boost the country's economic growth and make it more competitive in the global market. In Brazil, however, the situation is more complicated. Political instability, corruption, and a persistent recession have led to a decline in investor confidence and weakened the country's economy. In order to recover, the government must address these challenges and implement policies that promote economic stability and growth. Overall, the global economy is in a state of flux. The growing economies of Brazil, China, and India are facing challenges, while advanced economies are increasingly driving global growth. As the global economy evolves, policymakers must work to promote economic stability and growth, and ensure that all nations have the opportunity to benefit from economic prosperity.
