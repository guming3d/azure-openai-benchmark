article: NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A rarely seen portrait of Michael Jackson is on display inside a Harlem luxury car dealership. Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled "The Book" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat. The oil painting titled "The Book" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York. A different portrait of the entertainer was among items auctioned from his Neverland Ranch in April. It is not clear whether Jackson sat for that painting. The painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership. The 40-inch by 50-inch portrait, by Australian painter Brett Livingstone-Strong, sold for $2.1 million in 1990. Abrams acquired it as part of an unrelated business deal in 1992 and had it stored. The painting shows Jackson sitting in Renaissance-era clothes and holding a book. Jackson sat for the portrait because he was a friend of Livingstone-Strong's. The painting was unveiled at the Dancy-Power Automotive Group showroom on Thursday but was removed Friday because of crowd concerns. It returned to the showroom floor Monday morning. Dancy said the painting's owner chose the showroom because it's near the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where the Jackson 5 won their first taste of fame by winning Amateur Night in 1967. He said Abrams hopes the painting in some way can raise money for charities in the Harlem neighborhood. Dancy said Abrams is not necessarily interested in selling the portrait. When news broke about the resurfacing of the painting, Dancy said, he received a phone call from representatives of Livingstone-Strong, the artist. Now, Dancy said, "We are in the middle of possibly putting together the artist with the painting again. Maybe for some auctions or charitable shows or something of the sort." The showroom features Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and other pricey cars and is famous for its celebrity clientele.

The painting is said to be the only portrait for which Michael Jackson sat, and it has found a new home in a Harlem-based automotive showroom.  The painting portrays Jackson in Renaissance-era clothes, holding a book.

The painting has proved to be a massive draw for visitors to the showroom, many of whom are drawn to its superb likeness and inspiring beauty.  The painting's owner has chosen the Harlem-based showroom because it is in close proximity to the world-famous Apollo Theater. The Apollo is synonymous with Michael Jackson, and it has played an important part in the young singer's career, which grew in many ways under its roof. So the display of the painting is a fitting tribute to the late singer's life and career.  The Harlem automotive showroom is also a fitting place for the portrait to be displayed as it is renowned for its high-end vehicles, which the painting sits alongside. The showroom dominates a corner of the Harlem street and is extravagant in its display of vehicles, including luxury sports cars and luxury SUVs. The dealership has always been a draw for locals and tourists, but the addition of such a unique piece of art has only added to its allure. Since its release, the painting has been a topic of much discussion and fascination, with many people having differing opinions on it. However, the one thing that is undeniable is the stunning artistic skill on display. The painting's artist captured Michael Jackson's image and charisma beautifully, creating a lasting tribute to a music icon who has left a lasting impact on the world. In conclusion, the oil painting is a treasure to be beheld, and it is a testament to Michael Jackson's influence even posthumously. It's fitting that the painting is displayed in Harlem, and it's near the Apollo Theater, where Michael Jackson spent a lot of his early years. Of course, for the automotive showroom, it's a unique selling point and a reason to attract new customers. Nonetheless, the contribution of the masterpiece has added another dimension to the already exciting arena of cars in the showroom.
