When the police arrived, they found that the boy had already passed away, and the injuries were consistent with him being trapped inside a washing machine. The man, identified as Joseph Blocker, was home alone with his son, Koda, and his 22-month-old daughter. It remains unclear whether Blocker put Koda inside the washing machine or if the boy had climbed in himself. The police have not commented on the matter. The incident has left the community in shock, and many are left wondering how such a tragedy could occur. "I can't even begin to imagine what this family must be going through," said one neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous. "It's just heartbreaking." According to the police, the washing machine needs to be switched on from the outside, which has raised suspicions about the circumstances of Koda's death. The medical examiner's report confirmed that the boy's injuries were consistent with him being stuck inside the washing machine. The police investigation is ongoing, and Blocker has not been charged with any crime. However, the community is demanding answers, and many are calling for justice for Koda.

Meanwhile, Blocker's daughter is reportedly safe and under the care of Child Protective Services. The family has declined to comment on the incident, and it remains to be seen what charges, if any, will be filed. The tragic death of Koda serves as a reminder of the importance of child safety and the need for parents to be vigilant at all times.
