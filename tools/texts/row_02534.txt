article: Rich Californians are having their days at the beach ruined - by a huge pileup of reeking seaweed. Residents of Laguna Beach, in Orange County, have recently come face-to-face with record volumes of pungent kelp which was washed up on the shore by ocean currents. The odorous plantlife usually stays clinging to reefs offshore, far from surfers' noses, but warmer waters in the Pacific this year loosened the plants' grip. Stench: The washed-up kelp on Laguna Beach, California, is the worst in at least 20 years . Because warm water carries less nutrients, the plants are more likely to detach from the reefs in hope of ending up somewhere better. This, combined with strong currents to wash them inland, has piled kelp high up and down the Southern California shoreline. Steve May, Laguna's director of public works, told the LA TimesÂ that in his two decades working along the beach the kelp situation is the worst it's ever been. Unpleasant: The pungent weed is now in abundance thanks to strong currents and warm water . Eco-friendly: One expert pointed out that kelp washing up helps the environment by bringing beach hoppers (pictured) along with it . However, while many, including local authorities, are not keen on the new vegetation changing the character of the beaches, others have praised it for bolstering local eco-systems. Nancy Caruso, a marine biologist, pointed out that the slimy plants bring with them tiny sealife called beach hoppers, which in turn feed offshore birds. The process of kelp being washed away from the beach by outgoing tides also releases nutrients into the sand, Caruso, who organizes a kelp festival, explained. However, waste management in the area take a dimmer view of the reeking weeds, with crews often scooping up the detritus and taking it away to dry in the sun. Afterwards the waste material is added to other green mulch and recycled into landfill cover.

chatgpt: Residents of a high-end California town are up in arms after heaps of stinking kelp washed up on their shores. The unsightly and smelly deposits are believed to be the result of warm waters and storm activity, causing the municipalities within the resort town to take immediate action. Tourists, hoping for a relaxing trip to the oceanside, have been met with an overwhelming and unpleasant odor. The piles of kelp have created a nuisance for both visitors and locals alike, as it makes swimming and sunbathing particularly unpleasant. According to one resident, the smell is so strong that it can be detected from several blocks away. The problem has become so significant that the town has called in heavy machinery to remove some of the kelp, which has piled up several feet deep in some locations. Experts suggest that changes in temperature and weather caused by climate change can be the culprit. The warm waters could be encouraging the growth and spread of kelp, leading to a surge in deposits along high-end coastal areas. Some scientists have pointed to increasing water temperatures as a sign of a changing climate, warning that this may become a more common occurrence in the future. This is not an issue unique to this particular town. Many coastal communities around the world are experiencing similar problems, with kelp deposits plaguing high-end resorts and tourist destinations. As resorts and towns attempt to take action to remove kelp, some environmentalists are warning of the potential harm. Kelp is an essential component of many marine ecosystems and is the basis of numerous food chains. Removing it could have significant knock-on effects on the local ecology, potentially leading to a decline in fish and other marine life. In conclusion, the residents of this California town are not alone in their struggle against the increasingly unpleasant consequences of climate change. The proliferation of kelp deposits on their shores is just one example of the issues coastal communities around the world face as they attempt to cope with a warming planet.
