article: (CNN)A judge has vacated the conviction of a 14-year-old boy who was executed for allegedly killing two girls some 70 years ago in South Carolina. The judgment against George Stinney, the youngest person to be executed by an American state since the 1800s, effectively exonerates the boy, said family attorney Matt Burgess. A black teen in the Jim Crow South, Stinney was accused of murdering two white girls, ages 7 and 11, as they hunted for wildflowers in Alcolu, about 50 miles southeast of Columbia. Stinney, according to police, confessed to the crime. No witness or evidence that might vindicate him was presented during a trial that was over in fewer than three hours. An all-white jury convicted him in a flash, 10 minutes. "Given the particularized circumstances of Stinney's case, I find by a preponderance of the evidence standard, that a violation of the Defendant's procedural due process rights tainted his prosecution," wrote Circuit Judge Carmen Tevis Mullen in her decision, dated Tuesday. She said that sentencing a 14-year-old to the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Earlier this year, attorneys for Stinney's family had asked for a new trial, saying the boy's confession was coerced and that Stinney had an alibi, his sister, Amie Ruffner, who claims she was with Stinney when the murders occurred. Ruffner, Stinney's sister, told CNN affiliate WLTX that she and Stinney saw Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, 7, the day they died. Stinney and Ruffner were tending to their family's cow near some railroad tracks close to their home. "They said, 'Could you tell us where we could find some maypops?' " Ruffner recalled. "We said, 'No,' and they went on about their business." The girls were found the next day in a water-logged ditch with injuries to their head. Mary had a 2-inch laceration above her right eyebrow and a vertical laceration over her left, according to a 1944 medical examiners' report. Ruffner told WLTX, police took Stinney and another of her brothers away in handcuffs while their parents were not at home. One brother was released, she said, while Stinney faced police questioning without his parents or a lawyer. The police "were looking for someone to blame it on, so they used my brother as a scapegoat," Ruffner said. CNN's David Mattingly contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A South Carolina Judge has ruled that the execution of George Stinney, a 14-year-old African American boy who was sentenced to death for killing two white girls seven decades ago violated his due process rights. According to the ruling, a “fundamental, constitutional violation” had occurred that tainted his prosecution.  Stinney was accused of murdering two young girls in 1944 in Alcolu. He was tried, convicted and sentenced to death in a matter of weeks. The legal proceedings were marred by an utter lack of evidence and witnesses, corruption, and tainted confessions, which the court used to sentence the young boy to the electric chair.  Stinney was one of the youngest people in United States history to have been executed, and the proceedings were widely recognized as flawed and unjust. Advocacy groups have long called for justice to be served in Stinney's case, and many experts have suggested that his confession was coerced through force, neglect of his rights and intense pressure from the investigating officers.  According to the ruling by Circuit Judge Carmen Mullen, Stinney's prosecution was “fundamentally unfair” since he was denied access to proper legal counsel and a fair trial. The judge also pointed out that the sentencing of a 14-year-old to the electric chair for such grave offenses is cruel and unusual when viewed in the light of contemporary legal and social norms.  The ruling is considered a step forward for justice and human rights in South Carolina, and will hopefully inspire similar scrutiny and review for other questionable legal proceedings that resulted in the execution of juveniles and people of color. The ruling stated that Stinney's execution violated his fourteenth amendment rights, and the underlying cause of justice requires that his conviction be vacated, setting him free from the horrific death sentence that was imposed on him seven decades ago.  The news has been received with mixed emotions since many people questioned the validity of a trial that occurred so long ago. Nevertheless, advocates for justice are celebrating the ruling as a step forward in ensuring the protection of civil rights and a fair legal process for all individuals. It's expected that the ruling will also encourage people to revisit other cases that may have questionable legal standing, leading to a more comprehensive approach for ensuring justice for those who have been unfairly treated in the legal system.  In conclusion, the ruling against Stinney's execution and conviction for the murder of two young girls some 70 years ago in South Carolina is a significant development for the United States justice system, as it highlights the importance of fair trial and due process of law, especially for minorities in the country. It is hoped that the ruling will inspire future serious reviews for other cases and lead to fair justice to all.
