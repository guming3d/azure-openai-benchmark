Dramatic footage has emerged showing terrified passengers hurling themselves from a sinking tourist dive boat off the coast of Thailand.

It took on a lot of water. ‘People threw themselves headlong into the water. Some were sucked under the water with the boat before they resurfaced and were pulled out. It was really amazing that everyone survived.’ It is believed that Aladdin, which sank between Bon Island and Tachai Island in Thailand's south, was on a four-day live-aboard adventure trip at the time it sank. The incident comes just three months after six tourists died when an overcrowded ferry capsized and sank off the Thai coast. The double-decker ferry, which was carrying around 200 people, had an engine problem which caused the ferry to flip on its side and sink in November. Among the dead were Three Thais – two women and a man – a Russian man, a Russian woman and a Chinese man. The ferry which was carrying around 200 people, well over its capacity of 130 to 150 passengers, did not have enough life vests for those on board.

chatgpt: Thirteen tourists narrowly escaped with their lives after their dive boat began to sink in the waters between two islands in Southern Thailand. The terrifying ordeal was captured on video and showed passengers throwing themselves overboard in a frantic attempt to escape the sinking vessel. The incident occurred on a sunny afternoon as the tourist dive boat was making its way through the waters in the vicinity of two scenic islands, popular for their pristine white sand beaches and world-renowned diving sites. Suddenly, and without warning, the boat began taking on water and listing to one side, causing several passengers to panic and start screaming in fear. Video footage of the incident shows the desperate scenes that ensued as the passengers attempted to evacuate the sinking boat. Some leapt from the deck, while others desperately clung to the side of the vessel, hoping for a rescue. Thankfully, a nearby boat was alerted to the distress call and raced to the scene to aid the stranded tourists. The crew of the rescue boat worked tirelessly to pull the tourists to safety, as the sinking vessel gradually disappeared beneath the waves. All thirteen passengers were successfully rescued, though several were left shaken and traumatized by the incident. The cause of the boat's sinking is currently under investigation, but initial reports suggest that it may have been caused by a mechanical failure or an unexpected shift in the weight distribution onboard the vessel. Following the incident, local authorities have issued a warning to all boat operators in the area to ensure that their vessels are being maintained to the highest standards, and that all crew members are properly trained and equipped to deal with emergency situations. The incident has shone a spotlight on the dangers of sea travel in Thailand, a country that is popular among tourists for its idyllic beaches, clear waters, and world-class diving spots. It serves as a stark reminder for all travelers to be vigilant and aware of the risks involved in sea travel, and to take all necessary precautions to ensure their own safety and well-being when embarking on such excursions. In the aftermath of the frightening incident, all passengers expressed their gratitude to the crew of the rescue boat for their bravery in saving their lives. Many also took to social media to share their harrowing experience and raise awareness of the importance of proper safety procedures in the tourism industry. While the incident was undoubtedly a harrowing experience for all involved, it is fortunate that none of the passengers were injured or killed. It serves as a reminder that life can be unpredictable, and that it is important to be prepared for anything when traveling in unfamiliar and potentially hazardous environments.
