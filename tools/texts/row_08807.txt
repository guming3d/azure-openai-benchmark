chatgpt: Notorious underworld figure Toby Mitchell has been charged with extortion and threatening to kill a man and his young daughter in a frightening incident. Mr. Mitchell allegedly demanded $300,000 from the man and warned that he would shoot them dead if the payment wasn't made. The 39-year-old is no stranger to danger, having survived two shooting incidents in 2011 and last year. In court, it was revealed that Mr. Mitchell is in need of regular medical attention as only one of his kidneys functions at just thirty percent. Mr. Mitchell, who has amassed a long history of criminal activity, was charged with a string of offenses including extortion with threats to kill. His case has been adjourned while he remains in custody. The alleged threat left the man and his daughter in fear for their lives, causing widespread alarm among Melbourne locals. The prosecution argued that Mr. Mitchell posed a serious threat to public safety, and that he should not be released prior to his trial. Concerns were also raised about his health, with the court hearing that Mr. Mitchell needs his diet carefully monitored in custody. Despite his criminal history and notoriety, the defendant's failing health has made him a vulnerable figure in the eyes of the court. Mr. Mitchell's lawyers did not contest the allegations made against him, but instead requested that their client be granted bail on the grounds of his deteriorating health. However, in light of the severity of the charges, bail was denied and the accused was remanded in custody. The case has been closely watched by the public and draws attention to the issue of extortion and threats of violence in Melbourne's underworld. Mr. Mitchell's history of violence and continued criminal activity will no doubt play a central role in determining the outcome of the trial. For now, Toby Mitchell's future remains uncertain as he awaits trial and undergoes medical treatment in custody. The case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by Melbourne's criminal underworld, and the importance of law enforcement efforts to put an end to such behavior.
