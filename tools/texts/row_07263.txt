article: By . Margot Peppers . Virginity pledges have long been a contentious subject, and now a new study has shown that they may do more harm than good. According to findings recently published in the Journal of Child and Family Studies, only people who have genuinely strong religious beliefs actually keep their promise. For others - even those who attend church regularly but don't consider themselves devout - virginity pledges are more often broken, leading to risky behavior and a greater likelihood of having unprotected sex. Saving themselves: A new study has found only people with truly strong religious beliefs keep their virginity pledges. Those who are religiously committed but not devout are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior . The study involved 1,380 students between the ages of 18 and 24, all of whom attended a 'large, public Southeastern state university'. When the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their sexual behavior, more than a quarter said they had signed a virginity pledge - which is about the same as the statistic nationwide among young people in that age group. The problem arises when those who aren't totally committed break their vow; if they haven't had comprehensive sex education, they have little incentive not to have unprotected sex. 'For pledge signers with low religious commitment, there are unintended negative consequences with regard to increased participation in risky sexual behaviors,' reads the study. It also found that these people are even more likely to engage in dangerous sexual behavior than people of the same age who have never taken such a pledge. A study published in the Pediatrics journal 2008 had similar results; it found that more than half of young people become sexually active before marriage regardless of whether or not they have taken a pledge. However, while 34per cent of people who do not take a pledge say they always used a condom, only 24per cent of those who have taken a pledge said the same. 'Taking a pledge doesn't seem to make any difference at all in any sexual behavior,' said Janet E Rosenbaum, one of the authors of the report. 'But it does seem to make a difference in condom use and other forms of birth control that is quite striking.'

chatgpt: A recent study in the Journal of Child and Family Studies suggests that young people who take pledges to abstain from sex but do not practice their religion are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. The study, carried out by a team of experts from different universities across the United States, aimed to examine whether taking a virginity pledge had an impact on adolescent sexual behavior. The study involved analyzing data from a survey of 3,300 individuals, collected over a period of six years. The data showed that those who had taken a pledge to remain a virgin until marriage but did not practice their religion, were more likely to have engaged in oral and anal sex, as well as having sex without using contraception. The study found that pledgers who were not religious were more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors because they felt that they were not accountable to a higher power, which led to them indulging in sexual activities that went against their pledge. "Many young people who take a virginity pledge do so because they are concerned about the moral implications of premarital sex," said the lead author of the study. "However, if they do not have a religious framework that supports this belief, they are more likely to rationalize away their pledge when faced with difficult sexual situations." The study also found that those who took virginity pledges but practiced their religion were more likely to delay having sex until marriage and engage in healthy sexual behaviors when they were in a committed relationship. This is because they are more likely to consider the consequences of their actions, as their religious framework provides guidance on moral and ethical behavior. The findings of the study reinforce the idea that taking a pledge to abstain from sex is not enough to prevent risky sexual behavior. The results suggest that young people need to have a strong moral and religious framework to support their pledge to remain a virgin. This also highlights the importance of comprehensive sex education that takes into account the different beliefs and values of young people. In conclusion, the study shows that young people who take a pledge to remain a virgin but do not practice their religion are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. The findings suggest that teenagers and young adults who wish to remain abstinent until marriage should have a religious framework that supports their pledge. Educators and parents should consider this when they discuss sex education with young people, and they should also provide more comprehensive sex education programs that take into account different beliefs, values, and lifestyles.
