A centenarian who has just had his left hip replaced is believed to be the oldest person in the world to have surgery. John Lawrence Randall - known as Laurie - is the grand age of 102. He first had his left hip replaced in 1989. The determined pensioner wanted to have the two-hour operation so he could continue his passion for gardening. Standing tall: Laurie Randall with his granddaughter Gillian Coates. She said he was very determined . His granddaughter Gillian Coates, said: 'Even at 101 he was still digging up his garden and he decided on the hip replacement so he could continue with that. 'It will be a struggle for him to do . the gardening but he still says the operation was worth the risk because . at least he can stand up and walk around which he enjoys. He was never . very good at sitting still.' His feat could earn him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records, as the current record holder is Lily Wauters, who was 101 years and 196 days old when she had her right hip replaced in 2007. Ms Coates, said that Laurie, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire had also had his right hip replaced in 2006 and had 'true Yorkshire determination'. 'The operation was a fantastic success and we are very proud of him,' said Gillian. 'He has always said: "I tell my legs what to do, they don’t tell me". He wants to live until he is 105, but he said he didn’t want to do it if he was going to be in a wheelchair.' Success: Laurie is keen to get back to his garden . Laurie, who has since moved to Durham to be closer to his family, has just had his final post-operation check up at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorks. Ms Coates added that the record-breaking op was made even more dangerous as the hip Laurie was having replaced was artificial. Gillian said: 'Doctors told him that removing an artificial hip was much more complex than removing a natural hip as the full structure needs to come out. 'He was still undetered despite having the risks spelled out to him. He said he was talking with the surgeons throughout the process. 'He always says you should just try things and have a go. It was that attitude that spurred him on to risk his life and have the surgery. 'We didn't try to talk him out of it as there would have been no point. Once he has set his mind to something that's it.'
