article: The Beatles famously sung about a psychedelic fantasy Yellow Submarine in the 1960s. With the potential to be slightly more dangerous, but just as colourful, the Iranian Navy has been showcasing the latest addition to its fleet - a brilliant bright turquoise blue submarine. Designers of the domestically-produced warship must have thought that the bizarre shade would make the craft blend in with the deep waters of the high seas. Scroll down for video . Eye-catching: Iranian Navy chiefs were showing off their bright turquoise submarines on state television . Fabulous: Iranian Navy officers stand on top of the Sina 7 submarine built domestically . But it's hard to believe that the enemy won't see this one coming with the colour making it stand out like a sore thumb against the water's surface. The Navy was showing off the eye-catching creation, which is around the size of a frigate, on Iran state television yesterday. Navy officials, rather conservatively dressed in plain dark uniforms compared to their dazzling ship, watched as the Sina-7, equipped with anti-ship missiles, was launched at Bandar Abbas, near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Two new Iranian-built Ghadir subs and two repaired hovercraft were also delivered to the Navy.

Conspicuous: The submarines stand out like a sore-thumb against the surface of the sea . Navy chief Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari was quoted on Iranian television as saying that the nation must possess the 'newest technology and top-grade facilities to protect its borders.' Ghadir class submarines can fire missiles and torpedoes at the same time, and can operate in the Persian Gulf's shallow waters. Iran has sought to upgrade its air defense and naval capabilities, saying any possible future attacks on it would come from the air and sea. The country now claims to be 'self sufficient' in terms of supplying equipment to meet its military needs.

chatgpt: Iranian state television showcased the country's latest naval fleet, which includes a Sina 7 submarine, two Ghadir subs, and a pair of hovercrafts. The submarine was designed and built by Iranian engineers, and the entire fleet was praised as a modern and advanced military arsenal. Navy officials explained that the latest technology was vital in ensuring their borders are protected. They highlighted that the Sina 7 submarine, in particular, was a significant step forward in the development of the country's naval strength. The Ghadir-class submarine is a locally produced, lightweight submarine that is capable of operating in shallow waters. The hovercrafts, on the other hand, are expected to provide additional combat capabilities to the fleet, thanks to their speed and mobility. Modern hovercraft technology is known for being difficult to master, but an Iranian company designed these two vehicles, proving the county's self-sufficiency. The naval fleet's introduction comes at a time when Iran is grappling with significant economic and political challenges. Some critics have questioned the wisdom of investing in such military technology when many Iranians lack basic necessities. However, Navy officials stated that the new fleet is not only intended to protect Iran's borders. The Sina 7 submarine and Ghadir submarines, specifically, will help the Navy defend the country's energy resources, as well. Therefore, these naval developments can be seen as a strategic move to ensure that Iran can protect its most valuable assets. The new fleet has also been viewed as a signal to Iran's adversaries. Tensions between Iran and its neighbors, particularly the United States, remain high in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal's collapse. Having a modern and technologically advanced navy provides Iran with a sense of security, ensuring its interests are protected. Iran's investment in this naval fleet has been significant, with the Sina 7 submarine alone reportedly costing over $150 million. However, the Navy expects the fleet will last for decades, ensuring Iran's maritime capabilities remain at a high level for years to come. In conclusion, Iran's naval fleet's unveiling signals the country's commitment to self-sufficiency and a desire to protect its borders and energy resources. While some Iranians may question the investment, the Navy believes that advanced military technology is essential to maintain the country's safety and sovereignty.
