article: (CNN) -- Celebrated Cameroonian-born photographer Samuel Fosso, famous for his compelling self-portraits, has had his work exhibited in major museums across the world -- from New York and Paris to London and Buenos Aires. Yet Fosso's thought-provoking creations, in which he transforms into characters ranging from symbols of black identity to pop culture icons, had never been exhibited in Nigeria, the country he grew up in but had to flee at a young age to escape the Biafran War in the late 1960s. Not any longer. Fosso, who now lives and works in the Central African Republic, has chosen the LagosPhoto Festival for the global premiere of his latest photographic series, "The Emperor of Africa." In his latest work, the award-winning artist uses his constructed images to explore the relationship between Africa and China by assuming the part of Chinese leader Mao Zedong. "We are very excited to have him," says Joseph Gergel, one of the festival's curators. "He is one of the biggest names in photography on the continent."

"They're all focused on engaging the emerging community of photographers and contemporary artists and give them a voice," he adds. "The real goal of LagosPhoto is not only in the work that we show but also to show that there's another side of Nigeria -- there's another side of Africa -- and we hope that spreading that message will lead to positive change."

"One that is informed by vast changes taking place at an unprecedented speed, such as population explosion, urban development, socioeconomic gaps, and the rising middle class, and the other that is defined by the internet, the digital revolution and virtual connectivity."
