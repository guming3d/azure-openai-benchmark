article: (CNN) -- A U.S. Navy submarine and a Navy amphibious ship that collided Friday in the Strait of Hormuz south of Iran have arrived in Bahrain to be assessed for damage, the Navy said. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans are shown in Navy photos. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans arrived Saturday in Mina Salman pier to "to further assess and evaluate the damage that resulted from their collision at sea," the service said in a written statement. Fifteen sailors were slightly hurt aboard the Hartford in the collision, which occurred early Friday morning. On Friday, Navy officials in Washington told CNN that there was significant damage to the sail, or tower-like structure on the topside of the submarine. On Saturday, the Navy said there was no damage to the submarine's propulsion unit. No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans. The ship's fuel tank ruptured, spilling 25,000 gallons of marine diesel fuel in the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy said in the Saturday statement. "Aerial searches of the area where the fuel spill occurred were conducted yesterday, and revealed no indication of any remaining fuel on the ocean's surface," the Navy said. "The quick dissipation of the fuel is likely due to the type of fuel, and various environmental factors to include air and water temperatures, winds and seas." When the collision occurred, both vessels were headed to ports in the Persian Gulf to stock up on provisions and allow for some recreation, Navy spokesman Lt. Nate Christensen said Friday. Christensen said there were about 200 sailors in the sub and 1,000 sailors and Marines aboard the ship. The Strait of Hormuz is located between the United Arab Emirates and Iran, linking the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. It is heavily used by oil tankers. Both vessels are on regularly scheduled deployments to the U.S. Navy Central Command area of responsibility, and conduct Maritime Security Operations.

chatgpt: Two United States Navy vessels collided near the Arabian Peninsula on Friday, causing damage and injuries to crew members. The USS Hartford and the USS New Orleans were conducting routine operations in the Gulf when the accident occurred. According to a statement from the US Navy, the incident happened as the vessels were transiting the Strait of Hormuz - a vital shipping route for oil exports. The cause of the collision is not yet known, but investigations are underway. Fifteen sailors onboard the USS Hartford were slightly injured in the collision. They have received medical attention and have been released. However, the impact caused significant damage to the vessel, and it will need to undergo further assessment and evaluation to determine the extent of the damage. The USS New Orleans suffered a more severe impact. Its fuel tank ruptured during the collision, spilling around 25,000 gallons of fuel into the surrounding waters. An oil spill response team has been dispatched to the area to contain and clean up the spill. Both vessels have been ordered to moor in Bahrain while investigators carry out their work. The Navy says it is taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of its crew and to protect the environment. The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea. It is a vital shipping route for oil exports, and any disruptions can have serious economic consequences. The US Navy has a strong presence in the region to ensure the safety and security of shipping lanes. This incident is the latest in a series of incidents involving US Navy vessels. In 2017, the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship near Japan, killing seven sailors. Later that year, the USS John S. McCain collided with an oil tanker near Singapore, resulting in the deaths of ten sailors. The Navy has pledged to investigate this latest incident thoroughly and take appropriate action to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
