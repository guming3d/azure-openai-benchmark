article: (CNN) -- Agnieszka Radwanska is already the most successful Polish female tennis player, but her achievements will reach a new level when the world rankings are released on Monday. The 22-year-old will climb to a career-high No. 5 after winning the Dubai Tennis Championships on Saturday, when she beat Germany's rising star Julia Gorges 7-5 6-4 in the final. Radwanska, the first Polish woman to pass $1 million in prize money, claimed the eighth title of her career and her first this year. She extended her record to 15-3 this season, with her only defeats coming against world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the last eight at the Australian Open and the semifinals in Sydney and Doha. Gorges, making her Dubai debut, had reached her fourth career final after knocking out Caroline Wozniacki -- Melbourne champion Azarenka's predecessor at the top -- in Friday's semis. Victory on Saturday would have seen the 23-year-old climb to a career-high 15th in the rankings, up from 19, but -- just like in the fourth round of January's opening grand slam Down Under -- she had no answer to Radwanska's game. Meanwhile, former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro reached his second successive final after beating top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Marseille Open on Saturday. The fourth-seeded Argentine, who has climbed back up the rankings to 10th after long-term wrist problems, won 6-4 6-7 (9-11) 6-3 against the French world No. 6 -- who won this tournament in 2009. Both players had reached the career milestone of 200 match wins on Friday. Del Potro, who lost to world No. 3 Roger Federer in the Rotterdam final last weekend, will face 2010 champion Michael Llodra in Sunday's final. The Frenchman went through after beating Serbian third seed Janko Tipsarevic 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in the second semi. Jurgen Melzer reached the final of the Memphis hard-court event on Saturday, beating Czech third seed Radek Stepanek 6-4 3-6 6-3. The Austrian followed up Friday's win over American top seed John Isner, while Stepanek ended the hopes of 2010 winner Sam Querrey of the U.S. in their quarterfinal . Melzer will face last year's runner-up Milos Raonic on Sunday after the in-form Canadian defeated Germany's Benjamin Becker in straight sets. The 21-year-old, seeking a third ATP title of the year, took just 75 minutes to ease through 6-4 6-4. Fourth seed Raonic fired an impressive 14 aces on his way to a ninth straight victory and remains on course to add to his tournament victories in Chennai and San Jose.

Radwanska defeated former world number one Jelena Jankovic in a close encounter, winning 6-2, 2-6, 6-0 in the final. Radwanska's victory in Dubai will see her replace Caroline Wozniacki as the world number five.  Radwanska is enjoying a remarkable resurgence in her career, having struggled with injuries in the past. She has been in sensational form in 2019, reaching the quarter-finals or better in every tournament she has played so far this season.  In Marseille, Juan Martin del Potro and Michael Llodra will contest the final of the Open 13. Del Potro defeated Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-1 in the semi-finals, while Llodra beat another Frenchman, Julien Benneteau, 6-3, 6-1. Del Potro is the favourite to take the title, having played some of his best tennis this season.    Meanwhile, the final of the Memphis Open will see Austria's Jurgen Melzer take on in-form Canadian Milos Raonic.

Melzer, who is currently ranked 43 in the world, will be hoping for a shock victory over Raonic, who is currently ranked number 13 in the world. However, Raonic has been in fantastic form this season, winning the Australian Open quarter-finals and reaching the final of the San Jose Open last week.  The final promises to be a closely contested encounter between two players in red hot form. Both players will be looking to claim their first title of the season and make a statement ahead of the big events later in the year.  In conclusion, it has been an exciting week of tennis with top players from around the world competing in various competitions. Radwanska's victory in Dubai is a significant milestone in her career, and she will be looking to carry this momentum forward into the next tournaments on the tour.
