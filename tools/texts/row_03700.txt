article: How do you solve the problem of choking road traffic in one of the world's bustling megacities? You bring in the robot cops. In Kinshasa, the sprawling capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, two humanoid robots have been installed in high-traffic areas to regulate the flow of vehicles and help drivers and pedestrians traverse the roads safely.

The goal is to ease the traffic woes of commuters and cut the number of road accidents in the center of Kinshasa, a city of some 10 million people. "It is an innovation about road safety," Vale Manga Wilma, president of the DRC's National Commission for Road Safety (Commission Nationale de Prevention Routiere), told CNN. "The traffic is a big problem in the rush hours," he explained. "With the robots' policemen intelligence, the road safety in Kinshasa becomes very easy." Read this: Megacity's ambitious plans . Standing eight feet tall, the robot traffic wardens are on duty 24 hours a day, their towering -- even scarecrow-like -- mass visible from afar. They are powered by solar panels and are equipped with rotating chests and surveillance cameras that record the flow of vehicles. The humanoids, which are installed on Kinshasa's busy Triomphal and Lumumba intersections, are built of aluminum and stainless steel to endure the city's year-round hot climate. Featuring green and red lights, Kinshasa's robot cops are designed to merge some of the functions of human officers and traffic lights. The anthropomorphic robots can raise or bend their arms to stop passing vehicles or let others pass, and are also programmed to speak, indicating to pedestrians when they can cross the road. Manga Wilma said that this is a DRC-made technology, designed and built by a team of local engineers called WITECH ONG. READ MORE: Africa's 'new cities' - Urban future or utopian fantasies?

chatgpt: Kinshasa, the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has recently installed two talking robots to regulate traffic in the bustling city. These robots are equipped with advanced features and are powered by solar panels, making them eco-friendly. Installed at strategic traffic points in the city, the robots are fitted with surveillance cameras to monitor traffic flow and reduce accidents in the busy streets of Kinshasa. The two robots will work continuously to ensure that vehicles and pedestrians obey traffic laws and follow traffic signals to prevent accidents. According to the authorities, the robots' deployment will also help reduce traffic congestion in Kinshasa, a city that has historically faced significant traffic and mobility challenges. The robots will work harmoniously with other traffic management strategies to alleviate congestion and streamline traffic flow. The talking robots have a friendly and approachable appearance that makes them easily identifiable. They communicate with road users in various languages and direct them on the rules of the road. This feature is essential, as Kinshasa has a diverse population that speaks many languages. The innovative robots' installation is part of a larger project aimed at modernizing Kinshasa's infrastructure, reducing air pollution, and controlling both pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The robots offer a solution for Kinshasa congestion and provide an alternative means of transportation that reduces carbon emissions. This project's success is, however, dependent on the public's cooperation as drivers and pedestrians need to listen to the robots' instructions for it to have a significant impact.  Nevertheless, the initiative's successful implementation would potentially revolutionize traffic regulation and encourage sustainable transportation in Kinshasa. Overall, the new talking robots will aid in improving the flow of traffic in Kinshasa, reducing accidents, and promoting eco-friendly transportation. They represent a significant breakthrough in AI-assisted traffic management systems and are an innovative solution for the city's traffic and mobility challenges.
