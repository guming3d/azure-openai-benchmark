article: Jailed: Glenn Stacey is back in prison after flouting a town centre ban six times in just two months . A prolific shoplifter with more than 350 convictions is back behind bars after flouting a town centre ban six times in just two months. Glenn Stacey, who has a long history of stealing low-value items, was given a Criminal Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Crasbo) in February, barring him from the centre of Blackpool, Lancashire. But 54-year-old Stacey, who is well-known to local security teams, was spotted last month in Poundland. It was the latest breach of his order - and he was sent to prison for 28 days. Police say the threat of jail does not stop Stacey, but claim the Crasbo means they can at least arrest him before he causes any serious trouble. Lancashire Constabulary's PC Russell Bargh, of the Blackpool Centre Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: ‘It’s how prolific he is that’s the problem. Jail doesn’t stop him - being inside is just an occupational hazard. ‘I have been an officer for 12 years and the number of convictions he has is well above anyone else I’ve ever come across. ‘But the Crasbo gives us a chance to arrest him before he manages to commit a crime. It gives us another string to our bow that helps us prevent crime before it gets too far. ‘The order has not been issued lightly. He is not shoplifting because we are getting to him first.’ Sighting: Stacey was spotted at Poundland (pictured) in Blackpool. It was the latest breach of his order .

He was in all the time before.’ 'Jail doesn’t stop him - being inside is just an occupational hazard' PC Russell Bargh . But the nature of Stacey’s offences means he is unlikely to face a significant stretch behind bars any time soon. PC Bargh added: ‘If you asked town centre stores, they would probably be relieved at a longer period of time but would it stop him committing offences? Probably not. ‘I don’t think Glenn is a particularly nasty person. He just doesn’t see the consequences and he doesnt fear them. I think any officer you ask in Blackpool Central would say they know Glenn.’

chatgpt: Glenn Stacey, a 54-year-old man from Blackpool, has become notorious for his history of theft. Stacey has a habit of stealing low-value items, which has led to multiple run-ins with the law. His most recent encounter with the authorities saw him being jailed for one month after breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order (Crasbo) while being seen in town. Crasbos, put in place by magistrates, are used to restrict the behavior of individuals who have been involved in criminal activity. Violating a Crasbo can result in imprisonment, as it did for Stacey. However, the police believe that jail time does not deter him from committing further crimes. "Being inside is just an occupational hazard," says one officer. Stacey's criminal record dates back over several years, with previous offenses including shoplifting, stealing bicycles, and even taking clothes from a charity shop. Despite multiple visits to court and time spent behind bars, it seems that Stacey has not learned from his mistakes. In court, Stacey's defense solicitor explained that his client had been struggling with a drug addiction for many years, which had led to his criminal behavior. However, the judge argued that Stacey was responsible for his actions, regardless of any personal issues he was facing. The public has expressed concern over the length of Stacey's prison sentence, with some feeling that it is too lenient. They argue that without a stronger deterrent, Stacey is likely to continue his criminal behavior, putting both individuals and businesses at risk. Local businesses have reported losses due to Stacey's thefts, with some stating that they have had to increase security measures as a result. They hope that with Stacey now behind bars, the community can breathe a sigh of relief and move on from the disruption that he has caused. Despite the concerns raised by members of the public, Stacey's jail sentence is in line with other similar cases. However, with the police acknowledging that jail is not a deterrent for him, it remains to be seen whether this latest imprisonment will have any impact on his future behavior. For now, Glenn Stacey's criminal history continues to be a cause for concern. It is a reminder that theft, no matter how insignificant the item may seem, has consequences and can have a significant impact on individuals and businesses alike.
