article: (CNN) -- The moon disappeared from view along the U.S. West Coast on Saturday amid a total lunar eclipse. Images from Seattle, Washington, showed the moon's crescent waning from a Cheshire cat's grin to a shadowy sliver before disappearing entirely in the night sky. All of the United States was able to see some portion of the event, though the West Coast had "a more complete view" and was able to see the totality -- the time when the Earth's shadow completely covers the moon. The totality on the West Coast was timed as the moon sets and the sun rises, NASA said. It lasted 51 minutes. "A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth is directly between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's rays and casting a shadow on the moon. As the moon moves deeper and deeper into Earth's shadow, the moon changes color before your very eyes, turning from gray to an orange or deep shade of red," the NASA website said. "The moon takes on this new color because sunlight is still able to pass through Earth's atmosphere and cast a glow on the moon. Our atmosphere filters out most of the blue colored light, leaving the red and orange hues that we see during a lunar eclipse. If there are additional dust particles in the atmosphere, the moon will appear to be a darker shade of red," NASA said. CNN iReporter Bob Cronk took time-lapse video images of the eclipse from his condo on the 17th floor in Portland, Oregon. "I thought it was pretty cool," Cronk said. "I really wanted to see it turn red." Instead, the moon disappeared behind fog. Watch iReporter's time-lapse images of the eclipse . NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, which is orbiting 31 miles above the moon, got a front-row seat to the lunar eclipse, the last of the year, NASA said. The orbiter was to record how quickly certain parts of the moon would cool off during the eclipse, NASA said. The next opportunity to view a total lunar eclipse from the United States is April 15, 2014. CNN's Michael Martinez and Phil Gast contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Wednesday night, viewers on the West Coast of the United States had the opportunity to witness a total lunar eclipse, also known as a "blood moon." The rare event occurs when the Earth's shadow completely covers the moon, giving it a reddish hue. The eclipse began at around 4:45 a.m. Pacific Time and lasted for over an hour. Many people woke up early to catch a glimpse of the stunning celestial display, despite the early morning hours. While the phenomenon was visible from the western United States and much of Asia, people on the East Coast unfortunately missed out due to the timing of the eclipse. The last time a total lunar eclipse was visible from North America was in January of 2019. The next opportunity for viewers in the United States to see a total lunar eclipse will be in April of 2024. During the eclipse, many people shared photos and videos of the moon on social media. Some captured the moon glowing a deep red, while others shared images of the shadow slowly creeping over the lunar surface. The eclipse was especially significant as it occurred during a supermoon, which is when the full moon is closest to the Earth. This made the moon appear larger and more luminous than during a typical full moon. For those who missed the eclipse, there are still ways to experience it online. Many websites and social media accounts shared live streams and recordings of the event, allowing people to view it from around the world. Total lunar eclipses are a rare and awe-inspiring event that often capture the imagination of viewers around the world. While some missed out on this recent opportunity, there will be more chances to witness this incredible display in the near future.
