Harry was asked to leave by security because he was not wearing a shirt while shopping . She said: 'We literally walked through the door, past the checkouts and towards the toy aisle because my boy wanted to choose a toy with the money he had. I heard someone come up behind us and say "Excuse me". 'When I turned around it was the security lady and she asked me to leave. 'I said "Why? I haven’t done anything’ and she said ‘Because your son hasn’t got a t-shirt on. Unless he puts something on I’m going to have to ask you to leave". 'I explained we didn’t have anything with us and she just kept saying "It’s company policy". 'I said "He’s only six", but she said it didn’t matter.' Harry was allowed to choose a toy but Mrs Seaborn had to take her son outside to wait with her husband Colin, 43, while she went back inside and paid. Company policy: A spokesman for Tesco said that stores do normally ask customers to be fully clothed while shopping (file picture) Mrs Seaborn added: 'It’s absolutely ridiculous. 'He was so warm he didn’t want a t-shirt. He’s six-years-old. 'He goes to the park like that all the time. I just can’t see any harm in it.' She said: 'He was upset. He didn’t really understand because he’s been in other shops without a top, actually he’s been in Tesco before without one.' She now plans to make a formal complaint to the company. A Tesco spokesman said: 'We do usually ask that all customers are clothed when shopping, including children, but on this occasion we were happy to let our customer and her son finish choosing a toy before paying and leaving, which our customer seemed happy with at the time.'

chatgpt: A shopping trip to Braintree, Essex turned sour for a mother and her son when they were approached by security. Harry Seaborn and his mother, Paula, were browsing through a store when the security guard approached them and asked Harry to cover up or leave the premises. The young schoolboy had chosen a t-shirt with a playful slogan, which in the guard's opinion was inappropriate for public display. Despite the protestations of his mother, the security guard was adamant that Harry's shirt was not suitable for the store. With no alternative available, Harry chose a toy and waited outside while his mother paid for their purchases. Although Paula insisted that the incident was not a big deal, it raises questions about the boundaries of acceptable clothing in public spaces. The incident has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many people weighing in on the issue. Some argue that children should be allowed to express themselves through their clothing choices, while others believe that certain clothing is simply not appropriate for public display. This is not the first time that dress codes have caused controversy. In recent years, similar incidents have been reported in schools, offices and public spaces across the world. While some argue that dress codes are necessary for maintaining decorum and professionalism, others feel that they are a form of oppression and limit personal expression. According to experts, the issue of dress codes is not clear-cut. There is no definitive answer to what is considered acceptable or inappropriate for public display, and opinions on the matter are likely to be divided. In the end, it seems that the case of Harry Seaborn is simply a small part of a much larger debate. What is clear is that incidents like this will continue to occur as society grapples with the question of what is acceptable in public spaces. As for Harry Seaborn and his mother, they are unlikely to forget the incident any time soon.
