article: By . Associated Press . A conservative Mississippi blogger who is accused of photographing the bedridden 72-year-old wife of Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, 76, without permission has had bail set at $100,000. Clayton Kelly, 28, has a preliminary hearing on Thursday, which was scheduled by a magistrate in Mississippi on Sunday, Assistant Police Chief Robert Sanders said. Police were also looking into the possibility that other people were involved. Mississippi blogger Clayton Kelly (pictured), 28, had bail set at $100,000 by City Magistrate Dale Danks on Sunday . 'That is certainly one of the focal points of the investigation,' Sanders said in an email. Kelly was arrested Friday on a charge of exploiting a vulnerable adult. He's accused of using an image of Cochran's wife, Rose, who suffers from dementia and has been in a nursing home since 2000, in an online video. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who is challenging the six-term senator in a GOP primary in June, said he does not have any ties to Kelly. 'I've reached out to Senator Cochran directly to express my abhorrence for the reprehensible actions of this individual,' McDaniel said in a statement Saturday. 'This criminal act is deeply offensive and my team and I categorically reject such appalling behavior.' Kelly voluntarily took down the video about 90 minutes after uploading it last month and is cooperating with investigators, said his attorney, Kevin Camp. Cochran's attorney Don Clark said on Saturday that the photo of Rose Cochran was taken near her bedside. Kelly's attorney said it was taken through an open door during visiting hours. Republican U.S. Senator Thad Cochran's (pictured far left in February) wife was unwillingly photographed while in her nursing home . 'He didn't do anything that was out of the norms of visitation. He took the photo and put it on the blog,' Camp said. Kelly's Facebook page includes a photo of a McDaniel campaign sign and a photo of him with McDaniel at a campaign meet-and-greet event. On his blog, Constitutional Clayton, Kelly wrote: 'When it comes to Republicans with a bad voting record, you can't get any worse than Thad Cochran.' Since Kelly's arrest, the campaigns have traded barbs over when Kelly came to the attention of the McDaniel campaign. Cochran's campaign released a voicemail it received from McDaniel's campaign manager, trying to show that McDaniel's camp knew about Kelly before his arrest. The recording was first reported by The Clarion-Ledger and later provided to The Associated Press. Cochran was elected to Senate in 1978 after six years in the House. He is a former chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 'I have been fortunate to have a wonderful family, and like so many families, we are deeply affected by my wife's serious, long-term illness, that we consider to be a very private family matter,' Cochran said in a statement Saturday. 'We will continue doing everything we can to protect my wife's safety and security.'

chatgpt: Clayton Kelly, a 28-year-old Mississippi blogger, has been arrested on charges of exploiting a vulnerable adult. This comes after Kelly uploaded a video to his blog that featured a senile nursing home resident discussing an upcoming senatorial election. The video was taken down just 90 minutes after it was initially uploaded, and Kelly is reportedly cooperating with investigators. According to his statement, the photo or video was taken through an open door during visiting hours. Reports indicate that Kelly's motive for filming the video is linked to his backing of Christopher McDaniel, who was running against incumbent Thad Cochran in a senatorial primary last year. The video, which was published on Kelly's political blog "Constitutional Clayton," received a significant amount of attention before it was eventually removed. Many viewers claimed that the video was exploitative and unethical, and the case has since drawn the attention of national media and authorities. According to authorities, the nursing home resident featured in the video was unable to provide consent due to her advanced age and medical condition. Kelly maintained that he had no intention of harming the resident, and that his actions were instead motivated by a desire to expose the alleged electoral misconduct of Cochran and his supporters. Kelly's defense attorneys have argued that he had every right to film the resident, as she was allegedly coherent and in good spirits during the visit. However, prosecutors have pointed out that the resident may not have fully understood Kelly's intentions or been able to give informed consent. The case is being closely followed by advocates for elder abuse victims, who are calling for greater protections and rights for nursing home residents. They argue that such residents are particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and that the legal system must do more to protect them. Legal experts point out that, while Kelly's actions may have been well-intentioned, they still constitute a serious violation of the resident's privacy and dignity. Moreover, the fact that he was able to gain access to the nursing home and record a video without proper consent raises troubling questions about the security protocols and oversight of such facilities. Kelly's case is a stark reminder of the ethical and legal challenges posed by the use of modern technology in journalism and political campaigning. While the internet and social media offer powerful new tools for disseminating information and mobilizing voters, they also present new risks and vulnerabilities, particularly for vulnerable populations like seniors and people with disabilities. As the legal battle over Kelly's actions continues, many are calling for greater education and awareness around issues of elder abuse and privacy in the digital age. They argue that only by understanding the complex ethical and legal issues at play can we hope to build a society that truly values and protects all of its citizens.
