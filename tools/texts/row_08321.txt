chatgpt: A distressing video has emerged online, recorded by horrified bystanders in Estonia, which depicts the harrowing death of Madi, a 48-year-old elephant from India. The footage shows the gentle giant desperately struggling to stay afloat as she slowly drowns. Madi had been brought to Estonia as part of Germany's renowned Universal Circus Renz. Her performance at the circus involved doing tricks such as standing on one foot and playing the harmonica. Unfortunately, her tragic death has now sparked an international outcry and reignited the debate surrounding the ethics of using animals in circuses. The incident occurred when Madi was being transported to perform her shows in Tallinn. However, at one point, something went horribly wrong, and she ended up slipping off a ramp while crossing a river. With her huge bulk weighing her down, she quickly became submerged in the water and then struggled to keep her head above water. Tragically, none of the circus staff or handlers on hand were able to save her. The incident has left animal rights activists and animal lovers across the world outraged. They have been calling for an immediate ban on animal circuses in Europe, citing the cruel and inhumane conditions these animals are forced to endure. While Madi's plight was heartbreaking, she is only one of many animals kept in captivity for the purpose of entertainment in circuses. Elephants, in particular, are known to suffer greatly from being confined in small spaces and being forced to perform unnatural acts. They often suffer from a range of physical and psychological problems, including arthritis, foot infections, and depression. Germany's Universal Circus Renz has previously faced criticism over animal welfare concerns. Despite global pressure, they have refused to stop using animals in their shows. Ironically, the circus was fined €10,000 ($11,700) in 2017 for using Madi in their performances- citing her tuberculosis diagnosis, which can pass to humans. Madi's tragic death demands urgent action from the authorities to protect animals in circuses. Several countries, including Bolivia and Greece, have already banned the use of animals in circuses. It is now time for other European countries to follow suit and put an end to this outdated and cruel form of entertainment, which puts animals' lives at risk. In conclusion, the death of Madi was a painful reminder of the misery experienced by animals in circuses. The incident has prompted global calls for an end to the mistreatment of animals in these settings. It remains to be seen whether these calls will be heeded, but one thing is clear - the death of Madi must not be in vain.
