chatgpt: Former Welsh rugby star, Gareth Davies, has left his friends stunned following his sudden decision to move out of his family home in Cardiff before Christmas. The 51-year-old is known for his successful career as a rugby player, but it seems his private life has been thrown into turmoil. According to close friends, Davies has been struggling to come to terms with his split from his wife of nearly two decades, Helen.

Friends say that Davies has been left devastated by the split and has been struggling to come to terms with what it means for his family. "He's a tough guy, but even he has been shook by all of this," said one friend, who wished to remain anonymous. "He's been with Helen for a long time and they have a daughter together. It's not an easy situation." Davies was previously married to Karen, who tragically died from cancer in 1997. The couple had three grown-up children together, and Davies has since spoken at length about how her passing affected him. It's unclear who initiated the split, but friends say that Davies had been living apart from Helen for some time before making the official move out of the family home.
