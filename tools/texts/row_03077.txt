article: (CNN) -- A giant panda slated to be the star of the first-ever live broadcast of the birth of panda cubs has lost the role -- after it was discovered the bear is not pregnant after all, Chinese state media reported. Not only was it a phantom pregnancy, but zookeepers suspect the panda, Ai Hin, may have been faking it to improve her quality of life, the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding told Xinhua on Monday. Ai Hin, age 6, had shown signs of pregnancy, including a change in appetite, moving less and an increase in progestational hormone in July, according to Xinhua. But after almost two months, she began acting normally again, zookeepers said. Experts say pandas sometimes carry on the behaviors associated with early pregnancy after noticing that they get preferential treatment, the news agency reported. "After showing prenatal signs, the 'mothers-to-be' are moved into single rooms with air conditioning and around-the-clock care," Wu Kongju, an expert at the Chengdu base, is quoted as saying. "They also receive more buns, fruits and bamboo, so some clever pandas have used this to their advantage to improve their quality of life." The birth of Ai Hin's supposed cub and its progress in its early days, from its first cries to acquiring its distinctive black-and-white fur, were due to be broadcast online to panda lovers in China and worldwide. Giant pandas are notoriously reluctant to breed in captivity and pseudo-pregnancies are common. The female is fertile for no more than three days a year, and the time span for a pregnancy is from 80 to 200 days, according to the Chengdu base. Scientists will closely monitor behavioral and physiological signs, but it's often a guessing game. Even if a pregnancy proves genuine, baby pandas have very low survival rates. According to the Chengdu base, only a third to a half of pandas born in Chinese captivity manage to survive past infancy. There was good news last month, though, when a panda gave birth to a healthy set of triplets in China's Chimelong Safari Park in the southern city of Guangzhou. The cubs are thought to be the only living panda triplets in the world. Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland thinks its panda, Tian Tian, could be the next to produce a cub, based on the latest scientific tests, but there are no guarantees. "It is very likely that we will not know 100% if Tian Tian is pregnant until she gives birth," Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said earlier this month. As few as 1,600 giant pandas survive in the mountain forests of central China, according to the Smithsonian Institution's National Zoo in Washington. More than 300 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, most of them in China.

chatgpt: In an unexpected turn of events, the world-renowned giant panda, Ai Hin, has recently been reported to have experienced a phantom pregnancy. This news comes just as Ai Hin was expected to be the star of the highly anticipated first live broadcast of a panda birth. According to a report from Xinhua, experts believe that Ai Hin may have developed her phantom pregnancy due to the increased attention and special treatment she has received while preparing for the live broadcast. The panda reportedly began to exhibit behavior similar to that of an expectant mother, building a nest and showing a decrease in appetite. However, after observing Ai Hin for some time, experts determined that there was no actual pregnancy. It is not uncommon for pandas to experience phantom pregnancies, with behaviors such as lactation and even loss of appetite being observed in some cases. Experts say that this behavior may be a result of the panda's natural instincts to care for young and ensure their survival in the wild. This news has come as a disappointment for many who were looking forward to the live broadcast of a panda birth. However, experts urge the public to understand that the occurrence of phantom pregnancies is a natural and normal phenomenon among pandas. Many viewers have been eagerly awaiting the live broadcast of a panda birth, with the event being touted as a breakthrough in conservation efforts. The broadcast was set to take place at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China, where Ai Hin is currently housed. However, with the recent news of Ai Hin's phantom pregnancy, it is unclear whether the live broadcast will still take place. Despite the disappointment, experts are using this opportunity to bring greater awareness to the plight of giant pandas and their conservation efforts. By shedding light on the natural behaviors of pandas, they hope to increase public understanding and support for conservation efforts. The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has been at the forefront of panda conservation efforts, with a focus on using technology and scientific methods to further their work. The live broadcast of a panda birth was seen as a significant step forward in this effort, bringing greater awareness to the importance of preserving these iconic creatures. While Ai Hin's phantom pregnancy may have caused a setback in the live broadcast, experts say that there are many other ways in which the public can get involved and support panda conservation efforts. From donating to research programs to supporting sustainable tourism initiatives, the public can play a significant role in ensuring the survival of giant pandas for generations to come. In conclusion, Ai Hin's phantom pregnancy has drawn attention to the natural behaviors of giant pandas and their importance in conservation efforts. While the live broadcast of a panda birth may not take place as expected, experts urge the public to continue supporting efforts to preserve these iconic creatures for future generations.
