What's more, she also has plans to launch an athleticwear line that offers plus sizes, including swimwear, sportswear, knits and footwear. '[Currently, most designers] just go up to 12 or 14. I don't know why,' she said. 'There might be a stigma that is undeniably present. It's really the unspoken truth. I see such an opportunity.'

'The game is online for full-figured women. Major department stores are now playing that [online] game,' she said. As for big brands who are making the most of the as of yet untapped market, Emme praises Michael Michael Kors, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Asos and Calvin Klein. Despite all the progress, however, the fashion industry still has a ways to go. 'The whole plethora of personality is not being tapped,' she said. 'Just because she's a plus-size woman does not mean she is matronly.'

chatgpt: Fashion icon and body positivity advocate, Emme, has launched an inspiring initiative called Fashion Without Limits at Syracuse University. The ongoing project encourages design students to create apparel for plus-size women, offering them an opportunity to challenge contemporary fashion's size biases. The project allows students to explore the creation of evening dresses for the model, with the winner receiving a $500 prize and the chance to see their design worn by none other than Emme at a red carpet event. The Fashion Without Limits project was born out of Emme's personal experience. Emme, a famous model, and a pioneer in the body positivity movement, struggled to foray into the fashion industry's standard sizing. She learned the hard way that fashion was inherently biased towards smaller sizes. But instead of feeling disheartened, Emme decided to channel her frustration into a project that would help aspiring designers challenge these biases and create fashion for everyone. The project's primary goal is to encourage size-inclusive fashion that would cater to plus-size women. Emme established the competition for evening dresses for a reason. Evening dresses represent a category of fashion known for its exclusivity and inaccessibility to plus-size women. The competition is a significant breakthrough in the fashion industry, as it not only challenges size biases but also creates beautiful fashion pieces that cater to different body types. Design students at Syracuse University are taking the challenge quite seriously. Every semester, students submit their designs to a panel of judges, comprising Emme, a local fashion designer, and an industry expert. Judges evaluate the designs on creativity, trendiness, and practicality. The winner receives a $500 prize, along with the opportunity to see their design worn by Emme at a red carpet event. The Fashion Without Limits initiative does more than inspiring students—it sheds a bright light on the industry's fatphobic size biases. Clothing, which was meant to serve everyone, has become a tool of exclusion. The project encourages the creation and experimentation of fashion for all sizes. Although most designers today have shied from catering to plus-size women, Emme's project highlights the urgent need for inclusive fashion.  The Fashion Without Limits project marks a significant step towards inclusivity and diversity within the fashion industry. Emme is determined to bring significant changes to the industry by planting the seeds of inclusivity in the next generation of designers. Not only does her initiative inspire more size-inclusive fashion, but it fosters the creation of beautiful and innovative pieces that defy the industry standards.  In conclusion, Emme's Fashion Without Limits initiative is changing the game in the fashion industry as it encourages body positivity and size-inclusive fashion. The project is invaluable as it provides an opportunity for female plus-size models to wear beautiful, creative designs. The project is a powerful way to challenge the industry's biases and break down size boundaries. Through the Fashion Without Limits initiative, the students get inspiration, experience, and a chance to challenge their assumptions and create something inclusive and beautiful.
