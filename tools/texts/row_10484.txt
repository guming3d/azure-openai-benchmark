article: JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South African fast bowler Dale Steyn took a career-best five for 34 as the Proteas took a tight grip on the first test against New Zealand in Johannesburg. Steyn's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africa's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings. Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287. South Africa's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings. They snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the Kiwis could only muster 56 runs. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylor's 15. Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon. Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising. New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker, before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip. Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled. Steyn's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago. It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11. South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply, but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge. They batted together for 205 minutes, Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76. The Kiwis were left to regret  Brendon McCullum's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond, when the batsman had only scored two. "The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum. It cost us a lot," said coach John Bracewell. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: South Africa took a commanding lead over New Zealand on day three of the first test match being played in Centurion. The Proteas have built a lead of 287 runs with eight wickets still standing, after the Kiwis were bowled out for a paltry 118 in their first innings. South African paceman Dale Steyn was the star of the show, taking a career-best 5-34 to dismantle New Zealand's batting order. The Kiwis had resumed their innings on the third morning at 38-3, but their hopes of mounting a comeback were soon dashed as they lost wickets regularly to the relentless South African bowling. Steyn led the charge for the home side, getting rid of skipper Kane Williamson for just four runs, and he went on to take the wickets of Ross Taylor, Tom Blundell, Will Somerville, and Neil Wagner. The rest of the Kiwi batsmen had no answer to the pace and swing of Steyn, who was well supported by Kagiso Rabada, who took three wickets, and Vernon Philander, who chipped in with two. In response, South Africa batted with aggression and purpose to pile on the runs in their second innings. Dean Elgar and Aiden Markram gave the Proteas a solid start, putting on a 70-run opening stand before Markram was dismissed. Elgar went on to make a fine century, scoring 116 off 246 balls with the help of 15 boundaries. He was ably supported by captain Faf du Plessis, who made a quickfire 52 off 54 balls. When du Plessis fell, the score was 175-2, and it looked as though South Africa would dominate proceedings on day four. New Zealand failed to make any inroads into the South African batting lineup before stumps were drawn, with Zubayr Hamza and Temba Bavuma at the crease. The Proteas will look to bat the visitors out of the game on day four and build a massive lead, while the Kiwis will be hoping for a miraculous turnaround if they are to come out on top in the match. The performances of Steyn and Elgar were the highlights of the day, with the former showing that he still has much to offer as a bowler despite his age, and the latter proving his worth as a top-class opener. The South African team will be buoyed by their dominant position in the match, and will look to maintain their momentum on the fourth day. As for New Zealand, they will need to dig deep to find a way back into the game and prevent South Africa from running away with it.
