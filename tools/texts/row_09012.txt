Britons driving abroad are enjoying significantly cheaper motoring at the pumps – and up to £22 less per fill-up - thanks to the strength of the pound against the weakening crisis-laden euro. Those holidaying on European roads are saving an average of 4.2p a litre on petrol and a massive 21p a litre on diesel compared to costs at home, a survey by the AA showed. But the biggest savings range from more than 22p a litre for petrol and nearly 32p for diesel. Savings: An autobahn in Germany.

For a Ford Mondeo that is a saving of £15.47 per fill-up for petrol versions and £22.26 for diesels, based on the car’s 70-litre tank. The weaker euro is providing UK drivers on continental breaks a level of fuel saving last seen in 2008, with petrol now an average of nearly 6p a litre cheaper than in July last year. Some of the biggest and most dramatic price drops were in France, where the cost of petrol has fallen 13.4per cent in the last 12 months – or around 20p per litre. Petrol in France now costs 124.2p per litre and diesel 115.7p. The AA report says the average cost of a litre of petrol in the UK is now 132.2p and diesel 137.3p. COUNTRY . UK . Austria . Belgium .

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Since the beginning of July, drivers have seen the average UK pump price of petrol rise 2.53p a litre and diesel go up 2.30p. ‘At least, if they go abroad, the weaker euro allows them to claw back some of the surge from speculator-driven wholesale prices.’

chatgpt: Holidaymakers planning a road trip this summer can expect to save some money at the pump, as the average petrol price in the UK has dropped to 132.2p a litre, according to a survey conducted by the AA. The survey found that holidaymakers are saving an average of 4.2p a litre on petrol and 21p a litre on diesel compared to prices in June 2020. This is good news for anyone planning a staycation or a road trip abroad, as fuel prices often make up a significant portion of the travel budget. The decrease in petrol prices can be attributed to a number of factors, including low global oil prices and reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the UK government has reduced fuel duty by 2p a litre since March 2020, which has helped to offset some of the price increases that occurred earlier in the year. Despite the recent decrease, petrol prices in the UK remain among the highest in Europe. This is due to a number of factors, including higher taxes, lower levels of competition among retailers, and the weak value of the pound sterling. According to the AA, drivers in the South East of England pay the highest prices for fuel, with an average of 132.9p a litre for petrol and 136.2p a litre for diesel. By contrast, drivers in Northern Ireland pay the lowest prices, with an average of 128.8p a litre for petrol and 131.7p a litre for diesel. While the recent decrease in fuel prices is good news for holidaymakers, it remains to be seen how long the trend will continue. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created a great deal of uncertainty in the global oil market, and any number of factors could cause prices to rise again in the near future. In the meantime, the AA is advising drivers to shop around for the best deals on fuel and to take advantage of any loyalty schemes or discount programs offered by retailers. By doing so, drivers can save even more money on their summer road trips. Overall, the news that holidaymakers are saving an average of 4.2p a litre on petrol and 21p a litre on diesel is good news for anyone planning a staycation or a road trip in the coming months. While petrol prices in the UK remain high compared to other countries in Europe, the recent decrease in prices is a welcome relief for drivers. Whether this trend will continue in the long term remains to be seen, but for now, holidaymakers can enjoy some extra savings at the pump.
