chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, Khalil Tatum, aged 51, has been charged with the murder of his wife, Andrea Tatum. This comes after her body was discovered in a motel in Washington D.C., where she had apparently been staying with her husband. The police were called after the motel staff noticed a foul odor emanating from one of the rooms. When the police arrived, they found Mrs. Tatum's lifeless body on the bed, with evidence suggesting that she had been strangled to death. Following this discovery, the police launched a search for her husband, who was nowhere to be found at the scene of the crime. It was later discovered that Tatum had been entrusted with the care of a young girl, Relisha Rudd, by her family. However, the 8-year-old was reported missing a day after Mrs. Tatum's body was found, leading to an intense manhunt for Tatum. The search for Tatum spanned several states, with the police appealing to the public for information about his whereabouts.
