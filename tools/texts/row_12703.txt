chatgpt: One of Britain's top independent schools is set to open a second branch in China, catering to the children of expats based in Shanghai. Wycombe Abbey School, located in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, operates as a fee-paying school and is highly regarded for its commitment to academic excellence and pastoral care. Its new campus, situated in Pudong Qiantan, will seek to emulate this success on a global scale. Visually striking, the artist's impression of the proposed site reveals several imposing buildings arranged around a central courtyard. Enclosed by rolling lawns embellished with a scattering of trees, the design has been carefully crafted to evoke a sense of heritage and tradition. "We've tried to adapt the school's brand and vision to a Chinese context," says Zhang Min, the architect responsible for the plans. "We hope that this will resonate with local families and help to establish our presence within the area." During its first year of operation, the new campus will accommodate children aged between 5 and 12, with additional classes added each year as the school expands. Applications are currently being accepted, with fees averaging around £40,000 per annum. While this may seem steep, the school is well-equipped to deliver a substantial return on investment, with its highly-qualified teachers and state-of-the-art facilities attracting an enviable track record of academic success. The school will be operated through a partnership between Wycombe Abbey School and China's Bright Scholar Education Group, which already oversees several free education schools across the country. Together, they intend to deliver a bespoke education that fuses elements of Eastern and Western education styles. This unique approach is intended to provide students with a rigorous academic grounding, alongside a deep appreciation of Chinese culture and heritage. The expansion of Wycombe Abbey School into Pudong Qiantan underscores the growing reputation of China as a destination of choice for global education. As the country continues to open up to international investment, schools such as Wycombe Abbey are helping to bridge the divide between cultures, providing children with the skills and knowledge they need to excel in an increasingly interconnected world.
