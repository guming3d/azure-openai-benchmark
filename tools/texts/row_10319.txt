Alberdi and his two children and a friend and her two children visited the creek to swim but Alberdi and Lovett 'were immediately swept away in the swift currents,' officials said. The girl's body was recovered later on Saturday night after being spotted by kayakers about three-quarters of a mile from where she had been swimming, Kincaid said. Alberdi's body was recovered on Sunday. The creek 'is about two feet above normal with all the rain' across the Appalachian foothills, Kincaid said Sunday.

The county and the cities of Hickory and Newton - where dozens of streets were underwater Saturday afternoon - were among the communities declaring local emergencies as a precursor to seeking state and federal aid, assistant county emergency services director Mark Petit said. There were no reported injuries from the flash flooding, Dickerson said. Sections of at least six roads will remain closed for up to three months to repair damage, he said. Interstate 85 was closed for a short time Saturday afternoon in Cabarrus County because of high water, the State Highway Patrol said.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck two Charlotte-area families over the weekend as Juan Alberdi and Delilah Lovett drowned while swimming in Wilson Creek. The usually calm pool section, located about 100 miles north of Charlotte, proved to be a dangerous destination on Saturday evening as the pair lost their lives. According to reports, the pair were swimming when heavy rain started falling in the area. Four inches of rain fell over five hours in North Carolina's Piedmont region, causing officials to issue a state of emergency. Unfortunately, the warning came too late for Alberdi and Lovett. The search for the two began late Saturday evening after reports of a missing girl in the area. Lovett's body was located by kayakers about three-quarters of a mile from where she was last seen swimming. The discovery of her body prompted officials to continue searching for Alberdi, whose body was found the following day. The families of the two victims are now in mourning as they come to grips with the tragic loss. Friends and family have shared memories and messages of love and support for the two teens who lost their lives so tragically. The incident highlights the importance of staying vigilant during stormy weather, especially when near bodies of water. Heavy rainfall can cause flash flooding and dangerous currents, even in areas that are typically calm and safe for swimming. As the state of emergency continues in North Carolina, officials are urging residents to take precautions and heed any warnings or alerts that may be issued. The loss of Alberdi and Lovett is a somber reminder of the risks associated with inclement weather and the importance of staying aware and prepared. In the wake of the tragic incident, authorities have reiterated the need for safety precautions and the importance of respecting natural bodies of water. As the community mourns the loss of two young lives, it is hoped that their story will serve as a reminder of the dangers of playing in the water during hazardous conditions.
