Clumps of mane and tail hair were discovered in the lay-by leading to the towpath . 'The soil is really disturbed in places which could mean the pony had been alive and had been struggling. 'There were also clumps of mane and tail hair in the lay-by and drag marks leading to the towpath. 'It is awful that a pony has just been dumped in this way and distressing for anyone who sees the body. 'We have informed the relevant authorities asking them to remove the pony - as we don't have the statutory responsibility nor the resources to dispose of bodies.'

chatgpt: The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) has issued a plea for anyone with information regarding the death of a pony found in water near a lay-by to come forward. Inspectors say that the evidence suggests the pony was alive when it was put into the water. The discovery was made by a passerby, who noticed a large presence in the water near the lay-by. Upon closer inspection, they were saddened to find a distressed and deceased pony partially submerged. Inspectors arrived on the scene shortly after the discovery and noted drag marks leading up to the water’s edge, as well as mane and tail hair scattered across the lay-by. This evidence strongly suggests that someone was involved in the animal’s death, and may have forcibly dragged it into the water. The RSPCA has issued a statement urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward immediately. An RSPCA spokesperson said, “We are deeply saddened by the death of this pony, and we believe that someone is responsible. We urge anyone who saw anything suspicious or who has any other relevant information to come forward and speak to us immediately. This is a tragic case and we need to find the person or people responsible.” Animal welfare activists have expressed outrage at the incident and are calling for stronger penalties for those found guilty of animal cruelty. “It is absolutely heartbreaking to see such a beautiful animal treated so callously,” said one campaigner. “We must do more to protect our precious wildlife and ensure that those responsible for causing harm are held accountable for their actions.” The RSPCA is currently investigating the incident and has appealed to the public for help in identifying those responsible for the pony’s death. Anyone with information is urged to get in touch with the organization as soon as possible. This is a tragic and heartbreaking case that underscores the ongoing need for greater protection and care for animals throughout the country.
