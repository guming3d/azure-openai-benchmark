article: (CNN) -- Authorities in Arizona have arrested three employees of a sheriff's office known for its tough stand on illegal immigration, accusing them of aiding human traffickers and drug smugglers. A sheriff's deputy and two detention officers were among 12 people arrested in an operation Tuesday, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said. "That a deputy sheriff would provide information and associate with these drug and human traffickers is despicable," Arpaio told reporters. Deputy Alfredo Navarrette, who had been a member of a unit targeting human smuggling, faces felony charges connected to human smuggling, money laundering and participating in a crime syndicate, Arpaio said. "He admitted actually going to our command centers to obtain information to pass on to the drug traffickers and the smugglers," Arpaio said, noting that authorities found two illegal immigrants in Navarrette's home when they served a search warrant Tuesday morning. The two detention officers who were arrested -- Sylvia Najera and Marcella Hernandez -- are accused of money laundering and having connections with drug-trafficking organizations. Hernandez had more than $16,000 in her purse when she was taken into custody, Arpaio said. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery praised the sheriff's office for its handling of the matter and pledged to hold the officers accountable. "This wasn't swept under the rug. The cooperation that we received from the sheriff's office was complete and forthright," he told reporters. "No one's above the law, and apparently no one is beyond the reach of drug-trafficking organizations in Mexico," he added. Arpaio drew national attention and earned the nickname of "America's toughest sheriff" for his stance on illegal immigration, among other things. Many of his prisoners are housed in tents and forced to wear pink underwear, and he once boasted of feeding them on less than a dollar a day per prisoner. He faces a U.S. Justice Department investigation into whether his policies cracking down on illegal immigrants discriminate against Hispanics. Earlier this month critics called for his resignation after an audit found he used nearly $100 million designated for jail funds to pay deputies' salaries. Some activists said Tuesday's arrests are part of a public-relations ploy to clean up the sheriff's office image in the wake of such accusations. "Now he's saying that he's cleaning out his department, but frankly, these problems have always existed inside the agency," human rights activist Lydia Guzman told CNN affiliate KTVW.

chatgpt: The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona faces yet another controversy after a deputy was accused of being affiliated with a human-smuggling ring. The accused deputy, who was part of a special unit assigned to tackle human smuggling, has been under investigation by the office's anti-corruption unit.  Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his dismay over the accusations, calling the alleged connections "despicable". "It is unfortunate that a member of our team, who was entrusted with upholding the law, may have had an association with such criminal activity," he said.  The deputy's links to the human-smuggling ring were uncovered during an investigation into a detention officer who had been caught with a hefty sum of cash in her possession. According to Arpaio, the officer was found with a staggering $16,000 in her purse when she was arrested. The Maricopa County Sheriff stated that this discovery was made during an internal investigation of one of their employees that was initiated after receiving information on the detention officerâ€™s involvement with drugs. This comes at a time when Arpaio is already facing immense criticism and calls for resignation after a government audit of his agency in September of 2020. The audit had resulted in a scathing review of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, citing a breakdown in internal affairs procedures and lack of oversight on use of force. Arpaio has been the subject of numerous controversies, including being found guilty of criminal contempt for intentionally defying a court order to stop racial profiling. Local activists and civil rights groups have been pushing for Arpaio's removal for years, citing his alleged racial profiling, abuse of power, and mistreatment of inmates in his jails. The allegations against the deputy further add to the concerns raised by these groups about the conduct of the Sheriff's Office. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office has indicated that they will conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations against the deputy and detention officer. They have also stated that they will cooperate with law enforcement agencies to ensure that anyone involved in criminal activity is held accountable.  As the investigation unfolds, critics of Arpaio and his agency continue to call for his resignation, citing the need for a change in leadership to restore the public's trust in law enforcement in Maricopa County.
