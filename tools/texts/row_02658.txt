article: New pictures show the effects dredging and dumping has on Australia's  Great Barrier Reef Heritage Area, after a ship was photographed dredging in Cairns' waters, north-Queensland. Dredging removes sediments from the bottom of harbours, lakes and rivers. It is also used to avoid the spread of contamination that could pose as a risk to fish, wildlife and people. Lissa Schindler from the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) said these images reveal the impact dredging has on our waters, which is a problem that extends across the whole Great Barrier Reef Coastline. 'There are proposals for millions of cubic metres of dredging from new projects that could be dumped in Reef waters,' Ms Schindler said. She said the act of dredging needs to be maintained, therefore once it starts it can never stop. 'The current proposal to build a new cruise ship terminal in Cairns would involve 4.4 million cubic metres of capital dredging to establish a larger shipping channel, which would require a significant amount of maintenance dredging every year after that,' she said. Ms Schindler insists this type of activity destroys the environment and will eventually affect  tourism and the fishing industry. 'It’s vital we protect the 63,000 jobs and $6 billion the Reef brings to the QLD economy by creating a sustainable approach to the environment, jobs and the economy.' Ms Schindler pointed to the beauty of these areas like the Great Barrier Reef and said they were too 'precious' to be used as a dumping ground for rocks and muds. AMCS is an independent charity that aims to protect Australia's ocean wildlife. Scroll down for video . New pictures of a ship undergoing routine dredging in Cairns .

chatgpt: Photographs showing a ship involved in dredging activities in Cairns have raised concerns over the impact of the activity on Australia's Great Barrier Reef Heritage Area. The images captured the ship, which appeared to be involved in dredging activities off the coast of Cairns, a coastal city in the north of Queensland. The Australian Marine Conservation Society has spoken out against the activity, warning that it could be detrimental to the tourism and fishing industries. Lissa Schindler, a spokesperson for the society, stated that the dredging activity could destroy the reef, which is a vital part of the ecosystem in the area. Schindler noted that the Great Barrier Reef is a significant source of revenue for the tourism industry in the region, and that any damage to the reef could have devastating consequences for the sector. She also highlighted the importance of the fishing industry in the area, noting that the reef supports a range of marine life and is vital to the region's fishing industry. The dredging activity, which involves the removal of sediment, rocks and other materials from the seabed, can cause significant damage to marine ecosystems. The activity can alter water currents, introduce pollutants and disrupt the delicate balance of marine life in the area. The Great Barrier Reef Heritage Area, which covers an area of approximately 348,000 square kilometres, is home to some of the most diverse marine life in the world. The area is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of visitors each year. The Australian government has been criticised for its approach to protecting the reef, with some environmental groups claiming that the government has not done enough to address the threats to the ecosystem. The government recently approved the expansion of a coal port near the reef, despite concerns about the impact on the ecosystem. The photographs of the dredging activity have led to renewed calls for greater protection for the Great Barrier Reef, and for measures to be put in place to reduce the impact of human activity on the area's fragile ecosystem. Environmental groups are calling for stricter regulations on dredging activity and for greater investment in measures to protect the reef. Despite the concerns raised by environmental groups, some in the business community have argued that dredging is necessary to support economic growth and development in the region. The debate over the impact of dredging on the Great Barrier Reef is likely to continue, with both sides of the issue presenting compelling arguments. In the meantime, the photographs of dredging in Cairns have served as a reminder of the importance of protecting the fragile ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef Heritage Area, and of the need for sustainable development in the region. As Lissa Schindler noted, the reefs are a vital source of life and livelihood for the region, and their preservation is essential for the long-term health and prosperity of the area.
