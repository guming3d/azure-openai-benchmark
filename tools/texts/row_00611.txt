article: By . Misty White Sidell . It has taken 30 years of diligent collecting for David Bailey to amass 15,000 Hawaiian shirts – the world’s largest collection. Mr Bailey, the owner of Bailey's Antiques and Aloha Shirts in Honolulu Hawaii, says that he loves Hawaiian shirts, not only because they are a worthwhile investment, but also because they are a cool alternative to formal menswear. ‘I never understood suits. I don’t even own a tie. They’re creepy, actually, if you think about it. They turn people into little robot ants,’ the 69-year-old told Opening Ceremony’s blog in an interview. Biggest collector: David Bailey (pictured second from right) owns the world's largest Hawaiian shirt collection, which he sells out of his store in Honolulu . ‘When you wear a Hawaiian shirt it allows you to express yourself,’ he added of the style, which has recently been reinterpreted by high fashion labels like Prada and Dries Van Noten. Mr Bailey’s interest in prized vintage ‘aloha shirts’ as he calls them, started off as an accident – quite literally. He survived a 1,000-foot fall from a building – after which point he sold the jewelry store he had been managing in Santa Barbara to start collecting the shirts because they were both cheap and festive. Once he amassed a collection of 1,000 he transported the shirts to Waikiki in 1980 and opened a store, which would later move to Honolulu. Massive inventory: Mr Bailey's many shirts are priced up to $25,000 as many original Hawaiian shirts were hand painted and one-of-a-kind . Worthy investment: Mr Bailey says that the value of his shirts have only soared as he has owned them - making them a much more worthy investment than stocks . Its fans include Nicolas Cage, Anthony Bourdain, and Jimmy Buffett – the latter of which bought $20,000 worth of shirts from the store and has worn many of them on stage. Mr Bailey's most expensive shirts cost up to $25,000 and he says that vintage Hawaiian shirts are so expensive because many of them are wearable art. Early styles from the Forties were hand painted and enlisted artisanal stitching techniques. Prime location: Mr Bailey's store (pictured) is located near the water in Honolulu - the birthplace of the modern Hawaiian shirt . Like snowflakes: As Mr Bailey's collection points out - no two Hawaiian shirts are the same, and many include interesting details . Now, thanks to modern technology, many of these prints have been recreated on contemporary Hawaiian shirts, rather than hiring artists to create new landscapes and floral motifs – making the mass-produced fare much cheaper. Because of this, Mr Bailey says that the original aloha shirts (those created prior to the Sixties) have a bigger financial return ‘than the stocks I pick which all uniformly go down.’

chatgpt: David Bailey, a 69-year-old resident of Honolulu, Hawaii, has spent the last three decades accumulating the largest collection of Aloha shirts in the world. Bailey's impressive collection totals over 15,000 shirts, each one meticulously curated, acquired, and preserved. Bailey's quest for Aloha shirts began in the early 1990s, when he stumbled upon a rack of vintage Hawaiian shirts at a thrift store. The vivid colors and lively patterns immediately caught his eye, and he bought a handful on impulse. From there, the collection grew exponentially, as Bailey scoured garage sales, swap meets, and estate sales across the island. Bailey's passion for Aloha shirts eventually led him to open his own boutique in Honolulu, where he sells items from his collection. The shop, which Bailey affectionately calls "The Aloha Shirt Museum," is a destination for tourists and locals alike, drawn by the unique selection of vintage and contemporary shirts that Bailey has amassed. "I never set out to start a business," Bailey says. "I was just really enthusiastic about these shirts and wanted to share my passion with others." Bailey's shop is filled with rows upon rows of carefully arranged shirts, each one meticulously organized by color, pattern, and era. The collection spans from the 1930s to the present day, with examples of every major style and trend in Aloha shirts. Aside from selling shirts, Bailey also provides an educational experience for his customers. He offers guided tours of the shop, sharing the history and cultural significance of Aloha shirts as he leads visitors through the collection. "Aloha shirts are more than just a fashion statement," Bailey explains. "They are a symbol of Hawaiian identity and culture. Each shirt tells a story, whether it's through the patterns, the colors, or the history of the designer who created it." Despite its impressive size and scope, Bailey's collection is not for sale in its entirety. He is committed to preserving the shirts and their cultural significance for future generations, and hopes to one day establish a permanent museum dedicated to Aloha shirts in Hawaii. In the meantime, Bailey continues to add to his collection and share his passion with others. He is constantly on the lookout for new finds, and takes great pleasure in tracking down rare and unique shirts that he can add to his collection. "There's always something new to discover with Aloha shirts," Bailey says. "And there's always someone else out there who is just as enthusiastic about them as I am. It's a community that I'm proud to be a part of."
