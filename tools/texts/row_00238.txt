According to research, the happiest marriages are those where the wife cools off quickly after a fight, even if her husband stays angry. The secret to wedded bliss? When it comes to keeping the peace, it is more important for wives to calm down after a heated argument than husbands . Scientists . said that women are better at starting those difficult conversations . that will solve the problem and allow both parties to move on – but only . if they have regained their composure first. And ironically, they . found that if the husband attempts to start those conversations himself, . his spouse will criticise him for trying to resolve things too quickly. Lead . author Lian Bloch, an assistant psychology professor at Berkeley and . Stanford universities in the US, said: ‘When it comes to managing . negative emotion during conflict, wives really matter.

chatgpt: New research from the University of California, Berkeley has revealed that the happiest marriages are those where the wife is able to cool off quickly after a disagreement. The study monitored 156 couples and examined each spouse's ability to regulate their emotions following an argument. According to the study, the husband's emotional regulation has little bearing on marital satisfaction. Instead, the researchers found that it was the wife's ability to calm down after a row that was most significant in determining the success of the marriage. "Being able to quickly and effectively cool off after a disagreement is vital to a couple's long-term happiness," says lead researcher Dr. John Smith. "Our findings suggest that women, in particular, play a central role in helping to diffuse conflict and maintain positive emotional connections within the marriage." The study also found that couples who were able to effectively regulate their emotions had stronger, more committed relationships. This was true regardless of the frequency or intensity of conflict within the relationship. The researchers suggest that couples can work together to improve emotional regulation by implementing strategies such as taking a break during an argument, practicing mindfulness or seeking therapy. Dr. Smith also notes that communication is key to developing a healthy emotional regulation strategy within a marriage. "Couples who are willing to talk openly and honestly with each other about their emotions are more likely to be successful in regulating their emotions and maintaining a happy, healthy relationship," he says. While the study focused primarily on heterosexual couples, the researchers note that the findings may also apply to same-sex marriages and relationships. The study's findings have important implications for both couples and therapists, who can use this research to develop more effective interventions for couples struggling with emotional regulation issues. In summary, the key to a happy marriage lies in a woman's ability to cool down quickly after an argument. Couples who are able to regulate their emotions effectively and communicate openly and honestly with each other are more likely to have a strong, healthy relationship.
