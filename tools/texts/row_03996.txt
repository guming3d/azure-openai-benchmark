article: (CNN) -- The video is as short as it is surprising. A hand tilts a glass bottle containing a red glob of ketchup, which -- instead of oozing out in slow motion or getting stuck -- slides out easily, leaving the bottle nearly spotless. Posted last week, the 20-second clip has been viewed more than 125,000 times on YouTube, prompting dozens of news stories and brightening the spirits of impatient ketchup lovers everywhere. But it's not exactly what Kripa Varanasi had in mind when he and his students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set out to develop a new kind of slippery coating that would help de-ice planes, or keep water droplets from sticking to steam turbines in power plants. "I never thought a ketchup bottle would make us this famous," said Varanasi, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. "We were all focused on [solving] the big problems, like water and energy." But one of the goals of Varanasi's MIT lab is to develop potential commercial products, not just publish research in academic journals. The coating, which he and his graduate students call LiquiGlide, seemed more immediately viable as a food-packaging product, he said. LiquiGlide is made from a secret cocktail of edible, nontoxic materials that can be sprayed into bottles or other food containers. Videos on the LiquiGlide site show it working its slippery magic on plastic bottles of jelly and mustard, too. "You could literally scratch it off and eat it," Varanasi told CNN in an interview. "It's that safe." LiquiGlide first gained attention earlier this month at MIT's $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, an annual forum for launching academic projects into the commercial marketplace, where it won an Audience Award. Now Varanasi and his students are fielding interview requests, talking to bottling companies, filing for patents and planning to launch a startup this summer. An MIT grad student, Dave Smith, will serve as CEO, Varanasi said. As Varanasi sees it, LiquiGlide offers several benefits: It's more convenient for consumers, and it makes recycling easier because the bottles are clean. It also wastes less food, because people won't be tossing out bottles coated with mustard that they can't squeeze out. He also believes LiquiGlide has practical applications beyond condiments, such as high-end cosmetics. Who wants to waste precious drops of $50 hand lotion because they can't get the stuff out of the bottle? "It works on everything we've tried so far," Smith told CNN. Varanasi and his students hope to have their product on supermarket shelves within two years. Right now they have momentum on their side, thanks to a deceptively simple idea, a niche nobody realized needed filling -- and a little video. "It just went viral," Varanasi said. "The video sold it."

chatgpt: MIT Professor Kripa Varanasi and his team of students have created a revolutionary non-stick coating that makes ketchup and other condiments slide right out of the bottle. This new innovation is called LiquiGlide, and it is made from safe and edible materials that can be sprayed into food containers. The creation of LiquiGlide began when Professor Varanasi noticed that, like many people, he struggled to get the last bit of ketchup out of the bottle, even after shaking it vigorously. In an effort to solve this problem, he and his students began experimenting with new materials that could make ketchup and other condiments glide out of the bottle with ease. After many trials and errors, the team finally developed LiquiGlide, a coating that uses "liquid-impregnated surfaces" to create a slippery barrier between the condiment and the container. This barrier prevents the condiment from sticking to the container, ensuring that every last drop can be easily squeezed out of the bottle. One of the most exciting things about LiquiGlide is that it is made from edible, nontoxic materials that are safe for human consumption. This means that it can be used in food containers without any health concerns, making it a highly sought-after product for food manufacturers and consumers alike. In fact, a video of the ketchup bottle in action has gone viral, garnering over 125,000 views on YouTube alone. The video shows a bottle of ketchup coated with LiquiGlide being tilted upside down without any of the condiment sticking to the inside of the bottle. The demonstration has impressed viewers with its simplicity and effectiveness. According to Professor Varanasi, LiquiGlide has the potential to revolutionize the food industry. It could be used in a wide range of applications, from ketchup bottles to mayonnaise containers, making it easier for consumers to get the last drop of their favorite condiments. Additionally, it could help reduce waste by ensuring that people are able to use every last bit of the product they buy. The potential uses for LiquiGlide don't stop at condiments, either. The coating could be used in a variety of other applications, such as preventing fuel from sticking to the insides of fuel tanks or making medical supplies more efficient and cost-effective. Ultimately, LiquiGlide is an exciting innovation that has the potential to transform the food industry and beyond. As Professor Varanasi and his team continue to develop and improve the coating, it will be exciting to see how it is integrated into various products and industries, ultimately making life easier and more efficient for consumers.
