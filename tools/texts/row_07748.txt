article: (CNN) -- An explosion tore through an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, triggering a fire and injuring at least 11 people, authorities said. Rescue planes and helicopters are searching for at least two crew members who are still missing. The incident happened roughly 20 miles off the coast of Grand Isle, Louisiana, on a platform used for production, not drilling. About 28 gallons of fuel spilled into the region, according to Coast Guard Response Division Chief Ed Cubanski. A half-mile oil sheen reportedly stretched near the area. The 11 injured were airlifted off the platform, and nine additional crew members were safely evacuated off the platform, according to the Coast Guard. Four of the injured were taken to West Jefferson Medical Center in Louisiana where they were listed in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN. Once they stabilized, they were scheduled to be transferred to the Baton Rouge General Burn Center. The fire has been extinguished, according to a spokesman for Black Elk Energy, the Houston-based firm in charge of the platform. Federal authorities are investigating what triggered the explosion. The incident comes a day after the Justice Department announced that oil company BP would plead guilty to manslaughter charges stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Family of killed rig workers react to BP settlement . The London-based oil giant BP has agreed to pay $4.5 billion in government penalties. Working in the oil industry is a dangerous business. The fatality rate for oil and gas workers is 15.8 deaths per 100,000 employees, according the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's nearly five times the national average. In 2011, there were 11 fatalities in the oil and gas industry, according to BLS. Most of the deaths were accidental, and criminal charges are never filed. The manslaughter charges brought against BP and two of its employees Thursday were rare. Only a handful of all workplace deaths in the United States result in criminal cases, according to the union AFL-CIO. CNNMoney's Steve Hargreaves and CNN's Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report.

chatgpt: An offshore oil production platform off the coast of Louisiana caught fire on Wednesday, leaving 11 workers injured, including four with critical burns. According to a Coast Guard official, about 28 gallons of fuel spilled during the incident, which occurred on a platform run by Houston-based Fieldwood Energy.  The platform, which is used for production and not drilling, was quickly engulfed in flames, prompting a large-scale emergency response. Workers on board scrambled to evacuate as firefighters battled the blaze, which took several hours to put out. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but Fieldwood Energy said in a statement that it appeared to have originated in the electricity-generating equipment on the platform. The company also confirmed that all workers on board had been accounted for and that the fire had been contained. "Our immediate priority is the safety and well-being of our employees and those injured in this incident," Fieldwood Energy said in the statement. "We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation and will provide updates as more information becomes available." The injured workers were airlifted to hospitals in the nearby cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge for treatment. Four of them are said to be in critical condition, while the others are being treated for less severe injuries. The incident comes at a time of increased scrutiny on offshore oil and gas operations, particularly in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 workers and caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history. The U.S. government has since implemented stricter regulations to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Fieldwood Energy said it was working closely with regulatory authorities to ensure that all safety protocols were being followed on its platforms. The company also expressed its gratitude to the emergency responders who put their lives on the line to extinguish the fire. "Our thoughts and prayers are with our employees, their families, and all those affected by this incident," the company said. "We will continue to provide support and assistance to everyone impacted as we work to fully understand what happened and how we can prevent it from happening again."
