article: A fake advert claiming Apple's new iOS 7 software makes iPhones and iPads waterproof is reported to have duped some users into breaking their devices by submerging them in water. The advert appeared on social networks, including Facebook and Twitter, earlier this week and is rumoured to have originated from online forum 4Chan. The advert shows an iPad and an iPhone 5S covered in water droplets, with the tagline: 'a smart-switch will shut off the phone's power supply and corresponding components to prevent and damage to your iPhone's delicate circuitry'. The advert, pictured, appeared on Facebook and Twitter. It made false claims that iOS 7 has a 'smart-switch' which prevents damage from water. It showed the new iPhone 5S covered in droplets with the tagline: 'Waterproofing covered by Apple's warranty policy'. The advert is believed to have originated from online forum 4Chan . Just two days after Apple's iPhone 5S handset went on sale, hackers found a way to bypass the new fingerprint sensor. They used a high-resolution photo of a fingerprint to create a laser-printed copy. Woodglue was poured onto the copy and, once dried, was peeled off and pressed onto the phone's TouchID sensor. The hackers were from German-based group Chaos Computer Club. It goes on to say that 'Waterproofing is covered by Apple's warranty policy.' The advert is said to look so much like an official Apple ad, some users have apparently trialled the feature and ultimately destroyed their handsets by getting them wet -Â  invalidating their warranties. Some have taken to Twitter, including one user who tweeted: 'Whoever said iOS 7 was waterproof **** you.' Other tweeters, such as Queen V said: 'Are people so gullible?', while Andy Porter slammed anyone who was duped as 'idiots'. Apple's iOS 7 software was released to iPhone users last Wednesday as a free upgrade. The new iPhone 5S and 5C handsets also come with iOS 7 pre-installed. There are a number of waterproof handsets on the market, including Sony's new Xperia Z1, Samsung's Galaxy S4 Active and Motorola Defy, however, Apple's handsets are not. Many warranty policies do not cover water damage, even if its accidental.

chatgpt: A fake advert has surfaced on social networks including Facebook and Twitter, claiming that Apple's latest update, the iOS 7, comes with a "smart-switch" feature that protects the phone from water damage. However, reports indicate that many users who fell for the hoax are now breaking their phones after submerging them in water. Despite the fact that the advert was exposed as a hoax shortly after it began circulating, many Apple fans were taken in by the fake claims. Social media users shared the advert with their friends and followers, with some even going as far as to test its validity by dropping their devices into the water. In response to the fiasco, Apple has issued a statement warning users not to try and submerge their iPhones in water, as the devices are not waterproof nor water-resistant. The iPhone's warranty does not cover water damage, meaning users who have fallen victim to the fake advert will be forced to pay for repairs or replacement devices out-of-pocket. Apple has also urged users to be cautious when clicking on ads or links posted on social media sites, as not all of them are genuine. Scammers often use fake ads or clickbait headlines to lure unsuspecting users into downloading malware or giving away personal information. The hoax has once again highlighted the dangers of sharing unverified information on social media, where fake news and misinformation can spread like wildfire. With over 2.8 billion active users worldwide, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are powerful tools for communication and sharing information, but they also pose significant risks. To tackle the issue, Facebook and other social media companies have implemented measures to verify the authenticity of ads and content posted on their sites. Ads and posts that violate community standards or contain false information can be reported and removed, while users who repeatedly share fake news or engage in malicious activities can be banned from the platform altogether. However, there is still much work to be done to combat the spread of misinformation on social networks. Experts recommend that users fact-check any information they come across online, and verify the source of any ads or links before clicking on them. As for the victims of the iOS 7 hoax, it serves as a painful reminder to always double-check information before sharing or acting on it. In this case, a simple Google search would have revealed that the iPhone is not waterproof, and prevented many unnecessary phone repairs or replacements. In conclusion, the fake advert claiming that Apple's iOS 7 is waterproof has been exposed as a hoax. Reports indicate that many users who fell for the scam are now breaking their phones after submerging them in water. Apple has issued a warning to users not to try and submerge their devices in water, reiterating that the iPhone is not waterproof nor water-resistant. The incident highlights the dangers of sharing unverified information on social media, and the importance of fact-checking and verifying sources.
