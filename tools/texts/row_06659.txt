article: Getting supplies to astronauts on the International Space Station can be a long, costly process and, unfortunately, UPS doesn't deliver to outer space. However, this week, thanks to Made In Space's Zero-Gravity 3-D Printer, astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore got a ratcheting socket wrench he needed uplinked --or transmitted-- to him in space, CNN reports. Since its launch in September, the 3-D printer has made a total of 21 objects aboard the ISS, according to Business Insider, those objects had previously been tested on the printer with back-up files created. Scroll down for video . Wrench: The Zero-Gravity 3-D printer aboard the International Space Station 'emailed' a ratcheting socket wrench (photographed) to outer space . On December 17, MIS designed, qualified, tested, and printed the wrench in space in less than a week, according to the MIS site. Unlike the 21 objects printed before it, the wrench's design did not exist when the printer was first launched. The wrench took four hours to print and the entire process took less than a week, CNN reports. The tool has rounded edges and finger grooves to make it 'more ergonomic and improve the grip,' according to MIS. The wrench will be returned to Earth, along with other 3-D printed parts, for observation and testing. Installed: Astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore initially installed the 3-D printer and recently received the wrench he needed from the 3-D printer . The 3-D printer is the first to operate in zero gravity, according to CNN, and printed its first object in November. The object was a part for the printer. In a news release, Niki Werkheiser, NASA's 3-D print manager, said the printer will be 'critical for exploration missions.' 'This means that we could go from having a part designed on the ground to printed in orbit within an hour to two from start to finish,' Werkheiser said. 'The on-demand capability can revolutionize the constrained supply chain model we are limited to today...' The printer will decrease cost, decrease risk, and increase efficiency, according to the news release. The process of printing an object can take anywhere from 15 minutes to hours, depending on its size and complexity. Zero-Gravity: Photographed is the Zero-Gravity 3-D printer, created by Made In Space, and launched in September . Manufacture: The printer receives a hardware code and can immediately begin manufacturing an object . The process of uplinking objects to the ISS includes designing the objects hardware, converting that hardware into a file-format the 3-D printer can read, sending the file to NASA, and, finally, transmitting the file to the ISS. The zero-gravity printer then receives the code and can begin manufacturing the object immediately. This new, innovative technology is a big step for space exploration. Normally, astronauts would wait anywhere between weeks and months for objects they needed in space. But now, thanks to the zero-gravity printer, astronauts no longer need to wait.
highlights: A zero-gravity 3-D printer manufactured a socket wrench in the International Space Station . The printer is the first of its kind and produced the wrench in less than a week . Other objects were previously printed in outer space, but the wrench was the first to be designed, tested, and printed to the ISS without previous testing .

chatgpt: In a groundbreaking moment for space technology, a zero-gravity 3-D printer manufactured a socket wrench inside the International Space Station. The printer is the first of its kind and produced the wrench in less than a week, marking a significant milestone in space exploration. Previous attempts to print objects in space were made by transporting them from Earth on mission-critical trips, but with the help of 3-D printing technology, astronauts were now able to create tools on-demand. However, the socket wrench was the first object to be designed, tested, and printed entirely aboard the ISS without prior testing. The 3-D printing process in space uses a type of plastic that transforms into a solid as soon as it is printed, avoiding any harmful emissions or toxic waste byproducts. Struggling with the limitations of traditional manufacturing methods, the astronauts aboard the ISS were thrilled to have a 3-D printer onboard to create all the necessary tools to complete their missions. NASA's goal is to eventually be able to print everything needed on a mission, including food and housing structures, eliminating the need for additional cargo. The success of the socket wrench's creation is a huge step forward in achieving that goal and further advancing space technology. The zero-gravity 3-D printer functioned without any trouble, and the wrench was printed in just five days, with the printer operated from Earth while sending the specifications to the ISS. The 3-D printer technology allowed the astronauts to create something they need from scratch, just by using a template created on Earth, reducing manufacturing and dependency issues for them on the ISS. The socket wrench is an important tool for astronauts, as it can be used to adjust loose bolts and nuts around the space station. Its creation proves how essential 3-D printing technology can be in space, enabling astronauts to create essential tools when required, without the need for transporting them from Earth. This development is not only significant for space travel but also for everyday life on Earth. The zero-gravity 3-D printer may soon be replicated on Earth, leading to more cost-effective, eco-friendly, and therefore improved manufacturing methods in industries globally. Companies who aim to reduce waste and increase cost efficiencies can consider 3-D printers as an effective method to produce tools and equipment for production in the future. In sum, the manufacturing of the socket wrench demonstrates a major breakthrough in space technology. The zero-gravity 3-D printer is a remarkable invention in the 21st century that will transform space manufacturing processes for the better. The possibility of 3-D printers someday printing everything needed on a mission reduces unnecessary transportations and team dependency, potentially building safer space travel. The creation of the socket wrench in space sets the groundwork for the use of 3-D printing technology in industries worldwide, enabling cost-effective and eco-friendly manufacturing methods.
