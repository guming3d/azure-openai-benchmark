New York's JFK Airport may deal with some of the fastest planes in the sky, but its runways are at risk from being put out of use by some of the slowest creatures on earth: turtles. The airport is located alongside Jamaica Bay and has been plagued in recent years by turtles, which have started to cross over runways as they attempt to find a nesting ground. During last year’s mating season airport employees had to carry 1,300 turtles off the tarmac to safety.

The turtles have become a slow-moving nuisance to the airport, causing runway closures and delays for passengers. The airport is already running at capacity as it tries to move 47 million passengers every year in and out of the complex swiftly. In an effort to keep the planes running on time and the turtles safe, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials are installing piping along runways to keep the turtles out.

Project: The airport is going to install 4,000ft of plastic piping along the runway that runs closest to the bay in an effort to prevent turtles from crossing the massive runways . Turtle power: Last year there were 1,600 turtles that had to be carried off the runways to safety. Not only are their lives at risk but a turtle could do serious damage to an aircraft engine . 'We’re trying to find a balance between nature and aviation,' Port Authority spokesman Ron Marsico told the New York Post. 'We don’t want to see the turtles get hurt, and this should keep the airport running smoothly.' The airport will install 4,000 feet of 8-inch plastic piping along the runway 4L which runs closest to the bay. The barrier will apparently come just in time: The Port Authority’s Twitter account recently posted a few photos of 200 turtles that were cleared from the area.

chatgpt: Turtles crawling onto the tarmac at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York is becoming a recurrent problem in the airport's efforts to keep flight schedules running smoothly. According to airport authorities, dozens of flights were delayed because a group of turtles crawled onto the tarmac in search of beaches to lay their eggs. This situation has caused immense inconvenience to passengers and resulted in significant financial loss for airlines operating from the airport. The airport authorities revealed that turtles crawling on the runway pose a significant risk to the safety of aircraft and passengers, as they can cause engine damage or other problems leading to accidents. Therefore, the problem requires urgent attention to mitigate the risks involved. Following the incident, the airport authorities announced their plan to build a barrier that would stop the turtles from entering the runways. The move was welcomed by airline companies as it would protect their planes from the damage that turtles and other wildlife on airport grounds can cause. The authorities will be collaborating with the New York State DEC, the Port Authority of New York, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure the safety of flights and passengers. Furthermore, the airport authorities urged airport staff to be extra vigilant when on-duty and to report immediately any sighting of turtles or other wildlife in the airport area. “The safety of the passengers and crew is our topmost priority, and we will continue to explore ways to prevent any wildlife from interfering with the smooth functioning of the airport,” said the airport official. The airport authorities emphasized that despite the inconvenience caused, they would take measures to ensure that no harm would come to any wildlife in the process of building the barrier or removing the turtles. This problem, while significant, is not unique to JFK International Airport, as many airports around the world have faced similar situations. A solution is being developed by several airports, including the use of lights or sounds that repel the animals and electronic fences to prevent them from entering certain areas. In conclusion, while turtles crawling onto airport tarmacs may seem like an amusing or harmless occurrence, it poses real dangers to flight safety, passengers, and the animals themselves. The move by the JFK International Airport authorities to build a barrier to prevent the entry of turtles on the runway is a significant step towards preventing accidents and huge financial losses.
