chatgpt: A young woman from Pearland, Texas, is facing serious charges after being arrested for the possession of child pornography. Julia Lack, 26, was charged with one count of child porn possession after police found memory cards that allegedly contained illicit material. The arrest came after Lack's boyfriend, Tad Jeremy Costin, was arrested on November 1st. Police received a tip that Costin, who had recently moved out of his home, had left boxes behind that contained concerning material. Officers found memory cards in the boxes, which were then analyzed by a forensic team. It was concluded that the memory cards contained child pornography, and police believe that some images date back as far as 1990. The victims in the images have not been identified at this time. While Costin has been arrested in connection with the case, Lack was also charged after admitting to police that she had knowledge of the material found on the memory cards. Child pornography is a serious crime, and those caught in possession of such material can face significant penalties. In Texas, possession of child pornography is considered a third-degree felony, which can result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of up to $10,000. The arrest of Lack and Costin highlights the importance of reporting suspicious behavior to authorities. If it were not for the tip about Costin's boxes, it is possible that this material might never have been discovered, and the victims in these images may have continued to suffer in silence. For now, police are working to determine the extent of the material found on the memory cards and to identify any further victims. The investigation is ongoing, and further charges may be brought against Lack and Costin if new evidence comes to light. As this case unfolds, it serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and reporting when it comes to crimes involving children. By working together and staying aware, we can help put a stop to these heinous acts and bring justice to those who have been victimized.
