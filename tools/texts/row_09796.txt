article: (CNN)  -- Rwandan troops have crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo to prepare for a joint operation with Congolese forces against a Hutu militia, the United Nations said. At least 800,000 people are thought to have died during 100 days of violence in Rwanda in 1994. "We can tell you there are Rwandan soldiers here, but I cannot confirm the numbers," said Madnodje Mounoubai, spokesman for the U.N. mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Rwandans will team up "with the Congolese forces," he said Wednesday. "The Rwandan forces are in a meeting with Congolese forces and the understanding is that in the meeting they are preparing a joint operation against the FDLR," or the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda. The Rwanda News Agency reported that Rwanda has dispatched 1,917 soldiers. Rwanda and Congo traditionally have been on different sides of the conflict in eastern Congo. The struggle pits ethnic Tutsis, supported by Rwanda, against ethnic Hutu, backed by Congo. The conflict is effectively an extension of the Rwandan genocide dating back to the early 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were killed in ethnic battles between minority Tutsi and majority Hutu. According to a statement issued last week by the Rwandan government, the joint military operation is aimed at driving out the FDLR and former members of the Interhamwe militia, "remnants of those who spearheaded the 1994 genocide against Tutsis." Michael Arunga, a Kenya-based spokesman for the World Vision aid organization, said his colleagues in Goma -- a city in eastern Congo -- told him that Rwandan troops arrived Tuesday morning in the village of Ishsha, outside of Goma. Arunga said he had no knowledge of Rwandan troops being in Congo before. A U.N. statement said the FDLR has been involved in clashes since late August mainly in North Kivu, "where the national army, the mainly Tutsi militia -- known as the CNDP -- and other rebel groups ... have fought in shifting alliances, uprooting around 250,000 civilians on top of the 800,000 already displaced by violence in recent years."

Security Council panel last month said Rwanda and Congo were fighting a brutal proxy war for territory and precious natural resources in eastern Congo, and all parties involved in the conflict were using execution, rape and child soldiers as tools of war. The report, filed by a panel of U.N. experts, "found evidence that Rwandan authorities have sent officers and units of the Rwanda Defense Forces" into Congo in support of Congo rebel leader Laurent Nkunda's fighters. CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Rwanda has sent around 1,900 soldiers to the east Congo to help fight against the Hutu rebellion, the Rwanda News Agency reported on Monday.   This move represents a significant increase in the number of Rwandan troops in the region, where fighting between the Tutsis, supported by Rwanda, and the Congo-backed Hutu has been ongoing for more than two decades. The conflict is effectively an extension of the Rwandan genocide, which erupted in 1994 when Rwanda's Hutu-dominated government launched a coordinated campaign of violence against the Tutsi minority. The violence left at least 800,000 people dead. Since then, the two neighboring countries have been on different sides of the conflict in east Congo. Rwanda has supported Tutsi rebels, while Congo has backed Hutu groups. The complex conflict has been fueled by ethnic tensions, competition for resources, and regional power struggles. According to the Rwanda News Agency, the additional troops were dispatched to help the Congolese army fight against armed groups in the region. It is not yet clear what specific operations the Rwandan soldiers will be involved in, but their presence is expected to have a significant impact on the situation in the east Congo. The move was welcomed by some observers, who believe that the Rwandan troops will help strengthen the Congolese army and improve its capability to fight against armed groups in the region. However, others have expressed concern that the move could escalate tensions between the two countries and trigger another round of violence. The presence of Rwandan troops in the east Congo is a sensitive issue, given the historical tensions between the two countries. In recent years, there have been allegations that Rwanda has been supporting Tutsi rebels in the region, something that Rwanda has vehemently denied. The deployment of the Rwandan soldiers comes at a time when the east Congo is experiencing a surge in violence. Armed groups, including the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), have been carrying out attacks in the region, resulting in the displacement of thousands of people. In a statement, the United Nations Mission in Congo (MONUSCO) welcomed the deployment of the Rwandan soldiers and called for an end to the ongoing violence in the region. The UN has been working closely with the Congolese army to help bring stability to the east Congo and has been advocating for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In conclusion, the deployment of Rwandan troops to the east Congo represents a significant development in the ongoing conflict in the region. While some observers are hopeful that their presence will help improve the situation, others are concerned that it could escalate tensions and trigger more violence. The situation in the east Congo remains complex and requires a long-term solution that addresses the underlying causes of the conflict.
