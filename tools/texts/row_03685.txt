article: Washington (CNN) -- An increase in the number of brazen laser attacks on planes in the United States has reached an "epidemic level." According to an FBI blog post, the number of incidents is projected to reach 3,700 by the end of the year, compared to just 283 in 2005, a rise of more than 1,100%. Last year, there were 3,592 reported laser incidents, the FAA said. The FBI cited the Internet as a source for cheap, easy to purchase hand-held gadgets about the size of fountain pens which have become more powerful in recent years. Lasers costing as little as a dollar can have ranges of 2 miles, the FBI said. Incidents on the rise, harsh penalties sought . The number of attacks is reaching an "epidemic level," said George Johnson, a supervisory federal air marshal who is a liaison officer with the FBI. Lasers directed at aircraft can cause temporary blindness to pilots for a few seconds, posing risks during takeoffs and landings. "Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft is dangerous and reckless. Just don't do it," Johnson said. Those who intentionally aim a laser at an aircraft can be prosecuted under two federal statutes, including a law put into effect this year that makes it punishable by up to five years in prison and $11,000 per violation without the benefit of a warning notice or counseling. An existing law allows punishment up to 20 years in prison and fines of $250,000. Russian airliners targeted by 'laser hooligans' Michael Huerta, acting FAA administrator, is on record as saying his department will "aggressively" prosecute violators. Laser incident reports have increased steadily since the FAA created a formal reporting system in 2005 to collect information from pilots. In 2011, the FBI said those responsible for "lasering" aircraft fall into two general profiles, either minors with no criminal history or older men with criminal records. Human traffickers or drug runners have also sought "to thwart airborne surveillance," according to the FBI.

chatgpt: According to a new report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the number of laser attacks on aircraft is expected to reach a staggering 3,700 by the end of the year. This worrying projection has been attributed to the easy accessibility of hand-held gadgets capable of emitting harmful laser beams, which are widely available on the internet. The FBI has warned of the grave consequences that can result from such incidents, as lasers directed at aircraft can cause temporary blindness for pilots, thereby creating a dangerous situation that could risk the lives of passengers and crew onboard. The report recommends the adoption of stringent measures to curb such attacks, including the need for tougher penalties for perpetrators. Hand-held lasers are increasingly becoming popular among mischievous individuals seeking to cause disturbance and chaos at airports. Despite the potential danger posed by such laser pointers, they remain easily accessible online, as they can be purchased at cheap prices from various online retailers. The FBI report noted that the majority of these incidents occurred near large airport hubs, where the volume of air traffic is high. The report also expressed concern that some of these attacks could be escalating into more sinister and coordinated campaigns, necessitating the need for more vigilance and surveillance. The aviation industry has been working towards enhancing safety measures to counter the threat of laser attacks. For instance, some airlines have installed laser-proof shields on their cockpit windows to prevent the laser beam from penetrating into the cockpit, thus keeping the pilots safe. The FAA has also rolled out awareness campaigns and training programs for pilots to help them better understand the risks and implications of laser attacks. These training programs aim to raise awareness among pilots on how to identify potential laser attacks and the appropriate measures to take in such cases. In conclusion, the message from the FBI is clear, laser attacks on planes are a serious crime, and perpetrators of such acts will face the full force of the law. It is essential for individuals to think twice before using such gadgets, which can cause harm to innocent people and create chaos in public places, particularly at airports. The aviation industry and law enforcement agencies need to work together to enhance safety measures and improve surveillance to prevent these attacks from happening.
