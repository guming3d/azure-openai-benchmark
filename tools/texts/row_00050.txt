article: (CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country will show its support to the revolution on February 11. "Our revolution has changed the patterns and the equations of the world," he said in a nationally televised interview. Ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the Ten Days of Dawn, which lead up to the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. He said that enemies who plotted against Iran during the election protests last year continue to plot, but despite all the economic sanctions on the country, they are not succeeding. "This year, they have mobilized themselves again to harm the Iranian nation and to stop them, but they failed," he said, adding that the capitalist powers who are against Iran have peaked. Specifically, he cited the United States and United Kingdom as nations that have tried to interfere with Iran's domestic issues. "They adopted their stances, and they failed," Ahmadinejad said. "This is a clear defeat for them." On the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad said that Iran seeks such production for peaceful purposes only. The United States and other nations have expressed concern that Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons. The same countries who doubt Iran could, instead, partner with Iran and build the nuclear plants themselves if they wanted, he said. "Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts to build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course, if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point [where we will] build our own power plant," he said. The Iranian leader also mentioned the three American hikers who have been detained, saying that negotiations are ongoing. "We don't like anyone in jail or in prison, but these people have violated our borders, and it has a defined penalty," he said, adding that there are Iranians "languishing within American jails." He hinted at a possible prisoner swap. "We are approaching this from a humanitarian perspective and see how it goes," Ahmadinejad said. U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said the United States is prepared to answer any questions about Iranians in U.S. custody. "It's hard to know what he meant from these fragmentary comments, but we have made clear that we want consular access to our citizens in Iranian custody," Duguid said. "If President Ahmadinejad's comments suggest that they are prepared to grant us access through the Swiss and resolve the cases of the three hikers and others in custody, we would welcome that step. It is long overdue." CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.

chatgpt: As Iran prepares to mark the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on February 11, tensions with the United States and United Kingdom are on the rise. In a nationally televised interview on Tuesday, Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accused the two countries of trying to interfere in Iran's affairs. Ahmadinejad's comments came amid ongoing negotiations for the release of three American hikers who have been detained in Iran since July 31. The hikers, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal, and Sarah Shourd, were arrested for allegedly crossing into Iran illegally while hiking in a mountainous area near the Iraqi border. Despite repeated appeals from the United States for their release, the Iranian government has refused to free the hikers, citing ongoing investigations into their case. Ahmadinejad, however, suggested in his interview that the hikers could be released soon. "We have ongoing negotiations, and I think these issues will be resolved," he said. The Iranian leader also accused the United States and United Kingdom of trying to meddle in Iran's affairs. "They want to interfere in the affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, but they will not be able to achieve their goals," he said. Ahmadinejad's remarks were likely aimed at the United States and United Kingdom's recent efforts to apply pressure on the Iranian government. Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions against Iran's ballistic missile program, while the U.K. froze the assets of an Iranian bank accused of funding terrorism. The tension between the two sides is unlikely to abate anytime soon, with both the U.S. and U.K. continuing to take a hardline stance on Iran. In a recent speech, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Iran that it would face "consequences" if it failed to meet its international obligations, while British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the U.K. would not hesitate to take action against the Iranian government if necessary. Despite the tough talk from both sides, there is hope that the upcoming anniversary of the Islamic Revolution could provide an opportunity for a diplomatic breakthrough. Known as the Ten Days of Dawn, the lead-up to February 11 is typically marked by rallies and celebrations across Iran, and could provide a platform for both sides to engage in dialogue and ease tensions. For now, the fate of the imprisoned American hikers remains uncertain. While Ahmadinejad's comments suggest that negotiations for their release are ongoing, it is unclear when or if they will be freed. As the U.S. and Iran continue to clash over a wide range of issues, it remains to be seen whether a resolution can be found.
