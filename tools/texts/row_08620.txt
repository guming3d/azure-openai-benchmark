article: A playground dealer was charged with supply class A drugs at an infant, junior or primary school in 2013, according for figures released as part of a Freedom of Information request . Drug dealers sold heroin and amphetamines outside an Essex primary school, it has been revealed. The dealer was charged with supplying the class A narcotic in 2013, according to figures released by Essex Police as part of a  Freedom of Information request. The figures come just weeks after it was revealed in parliament that one primary school age pupil  is suspended every week for being drunk or high on drugs. The figures released  last month showed that in 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs. The Department for Education said it included alcohol abuse, drug dealing, inappropriate use of prescribed drugs, possession of illegal drugs, smoking and substance abuse. There are 39 weeks in the average school year, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 is suspended every week. At secondary school the situation is even worse, with 6,500 pupils excluded in 2012-13. Tory MP Andrew Griffiths, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline:'It is deeply worrying that so many children appear at school under the influence.' As part of a Freedom of Information request Essex Police confirmed it had investigated a total of 122 drug offences at schools in the county since 2010. They also dished out a warning for possession of cannabis at a nursery or creche in 2012. In 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 was suspended every week during term-time . In each instance the school has not been identified and the force has been unable to say exactly who was involved. A total of 32 offences were committed by youths and all but 15 involved the possession of cannabis. More than half  were dealt with by a reprimand, caution or warning, while a further 25 received some form of community resolution. In 17 case someone was charged. At secondary schools, 6,500 pupils were temporarily excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that parents and teachers are 'losing the battle' against substance abuse . Nick Alston, Police and Crime Commissioner for Essex, said: 'It is disturbing to see evidence of any drug-related activities taking place in educational establishments. 'However, it would be naive to believe this doesn't go on as, for many years, some young people have been tempted to experiment with drugs.' Ray Gooding, Essex county councillor for education, said: 'The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of the utmost importance. 'We work with schools throughout Essex, along with partner agencies, to educate pupils on drug misuse. 'However, we are not complacent and as these figures demonstrate, there is still work to be done.'

chatgpt: A drug dealer has been charged with selling heroin outside an Essex primary school, according to police reports released this week. The information was obtained through a recent Freedom of Information request that revealed the incident took place in 2013. The news has left parents in the area feeling concerned and outraged. The unnamed dealer was allegedly caught selling the illicit substance within close proximity to a primary school, despite the obvious danger this posed to young children in the area. It is believed that the dealer was targeted by Essex Police as part of a larger operation against drug dealing and related criminal activity. The shocking incident highlights an alarming trend, as recent figures reveal that a worrying number of children in England are being excluded from school due to alcohol and substance abuse. According to the research obtained through a Freedom of Information request, over 40 youngsters aged between 5 and 11 were excluded from school in England in the last year due to issues with drugs or alcohol. In some cases, children have been caught smoking or drinking during school hours, while others have been involved in drug dealing or in possession of illegal substances. What’s perhaps most concerning is that these incidents are not isolated – there have been reports of around one case per week, during term time, of children being excluded for substance abuse or related offences. Speaking about the revelations, education experts have noted that the statistics are a worrying indication of a growing problem in the UK. Many believe that more needs to be done to address issues with addiction and substance abuse, with greater support and education provided in schools to help young people understand the risks associated with drug and alcohol use. Some parents have also called for greater vigilance and action from local authorities and law enforcement, particularly in areas where drug dealing and other criminal activity is known to be a problem. The recent incident outside the Essex primary school highlights just how dangerous these situations can be, and how quickly they can escalate without swift and decisive action from the relevant authorities. Despite the concerns raised by the latest statistics, there are a number of organisations and initiatives working to address issues around substance abuse and addiction in young people. Many charities and community groups are dedicated to providing support and resources to help children and families affected by these issues, while schools across the country are increasingly adopting preventative education programmes aimed at tackling substance misuse among students. While there is no easy solution to the problem of substance abuse in young people, it is clear that greater awareness, education and support are key to addressing this growing trend. With the help of committed individuals and organisations working together, it is hoped that we can create a safer and healthier future for the next generation.
