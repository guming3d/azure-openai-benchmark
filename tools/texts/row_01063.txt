Sven Sachsalber spent 48 hours sifting through a giant pile of hay dumped in at the  Palais de Tokyo gallery in Paris. In the pile of hay he searched for a needle hidden deep in its centre by the prestigious modern art gallery's president Jean de Loisy. Italian artist Sven Sachsalber begins in search for a needle in a haystack in the Palais de Tokyo . The meticulous and uncertain process of searching for a needle in a haystack begins . Sachsalber says the 'art installation' is something easy to understand for the general public . De Loisy says the installation isn't just a man taking on the ultimate hide-and-seek challenge as it explored the complex relationship between words and actions, juxtaposing metaphors for the immensely small and the incomprehensibly large and complex . 'I don't think there is anyone, regardless of whether they like modern art or not, who would not be intrigued by this childish question -- can it actually be done, or is "Searching for a needle in a haystack" simply a turn of phrase?' De Loisy said. Palais de Tokyo gallery president Jean de Loisy holds the needle he would bury in the haystack . De Loisy dives into the haystack to ensure Sachsalber's search isn't simple . De Loisy shows his commitment to the artistic statement in the modern and contemporary gallery . The two-day timeframe was set as a limit since Sachsalber could have simply taken minutes to find the needle, though that was considered unlikely. Sachsalber said that the project was a practical one that the general public would find accessible. He said: 'It's like playing the lottery, so you don't know if you're going to win or not, you hope you're going to win otherwise why play the lottery? And it's the same thing here, even if it's hard I think, because it's itchy, this hay, and I have it everywhere after a few hours, but it's fun at the same time. 'And it's very accessible, I think you don't really need to understand much about art or whatever, just everyone knows what it is,' he said. The giant pile of hay is a prominent feature in the vast Parisian gallery . Although he avoids the label 'performance artist', Sachsalber has a history of engaging in unusual, even dangerous, activities in the name of art. 'I have never considered myself as a conceptual artist, other people did,' he said. His escapades include eating a highly toxic wild mushroom, spending 24 hours in a room with a cow, cutting down a tree he was precariously perched on and climbing over gravestones pretending to be a squirrel. 'Even though it might look stupid, I just want to test out these things,' he said.

chatgpt: Artist Sven Sachsalber recently embarked on a unique artistic pursuit in Paris. The New York-based Italian set out to search for a needle in a haystack at the Palais de Tokyo gallery. Sachsalber spent a grueling 48 hours sifting through the large pile of grass, determined to find the elusive needle. This was an installation piece that explored the complex relationship between words and actions. The Palais de Tokyo gallery is one of the largest art centers in Paris and is renowned for its avant-garde exhibitions. The gallery's President, Jean de Loisy, is known for his bold and innovative ideas when it comes to curating shows. This time around, he wanted to push the boundaries even further and came up with the idea of hiding a needle in a haystack. Sachsalber was chosen to be the artist to carry out the unique art piece. The performance artist is no stranger to pushing his body to the limits. One of his past works involves him sitting in front of a gallery and attempting to stay awake for 24 hours straight. The installation piece began on the 19th of April and lasted for 48 hours. Sachsalber spent the entire time searching through the pile of hay with a magnifying glass, determined to find the needle. Throughout this intense process, he was watched by hundreds of visitors who came to witness the unique artwork. Some even offered to help Sachsalber search through the haystack in their quest for the needle. Although Sachsalber's dedication and commitment to his artistic pursuit were admirable, he was ultimately unsuccessful in finding the needle. However, the very fact that the needle was hidden in the haystack also serves as a reflection of life itself. We are all searching for that one elusive thing in life, whether it be love, success or happiness. It emphasizes the path we take on the journey to find that one thing that eludes us. De Loisy stated that the unusual artwork was a perfect example of how words and actions are not always congruent. While the statement "finding a needle in a haystack" is often used in the context of a difficult task, the task itself turned out to be even more arduous than anyone could have imagined. The installation piece also brings into question other issues such as determination, commitment, and endurance. Sachsalber's performance is a stark reminder of how, in today's fast-paced world, we often give up too easily when faced with hardship. Endurance and perseverance are qualities that are often necessary to achieve excellence. In conclusion, Sachsalber's performance art piece at the Palais de Tokyo gallery was both thought-provoking and inspiring. It was a testament to the power of art in making us think, feel and question our realities. Through Sachsalber's artistic pursuit, we are reminded of the importance of endurance, perseverance, and the journey we take in searching for that which eludes us.
