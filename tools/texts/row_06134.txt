article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Members of the military may get expedited treatment at airport security checkpoints under a law signed Tuesday by President Obama. The law, authored by Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minnesota, requires the Transportation Security Administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families, when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders. Cravaack, a 24-year Navy veteran and former Northwest Airlines pilot, was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. "It seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country," said the congressman's spokesman, Michael Bars. The new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in North Carolina and Texas. According to court records, Trey Scott Atwater, a 30-year-old Army Green Beret, had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve headed for Texas. He was allowed to continue on his trip. On Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. Authorities said Atwater did not have a detonator and initiator, that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives, and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious. It was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like Atwater's. Bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening, but not reduce security. Currently, the TSA expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them, and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags. The new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary. In November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members. The TSA was starting to tests its ability to scan military ID cards, known as "Common Access Cards," at a regional airport in Monterey, CA. Pistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. But if tests are successful, "we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them," he said. Supporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel, the TSA will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk."

chatgpt: President Obama signed a new law on Tuesday that requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to study ways to speed up the screening process of military personnel. This law was designed to improve efficiency in security checks for military men and women who are traveling through airports, and aims to reduce wait times for these individuals.  The TSA has already begun testing a new method of screening for military personnel involving card scanning. This expedited process allows military personnel to be identified and cleared through security faster, which in turn will allow the TSA to focus on higher-risk passengers. The supporters of this new law argue that it will help make air travel a smoother and more efficient experience for everyone involved.  The TSA will be conducting a thorough review of its current screening procedures for military personnel to identify areas where changes can be made to improve efficiency. The goal is to create a seamless process that allows military personnel to move through screening quickly, without compromising security. The TSA will also be working closely with military officials to ensure that any new procedures are in alignment with established military protocols.  The new law has drawn strong support from military officials and lawmakers alike. Congressman John Lewis, who co-sponsored the bill, praised the new legislation as a step towards better support of our military personnel. "Our military men and women put their lives on the line for us every day. They deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and this law will help ensure that they are not unnecessarily delayed or mistreated when traveling through airports." The TSA has been under criticism in recent years for its screening procedures, which some have argued are overly invasive and time-consuming. This new law is seen as a way to address these concerns by streamlining procedures for military personnel, and allowing the TSA to focus on other high-risk passengers.  The new card scanning method is particularly efficient because it eliminates the need for verbal confirmation of identity by a TSA agent, which can be time-consuming and prone to error. The new system is also designed to be more secure, as it relies on electronic identification instead of potentially fallible human judgment.  Overall, this new law is seen as an important step forward in improving the travel experience for military personnel. It represents a commitment by lawmakers and TSA officials to make air travel a more efficient and streamlined experience, while still maintaining the highest levels of security. Military personnel can now expect to enjoy faster screening times and smoother travel experiences.
