chatgpt: A 20-year-old man has been accused of brutally murdering a mother and daughter at their home in Indianapolis on December 20. The suspect, Christian Rene Haley, had worked for the husband and father of the victims, Todd Erb, for three months before being fired for attendance issues. He has since been charged with two counts of murder, burglary, and theft. According to court documents, Haley told a friend that he had "bashed their heads in with some cement" before stealing jewelry, an iPhone, and two debit cards from the home of the victims, Marylyn Erb, 52, and Kelley Erb, 23. The murder has shocked the community of Westfield, where the Erb family was well-known and respected. Todd Erb, the husband and father of the victims, expressed his grief and disbelief, saying: "We're just heartbroken. They were just innocent, wonderful people who didn't deserve this." Police arrived at the Erb home around 2:30 pm on December 20 after receiving a report of a suspicious person. When they entered the house, they found the bodies of Marylyn and Kelley Erb, both of whom had suffered blunt force trauma to the head. The stolen items were also recovered from the scene. Haley was arrested a few days later after police obtained surveillance footage that showed him near the Erb home at the time of the murder. He was taken into custody and later admitted to the crime during questioning. The motive for the murders remains unclear, although police believe that Haley's termination from his job may have played a role. It is unclear whether he knew the Erb family personally or if the crime was a random act of violence. Since his arrest, Haley has been held without bail at the Hamilton County Jail. He is set to appear in court on January 13 for a preliminary hearing. The Erb family has been remembered as a loving and close-knit group by those who knew them. Community members have come together to support the family during this difficult time, with several fundraisers and memorials planned in their honor. The tragedy has left a deep impact on the Westfield community, with many expressing shock and sorrow over the senseless violence that claimed the lives of two innocent women. As the investigation continues, authorities are urging anyone with information on the case to come forward and help bring justice for the Erb family.
