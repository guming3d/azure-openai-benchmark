Mesut Ozil has confirmed he injured his hamstring after just two minutes in Arsenal's Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich and faces six weeks on the sidelines.

Arsene Wenger predicted on Tuesday night that the playmaker would be out for 'at least a few weeks' and said he would know more after further tests on Wednesday.

chatgpt: Arsenal's German playmaker, Mesut Ozil, revealed on Facebook that he suffered a hamstring injury during their recent 2-0 defeat against Bayern Munich. Ozil disclosed that he felt the injury just two minutes into the match, but remained on the pitch until half-time. The injury comes as a huge blow to Arsenal as Ozil is an integral part of their midfield. The Gunners are set to face tough fixtures against Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Manchester City, with Ozil now expected to miss all three games. Arsenal's season has been plagued by injuries, with several key players, including Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey, all spending long periods on the sidelines. The news of Ozil's injury is likely to add to the team's woes, especially as they chase a top-four finish and FA Cup glory. Ozil's absence is likely to be felt in the FA Cup semi-final against Championship side, Wigan Athletic. The Latics famously beat Manchester City in last year's final, and will be looking to cause another upset against Arsenal. While the Gunners will be favourites to progress to the final, the absence of Ozil will undoubtedly make their task more challenging. The 29-year-old has been one of Arsenal's most consistent performers this season, contributing four goals and eight assists in 26 appearances. His creativity and vision have been instrumental in helping Arsenal climb to third place in the Premier League, and booking a place in the FA Cup semi-finals. Ozil's injury is also a major setback for the German national team. The midfielder has been a key player for Die Mannschaft, helping them win the 2014 World Cup. He will now miss Germany's upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Belarus and Northern Ireland. In his Facebook post, Ozil expressed his disappointment at the injury and apologized to Arsenal fans for not being able to help the team during the Bayern Munich game. He also thanked fans for their support and promised to work hard on his recovery. Arsenal fans will be hoping that Ozil's injury is not too serious and that he will be back in action soon. The next few weeks will be crucial for the Gunners as they look to secure Champions League qualification and FA Cup success. However, they will have to do it without their star playmaker, who is set to miss several important games.
