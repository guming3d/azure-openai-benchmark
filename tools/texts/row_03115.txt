article: A wildlife operation involving dozens of countries and organizations, seized more than three tons of ivory and a bevy of rare wildlife products as well as rare wood. Operatives found rare animals -- both living and dead -- during the international, month-long operation. The China-led transnational effort, codenamed Cobra II, aimed to crack down on illegal wildlife trade. Authorities recovered over 10,000 live European eels and pig-nosed turtles, as well as over 2,000 live snakes, according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. They also seized three tons of ivory, 36 rhino horns, and over 1,000 hides and skins from tigers, leopards and snakes as well as several hundred kilograms of pangolin scales from wildlife traffickers. The operation included 27 other countries including the United States. The effort had the support from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the World Customs Organization and Interpol, reported Xinhua. During the operation, China's law enforcement officials suspected a Chinese man of being the head of an ivory trafficking group after customs staff at Taoxian Airport in northeast China found luggage containing 1,226 ivory beads, according to Xinhua. Both Chinese and Kenyan police cooperated in the investigation and suspected that the man, whose last name was reported as Xue, operated a crime ring buying, transporting and selling ivory. Xue was arrested in Nairobi, Kenya on January 17 and extradited to China, the news agency reported. His arrest marks the first time China has arrested a wildlife crime suspect overseas, the report said. The Cobra II operation lasted from December 30 to January 26. It will "serve as a valuable model for the international community in future operations against transnational crimes," said Wan Ziming, director of the law enforcement department under the endangered species office in Xinhua. The efforts uncovered over 200 cases with more than 250 suspects, according to Xinhua. China accounts for around 70% of the global demand for ivory, which is known as "white gold" in the country. China has been under pressure to take more action to protect rare and endangered species and to fight the illegal trade. China appears to have redoubled efforts tackling the ivory trade -- it destroyed 6.15 tons of ivory in January.

chatgpt: In a stunning wildlife operation that involved broad international collaboration, Chinese authorities have seized tons of illegal animal products, including thousands of live eels, turtles, and snakes. The operation was carried out in multiple locations across the country and was led by China's Ministry of Public Security. According to reports, the operation succeeded in confiscating over 10,000 live eels and Asia turtles, as well as more than 2,000 live snakes. Many of these animals are highly prized in the illegal wildlife trade and are often smuggled across borders for sale in other countries. The operation was supported by a range of international partners, including the Wildlife Justice Commission, which provided valuable intelligence and information that helped authorities target key players in the illegal trade. In addition, the operation received a boost from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, which provided logistical and technical support. Speaking about the operation, Liu Yanhua of the Ministry of Public Security praised the efforts of all those involved. "This operation shows the power of international cooperation and the determination of the Chinese government to combat the illegal wildlife trade," she said. "We will continue to work with our partners to crack down on this heinous crime and protect our planet's precious wildlife." The illegal wildlife trade is a major problem around the world, with millions of animals killed or captured each year and sold for use in traditional medicine, exotic pets, or luxury goods. In China, the trade has been a particular concern, with a long history of traditional medicine and high demand for rare and exotic animals. In recent years, however, the Chinese government has taken steps to crack down on the trade and has stepped up efforts to protect endangered species. This has included the implementation of new laws and regulations designed to curb the trade and better protect wildlife. Despite these efforts, however, the illegal wildlife trade continues to be a major problem in China and around the world. As such, authorities say they will continue to work together with international partners to combat the trade and protect the world's endangered animals.  In conclusion, the successful wildlife operation in China led by the Ministry of Public Security, with international support, has dealt a significant blow to the illegal wildlife trade. The confiscation of thousands of live eels, Asia turtles and snakes, sends a strong signal to smugglers that the world is united against animal trafficking. It is encouraging to see China showing leadership in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade and taking the issue seriously. The global community will continue to work together to combat this heinous crime and preserve our planet's biodiversity.
