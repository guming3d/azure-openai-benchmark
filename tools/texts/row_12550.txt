Police are warning swimmers to be on their guard after a great white shark was spotted just 200 yards of the Florida coast. The shark, which goes by the name Mary Lee, is 16 feet long and weighs 3,456 pounds. Together with another great white, called Genie, both sharks have been fitted with electronic tags to keep track of them. However the tags haven't been fitted by local police concerned about swimmers' safety, instead a nonprofit organization is tracking the sharks for altogether different reasons. Great white shark Mary Lee was briefly captured last September so researchers could insert an electronic tag in her . Mary Lee was fitted with electronic tag last September to enable Ocearch to track her . Last September, researchers from Ocearch, which studies oceans and fish, embarked on a project to tag two sharks off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The purpose of the project is to learn more about how the sharks live and their breeding habits in order to better protect them. This week, three months after their tagging, much to the surprise of the scientists both Mary Lee and Genie were spotted swimming off the coast of Nassau County. ‘It's really odd to me that we only tagged two sharks in Cape Cod,’ Ocearch's chairman Chris Fischer told Fox 35. ‘And both of those sharks are off Jacksonville. That's 100 percent of our sample size.’ The online shark tracker tool enables users to track the whereabouts of both Mary Lee and Genie . With 73 million sharks killed every year for human consumption, Fisher is hoping the project will help create awareness about these giant creatures. Scientists have long suspected that sharks swam south for the winter and researchers are predicting that both will stay in the warm Florida waters for the winter. Police are urging swimmers and surfers to remain vigilant and not to get too close. There is even an online tool on the Ocearch website that enables people to keep track of the whale’s movements. Much to the surprise of scientists, both Mary Lee and Genie have been spotted swimming off the coast of Nassau County, Florida . Ocearch chairman Chris Fischer is plesantly surprised that both of the tagged sharks have ended up swimming to Florida for the winter .

chatgpt: In September, two great white sharks were caught and tagged near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The two sharks, Mary Lee and Genie, have been known to repeatedly take the same trek south to Florida for the winter season. These creatures were tagged by scientists for the purpose of understanding their behavior and movements. Using tracking tools, animal behaviorists will be able to carefully monitor and analyze the migration patterns of these great whites, providing further insight into their habits. Mary Lee, the female great white shark, was caught and tagged in September 2012. Since then, she has been seen annually migrating south for the winter season. Her migration journey spans 2,000 miles from Cape Cod all the way down to Florida. Each year, she consistently follows the same path with calculated precision, a habit that has intrigued scientists for years. Genie, a male great white shark, was caught and tagged in September 2019. Interestingly, Genie’s migration pattern is similar to that of Mary Lee, leading scientists to consider whether great whites may have an inherent migration blueprint. The tagging process has allowed biologists to track the movements of these creatures more closely, increasing their understanding of the great whites' behavior. Through the use of online tools, people are able to follow and monitor the sharks' movement patterns. These tools enable both biologists and the general public to be informed and learn more about these remarkable creatures. Great white sharks are apex predators of the ocean and their behavior has long intrigued scientists. Their consistent migration patterns have been a subject of study, particularly since the great white shark population is considered vulnerable due to overfishing and other human-related dangers. Understanding the habits of these creatures is essential in protecting them and preserving their species. The migration pattern of sharks and other marine animals is of global significance. Tagging these animals helps researchers gather vital information that can contribute to conservation efforts. The information extracted from these studies can help maintain a balance among different marine species and preserve the aquatic ecosystem. In conclusion, the tagging of Mary Lee and Genie, two great white sharks, is an essential step towards understanding migration and behavior patterns of these mighty ocean predators. This information will have a significant impact on their conservation and help protect these animals from harm. The online tools for monitoring the movements of these sharks are a great way of promoting awareness about these creatures and their migrations. As we learn more about these species, we will be better equipped to protect and preserve Earth's oceans for generations to come.
