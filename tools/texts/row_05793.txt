Drunk: Party girl Hannah Sneade, 20 sparked a huge emergency by claiming she was caught up in a car crash with 10 other people to get off a drink driving charge . A drunken trainee teacher who crashed her car sparked a huge emergency by pretending she was in an accident involving 10 people. Hannah Sneade, 20, tried to avoid a drink driving charge by telling a 999 operator that she was in a taxi with 10 friends which had crashed on a country road. This resulted in four ambulances, three police cars and two fire engines racing to the scene. An air ambulance was put on stand-by and hospitals were warned to expect a flood of casualties. But when emergency services arrived at the remote spot all they found was bleary-eyed Sneade shivering in her pink pyjamas. Police noticed she smelled strongly of alcohol and a breath test showed she was more than twice the legal limit for driving. Sneade confessed she made up the story about the crash in the taxi to avoid being prosecuted for drink driving. Police found her damaged Peugeot car nearby and an investigation revealed no other vehicle was involved. Magistrates at Welshpool, Mid Wales, heard Sneade's wild claim caused 'significant strain' for the emergency services. Paul Inns, defending, said: 'Miss Sneade has not covered herself in glory with this matter. 'She had been out celebrating a friend's birthday and had been dropped off at home. 'For some inexplicable reason she decided to get into her vehicle and drive to see her boyfriend.' On her Twitter page Sneade describes herself as 'Welsh farmers daughter studying to be a teacher at Chester University! Work hard - play hard!' The night before her arrest she tweeted: 'Just about to let rip on the sauce yet again... Dressed as a sheep!! £pubcrawl £baaaaaa' Her next tweet, made after being released from police custody, said: 'Thank you all for your calls, messages and visits! Means a lot. Xxxx' Farmer's daughter Sneade, of Sarn, Newtown, admitted drink driving and was bannedfor 22 months. Sneade was fined £75 and ordered to pay £85 costs with a £15 victim surcharge. She will have her driving ban reduced by four months if she completes a drink-drive rehabilitation course.

chatgpt: Hannah Sneade, a university student, made up a story about crashing in a taxi along with ten friends. According to reports, she called 999 and informed the operator about the accident, leading to four ambulances, three police cars, and two fire engines rushing to the scene. The hospitals were put on alert and warned to expect a flood of casualties. To their relief, the authorities soon discovered that Hannah was the only one involved in the crash. She had made up the story to avoid charges of drink driving. The incident took place in the wee hours of the morning when the authorities received a call from Hannah claiming she was in a taxi that crashed with ten of her friends. She also told them that several people were injured and needed immediate medical attention. Upon receiving her call, the emergency services were immediately dispatched to the scene. However, when they arrived, they found no evidence of an accident. It was then discovered that Hannah had lied about the incident and had only been trying to deflect the authorities from her own bad behavior. Drink driving is a serious offense that can lead to fatal consequences, and it is essential to take precautions to prevent such incidents. Although Hannah's lie was exposed, it is paramount to remember that such false reports divert valuable resources from genuine emergencies. The authorities have expressed disappointment and concern about the incident and have warned that every report must be taken seriously to prevent any delays in responding to existing emergencies. The emergency services, including the police, medical professionals, and firefighters, are always on standby to provide help in times of need. It is imperative to report emergencies accurately because every second counts in such cases. Hannah Sneade's deception could have had severe consequences. The incident highlights the importance of not only taking responsibility for one's actions but also being truthful when communicating with the authorities. Lying for personal gain can lead to wastage of resources and inconvenience to others who might be genuinely in need. In conclusion, Hannah Sneade's false report should serve as a reminder of the importance of being truthful in emergency situations. Driving under the influence of alcohol is not acceptable behavior, and individuals should take responsibility for their actions. It is the responsibility of all citizens to cooperate with the authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone in the community.
