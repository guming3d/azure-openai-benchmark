article: Many New Year’s Eve revellers will be drinking themselves into a stupor on Wednesday night, but it’s probably best not to do it after you’ve robbed a restaurant of all its alcohol. This is what one boozy thief worked out in Darwin after police found him comatose at the scene of a massive alcohol theft  from a restaurant in the city's CBD. ABC reported that two men, 33 and 44, allegedly broke into the restaurant on Monday night and loaded a wheelie bin full of alcohol, with one then passing out drunk on the premises. This is the alcohol police in Darwin recouped after the boozy robber passed out drunk on the premises . The two men forced entry to the cold store. One tipped all the rubbish out of a nearby wheelie bin then filled it with the restaurant's spirits. 'He then wheeled it out and started drinking,' Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen said. The only problem was that he did more drinking than wheeling. A number of others also took advantage of the open premises and helped themselves. 'The original villains also helped themselves to various slabs of beer,' Superintendent Jorgensen said. The robbers piled the bottles of spirits into a wheelie bin but they did not make a quick getaway . After polishing off a couple of bottles of stolen spirits the legless thief wasn't going anywhere . In the morning one of the men was allegedly found on the premises by an off-duty police officer. 'He was passed out, comatose in front of the restaurant. The wheelie bin was nearby. Empties were everywhere,' Superintendent Jorgensen said. It turned out to be an even bigger Christmas gift for police as they also found on the premises the backpack of the second original offender with his ID inside. He was soon located and arrested. A total of 151 bottles of spirits and eight cartons of beer were stolen. The two men arrested remained in custody and were expected to appear in court in relation to the matter. As if 151 bottles of spirits wasn't enough robbers helped themselves to various slabs of beer too .
