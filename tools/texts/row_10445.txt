The video was posted on Facebook on Friday afternoon by the individual who shot it in question. The footage showcases three passengers waving their arms and excitedly having a good time while carelessly putting their lives and others' lives at risk. According to the individual who captured the footage, Henry Hogg, he has passed on the video to the police.

The incident has raised concerns about dangerous stunts and reckless behavior, particularly among younger generations. The video has received mixed reactions from social media users, with some viewers finding the act amusing and others condemning the behavior as irresponsible and dangerous. Many have taken to social media to criticize such stunts and encourage safe and responsible behavior while on the road. Road safety experts have warned against such dangerous stunts and urged motorists to abide by traffic laws and regulations at all times. "It is incredibly reckless and dangerous to engage in such behavior while traveling on the road," said a spokesman for road safety charity, Brake. "It not only puts the lives of the individuals involved at risk but also endangers the lives of other road users." The incident comes amid an increase in road accidents worldwide, particularly those involving younger drivers. A recent report by the World Health Organization states that road traffic injuries are a leading cause of death among people aged between 5 and 29 years. As such, it is crucial that motorists exercise caution while on the road, particularly when carrying passengers. Passengers must also be encouraged to engage in safe and responsible behavior while in a moving vehicle. It is vital to remember that such reckless stunts are not only illegal but also pose a significant threat to the safety of everyone on the road. In conclusion, while the act of sticking out of a sunroof while traveling in a car may seem like a harmless bit of fun, it is vital to understand the potential dangers involved. Such behavior can lead to accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. Therefore, it is crucial that motorists and passengers alike follow traffic laws and regulations and prioritize road safety at all times.
