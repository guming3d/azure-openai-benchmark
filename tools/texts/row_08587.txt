article: (CNN) -- England's Danny Willett recorded his maiden European Tour victory after a marathon sudden death playoff against Marcus Fraser of Australia at the BMW International Open in Cologne Sunday. The 24-year-old Willett won at the fourth extra hole, taking advantage after Fraser missed a three foot putt for par. Former Walker Cup star Willett, in his fourth year on the Tour, had 19 top-10 finishes in his professional career without clinching victory going into the tournament. "It's amazing," he told the official European Tour website. "It was a tough day -- it was brutal with the wind whipping and it was raining. "Marcus had a great round today and I hung in there nicely. Hopefully I gave people a good show." Willett was as good as his word, but it needed a miraculous shot on the 18th to seal a playoff with Fraser, a two-time winner on the European Tour. Fraser had set a clubhouse target of 11 under after a bogey of his own on the last. Willett needed a par to match him and after his drive ended behind a tree it looked unlikely. But he produced a sensational hooked iron shot to reach the green and two putts later forced extra holes. Willett missed a five-footer for victory on the first sudden death hole, but eventually was left to celebrate a breakthrough triumph. Tied for third, one shot adrift were Ireland's Paul McGinley, Spaniard Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and England's Chris Wood. On the PGA Tour, England's Brian Davis and Roland Thatcher were leading the $6 million Travelers Championship going into Sunday's final round. Davis shot a six-under 64 to reach 12-under 198 after 54 holes, while Thatcher carded a 65. There was an emotional win on the Ladies European Tour as England's Melissa Reid won the Prague Masters Sunday, just a month after her mother Joy was killed in a car crash in Germany. Reid rolled home a six-footer on the final hole to hold off Italian Diana Luna, before breaking into tears and being comforted by fellow competitors and friends. "To be honest I wasn't that nervous. I think with something like what's happened to my family and me the last four weeks nothing really seems that difficult anymore," Reid told AFP.

chatgpt: Danny Willett claimed his maiden European Tour victory on Sunday after defeating Marcus Fraser of Australia in sudden death playoffs at the BMW International Open in Cologne. The 24-year-old Englishman shot a final round of 6-under 66 to force a playoff with Fraser, who had led going into the final round. The duo then traded birdies on the first playoff hole, but Willett sealed the win on the next hole with a brilliant approach shot to tap-in range for birdie, leaving Fraser to settle for second place. The win was a welcome return to form for Willett, who has struggled with injury and form in recent times. Willett's previous victory came at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic in February 2018, and he has since been struggling with back and shoulder injuries, which have affected his golfing form. However, the Englishman showed no signs of those injuries hindering him in Cologne, and he produced a clinical performance to claim his first European Tour title. In another golfing event, the third round of the Travelers Championship in Connecticut saw Brian Davis and Roland Thatcher take the lead. The duo finished the day on 12-under 198, with Davis shooting a 4-under 66 and Thatcher posting a 6-under 64. The pre-tournament favorite, Bubba Watson, struggled to keep pace with the leaders and finished the day on 8-under 202. On the Ladies European Tour, England's Melissa Reid had an emotional win at the Prague Masters. Reid shot a final round of 4-under 68 to finish on 16-under 272, three shots ahead of nearest rival Christine Wolf of Austria. The win was Reid's fifth on the Ladies European Tour and came after a gap of six years since her last win in 2015. Reid dedicated the win to her late mother, who passed away last year due to cancer. Reid held her nerve in the final round, making six birdies and dropping just two shots, to secure a hard-fought victory. Her win enhances her chances of securing a place in the European team for the upcoming Solheim Cup in Ohio. In conclusion, it was an eventful weekend in the world of golf, with English golfers claiming victories on both the European and Ladies European tours. Danny Willett's victory at the BMW International Open will boost his confidence ahead of major tournaments, while Melissa Reid's emotional win in Prague proves that hard work and perseverance can lead to success in the sport.
