chatgpt: A new addition at Burghley Hall has made it more accessible for elderly visitors and those who use wheelchairs. A stairlift has been installed, allowing them to ascend the challenging "Hell staircase" and access all 18 state rooms. Burghley Hall, located in Stamford, Lincolnshire, is a 16th-century country mansion and has been used in various films and TV series such as The Da Vinci Code and Pride and Prejudice. The mansion is renowned for its outstanding architecture and has been declared a Grade I listed building. However, not all visitors were able to explore the entire mansion due to the challenging nature of the "Hell staircase," which leads to the state rooms. This was a particular challenge for elderly visitors and those using wheelchairs, but with the new installation, access to the state rooms has never been easier. The stairlift installation was made possible by the Burghley House Preservation Trust, who aimed to make the mansion more accessible for all visitors. The Trust's project manager, William Houlsby, said: "We are thrilled to have been able to make such a significant improvement to the visitor experience at Burghley Hall. It was important for us to ensure that all visitors can explore the full mansion with comfort and ease." The installation of the stairlift has been praised by visitors, including Jane Butler, who visited the mansion with her elderly mother. "It made all the difference," she said. "My mother was able to explore the state rooms without any difficulty, and we were both blown away by the stunning architecture." Burghley Hall's state rooms are home to precious treasures, including fine art collections and Tudor furniture. Visitors can also learn about the history of the mansion, which was built by William Cecil, Lord High Treasurer to Queen Elizabeth I. The stairlift installation is just one of the many ways that Burghley Hall is working towards making the estate more accessible. The Trust has also installed accessible toilets and car parking spaces for disabled visitors. The mansion's gardens have been modified to make them more wheelchair-friendly and the Trust now offers guided tours for visually impaired visitors. Overall, the new stairs lift is an excellent addition to the mansion, one that brings more people closer to iconic architecture and historic treasure. Burghley Hall is now more accessible and easier to explore, and visitors can enjoy the full experience that the mansion has to offer.
