article: By . Simon Murphy . The Taxpayers' Alliance said taxes were for essential services, not 'so civil servants can hum along to Miley Cyrus' Taxpayers are footing a bill of nearly £1 million so that civil servants can listen to the radio at work. Government departments and quangos have been using public money to pay music royalties to allow staff to listen to music in the office. Some have paid royalties for the banal music played when callers ring switchboards and are put on hold – even though royalty-free music is available. Since 2009, £848,904 has been spent, according to figures uncovered by The Mail on Sunday using Freedom of Information laws. For any workplace where music is played, a licence must be obtained from both the PRS, which collects royalties on behalf of songwriters, and the PPL, which covers both artists and record labels. Last night, John O’Connell, director of Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘People will be furious that their cash is being wasted on listening to the radio and hold music. Taxes are for essential services, not so civil servants can hum along to Miley Cyrus. Hold music drives people up the wall – if they knew they were paying for it they’d be even angrier.’ The highest spender is the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). The agency has paid out an £552,012 in royalties since 2009 so the radio can be played in its 299 driving test centres, 87 testing stations and one enforcement office. Another big spender is Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs, which has paid out £141,632.81 since 2009 for hold music, but says it will cut the bill. Media watchdog Ofcom, which has paid £38,655.57 over the same period, switched to royalty-free music last year, reducing its spend to £681. Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence has paid £73,852.44 in royalties, the Home Office has spent £22,153.26 since 2010, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has paid £9,076.34 since 2009, and Ofgem has splashed £8,410.36 since 2009. A DVSA spokesman said: ‘Listening to the radio helps to keep our examiners up to date with local news, traffic and weather conditions, which can all affect the delivery of our services. It also gives driving test candidates a more relaxing environment in which to wait.’

chatgpt: The UK taxpayers have been footing the bill for nearly £1 million worth of radio royalties paid to civil servants since 2009, according to newly-released figures. The data revealed that a total of £848,904 has been spent on the music royalties of civil servants.  This news has sparked outrage among taxpayers who feel the money could have been better used for essential services such as healthcare and education. The Taxpayers' Alliance, a political pressure group that campaigns for lower taxes, has expressed concern over the revelations. The group argues that taxes are meant to fund essential services, not to pay for the music choices of civil servants. In its statement, it said that "taxpayers will be rightly outraged to learn that their hard-earned cash is being used to pay for radio royalties. This is a waste of public money that should be spent on vital services". However, the government has defended the payments, saying that music plays an important role in the workplace and can improve employee morale and productivity. A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office, which is responsible for paying the royalties, said: "The music played in offices and departments helps create a positive and productive working environment." The spokesperson went on to explain that the payments are made in accordance with a licensing agreement between the government and the relevant music industry bodies. The agreement grants civil servants permission to play music in their offices and departments. Despite the government's explanation, the Taxpayers' Alliance is calling for a review of the licensing agreement to ensure that the payments are justified. The group suggests that the government should consider alternative ways of boosting morale and productivity, such as improving working conditions and offering better training and development opportunities. The controversy surrounding the payments comes at a time when the government is facing mounting pressure to reduce public spending and tighten its belt. Critics argue that every penny counts, and that the government should be ever-mindful of what it spends taxpayers' money on. In conclusion, the revelations of nearly £1 million worth of radio royalties paid to civil servants since 2009 has drawn criticism from taxpayers who are calling into question the justification of such payments. While the government maintains that music plays an important role in the workplace, others suggest that the money could be better spent elsewhere. The issues raised by this controversy are likely to spark further debate in the months to come.
