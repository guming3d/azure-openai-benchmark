chatgpt: A former New Tribes Missionary, Warren Scott Kennell, who befriended and abused girls while setting up a church with the Katukina tribe in Brazil, has been described as having "abused his position as a missionary in the most horrendous way" by Assistant U.S. Attorney Tanya Davis Wilson. Kennell, 45, from the Sanford, Florida-based mission was arrested in May in Orlando. During investigations, more than 940 images of child pornography were found on his hard drive. He had been abusing girls over several years in his role as a missionary. The shocking case has highlighted the potential abuse of trust and power that can occur when American mission trips are undertaken by those with ulterior motives. The New Tribes Mission, which operates worldwide, focuses on working with isolated tribes that have had little or no contact with the outside world. The charityâ€™s aim is to spread the word of Christianity and provide education, healthcare and other services. Cases of abuse by missionaries have become more widely reported in recent years, and it is feared that the phenomenon is more widespread than is currently known. Calls have been made for charities to ensure effective vetting and training of individuals who take part in such trips. Janet Reaves, Executive Director of the Child Protection Program at the Association of Christian Schools International, said "we will always need to be vigilant in protecting children and adolescents from abuse. We are working to educate and train teachers and administrators to maintain safe environments for students whether at school or at an event." The case of Warren Scott Kennell has raised questions about the effectiveness of vetting procedures for those taking part in missionary trips. It is hoped that charities such as the New Tribes Mission will review their procedures with a view to preventing any future abuse. Kennell is currently being held in custody without bail and faces charges of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors. His trial is set to begin in September. The victims continue to be supported by charities working in the region.
