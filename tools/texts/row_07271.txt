article: Jenson Button's future is set to be decided at a McLaren board meeting on Thursday. That is the day when team executives will convene to decide on the driver line-up for 2015, with Button and Kevin Magnussen both waiting to discover whether they will be retained or let go. McLaren group chief executive Ron Dennis said following the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: ''I've not made up my mind yet, but (the decision on the driver line-up) is not mine alone, and anyway, it wouldn't be appropriate.

'Any decision has to be supported by the shareholders and the board. 'It's pretty understandable we're looking at two people, and there's a broader choice than Kevin and Jenson, but nevertheless whatever the decision, it won't be taken until (the board meeting).' Fernando Alonso is widely expected to occupy one of the seats at McLaren following his departure from Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton, who was a former team-mate of Alonso's during the Spaniard's first stint at McLaren, believes he will be a very different character from the one who left in 2007. Button and Kevin Magnussen (above) are vying for McLaren seat . Hamilton said: 'I wish him all the best. 'It's an interesting decision, and a new experience for the team. 'Fernando has grown a huge amount over the years, both as a driver and in terms of his maturity. 'Having the previous experience with Ron he'll definitely have a much better handle on it, and perhaps won't be in as tricky a situation as he was back then.' Alonso is to be replaced at Ferrari by four-times champion Sebastian Vettel who has opted to end his 14-year association with Red Bull. Team executives will convene on Thursday to decide on the driver line-up for 2015 . Hamilton can appreciate what Vettel will be going through. He was with McLaren for 13 years before opting to join Mercedes. Hamilton added: 'For Sebastian, it's great for him. It's a dream for most drivers to experience driving a Ferrari. 'He's won four world championships, so this is a new chapter for him and I wish him all the best with it.'

chatgpt: McLaren executives are set to decide on the driver line-up for the 2015 Formula One season, with high expectations ahead of the new year. Fernando Alonso is expected to take one of the coveted seats at McLaren after his impressive performances at Ferrari. However, the team is facing a tough decision over who will join Alonso as the second driver. Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen are both vying for the second seat at McLaren, with both drivers bringing their own unique strengths and skills to the table. Button, the 2009 Formula One world champion, remains a popular and experienced driver, while Magnussen has shown tremendous speed and potential in his rookie season. McLaren team principal, Eric Boullier, highlighted the dilemma facing the team. "Both Jenson and Kevin are incredibly talented drivers with a vast amount of experience and speed. It's a difficult decision for us to make, but one that we're confident we'll get right." Button, who has been with McLaren since 2010, has voiced his desire to stay with the team, citing his strong ties to the team and his belief in the incredible work they are doing to rebuild for the future. However, he also recognizes the talents of his younger teammate, Magnussen. "I think Kevin has been incredibly impressive this season, and I'm excited to see what he can do in the future. But at the same time, I know what I can bring to this team and I believe I'm still a competitive driver." Magnussen, for his part, is determined to earn the second seat and prove himself on the track. "I'm ready for this challenge, and I know I have the speed and talent to compete at the highest level. I respect Jenson and what he's done for the team, but I believe I can bring something new and exciting to the partnership with Fernando." The decision on the driver line-up will be crucial for McLaren, as they look to rebuild after a disappointing 2014 season in which they failed to secure a single podium finish. With Alonso already signed and delivering strong performances, the second seat will be equally important in propelling the team forward in the hopes of capturing the world championship in the near future. Fans of the team will be eagerly awaiting the announcement, which is expected to be made in the coming days. With two talented drivers and a strong team behind them, McLaren will be looking to make a bold statement heading into the 2015 season.
