article: Singapore (CNN)  -- While economists fret whether the sharp "V"-shaped drop of the financial crisis will turn into a double-dipped "W" recovery, Tan Pheng Hock is most worried about the "P" word: Protectionism. His Singapore-based ST Engineering builds aerospace and transport systems and control centers. Most of the group's $3 billion in revenues come from exports. "When you have protectionism it breeds like a disease whereby people become so dependent on it," Tan said. "The moment you remove it you get lots of resistance." As the business and government leaders gather for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Tan has good reason to be concerned. Few economies have borne the brunt of the financial crisis -- or the "financial tsunami," as many Asian nations call it -- as has export-driven Singapore. The city-state's economic output took a record fall, with its GDP dropping 9.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to government statistics. Singapore lives and dies by the global economy. With no natural resources and a small domestic market, in a generation the city-state transformed itself from the third world British colony into a first world economic power by building its economy on exports and business services. While Singapore's economic health is quickly rebounding -- second quarter GDP was down only 3.5 percent, the best performance since the financial crisis exploded in September last year -- protectionist winds threaten to shatter any nascent recovery. "With the crisis we've been through there have obviously been some protectionist tendencies beginning to rise, particularly in the Western world," Tan said. "I hope we will see those quashed during the course of this week (at APEC)." Although APEC was built as an avenue to promulgate freer trade among Pacific Rim economies, the first salvos of trade disputes between China and the U.S. have many concerned. In September, the U.S. placed tariffs on Chinese made automobile tires; China responded by cutting off imports of poultry parts (including chicken feet, a delicacy in China) and auto parts. More recently, China has begun an investigation whether Washington bailouts of U.S. carmakers constitutes unfair government supports of U.S. cars sold in China. The fact that the leaders of the two nations will be gathering here on Saturday ahead of U.S. President Barack Obama's first visit to China puts implicit pressure to reduce the protectionist rhetoric, said Tan Khee Giap, chairman of the Singapore National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation Council. "At least they have to say that they will resist any form of protectionism at meetings like this," Tan said. Whether words will match deeds remains an open question. A survey of 400 business leaders released Wednesday by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council found a majority of those polled believe protectionism is likely to increase if the global recovery stalls. CNN's Andrew Stevens and Kevin Voigt contributed to this story.

chatgpt: Singapore's economy has reported a decline of 3.5 percent in the second quarter of the year, the country's best performance since the crisis hit. This follows a sharp decline of 9.5 percent in the first quarter, indicating that the economy is beginning to stabilize after the downturn caused by COVID-19. While the quarterly results are a positive sign, Singapore's economic growth is still predicted to shrink by between 6 and 7 percent for the year, according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Many analysts attribute Singapore's second-quarter economic improvement to the easing of COVID-19 measures and the gradual reopening of the economy. The gradual return to normalcy has helped businesses operate at pre-pandemic levels and, in some cases, improve their performance. However, trade disputes between China and the United States have caused widespread concern. The ongoing tensions between the two economic superpowers have made a significant impact on the global economy, leading to a slowdown in trade and investment. Despite this, some experts believe that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting may help to reduce protectionist rhetoric and promote free trade. The meeting, which will be held virtually in November, will bring together political leaders from the region to discuss economic cooperation and trade. According to observers, cooperation between countries in the APEC region could help to reduce tensions and promote economic growth in the area. APEC member countries make up approximately 60 percent of global GDP, making the group a significant force in international trade. In addition to the impact of trade disputes, Singapore's economy has also been impacted by the pandemic because of its heavy reliance on international trade and tourism. In response, the government has implemented several support measures for businesses and workers. These measures include helping firms to retain their employees, providing wage subsidies, and offering various types of financial assistance. The government has also allocated a significant amount of funding for various sectors, including aviation, hospitality, and retail. Despite the challenging economic conditions, Singapore's government remains committed to supporting businesses and workers during this difficult period. The government has stated that it will continue to monitor the situation closely and take appropriate action to support the economy as necessary. In conclusion, Singapore's second-quarter GDP performance provides a glimpse of hope for businesses and the economy as a whole. However, the global economic situation remains uncertain, with trade disputes and the pandemic still having a significant impact. The upcoming APEC meeting offers a promising opportunity for economic cooperation and growth. Only time will tell if this and other measures will be enough to sustain and improve Singapore's economy in the upcoming months.
