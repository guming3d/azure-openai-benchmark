article: England forwards Dylan Hartley and Courtney Lawes have both signed new contracts with Aviva Premiership champions Northampton, as revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday night. Saints announced the deals among a raft of seven fresh contracts, with flanker Calum Clark, props Alex Waller, Ethan Waller and Gareth Denman, plus lock James Craig also putting pen to paper. Northampton hooker and captain Hartley, 28, had been linked with a possible move to French club Montpellier after next year's World Cup, but he will now remain with Saints, the club he joined in 2005.

Hartley has clocked up almost 200 first team appearances and won 61 England caps. The multiple contract announcement comes just three days before Saints tackle fierce East Midlands rivals Leicester in the Premiership, when Northampton will look to consolidate top spot, currently standing two points above Bath. 'We have a group that has shown time and again that they have the ability to compete at the highest level of club rugby, and retaining players is very important to us,' Northampton rugby director Jim Mallinder said. Versatile flanker Calum Clark has also been involved in the England set-up . 'The seven forwards that we have announced today are all good players already, but they still have the ability to improve. 'We are looking forward to seeing them develop further at Franklin's Gardens.' Hartley is currently Northampton's longest-serving player, while 27-year-old Lawes made his club debut in 2007 and is now established among the northern hemisphere's leading second-row forwards, with 36 caps to his name. Former England Saxons and England Under 20 captain Clark was part of England's training squad for the autumn Tests this season, and appears firmly on course to be part of their World Cup campaign, while brothers Alex and Ethan Waller are also making considerable strides. Lawes rises to catch a lineout during the 67-0 European Champions Cup win over Treviso . Alex, 24, scored the winning try in last season's Premiership final against Saracens at Twickenham, and 22-year-old Ethan is closing in on 50 first-team appearances. Craig, meanwhile, joined Saints in 2011, while Denman is in his second season at Franklin's Gardens after previously packing down for Championship clubs Leeds - now Yorkshire Carnegie - and Rotherham.

chatgpt: Northampton Saints Rugby Club has announced the signing of seven players to new contracts, including England hooker Dylan Hartley and fellow international teammate Courtney Lawes. Sportsmail had previously reported that Hartley had turned down a move to Montpellier, deciding to remain with Northampton where he has spent his entire club career. The news that Hartley and Lawes have signed new contracts will come as a relief to Northampton fans, who have been anxious about the future of the club's star players. Speaking about the signings, Northampton coach Chris Boyd said, "We are delighted to have secured the services of these players. They are important members of our squad and we look forward to working with them in the future." Hartley, who has 97 caps for England and captained the team to the Grand Slam in 2016, has been a key figure for Northampton over the past decade. The 33-year-old hooker has made over 250 appearances for the club and is widely regarded as one of the best players in the Premiership. Lawes, who has 81 caps for England, has also been a crucial member of the Northampton squad since joining the club in 2007. The 30-year-old lock has made over 200 appearances for the Saints and has been a regular starter for both club and country. The other five players who have signed new contracts are prop Francois van Wyk, back row Shaun Adendorff, scrum-half Henry Taylor, fly-half James Grayson and winger Ollie Sleightholme. Boyd hailed the signings as a "statement of intent" from the club, as they look to build on their strong start to the season. Northampton currently sit in fourth place in the Premiership, with six wins from their opening ten games. They have also made it through to the knockout stages of the European Challenge Cup, where they will face Lyon in the quarter-finals. The news of the seven new contracts will be a boost to the club as they look to continue their push for a top-four finish in the Premiership. With Hartley and Lawes now committed to the club, Northampton fans can look forward to seeing two of the country's best players continuing to perform for their beloved Saints.
