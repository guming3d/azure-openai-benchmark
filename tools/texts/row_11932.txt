chatgpt: Miroslav Klose, the 36-year-old German striker, made history on Tuesday night by breaking the all-time World Cup scoring record. With his 16th World Cup goal, Klose surpassed Brazilian great Ronaldo, who held the previous record at 15. Klose's historic goal came early in the second half of Germany's 7-1 rout of Brazil in the semi-finals. It was a typical Klose goal – a poacher's effort from close range. The goal was met with rapturous applause from the German fans in Belo Horizonte, who chanted Klose's name throughout the game. Despite his record-breaking achievement, Klose was typically modest in his post-match comments. "I'm not interested in records," Klose said. "The most important thing is the team. If we can win the World Cup, then that's more important than any record." Klose also insisted that Ronaldo was still the best striker he had ever seen. "Ronaldo is the most complete player ever," Klose said. "He could score goals with his head, his left foot, his right foot. He was just amazing." Germany will play Argentina in the World Cup final on Sunday, and Klose will be hoping to add to his goal tally. If Germany win, it will be their third World Cup victory and their first since 1990. Klose has been an integral part of the team's success, providing experience and leadership to a talented but youthful squad. Whatever happens on Sunday, Klose has already cemented his place in World Cup history. He is now the all-time top scorer in the greatest sporting event on Earth, and that is an achievement that will be remembered for many years to come.
