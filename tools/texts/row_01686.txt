The couple earned a total of $719,274 for the year, according to a statement released by the White House on Friday.  Alongside their taxes, the Bushes contributed an impressive $165,660 to churches and charitable organizations.

The Vice President, Dick Cheney, and his wife Lynne earned a significantly higher income for the tax year, with a total of $2,528,068. However, the couple owes taxes of $602,651. Despite the disparity in incomes, both the President and Vice President have fulfilled their tax obligations as citizens of the United States. It reinforces the importance of paying taxes and contributing to society in this manner. The White House has heralded Bush’s stance on tax policies, stating that it has facilitated economic growth and supported the creation of jobs across the country. The President remains committed to easing the tax burden on working families and bolstering the economy in these challenging times. The Bush-Cheney administration has faced its fair share of criticism during its tenure in the White House, but these latest tax figures show the President and Vice President’s commitment to fulfilling their financial obligations as private citizens. It is also clear that charitable giving is an important part of both the Bushes’ and Cheneys’ lives. Their contributions to organizations that help those in need underscores their commitment to giving back to the greater community. As the 2008 election draws closer, these figures will no doubt come under scrutiny from opponents and supporters alike. However, it is important to note that both the President and Vice President have upheld their financial responsibilities to the nation and demonstrated their commitment to the welfare of others.
