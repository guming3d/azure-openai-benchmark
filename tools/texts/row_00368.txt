article: New York (CNN) -- A veteran New York City bus driver on Tuesday played down any claims of heroism for snagging a 7-year-old girl who fell three stories from a Brooklyn apartment building a day earlier. Steve St. Bernard, 52, says neighborhood children alerted him to the girl standing on top of a window air-conditioning unit, and he positioned himself underneath her. "I asked God ... I said, 'Let me catch her, please. Don't let me miss,'" the 10-year veteran of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) told CNN. "I don't play baseball. I'm not a sportsman. I don't want to miss." St. Bernard said the girl was up above him for an excruciating seven minutes before she fell into his arms. Man saves woman during shark attack . The incident occurred Monday afternoon and was captured on amateur video, which soon surfaced online. It shows the girl, who neighbors said is a special-needs child, standing and apparently dancing on the air-conditioner, losing her balance and falling. One of at least two people standing on the sidewalk beneath her reaches out and catches her before she hits the ground. "It felt like a ton of bricks ... like a whole bag of rocks on me," St. Bernard said. "We went down. She touched the floor but the impact wasn't on her. It was me and her going down. I guess I absorbed the blow." Bernard and the girl were treated at a local hospital and released. Bernard hurt his arm and is now wearing a sling and can't go to work. Neighbors and onlookers have since hailed the bus driver as a hero while police investigate the incident, authorities said. The child apparently was able to get onto an exterior air-conditioning unit because the window guards were too small for the opening, said New York City Housing Authority spokeswoman Sheila Stainback. There are now child-proof bars in place and the air conditioner unit has been removed from the window. The girl's mother told CNN affiliate WCBS that she thought her daughter was asleep and blamed the incident on the air conditioner, which she said was installed just a few days ago and was defective. Deborah Reed, a witness who alerted the girl's mother that her child was standing on the air conditioner, was emotional about the whole ordeal. "I am just so thankful that everything turned out well -- I really am," she said. But most grateful was the girl's mother, who hugged and thanked St. Bernard on Tuesday. Still, the bus driver is brushing aside the "hero" label. "If you have kids or you love people, like me, it's something you jump into action real quickly," he said.

However, it was the quick thinking and heroic actions of Steve St. Bernard, a 52-year-old bus driver, that saved her life. The incident occurred on July 16th at around 2:30 pm when St. Bernard was driving his bus on a routine route. Suddenly, he heard a loud thud and saw the young girl hurtling towards the sidewalk. "I saw her falling and I thought, this is not real," St. Bernard recounted. "I said, 'Let me catch her, please.'" Without hesitation, St. Bernard jumped off his bus and positioned himself underneath the falling child. His arms outstretched, he caught her just seconds before she hit the pavement. The impact of the 40-pound child hitting his chest was "felt like a ton of bricks," St. Bernard said. The grateful mother of the child, who wished to remain anonymous, arrived on the scene minutes later and embraced St. Bernard in an emotional embrace. "I hugged him so tight, I just couldn't even let him go," she said. "I just thanked him repeatedly. There are really no words to express how happy and grateful I am." According to authorities, the child was home alone with her siblings when the accident occurred. A faulty air conditioning unit caused her to push open the window while trying to escape the summer heat. Since the tragedy, the AC unit has been removed and child-safety bars have been placed on the window.

As for St. Bernard himself, he remains modest about his role in the dramatic events. "I don't feel like a hero. I just did what I had to do," he said. The incident serves as a reminder of how important it is to be vigilant when it comes to the safety of children. It also highlights the bravery and selflessness of ordinary people who step up to help others in times of need. As the community continues to heal from this traumatic event, many will be forever grateful for the actions of Steve St. Bernard, who will undoubtedly go down in history as a true hero.
