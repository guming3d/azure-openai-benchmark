article: Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- At least seven pro-Houthi protesters were killed and dozens were wounded Tuesday when demonstrators allegedly tried to raid the Ministerial Cabinet building in the capital, a senior Houthi official said. A government representative gave conflicting figures, saying four pro-Houthi protesters were killed in the attempted raid in Sanaa. The Houthi official said the more than 45 people who were injured were taken to Al-Moayyad house. Hospital officials told CNN that three of the injured are in critical condition. "The gunshot wounds are mostly to the head, back and chest, resulting in serious injuries," a hospital official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the media. The Interior Ministry said protesters -- including some armed Houthis -- attempted to raid the Ministerial Cabinet and attacked the soldiers guarding the gates. "Troops did their legal duties of protecting government buildings after being threatened," the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said the protesters were killed and injured by the armed demonstrators within the crowd, and said several government troops were attacked and injured in the violence. It called on Houthis to seek peaceful solutions for change instead of using force. Houthis, also known as "Ansarullah," have been rallying for almost a month, demanding that a recently approved oil subsidy reform be revoked and that the government step down. Until then, they say, they will not remove their tents from Sanaa and surrounding areas. In a televised speech Monday, top Ansarullah leader AbdulMalik al-Houthi called on supporters to continue protesting and launched a new stage of escalation. "It seemed that the government downplayed our threats and killed peaceful protesters," al-Houthi said, referring to the deaths of some demonstrators Sunday. "Their blood will not go in vain." Houthi spokesman Mohammed AbdulSalam threatened the Yemeni government, saying the group was being forced to consider non-peaceful actions in retaliation for the attacks against protesters. "The government is trying to say that peaceful activities are not accepted. The killing of protesters will not make us take steps backwards, but rather raise our ceiling of demands," he said. Earlier in the month, Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi dismissed the government and agreed to a 15% cut in fuel prices, in addition to other economic reforms, seeking to end weeks of tense protests led by tens of thousands of Houthi loyalists. Houthis, who follow the Zaidi sect of Islam, rejected the initiative.

chatgpt: Violent clashes erupted on Tuesday between protesters and Houthi fighters in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. At least six Houthis were killed and dozens of others were wounded amid the protests against the country's government and its recent oil subsidy reform. According to a statement from the Interior Ministry, the shots that killed the Houthis came from armed protesters who were part of the crowd. The ministry also said that several members of the security forces were injured during the clashes. The protests were led by Houthis, who are members of a religious and political group that has been in conflict with Yemen's government since 2011. The group has been pushing for the resignation of the current government and the implementation of a more inclusive political system. The Yemeni government recently implemented an overhaul of its subsidy program, which has led to a rise in fuel prices and general discontent among the population. Despite the violence, the protests continued into the night, with Houthis setting up makeshift camps across Sanaa. The protesters demanded the release of people arrested during the clashes and for the government to meet their demands. This is not the first time that Yemen has experienced violent protests, with demonstrations against the government sometimes turning deadly. The country has been wracked by political and economic instability for years, with various factions vying for power and control over resources like oil. The ongoing conflict has also led to a humanitarian crisis in the country, with millions of people suffering from famine, disease, and displacement. Despite calls for peace and unity, violence and unrest continue to plague Yemen, making any progress towards stability and security difficult. The international community has been working to broker a peace deal between the warring factions, but little progress has been made so far. Meanwhile, the people of Yemen continue to suffer, with no clear end to the conflict in sight. In conclusion, the recent clashes in Sanaa highlight the ongoing unrest in Yemen and the challenges facing the country's government and its population. The violence and protests are a reflection of the deep-rooted issues and divisions that continue to plague Yemen, making peace and stability a distant dream for its people.
