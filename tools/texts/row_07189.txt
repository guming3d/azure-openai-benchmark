article: By . John Stevens . Speaking out: Dr Charles Alessi said doctors treat patients as 'conditions rather than people' Many older patients’ lives are becoming a misery because they are being prescribed up to 18 tablets a day for different illnesses, a senior government health adviser has warned. Dr Charles Alessi said modern medicine treats patients as ‘conditions rather than people’ and urged doctors to stop practising ‘medicine by body part’ which leads to the over-prescribing of many drugs. But he also said that older patients needed to be more resilient and take control of their illnesses by leading more pro-active lives. Speaking at charity Age UK’s For Later . Life conference, Dr Alessi, who is lead adviser for preventable . dementia in Public Health England, said: ‘Lots of medicine is starting . to lose its way. It’s become far more reductionist – we practise . medicine by body part. ‘We . end up treating conditions on their own. 'So somebody with diabetes and . dementia, who has had a stroke, has a mixture of 12, 15 or 18 drugs to . take in a day and it is very difficult to do that.’ And he said many give up on the pills anyway because they are so fed up with it dominating their lives. He . said: ‘Most people who are put on medication for long-term conditions . are very rarely on the same medication a year later because they have . stopped taking them, because every normal person would if they’re on 18 . drugs a day, because there is very little time to do anything else.’ Almost . half of over-65s have three chronic health problems, such as high blood . pressure, diabetes, and arthritis, leading to many taking an array of . drugs every day and having to cope with the side-effects. Dr . Alessi, who is also chairman of the National Association of Primary . Care, said there was a need for a ‘personalisation of medicine’ in which . doctors would discuss a patient’s priorities with them. But . he also said that older patients must act too and take charge of their . illnesses by finding support from someone who ‘loves you’. High numbers: Dr Alessi said some elderly people are on 'a mixture of 12, 15 or 18 drugs a day' He said: ‘We need to give control back to people and we give control back to people by increasing their resilience. ‘The steps to do that are remarkably simple: be active, connect with people. 'Somebody loves you somewhere, you must belong somewhere, look around you, connect with people around you. ‘Try to learn something every day; try to help somebody else around you and be aware of your surroundings. That’s all you need to do. That activates you.’ Earlier this year Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for NHS patients to be ‘treated as people’. Since April, doctors’ practices have had to assign every patient aged 75 or over a named, accountable GP.

chatgpt: According to health advisers, elderly citizens are becoming increasingly discontented with the prevalence of pills in their daily routines. They feel as if they are being treated as conditions rather than individuals. Such sentiments were expressed by Dr. Alessi, who has been working for many years to reform medicine in care homes. Dr. Alessi, who works with elderly patients, believes that seniors should not have to live their lives popping pills. He expressed that he has witnessed firsthand the increasing medication of the elderly, leading to a state of depression, decreased motivation, and a general lack of enthusiasm. The increasing focus on medication over patient care and happiness is taking its toll on the elderly. In a society that is often focused on productivity and results, patients are treated as conditions rather than people. Dr. Alessi’s experience indicates that a good number of geriatric medicine problems should be solved by applying therapy and care approaches rather than medical, which in many cases worsen the patient’s mental and physical state.  The negative effects of overmedication are far-reaching. Patients may experience cognitive impairment, sedation, confusion, and other mental and physical impairments that impact the quality of their lives. The over-dependence on medication, according to Dr. Alessi, takes away from the autonomy that elderly citizens deserve to maintain. Dr. Alessi suggests that senior citizens should receive better access to non-pharmaceutical care, such as social interaction, guided meditation, shared meals, and physical exercise, rather than being forced to rely on endless bottles of medication. Such alternative care methods can bring a significant improvement to the elderly's mental and physical wellbeing. Some elderly people, Dr. Alessi adds, also suffer from isolation and boredom in care homes, which compounds their frustration with their pill-dominated routine. Caring for the elderly should be nuanced and personalized. Geriatric medicine must realize that every patient is unique and concentrate on delivering a treatment plan that is tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, caregivers should take the time to understand the day-to-day realities of care homes and the lives of aging patients. By doing this, they will be better equipped to offer non-pharmaceutical solutions that align more with the needs of individual patients. Providing comprehensive care to the elderly requires more than the ability to prescribe pills. It involves understanding the emotional and physical needs of elderly patients and tailoring treatments to those needs. Dr. Alessi's experience highlights that prioritizing medication over the patient's actual needs does not promote healing but reduces the quality of life for the elderly. With the right approach to geriatric care, seniors can regain a sense of autonomy and improve their mental and physical health, which should be the primary goal of care homes.
