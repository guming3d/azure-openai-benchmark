article: A glamour model whose lingerie photographs were sold to porn and erotica companies to use online is suing her photographer. Nicole Forni, a professional model from Cleveland, Ohio, claims that she only agreed to pose for the provocative pictures on the condition that they were not sold on for any 'adult-oriented' purposes. But after the shoot she and her family found the images used on websites for sex guides in Germany and Spain, an escort website in Switzerland, as well as gracing the cover an erotic e-book entitled Horny Housewives of Dubai: Episode 4. Scroll down for video . 'Horny Housewives': Nicole Forni (right in Cleveland) found herself gracing the cover of an erotic e-book (left) set in Dubai . Legal documents presented to a Manhattan federal court this week also claim that a Pittsburgh strip club, a seduction guide publisher, the dating website Cougar911 and numerous websites selling webcam sex shows also used the pictures of Forni. The model is demanding $75,000 from Joshua Resnick, who took the photographs, alongside the slew of sex-related companies who allegedly used them. The legal document says Resnick approached her with an offer of taking the photographs, which she could use in her portfolio in lieu of being paid for them. It then details how Forni travelled to Resnick's studio in Columbus, Ohio, where she lay down on a white bed and posed in a lacy black ensemble. It says she was promised that no obscene use would be made of them before the shoot, and signed the model release afterwards. But it fells how her family members soon broke the news to her that the photographs were doing the rounds of erotic websites, including Playboy, and were even being made into wallpaper. Shocked: Forni said her family first told her how the pictures were being used . Swiss escorts: The shoot, which lawyers say Forni put strict conditions on, led the model to becoming the face of superescort.ch in Switzerland . Her lawyers claim that Resnick is guilty of fraud not breaking their agreement, which he did not incorporate into a written model release form, which she signed. Michael O'Shea, the attorney representing Forni, said the pictures were meant to be a 'Victoria's Secret-style' shoot which would allow her to retain her 'dignity'. O'Shea told the New York Post: 'She was mortified... thereâ€™s a certain level of dignity that people live with, and this guy violated that dignity and trust for a few bucks.' In the lawsuit, originally filed in Ohio, Forni's attorneys said they want the sites and publishers who used the images to take them down. A lawyer for Resnick told the Post that the allegations against him are 'baseless'. Far and wide: This Brazilian sex site was also running the image of Forni, alongside others allegedly including Playboy maagzine. The suit even says a wallpaper offering her likeness as a design .

chatgpt: Nicole Forni, a model, is suing Joshua Resnick, a photographer, and several publishers for $75,000 in damages. The lawsuit comes after Forni discovered that pictures of her in lacy black lingerie were being used for adult purposes, despite her requesting that the images not be sold for that purpose.  The incident allegedly occurred during a photo shoot in Columbus, Ohio, where Resnick captured Forni in various poses in the lingerie. Forni claims she explicitly asked Resnick not to sell the images for adult use, but that didn't stop the pictures from appearing on sex sites and in erotica books across the world.  Forni's attorney, Aaron Singer, says that Resnick violated Forni's right to privacy and that the publishers who used the images for adult purposes are guilty of defamation. Singer also argues that Forni's reputation has been damaged as a result of the use of the images beyond their intended purpose.  "This is a clear case of breach of trust and breach of contract," Singer said. "Ms. Forni trusted Mr. Resnick to honor her request that the images not be sold for adult use, and he violated that trust. The publishers who are using the images for adult purposes are guilty of defamation and are damaging Ms. Forni's reputation."  Forni, who has previously modeled for lingerie and swimwear brands, says that she has been contacted by fans who have seen the images on adult sites and in erotic fiction. She claims the experience has caused her significant emotional distress and that she has suffered financial losses as a result of the misuse of the images.  "I trusted Mr. Resnick and the publishers who bought the images to use them for their intended purpose," Forni said. "I never gave consent for my images to be used for adult purposes, and I am horrified that they are now associated with that industry. This has caused significant emotional distress for me and has affected my reputation as a model."  Resnick, who has not yet commented on the lawsuit, has been accused of similar offenses in the past. In 2018, he was sued by another model who claimed that he used pictures of her for adult purposes without her consent. That case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.  The case is expected to be heard in the coming months, and Forni is hopeful that justice will be served. "I am determined to hold Mr. Resnick and the publishers accountable for their actions," she said. "I want to send a message that models have the right to control how their images are used and that violating that trust will not be tolerated."
