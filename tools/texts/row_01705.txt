article: London, England (CNN) -- Feared lost forever, 20 ancient ivory artifacts looted from Afghanistan's national museum were presented to the country's president, Hamid Karzai, in London Tuesday. The 2,000-year-old artifacts are the latest additions to the internationally acclaimed exhibition "Afghanistan: Crossroads of the Ancient World," which starts its UK run at the British Museum this week. Stolen during Afghanistan's civil war between 1992 and 1994, the ivory inlays were once part of a hoard of treasures found at the ancient city of Begram, north of modern-day Kabul. "These are an extraordinary set of ivories," said Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum. "Stolen from the National Museum in Kabul, bought by a London dealer specifically to return them, restored by conservators at the British Museum ... and after the exhibition they will go back." Originally part of a set of Indian furniture owned by the Kushan rulers from the 1st century A.D., the ivories were first discovered by a French archaeologist in 1937. Found in a concealed room in the ruins of Begram's ancient palace, it's believed the treasures were hidden in a moment of crisis. They then lay forgotten for almost 2,000 years. The artifacts have now been given back to the National Museum of Afghanistan thanks to a philanthropic donor who bought the ivories from various black market dealers. "(He's) retrieved what is probably the largest single group of antiquities that were known to be looted from the national museum during the civil war," said exhibition curator, St John Simpson. "It shows what an important role the international community can play in recovering material that has been stolen and has been sold and can then be returned," added MacGregor. According to the British Museum, it's estimated around 70% of the artifacts once found in Afghanistan's national museum have been looted or destroyed over the past 30 years. Often the only way these precious relics are recovered is through international border agencies working in collaboration with museums and archaeological experts. So far, the UK has sent back one crate of seized artifacts to Afghanistan, with another shipment due to go back in the near future. The rest of the exhibition's 200 relics, spanning 4,000 years of the country's ancient history, are only with us today thanks to the actions of a few dedicated individuals. They were hidden on the eve of the Soviet invasion in 1979 by a handful of Afghans and lay undiscovered in vaults underneath Afghanistan's presidential palace for over thirty years. Now they are part of this traveling exhibition, which raises awareness and much-needed funds for the national museum in Kabul. "Although we use these cliche terms for marketing purposes, these objects really do sing," said Simpson. "They show the fragility of cultural heritage and how the Afghans who saved them for the world have done such a fantastic job raising cultural awareness and showing there is much more to Afghanistan then the cliched news clips that you normally hear or see."

chatgpt: Afghanistan's National Museum has had a long history of suffering due to looting and unrest in the country. However, there have been moments of hope such as when 20 ivory artifacts were returned to the museum from the British Museum. These priceless relics, some between two and four thousand years old, were originally taken to the black market before being rescued and stored by the British Museum, where they have since been conserved. These returned artifacts now sit at the center of an exhibition named "Afghanistan: Crossroads of the Ancient World." The British Museum's exhibition is a collaboration with institutions and experts from Afghanistan, and seeks to showcase the beauty and in-depth history of the country. Additionally, the exhibit hopes to draw attention to the ongoing need for preservation of archaeological sites and objects, amidst continued looting and destruction in Afghanistan. The ivory artifacts themselves are nothing short of remarkable and tell tales of Afghan life and culture over the centuries. Several of the artifacts are intricately carved plaques that depict scenes of Afghan life and various religious and mythological images. A particular piece portrays the god Indra riding on an elephant, while another depicts an admiral surrounded by their warship’s crew. Conserving ancient ivory objects is a challenge because ivory is a sensitive material that can be easily damaged over time. The British Museum team used various techniques to restore the pieces to better condition. These included using special adhesives and consolidants to strengthen fragile areas, as well as creating storage facilities that regulate temperature and humidity to ensure the longevity of the exhibits. The ivory artifacts' return became possible due to collaboration from several organizations, including the British Museum, Afghan authorities, and the British Ambassador to Afghanistan. These organizations worked together to implement a new Memorandum of Understanding agreement that enabled an exchange in cultural material and artistic property. This exchange would have never taken place without the cooperation of the Afghan authorities. The National Museum, in conjunction with the Ministry of Information and Culture, housed the ivory artifacts before their looting, and played a crucial role in their safe return. The artifacts' return to Afghanistan reminds us all of the importance of valuing and preserving cultural heritage. This return is a significant victory in the fight against the illegal trade of cultural artifacts and represents an important step towards global cooperation. The British Museum's exhibition, “Afghanistan: Crossroads of the Ancient World,” shows the country's hidden treasures, including other precious objects and artworks. The exhibition presents a unique opportunity to learn more about Afghanistan's ancient past and to appreciate some of the country's cultural riches. Finally, the return of the ivory artifacts emphasizes the need for further efforts to preserve Afghanistan's cultural heritage. The current crisis in the country only emphasizes the importance of safeguarding priceless artworks, and this successful repatriation could encourage other countries with similarly looted objects to pursue campaigns to restore those items to the rightful owners.
