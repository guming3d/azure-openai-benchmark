article: (CNN) -- Frostbite has forced British adventurer Ranulph Fiennes to quit his attempt to cross the Antarctic in winter -- a challenge his team regarded as the coldest journey on earth. Tony Medniuk, the chairman of the expedition, said Fiennes' hand was frostbitten when he had to fix a loose ski binding with his bare hands in temperatures of around minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit). "It is the last remaining great polar challenge," Medniuk told CNN. "He was going to be on skis, in specially adapted clothing to withstand the temperatures, so that he would be the first person to actually ski across the Antarctic in winter." Fiennes' evacuation has been delayed by a blizzard but he is expected to be transported by skidoo to the Princess Elisabeth Station about 70 kilometers (44 miles) away from his current position. From there he will be flown to Novo to get a connecting flight to Cape Town. The other five members of the expedition will continue the journey without Fiennes as their leader, Medniuk said. They plan to travel almost 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) through icy wilderness mostly in complete darkness and in temperatures as low as minus 90 degrees Celsius. The journey is expected to take six months. A Norwegian team recently completed a winter crossing of the Arctic but this is the first attempt to traverse the Antarctic. Fiennes has previously been the first person to reach both the North and South Poles by land and the first to cross Antarctica on foot. The team set sail from London in December and were building a base camp and supply depot inland from Crown Bay when Fiennes developed the case of frostbite. They are due to begin the polar crossing as scheduled on March 21. Before his latest adventure, 68-year-old Fiennes described polar exploration as a drug or addiction. "Once you get bitten by polar records, you keep going for it," he told CNN. First woman to cross Antarctic solo: I've never felt so alone . Fiennes, who lost five fingers to frostbite on a previous expedition and also suffered heart problems during an attempt to climb Mt Everest, was sanguine about the risks of this adventure. "I don't think about not coming back, because I mean, more people get killed on the roads here [London] than they do in Antarctica. I mean, I had a massive heart attack reading a magazine on an airplane. You don't need to go to Antarctica to pop it." The expedition also aims to collect data on how climate change is affecting the Antarctic icecap in winter and raise $10 million for the blindness charity Seeing is Believing.

chatgpt: EXPLORER RANULPH FIENNES has been forced to abandon his attempt to become the first person to cross Antarctica in winter, after suffering frostbite in temperatures as low as minus 33C. The 68-year-old had been attempting to complete the 4,000km journey during the polar winter, which runs from March to September, but was forced to turn back after falling ill during a blizzard. In a statement released to the press, Fiennes explained that the frostbite had occurred after he attempted to fix a ski binding, and that he was "devastated" to have to leave the expedition. Despite this setback, the rest of Fiennes' team will continue on with the journey, which many are viewing as the last great polar challenge. Speaking to reporters, expedition leader Brian Newham said that while Fiennes' departure was a tough blow, the team would remain focused on the task ahead. "We're all gutted that Ran has had to leave us, but he's still with us in spirit," Newham said. "He's a true adventurer and we'll continue on with the knowledge that we're doing something that's never been done before." The crossing of Antarctica during the winter months is widely regarded as one of the toughest challenges in the world, with temperatures regularly dropping to minus 40C and winds reaching up to 80mph. On top of this, the expedition will be taking place in total darkness for much of its duration, with the sun not rising above the horizon for months at a time. Despite these incredible challenges, Fiennes and his team had remained determined to succeed, with the explorer describing the journey as "the last remaining great polar challenge". Announcing the expedition in 2018, Fiennes said that he wanted to "push the limits of human endurance" and inspire the next generation of explorers. But while his journey may have come to an unexpected end, Fiennes' legacy as one of the world's greatest living adventurers remains secure. Over the course of his career, Fiennes has completed a number of incredible feats, including becoming the oldest Briton to climb Everest and completing the first marathon on all seven continents in seven days. His work has earned him numerous accolades, including the Polar Medal and knighthood, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest explorers of all time. Despite this, Fiennes has always remained humble, and has often spoken about the importance of pushing oneself to new limits. In a statement, he said that he hoped his experience would inspire others to take on new challenges and push beyond their own perceived limitations. "It's been an incredible journey, and while it didn't end the way we wanted it to, I'm proud of what we've achieved," Fiennes said. "If there's one thing I hope people take from this experience, it's that anything is possible if you're willing to work hard and never give up."
