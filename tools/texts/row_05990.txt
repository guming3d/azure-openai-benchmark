The plight of the two lovers' has gripped audiences in deeply conservative Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Huda has defied both the wishes of her family, who said she could not marry Tahar,  and also dared to flee the country and follow him to Yemen. In court, she refused to accept a lawyer provided by the Saudi embassy, fearing pressure to return home. But Huda did accept to be represented by a lawyer appointed by a Yemeni non-government organisation called Hood, who said he hoped for a favourable outcome. 'This is a humanitarian case, and must not raise tensions between the two countries,' lawyer Abdel Rakib al-Qadi told AFP.

Niran, 22, fled from Saudi Arabia to Yemen with her Yemeni partner Arafat after her family refused to let them marry, her lawyer told Human Rights Watch . He indicated that Sanaa had come under pressure from the Saudi authorities to ensure Huda's return. She is currently under arrest and on trial for illegal entry. If found guilty, she faces expulsion. No decision was announced on Sunday, and the court set the next hearing for December 1 as it awaited a UN High Commissioner for Refugees ruling on a request for asylum. A UNHCR representative confirmed to AFP that Huda had initiated proceedings to be granted refugee status in Yemen. If she succeeds, it will be difficult for the authorities in Yemen to expel her. Huda's case has also come to the attention of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. On November 19, HRW urged Yemen not to repatriate her and to take into consideration the fact that returning to her family could put her life at risk. 'She fears physical harm from her family members, whom she said have beaten her in the past, if she is returned to Saudi Arabia,' HRW said in a statement.

chatgpt: Huda al-Niran has become an unlikely figurehead for the struggle for love in Yemen. The 22-year-old defied her family and crossed the border illegally to be with her beloved, Arafat Mohammed Tahar, 25. She appeared in court recently and pleaded to be allowed to stay in the country. The case has captured the hearts of many across the country who have followed her story anxiously. Supporters of Huda demonstrated outside the Sanaa courthouse as the trial against the young woman began. Huda had to leave her family behind when she decided to cross the border to be with Arafat, who lives in Yemen. Once there, she was quickly arrested and charged with illegal entry into the country. She now faces the prospect of being expelled from Yemen. Huda's story has brought attention to the harsh realities faced by those who defy traditional laws and customs in Yemen. Cultural and religious norms often dictate who one can and cannot marry in the country, leading many to choose between love and duty to their families. Huda's supporters argue that love should never be a crime, and that the country's laws should not be used to punish those who choose love over tradition. They hope that the court will see that Huda's situation is unique and that she deserves to be allowed to stay in the country. The case has also brought attention to the issue of illegal border crossings in Yemen. With the ongoing conflict in the country and the overall lack of security, it is not surprising that many people are taking matters into their own hands when it comes to crossing the border. As the trial continues, Huda's fate remains uncertain. However, her story has already sparked a national conversation about the importance of love and the need for change in Yemen's legal system. For Huda and her supporters, the hope is that this case will help pave the way for a brighter future, where love is not seen as a crime and cultural norms are not used as an excuse to deny someone their happiness. The case will continue to be a talking point for many months to come, and its ultimate resolution will be watched closely by all those who have been touched by Huda's story.
