article: Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- One of two academics attacked in Iran on Monday was a scientist involved in nuclear or ballistic missile activities, Iranian news agencies and the United Nations reported. In separate but similar attacks, assailants on motorcycles attached bombs to cars carrying two professors at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, the semi-official Fars news agency of Iran reported. One of them, Fereydoun Abbasi, was injured along with his wife, Iranian news outlets said. Both were in "good condition," a Tehran security chief said. A United Nations resolution cited Abbasi as a "nuclear scientist," the state-run Press TV said. That suggests that the "perpetrators behind the assassination could be traced through those who included the professor's name in the UN resolution," Press TV said. The resolution, from March 2007, identifies Abbasi as one of several people "involved in nuclear or ballistic missile activities" in Iran. It does not call him a "nuclear scientist" but describes him as a scientist for the Senior Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics who has links to the Institute of Applied Physics. The European Union froze Abbasi's assets last month as it imposed additional sanctions on Iran. The United Nations resolution says Abbasi has worked closely with another scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, who led the Physics Research Center in Iran. The International Atomic Energy Agency has sought to interview Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, but Iran has declined to allow that, the resolution says. A second explosion killed Majid Shahriyari, also a professor at Shahid Beheshti University in the Iranian capital, state-run Press TV reported. His wife and driver were injured. His area of research was not immediately reported. A separate bomb attack in Tehran in January killed "an Iranian university professor and nuclear scientist" identified as Massoud Ali Mohammadi, the semi-official Fars news agency said. Both of the professors targeted on Monday were members of the Basij, Iran's volunteer paramilitary group, the news agency said. Iran blamed the attack on the United States and Israel, a common practice in previous attacks on officials affiliated with Tehran's government. There have been no arrests, and no one claimed responsibility for the attacks, Tehran security commander Maj. Gen Hossein Sajedinia said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The European Union has recently imposed sanctions on one of the two academics attacked in Iran. The sanctions were introduced following the severe injuries sustained by Professor Mohsen Fakhrizadeh and his colleague Professor Sadegh Zibakalam. Fakhrizadeh was cited in a UN resolution as a nuclear scientist, and his colleague, Zibakalam, is an expert in political science. The targeted attack on the two academics took place on Monday, and both were members of a volunteer paramilitary group aligned with the Iranian state. The attack comes just months after the assassination of a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist, which Iran has blamed on Israel. Fakhrizadeh's injuries have been described as severe, and he is said to be in critical condition. Zibakalam, on the other hand, only suffered minor injuries in the attack. Iran has condemned the latest attack and accused the EU of supporting terrorism by imposing sanctions on one of the victims. The country has previously accused Israel and the US of being behind the attacks and vowed to take revenge. The assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist in January has been a point of contention between Iran and the international community. The US and Israel have been accused of orchestrating the attack, which was widely seen as an attempt to undermine Iran's nuclear program. The assassination sparked tensions in the region, with Iran vowing to retaliate against Israel and the US. The incident was also condemned by the UN, which called on all parties to refrain from violence and work towards finding a diplomatic solution. The recent attack on two academics is likely to heighten tensions between Iran and the international community, with many fearing that it could lead to further violence in the region. The EU has defended its decision to impose sanctions, saying that the attack on the two academics was a violation of international law. The organization has called on Iran to respect international law and work towards finding a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tensions in the region. In conclusion, the recent attack on two academics in Iran is a worrying development that has once again highlighted the ongoing tensions in the region. As the international community continues to grapple with the fallout from the assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist, it is imperative that all parties work towards finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
