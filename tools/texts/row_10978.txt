article: Roger Rodas' widow is suing Porsche for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of her race car driver husband and actor Paul Walker. Kristine Rodas filed the suit this week against Porsche Cars North America, citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40-year-old "Fast and the Furious" star on November 30 in Santa Clarita, California. Backed by celebrity attorney Mark Geragos, she is also suing for product liability and wrongful death. Roger Rodas, 38 at the time of his death, spent his competitive racing career driving Porsche cars. According to the court documents, he and Walker first met on the race track when Rodas was driving a Porsche owned by the actor. A few years later the two men formed the racing team Always Evolving Racing, where they were both drivers. "Although Mr. Rodas had a passion for cars, Mr. Rodas was first and foremost dedicated to his family, his wife, Kristine, and their two young children," the complaint states. The court documents filed by Kristine Rodas describe the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT that her husband was driving as a an "ultra-high-performance-super-sports car for the road," that goes from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 205 miles per hour. The complaint argues that such a high-powered sports car should have a higher standard of crash protection, and that a mechanical malfunction forced Rodas to veer off the road. Geragos also hired investigators to evaluate wreckage at the scene, who determined that Rodas was driving 55 mph before the vehicle went out of control. This contradicts the Los Angeles County coroner's report that car was speeding at more than 100 mph, and the investigations by the Los Angeles County Sherriff's Office and California Highway Patrol that focused on speed. Porsche pointed to the discrepancy. "As you know, the crash was subject of a very detailed investigation by the authorities, both the California Highway Patrol and the L.A. County Sheriff's Office," said Bernd Harling, Head of Public Relations for Porsche Cars North America. "The reports showed that driving at a high speed in a negligent manner caused the crash. Both concluded that there was no mechanical defect of the vehicle involved." "Their investigation disproves in the allegations in the lawsuit." Harling added that since the crash is now the subject of litigation, Porsche will not comment on it further. He expressed his sincere condolences for the Rodas and Walker families' losses. Walker's former publicist Ame Van Iden does not have information about whether the Walker family is also considering legal action against Porsche. Walker is survived by his parents, Cheryl Walker and Paul Walker Sr., four siblings and 15-year-old daughter, Meadow.

chatgpt: Automaker Porsche is now facing a lawsuit over the tragic death of "Fast and Furious" star Paul Walker and his friend, professional race car driver Roger Rodas. Rodas' widow, Kristine, has filed a lawsuit against the German car manufacturer, citing negligence, product liability, and wrongful death. Back in November 2013, Paul Walker and Rodas were killed in a fatal crash while driving in a Porsche Carrera GT. The pair were attending a charity event in Santa Clarita, California when the car lost control, crashed into a tree, and burst into flames. Both men died instantly as a result of the crash. In her lawsuit, Kristine Rodas accuses Porsche of knowingly creating a car with a flawed design that made it prone to instability and loss of control. The car was also allegedly missing key safety features, which could have prevented the accident or reduced the severity of the injuries. Porsche has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing or liability for the incident. The company insists that the car in question, the Carrera GT, is a high-performance sports car that requires considerable skill and experience to drive safely. Porsche's statement also pointed out that the car had passed multiple rigorous tests and met all relevant safety standards prior to its release. Despite Porsche's defense, many experts and enthusiasts have criticized the design of the Carrera GT, citing its notoriously difficult handling and tendency towards oversteering. Some have claimed that the car was "dangerous," even in the hands of highly skilled drivers like Rodas. It's also worth noting that this was not the first high-profile incident involving a Carrera GT - several other accidents and fatalities have been linked to the car in the past. Kristine Rodas is seeking unspecified damages from Porsche, alleging that the company's negligence and disregard for safety led to her husband's untimely death. The lawsuit is likely to generate significant controversy and public scrutiny, given the high profile of the victims and the perceived risks associated with high-performance sports cars like the Carrera GT. The case also raises broader questions about the responsibilities of car manufacturers with regards to the safety of their products. With more and more emphasis being placed on self-driving cars and automated safety features, it's crucial for manufacturers to ensure that their products are both effective and safe to use in the hands of the average driver. The outcome of this lawsuit may well set a precedent for future cases where automakers are held accountable for accidents caused by issues with their vehicles - making it a case worth keeping a close eye on.
