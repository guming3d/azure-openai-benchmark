chatgpt: A daredevil circus performer suffered burns and a dislocated shoulder after a charity stunt went awry on Saturday. Antony Britton, known for his death-defying stunts, was attempting to escape from a strait-jacket suspended from burning ropes. However, strong winds caused the ropes to burn more quickly than anticipated, leading to a frightening experience for the audience members who watched on. The stunt took place at a charity event in central London, and Britton had been planning the stunt for weeks. He reportedly wanted to raise money for a local children's charity, and believed his stunt would draw a large crowd and more donations. The stunt was planned to take place in front of a large, outdoor audience, and Britton had rehearsed the escape many times before the event. Despite the setback, Britton remained in good spirits after the incident. He spoke to reporters from his hospital bed, saying, "I've had worse injuries from stunts in the past. It's all part of the job. I'm just glad nobody else was hurt." Britton has been performing dangerous stunts for over a decade, and has built up a large following of fans who enjoy watching his daredevil feats. He has previously escaped from strait-jackets while being submerged in water, and has been set on fire during other stunts. Britton's latest stunt involved suspending himself from burning ropes, while bound in a strait-jacket. The ropes were set to burn for a set amount of time, giving the performer enough time to escape before the ropes became too brittle. However, the strong winds caused the ropes to burn faster than expected, which led to Britton's injuries. Despite the setback, Britton is reportedly undeterred, and is already planning his next stunt. He told reporters that he plans to perform a similar stunt in the future, but will take extra precautions to ensure that everything goes according to plan. The audience was understandably shaken up after the incident, and many expressed their concern for the performer. However, they also praised Britton for his bravery, and for his dedication to raising money for charity. The charity event continued after the incident, and many of the attendees donated money to the children's charity on the spot. The event organizers also thanked Britton for his contributions, and promised to work with him again in the future. Overall, Britton's stunt may not have gone exactly according to plan, but it did succeed in drawing attention to an important cause. His bravery and dedication to charity are admirable, and his fans will undoubtedly look forward to seeing what he has in store for his next death-defying stunt.
