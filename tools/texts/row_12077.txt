article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- "The email of the species is deadlier than the mail." So wrote the British actor and novelist Stephen Fry. Is the electronic age throwing sand in the face of the traditional postcard? Tell CNN Business Traveller what you think in the Sound Off box below. Yet, we book our holidays online, we check in online, and, now we even write about our travels online -- emails and blogs packed with photos, video clips and every conceivable detail of our travels. Where does this online explosion leave the humble postcard? In the "good old days" we sat and crafted our cards. Saucy for the colleagues at work, respectful to the relatives, begrudging to the next door neighbor. And always: How to write as much as possible in the tiny white square without spreading over in to the address section. And hoping the postman back home wouldn't mind the paella stains all over the address. Many of us still value the traditional postcard. According to the Royal Mail, which runs Britain's postal service, postcards are more popular today than they were five years ago. The service says it processes around 135 million postcards every year, 30 million more than in 2003. But it's a fact that some people do sniff at snail mail tales from the tropics. Why bother waiting when sending texts with pictures, video, emails by Blackberry will rub in the fact that "We're on Holiday and You're Not!" with greater immediacy.

chatgpt: CNN Business Traveller is reaching out to its audience to ask if they still send postcards when traveling or if they've switched to a more modern form of communication. With the speed and convenience of writing an email or posting on social media, it's understandable why sending a postcard is becoming a less popular option.  However, many people still see the charm and personal touch in sending a postcard. It's something tangible, that can be kept as a souvenir or displayed as a reminder of the trip. Some argue that the time and effort put into finding a postcard and writing a message is worth it for the joy it brings to the recipient.  On the other hand, digital communication offers its own benefits. It's instant, and can reach a larger audience with ease. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have become popular tools for travelers to share their experiences, with photos and updates that are accessible to friends and family at home.  So, the question remains â€“ do you still send postcards when traveling or have you fully embraced the digital age? CNN Business Traveller is asking its audience to leave a comment with their thoughts on the matter. The best comments will be published, giving readers the opportunity to share their perspective. Some may argue that the act of sending a postcard is a nostalgic experience that should be kept alive, while others may argue that the practicality of digital communication should take precedence. Whatever your opinion, CNN Business Traveller wants to know what you think. In conclusion, whether you still send postcards or have embraced digital communication, both have their own benefits and drawbacks. It's up to each individual to decide what works best for them when traveling. However, the discussion sparked by CNN Business Traveller's question is an opportunity to ponder the evolution of communication in the modern world, and the role nostalgia and sentimentality play in our lives.
