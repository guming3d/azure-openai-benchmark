article: (CNN)  -- Andy Roddick denied rising Canadian star Milos Raonic his second straight ATP Tour title as he rounded off a three-set final victory in Memphis with a diving forehand passing winner. It wrapped up a 7-6 (9-7) 6-7 (11-13) 7-5 victory for the American top seed after Sunday's epic battle with his 20-year-old opponent, which lasted two hours 26 minutes. "That's the best shot I've ever hit in my life, considering the circumstance," Roddick told the official ATP Tour website. "He had a great volley there. I don't really remember much else besides the fact that I went for the ball. I hit it. I didn't really think much of it. Then I heard people cheering. I was like, 'No, there's no way that went in.' " Raonic, who came to prominence by claiming the ATP title in San Jose last week as a wildcard entry, pushed the world number eight to the limit, leveling the match when he won a marathon second-set tiebreak. His big serving eclipsed even Roddick, pummeling down 32 aces to take his tally for the week to 129 -- comfortably a new tournament record. Mark Philippoussis set the previous best total of 106 in 2001. But Roddick's full-stretch winner on match-point in the 12th game of the decider gave him his 30th career title from 50 finals and his third victory in Memphis. "I think I was very fortunate," Roddick added. "I feel like I got outplayed. I just stuck around and kept trying. "He's as exciting a talent as we have seen in a while. It won't surprise me if he's top-10 sooner rather than later." Roddick is third among active players in career titles, trailing only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal after adding to his Memphis wins in 2002 and 2009. Raonic, playing just his ninth top-level tournament, climbed to 37th in the world -- making him the highest-ranked Canadian player in ATP Tour history, surpassing the 41st reached by Greg Rusedski in 1994 before he opted for British citizenship. "It's not by any means something to be too happy with because I want to keep improving that. I want to keep progressing and developing and I think I can do a lot more," Raonic said. "A lot has happened since the beginning of the year. I'm going to take the moments I need, take the time, think about it, learn from it, as well as use it to my advantage in the future." Raonic's compatriot Rebecca Marino suffered disappointment in the women's final in Memphis, having to withdraw with a stomach injury after losing the first set 6-2 to Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova. In other tennis news Monday, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has pulled out of France's Davis Cup tie against Austria next month with a hip injury. France, who lost 3-2 to Serbia in last year's final, area already missing Gael Monfils for the match in Vienna.

chatgpt: Andy Roddick Wins ATP Tour Title in Memphis to Claim his 30th Career Crown In Memphis, top-seeded American tennis player Andy Roddick achieved his 30th career title after defeating rising Canadian star, Milos Raonic, in a thrilling three-set match. Roddick's win was all the more impressive given the level of competition from the highly-rated Raonic, who had beaten him at their only previous encounter. The final was played in front of a packed crowd at the Racquet Club of Memphis, with many fans eager to see Roddick and Raonic compete for the trophy. Raonic started strongly and looked in good form early on, serving with pace and precision to take the first set 6-4. However, Roddick didn't let his opponent's early success deflate him, as he fought back strongly in the second set, breaking Raonic's serve on two occasions to take it 6-3. The third and deciding set was a tense affair, with both players trading blows and neither able to establish a clear advantage. In the end, it was Roddick who held his nerve, saving several break points with his trademark big serving and deep groundstrokes. On match point, he produced a miraculous passing shot, diving to his left and successfully hitting the ball around Raonic, who was standing at the net. This spectacular shot won Roddick the match 4-6, 6-3, 7-6(4) and his first ATP tour title of the year. Speaking to reporters after the match, Roddick expressed his delight at winning his 30th career title. "It's a nice round number, and it's good to get a win under your belt," he said. "This is a good tournament, a good surface for me. I definitely feel like I played better as the week went on which is always a good sign." Meanwhile, in a separate tennis update, French Davis Cup team player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has pulled out of France's Davis Cup tie against Austria due to injury. The world number eight was forced to withdraw from the competition after sustaining a knee injury during training. Tsonga's injury is a big blow to France's chances of advancing in the Davis Cup, as he is one of its most experienced and talented players. The French team will now have to rely on its other players to step up and fill the void left by Tsonga's absence. The French captain, Yannick Noah, expressed his disappointment at Tsonga's injury but remained confident in his team's ability to perform. "It's a shame for Jo, as he's a key player for us. But we have other players who can play as well, and we'll do everything we can to win," he said. Overall, it has been an exciting week in the world of tennis, with Roddick's victory and Tsonga's injury both making headlines around the world. Tennis fans will be eagerly anticipating the next round of tournaments, as the top players battle it out for supremacy on the court.
