article: By . Emily Crane . Prison guards have taken to wearing lapel-mounted cameras to capture violent outbursts from prisoners in New Zealand's toughest jails. The disturbing video footage shows prisoners threatening guards and staff responding to fights in maximum and high-security areas of Rimutaka and Auckland prisons. The smartphone-sized on-body cameras are part of a new six-month trial to increase guard and prisoner safety and help in gathering evidence. Scroll down for video . The smartphone-sized on-body cameras being used in Rimutaka and Auckland prisons captured the moment a man, who is known for assaulting staff, refused to hang up the phone after lock up . Footage collected from inside the prisons was shown for the first time on Wednesday to New Zealand politicians, stuff.co.nz reports. Two prisoners were filmed yelling abuse at guards after they were told to stop using prison phones. One was told to hang up because he became abusive to his partner on the other end. The other man, who is known for assaulting staff, refused to hang up after lock up. 'You're f****** lucky you're wearing that camera,' he yelled to guard as he returned to his cell. The cameras are also being used to collect evidence and in one case the guards found a sharp weapon in the drain of a shower after an inmate was stabbed . Soon after, prison guards recorded footage of scratches on the ground showing the weapon had been sharpened in another cell . In another incident, guards were captured running to break up a prisoner fight in a maximum security unit. They restrained one prisoner as he lashed out yelling 'Give me arm and I'll f*** you up'. The cameras are also being used to collect evidence and in one case the guards found a sharp weapon in the drain of a shower after an inmate was stabbed. Footage of scratches on the ground showed evidence of the weapon being sharpened in another cell. This inmate was told to hang up the prison phone because he became abusive to his partner on the other end . Prison guards said the camera had a clear impact on the inmate's behaviour. Ending phone calls can often end in violent outbursts and assaults, according to staff . Corrections Minister Anne Tolley said in most cases the camera acted as a deterrent for escalated, violent behaviour. 'I'm not sure anyone's ever made public film taken from inside a prison, but we thought it was interesting enough to show how technology can be used to protect our staff and also improve behaviour,' she said. 'If we can improve behaviour and management of prisonersâ€¦ it keeps staff safe and keeps (prisoners) safe. 'I've been in and out of prisons and talked with prisoners, but not normally in those sorts of circumstances.' In one incident the cameras captured guards running to break up a prisoner fight in a maximum security unit. The prisoner lashed out yelling 'Give me arm and I'll f*** you up'

chatgpt: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, smartphone-sized on-body cameras have been introduced into two of New Zealand's largest prisons to increase guard safety and improve evidence collection practices. The cameras were made a part of a six-month trial and have already captured footage of violent outbursts by prisoners from the Rimutaka and Auckland prisons. In footage released earlier this week, prisoners can be seen acting out and engaging in violent behavior, often towards guards or other inmates. The cameras have been hailed as a significant step towards combating prison violence and ensuring the safety of both prisoners and prison staff. The on-body cameras, which are similar in size to smartphones, are worn on vests by the guards and provide a first-person perspective of their environment. They can record for up to 12 hours and are equipped with night vision and audio recording capabilities. The footage can then be used to identify violent incidents, improve training for prison staff, and even help in the prosecution of criminals. According to the Department of Corrections, the new cameras have already had a significant impact on the safety of both guards and inmates. Three months into the trial, there had been a measurable decrease in violent incidents, with some prisons reporting up to a 50% reduction in assaults. "The use of on-body cameras is a crucial part of our efforts to reduce prison violence and ensure the safety of all those who enter our prisons," said a spokesperson for the department. "The footage we have collected so far has helped us identify key areas for improvement, both in terms of facility design and staff training." The cameras have also been praised by prisoners' rights groups, who say that they have the potential to improve transparency and accountability within the prison system. "There has been a long-standing issue of abuse and mistreatment within New Zealand prisons, and these cameras may be an important step towards addressing that," said a spokesperson for the Human Rights Foundation. The introduction of the cameras comes at a time when prison violence is a growing concern in New Zealand. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of assaults on prison staff, and many argue that the current system is failing both guards and inmates. However, the use of on-body cameras is not without controversy. Some argue that they infringe on the privacy of prisoners and that the footage could be used to unfairly prosecute inmates. Additionally, there are concerns that the cameras could lead to an increase in violence as prisoners may see them as a sign of mistrust and become more confrontational as a result. Despite these concerns, the trial is set to continue, with the Department of Corrections committed to exploring alternative strategies to reduce prison violence. "We understand that the introduction of on-body cameras may not be the solution to all of our problems," said the spokesperson. "However, we believe that it is an important step towards creating a safer and more accountable prison system for everyone involved."
