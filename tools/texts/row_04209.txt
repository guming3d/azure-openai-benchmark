article: Arsenal were left feeling red-faced on Wednesday night after not only falling to a humiliating defeat at the hands of Monaco, but also hyping themselves up in pre-game banter between them and their French opponents on social media. The Gunners face an uphill battle to qualify for the last eight of the Champions League after a heavy 3-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium, but prior to the game they were certainly confident - with the club's social media team expressing that in abundance on their official Twitter account. They began the exchange simply with: 'And how about you @AS_Monaco? Feeling confident? Nervous? Worried?' Arsenal and Monaco engaged in Twitter banter on their respective accounts prior to Wednesday night's game . Alexis Sanchez had scored in his last four Champions League games at the Emirates prior to facing Monaco . The Ligue 1 side responded candidly by merely stating they were 'just feeling excited to play in such a big match', before the Gunners upped the ante by asking which player they should look out for - with star name Falcao now on Manchester United's books. The French team then asked if Dimitar Berbatov would fit the bill, adding that the Gunners fans were very complementary of him during his time at north London rivals Tottenham. While admitting they knew all too well of the veteran striker's talents, the north Londoners quashed his impact by stating former striker Nicklas Bendtner made the difference that day when Berbatov hit the net for Spurs in a derby meeting in December 2007. Former Tottenham man Dimitar Berbatov enjoyed his second-half strike which put the game beyond Arsenal . Oliver Giroud and Mesur Ozil cannot fail to hide their gloom after Berbatov's crucial goal . Arsene Wenger endured a night to forget against his former side Monaco at the Emirates . The next reply from Arsenal would come back to haunt them as they sent the French side a graphic of star striker Alexis Sanchez, with the stat that he had scored in his last four Champions League games at the Emirates prior to Wednesday night's clash. The French side had the last word though, and in superb fashion, thanking Arsenal for their warning but reminding Arsene Wenger's men that they had - and still do have - the best defensive record in the Champions League - conceding just once in the group stages. A number of Arsenal fans asked for the club to stop engaging in the Twitter banter throughout the exchanges, believing it could jinx their chances before the game even started. Unfortunately for them they were proved right, as the Gunners suffered a heavy defeat with Berbatov and Co having the last laugh.

chatgpt: Arsenal's hopes of a Champions League quarterfinal appearance were dashed on Wednesday night as they lost 3-1 to Monaco at the Emirates stadium. Despite engaging in pre-match banter with the French side, the Gunners were unable to deliver a win in the last-16 knockout tie. The atmosphere at the Emirates was charged up ahead of the match, with Arsenal fans and players alike confident of a victory against Monaco. The club had engaged in pre-match trash talk, with midfielder Aaron Ramsey even suggesting that the Ligue 1 side would buckle under pressure. However, it was Monaco who had the last laugh as they outplayed Arsenal on the pitch, scoring three goals to secure a comfortable victory. The Gunners, who were without star player Alexis Sanchez due to injury, struggled to create clear-cut chances throughout the match. Monaco took the lead in the 38th minute of the game through former Tottenham Hotspur player Dimitar Berbatov, who capitalized on some poor defending from the Arsenal backline. The Bulgarian striker calmly slotted the ball past Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina to put the home side ahead. Arsenal tried to respond in the second half, but their attacks were easily dealt with by the Monaco defense. The French side doubled their lead in the 53rd minute, with winger Yannick Carrasco firing a low shot into the net from outside the box. The Gunners managed to pull one back through Alex Oxlade Chamberlain, but their hopes of a comeback were dashed just a few minutes later. Monaco striker Lucas Ocampos scored their third goal of the game, securing a comfortable win for the visitors. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left disappointed by his side's performance, admitting that they were outplayed by Monaco. "We were not good enough defensively, we gave them too much room to counter-attack," he said after the game. The loss means that Arsenal are now out of the Champions League and face an uphill battle to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League. They currently sit in third place, with Manchester United and Liverpool hot on their heels. Monaco, meanwhile, are in a strong position to progress to the quarterfinals of the competition after their impressive win at the Emirates. The French side will be hoping to replicate their form in the next round of the tournament, where they could face the likes of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or Barcelona.
