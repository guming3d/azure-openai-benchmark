"It was a harsh decision, but it's something he'll learn from," Rodgers said in his post-match press conference. "Lazar is a talented player, and we'll continue to develop him and support him going forward." Markovic himself took to social media to apologize for the red card. "I would like to apologize to my teammates, the fans, and everyone associated with Liverpool FC for my sending off tonight," the Serbian wrote on Instagram.
