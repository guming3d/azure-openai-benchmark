Robert Blasetti, a resident of Long Island, was reportedly in good spirits when he suddenly fell to the ground. Emergency medical personnel rushed to his aid, but unfortunately, they were unable to revive him. Blasetti was pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of his death was not immediately clear. This was the second death at the annual Halloween parade, which draws thousands of people to the streets of New York City each year. A civilian NYPD employee also suffered an apparent heart attack and passed away on the job. The deaths cast a pall over what is typically a joyous and celebratory event, with many parade-goers expressing shock and sadness at the loss of life. Some attendees said they felt the parade should be cancelled as a sign of respect. However, organizers pressed ahead with the festivities, acknowledging the tragedies but emphasizing the importance of carrying on with tradition. "The Halloween parade has been a fixture of this city for decades, and we believe it's important to keep it going," said Patrick Ryan, a spokesperson for the parade. "At the same time, we want to express our condolences to the families of those who passed away." Blasetti's wife, who was also in costume at the parade, was said to be in "deep shock" following the incident. The couple had been married for 43 years and were known for their love of Halloween. The NYPD has not released the identity of the civilian employee who died at the parade. Both deaths are still under investigation.
