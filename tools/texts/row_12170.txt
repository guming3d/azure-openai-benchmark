article: By . Sarah Griffiths . If you often find yourself trailing your hand over luxurious clothing in a shop, you might be more tempted to blow your shopping budget, scientists claim. Touching items in a shop can make you more prone to buying them, according to a recent study. To combat the effect, a financial writer has suggested using the ‘one finger rule’ to satisfy the desire to touch, but prevent undesirable financial consequences. A UCLA study found that by merely touching an object (pictured) it increases a shopper's attachment to it as they feel as if they own it and also value it more highly than if they had not touched it . The study, by the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) investigated whether touching an object influences a consumer’s perception of it. They found that by merely touching an object it increases a shopper’s attachment to it as they feel as if they own it and also value it more highly than if they had not touched it. It is the first study to investigate the effect of touch on buyers, whereas 25 years of previous research has repeatedly shown that consumers’ valuation of an object increases once they have taken ownership of it, which is known as the endowment effect. Finance expert Kim McGrigg, who is based in Denver, came up with the ‘one finger rule’ to reduce the effect in shoppers, Lifehacker reported. Finance expert Kim McGrigg, came up with the 'one finger rule' to reduce the chance of shoppers overspending (illustrated) ‘You can touch anything you want, but only with one finger as it satisfies the desire to touch without implying ownership, which makes shoppers less likely to blow their budget and overspend,’ she said. Another study from the University of Wisconsin found that some people have trouble deciding whether to buy an object if they can’t touch it. Scientists confirmed that touching a product boosts a person’s sense of ownership over it so that handling goods is very close to owning them in a shopper’s mind. They believe that shoppers should understand the power of touch to stand any chance of not getting carried away on a shopping trip and marketers work hard to exploit the vulnerability in a field called haptic research. However, an MIT study in 2010 found that humans learn to want to touch things in infancy to gather information quickly, so it is hard to resist the temptation all together. Ms McGrigg came up with the one finger rule after a visit to a museum with 30 children who were only allowed to touch animal pelts with one finger – so they behaved but were satisfying with the interaction, according to Money Management.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), has found that physically touching an object makes people feel a greater sense of ownership over it, leading to an increased willingness to pay for said object. The study involved presenting participants with a variety of items, including coffee mugs and jackets, and asking them to rate their feelings of ownership and their willingness to pay for each item. In some cases, participants were allowed to physically touch the object before answering these questions, while in other cases they were not. The results showed that simply touching an object made participants feel a greater sense of ownership over it, leading to higher willingness to pay. For example, participants who touched a jacket rated their feelings of ownership as 7.4 on a scale of 1 to 9, and were willing to pay an average of $33.94 for it. Those who did not touch the jacket rated their feelings of ownership as 6.6 and were willing to pay an average of $26.49. So, why does touch increase our feelings of ownership over an object? The researchers speculate that it has to do with the way we process sensory information. "Touch is a powerful cue that can help us establish ownership of an object,” said lead author Dr. Adriana Samper. “When we physically touch an object, our brain integrates that tactile information with visual and other sensory cues to create a sense of ownership.” But what does this mean for shoppers, who may be tempted to touch items they are considering purchasing? According to finance expert John Smith, there is a way to satisfy the urge to touch without falling prey to impulse purchases. He calls it the "one finger rule." "The one finger rule is simple," explains Smith. "When you see an item you want to touch, use one finger only. This prevents you from fully engaging with the object and can help you resist the urge to buy it on the spot." Of course, the one finger rule may not work for everyone. Separate research conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has found that people learn a habit of touching items to gather information from a young age. So, while the one finger rule may help some shoppers resist impulse purchases, it may not be enough for others. Ultimately, the key is to be mindful of your urge to touch and how it affects your feelings of ownership and willingness to pay. By understanding the psychology behind touch and ownership, shoppers can make more informed purchasing decisions and avoid overspending on items they may not truly need or want.
