Google must move its mystery barge from a construction site on an island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay because the permits are not in order, a state official said Monday. The notice came after the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission investigated numerous complaints about the construction of the floating, four-story building, commission executive director Larry Goldzband said. The investigation found that neither the Treasure Island Development Authority nor the city of San Francisco had applied for required permits for the work to be done at the site. Barge out: A state agency says Google must move its mystery barge from a construction site on an island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay because the permits are not in order . Goldzband said Google can resolve the issue by moving the barge to one of the fully permitted construction facilities in the San Francisco Bay. 'It needs to move,' he said. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Preliminary planning documents submitted to the port last fall showed plans for Google to build an interactive space for people to learn about technology. Has to move: Google is erecting a four-story structure in the heart of the San Francisco Bay but is managing to conceal its purpose by constructing it on docked barges instead of on land, where city building permits and public plans are mandatory . Mystery buildings: The barge is one of three mysterious floating structures that have sparked online speculation. There are three secretive structures, two in San Francisco and one Portland, Maine . The documents ended months of speculation that the barge would be a party boat, data storage center or a store for Google to sell its Internet-connected glasses. Google has had little to say about the barge or another vessel off the East Coast. In November, the company issued a statement that said, 'Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.' Goldzband said the construction in San Francisco Bay was not authorized by the agency, and the Treasure Island Development Authority, which allowed the project, could face fines and enforcement proceedings. The disclosure by the California agency marked the second set of permit problems for the barge project. Late last year, work was halted after the Coast Guard said additional permits were needed.

chatgpt: Google is facing a hurdle in its ambitions to construct a futuristic space in the middle of the San Francisco Bay. The search giant has been served notice by the San Francisco Bay authorities, asking the company to move a barge it has stationed at an unauthorized location. The authorities claim that Google has not obtained the necessary permits to construct the barge at its present location. According to official sources, Google can resolve the issue by moving the barge to one of the permitted construction facilities established by the bay authorities. However, it is not clear whether the move will change the outcome of the project or affect the timelines. Interestingly, Google has remained tight-lipped about the proposed use of the barge. The company initially announced that it was exploring options to use the barge as an interactive space. However, Google has refused to provide further details about the project, leaving many to speculate about the real purpose of the space. The barge has remained a mystery since it first appeared on the San Francisco Bay in 2013. The four-story tall structure, which some reports suggest cost around $4 million, has been the source of much curiosity and speculation from locals and industry watchers alike. Some observers have speculated that the barge could be used as a floating data center, while others have suggested that it could be used as an event space to attract high-profile guests. Despite the speculation, Google has been mum on the subject, maintaining that it is only exploring potential uses of the space. However, the company's latest run-in with the San Francisco Bay authorities may add another wrinkle to the mystery surrounding the barge. Interestingly, this is not the first time that Google has faced regulatory issues in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2014, Google's self-driving cars caused a sensation when they were spotted on the public roads of Mountain View. The company was later fined for operating the vehicles without the proper permits from the California DMV. However, Google has always remained a formidable player in the tech industry, with projects ranging from search to artificial intelligence. It remains to be seen how this latest development will affect the company's plans for the barge in the San Francisco Bay, but one thing is for sure â€“ the structure remains one of the most talked-about projects in the area, even though it has been shrouded in secrecy for years.
