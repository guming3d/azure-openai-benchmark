article: (CNN) -- In death, as in life, the two brothers were inseparable. Connor Barthe, 6, the loud protective big brother with a wicked smile and deep dimples. Noah, the little albeit quieter one, who wanted to play basketball when he grew up. Their Canadian community of Campbellton, New Brunswick, eulogized the boys Saturday, days after they were strangled to death by an African rock python. The 100-pound snake came crashing through the ceiling of a family friend's apartment, where they were having a sleepover Monday. "How can we prepare for such a service? There's not really any way to prepare," Father Maurice Frenette, the interim pastor at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, told CBC News. At the altar, the brothers smiled broadly in a picture, leaning against each other. Family members described them as sharing a close bond. They were best friends and shared everything, including their love of video games. Police: Boys killed by snake died from asphyxiation . "Boys, oh boys, we loved those boys," family friend Melissa Ellis said, according to CBC News. The two were visiting the home of Jean-Claude Savoie, who owns a pet store, when the tragic incident happened. The python was kept in a glass enclosure similar to an aquarium, but slithered into the ventilation system. It was above the living room, where the boys were sleeping, when the ceiling caved in. Savoie's son was asleep in another room, but was not harmed, CBC News reported. The city's deputy mayor expressed his condolences and asked the community not to rush to judgment. African rock pythons are not allowed in the province , the Department of Natural Resources told CBC News . "Mr. Savoie, he is a human being and you know, he is suffering, he is grieving, so everyone is grieving as well for Mr. Savoie," Ian Comeau said. As questions surround the incident, the family says the are forever changed. "Were they taken from us too soon? Absolutely. But how much time would have been enough?" said Nadine Poirier, who delivered the eulogy. The funeral service concluded with a somber rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" as the procession walked out. And as a symbol of their brotherly bond, they were laid to rest in a single, pale blue casket.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck a small community when two young brothers, Noah and Connor Barthe, aged 4 and 6, were killed by a python in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The boys had been at a sleepover at a family friend's apartment, where the python was being kept in an enclosure. Investigators are still trying to determine how the snake managed to escape from its enclosure and reach the boys. The two boys were reportedly sharing a mattress on the floor in the living room when the attack occurred. Emergency services were called to the scene immediately and tried to revive the boys, but sadly they were pronounced dead at the apartment. The family of the boys released a statement through their lawyer, which said: "Noah and Connor were energetic, adventurous, and lovable boys who were deeply loved by their parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. The family is absolutely devastated by this tragedy and is struggling to come to terms with the loss of these two beautiful children." The community has rallied around the family during this difficult time, with neighbors and school friends offering their condolences and support. The boys were laid to rest in a single casket at a private funeral service attended by family and close friends. The ceremony was filled with tears as family members eulogized the two young boys, who had so much life ahead of them. The incident has sparked a debate about the keeping of exotic animals as pets. Animal experts have warned that certain species, such as pythons, can pose a significant danger to humans, especially children. Investigations into the incident are still ongoing, and it is not yet clear if charges will be filed in connection with the boys' deaths. In the meantime, the community continues to mourn the loss of two young lives that were taken far too soon. Their family and loved ones are left to pick up the pieces and try to come to terms with the unimaginable pain of their loss.
