article: (CNN) -- Mark Zuckerberg believes that connectivity is a human right. Or at least that's how he's framing his new project, Internet.org, a partnership with leading companies in the smartphone industry to bring Internet access to the developing world. You could be generous and call this enlightened self-interest, but more likely, Internet.org is a canny business move dressed up to sound like charity. In his overly earnest manifesto about the project, Zuckerberg declares, "For almost ten years, Facebook has been on a mission to make the world more open and connected. For us, that means the entire world â€” not just the richest, most developed countries. We've made good progress, and today we connect more than 1.15 billion people through Facebook each month. But as we started thinking about connecting the next 5 billion people, we realized something important: the vast majority of people in the world don't have any access to the internet." In other words, how do we help these people become our customers? Companies that support Internet.org include Ericsson, Mediatek, Opera, Samsung, Nokia and Qualcomm. They make their money building smartphones or the systems and services that help them run. Internet.org has a three-part plan for achieving its goal. 1. Develop cheaper means of access, specifically low-cost smartphones. 2. Find data efficiencies that will allow services like Facebook to work with less bandwidth. 3. Create business models that will incentivize companies of all types to provide cheaper, more plentiful Internet access in the targeted regions. While this outline sounds refreshing, the fact is, Facebook and its partners have been pursuing them quite actively already. Internet.org is simply benevolent branding on what these companies were hard at work doing. Samsung and Nokia, for example, have been pushing their way into developing markets with low-cost smartphones. In terms of data efficiency, Facebook has developed two projects, Facebook Zero and Facebook on Every Phone, which allow the social network to run on feature phones with little bandwidth. These apps have propelled Facebook's recent growth in Africa and Mexico. New business models have emerged in regions like the Philippines, Mexico and Egypt, where Facebook partnered with handset makers and mobile carriers to preload its services onto phones in exchange for incentivizing upgrades and more expensive data plans. Will Zuckerberg's new initiative operate differently than these existing ventures? The name certainly implies so. The .org domain it uses in its name is one of the original top-level domains created specifically for nonprofits. Today, it is also used by academic institutions, open-source and community projects, and the philanthropic parts of for-profit corporations. A number of articles mistakenly referred to Internet.org as a nonprofit. It's easy to see how they were confused. In the opening lines of his essay about the new project, Zuckerberg writes, "It may not actually be proï¬ .

chatgpt: Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO and co-founder of Facebook, has announced his latest initiative to bring internet access to developing countries. The project, named "Internet.org," aims to increase the availability of basic internet services in low-income regions of the world, with the long-term goal of connecting two-thirds of the global population who are currently not connected to the internet. However, some critics are skeptical of Zuckerberg's true intentions. According to Ben Popper, a journalist based in Brooklyn, Internet.org is not a nonprofit, as many people have assumed, but rather a clever business move dressed up to sound like charity. In a recent op-ed for the technology website The Verge, Popper argues that Zuckerberg is primarily motivated by the potential for growth and profits in emerging markets. "Mark Zuckerberg is not a philanthropist, and he's not running a charity," Popper writes. "He's a businessman, and Internet.org is a canny business move." Popper points out that Facebook has already achieved saturation in the developed world, with little room for further growth in countries like the United States and Europe. However, there are billions of people in developing countries who are not yet online, making them a potentially lucrative market for Facebook and other tech companies. By providing the infrastructure for internet access in these regions, Facebook has the opportunity to position itself as the primary platform for the next billion internet users. Popper also notes that Internet.org is not a neutral platform, but rather a curated collection of services that have been chosen by Facebook and its partners. This includes Facebook itself, as well as other tech companies like Google and Wikipedia. While the idea of providing free internet access to millions of people may sound noble, Popper argues that this kind of selective access could have negative consequences for both users and competitors. "At a time when net neutrality is under siege in the United States, and critics are increasingly wary of the power of Big Tech, Internet.org seems like a troubling development," Popper writes. Despite these criticisms, Zuckerberg remains committed to his vision of a connected world. Speaking at a recent conference in San Francisco, he stressed the importance of internet access for the future of humanity. "The internet is one of the most important inventions of our time," he said. "Connecting the world is one of the greatest challenges of our generation, and one that we're uniquely positioned to solve." Zuckerberg is not alone in his efforts. Internet.org is a partnership between Facebook and several other tech companies, including Samsung, Nokia, and Qualcomm. Together, they hope to provide basic internet services like weather updates, health information, and education resources to millions of people around the world. While the debate over Zuckerberg's true intentions will likely continue, there is no denying the potential impact of Internet.org on the developing world. For millions of people who are currently unable to access the internet, this project could be the gateway to new opportunities and a better life.
