chatgpt: Raynesha Williams, a resident of Stockton, California, is grieving the loss of her stillborn son Zachary Toliver for the second time, after burglars broke into her home on Wednesday and stole his urn. The burglary occurred in broad daylight, and the thieves also stole several other valuable items from Williams' home. While the monetary value of the stolen items is not yet known, Williams says that the urn containing Zachary's ashes is "irreplaceable." Zachary Toliver was born stillborn on August 9, 2020. Williams had his ashes, along with a lock of his hair and handprints, placed in a decorative urn, which she kept in her home as a cherished keepsake. Since Zachary's passing, Williams has been grieving and trying to find ways to cope with the loss of her son. She has joined support groups, sought counseling, and relied on the support of family and friends to get through each day. The burglary has added another layer of trauma for Williams, who says that she feels violated and unsafe in her own home. "To have something so personal taken from you is just devastating," she said. "I don't know how I'm going to get through this." Stockton police are investigating the burglary and are asking anyone with information to come forward. Williams has also appealed to the public for help in finding the urn, saying that she just wants to have her son's remains back where they belong. "I don't care about anything else that was taken, I just want my son's urn back," Williams said. "If anyone knows anything or has seen anything, please come forward. This is not just a material possession, it's a piece of my heart." A GoFundMe page has been set up to help Williams with the cost of replacing the stolen items and to provide support during this difficult time. The community has rallied around her and is offering words of comfort and support. Despite the heartbreak and trauma of the burglary, Williams says that she is determined to honor her son's memory and keep his spirit alive. "He was only here for a moment, but he made a lasting impact on my life," she said. "I will never forget him, and I will always love him."
