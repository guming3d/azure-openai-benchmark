But on closer inspection it becomes clear that the palms, pines and firs are in fact cellphone towers. Phone companies in South Africa have taken to disguising the controversial masts so they fit into suburban streets. Blending in: Phone companies in South Africa disguise cellphone masts as trees to make them fit in . Surroundings: The masts are disguised as trees native to the area . Pioneering: The idea was first developed in South Africa in 1996 when a mast was turned into a palm . Photographer Dillon Marsh has created a series of some of the camouflaged towers erected around Cape Town. Called 'Invasive Species', the collections shows the lengths telecommunications companies have gone to make residents feel comfortable with having the masts so near to their homes. Mr Marsh said: 'A palm tree appeared almost overnight in a suburb of Cape Town. 'This was supposedly one of the world's first ever disguised cell phone tower. 'Since then these trees have spread across the city, South Africa and the rest of the world. 'Invasive Species explores the relationship between the environment and the disguised towers of Cape Town and its surrounds.' Wood for the trees: From a distance some of the disguised masts are very convincing . Controversial: Companies have gone to great lengths so residents feel comfortable with the nearby masts . Fake trees: Dillon Marsh has photographed the masts for a collection called Invasive Species . The features masts were erected in suburbs or towns all within 60km Cape Town's city centre. The photographer said it took six months to complete the work. He said: 'There were already a wide variety of designs by the time I started photographing. 'The designs loosely mimic trees that are found in the local environment.' According to Wired, the world's first Palm Pole Tower was developed in the mid-1990s by Ivo Branislav Lazic of South African telecommunications company Brolaz Projects and his colleague Aubrey Trevor Thomas. Felled: Some of the cellphone towers are even make to look like felled or dead trees . Project: Mr Marsh said the series explores the relationship between the phone masts and their environment . Challenge: The photographer spent six months on the project and all the masts are within 60km of Cape Town . It was placed into service in 1996 for Vodacom, one of South Africa's leading cellular operators. Brolaz say that more than a 1000 of these and similar camouflaged structures have been erected in South Africa and are also exported to USA, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. The company claim that increasing public approval, as well as advancements in antenna technology, have seen them expand the range of camouflaged options from the original Palm Trees to include other trees, lighthouses, windmills and roadside advertising structures.

chatgpt: South African photographer Dillon Marsh has spent six months photographing cellphone masts for his latest collection, entitled "Invasive Species". The series explores the complicated and often contentious relationship between the towering structures and their surrounding environment. Cellphone masts – also known as cell towers or base transceiver stations – have become a ubiquitous sight in our modern world, with an estimated 7.9 billion mobile phone users around the globe. The masts are used to transmit and receive radio signals from mobile phones and other wireless devices, but they have also been the subject of controversy due to their negative impact on the environment. The Invasive Species collection features over 40 photographs, each one focusing on a single cellphone mast as it looms over the landscape. Marsh captured the masts at different times of day and in various weather conditions, highlighting their stark contrast to the natural world around them. One of the most striking elements of the collection is how cellphone companies have attempted to camouflage the masts to match their surroundings. Some have been painted to match the color of trees, while others have been disguised as palm trees or flagpoles. In Marsh's photographs, these attempts at camouflage make the masts even more conspicuous, standing out as a jarring presence in the landscape. While the Invasive Species collection is primarily an artistic endeavor, it also raises important questions about the impact of cell towers on the environment. According to Marsh, the masts have been known to disrupt bird migration patterns and interfere with the nesting behaviors of certain species. However, cellphone technology is also seen as essential for modern communication and connectivity. As Marsh notes, "It's a complicated issue, because as much as these things are invasive and intrusive, we kind of can't live without them anymore." The Invasive Species collection is not Marsh's first exploration of the relationship between humans and the natural world. In previous collections, he has documented the impact of mining on the landscape and the historical legacy of South Africa's apartheid era. Marsh's work has been exhibited in galleries around the world and has garnered critical acclaim for its unique perspective on contemporary issues. The Invasive Species collection is set to continue the trend, with its thought-provoking and visually captivating portrayal of the relationship between cellphone masts and the environment. In a world where cellphone technology is increasingly woven into the fabric of daily life, the Invasive Species collection offers a timely reminder of the impact that our reliance on mobile phones is having on the world around us. Whether we choose to address this impact or continue to ignore it, the photographs serve as a striking visual representation of the complex relationship between nature and technology.
