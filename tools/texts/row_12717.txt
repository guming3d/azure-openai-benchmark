article: (CNN) -- Australian David Saker has been appointed England fast bowling coach, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced on Thursday. Saker takes over from Ottis Gibson, who took the job of head coach with the West Indies back in February. The 43-year-old spent six years as assistant coach with Australian state side Victoria, helping them to the Australian state championship twice, and four Twenty20 titles. He was head coach of the Delhi Daredevils in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, and an assistant coach during the franchise's first two Indian Premier League tournaments. Saker played first-class cricket for both Victoria and Tasmania in his ten-year domestic career and is expected to begin his new role before the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 tournament in the Caribbean later in April. He told the ECB's official Web site: "I believe I can offer the England bowlers a great deal and oversee their development at the highest level. I'm looking forward to working with the impressive crop of bowlers currently in and around the England team." England team director Andy Flower said: "His [Saker's] record with Victoria in recent times is second to none and he has managed the development of a number of top-class fast bowlers. "We were sorry to see Ottis Gibson leave the position but we believe we've found an excellent successor and look forward to David joining us in the lead up to what will be an exciting and challenging year ahead."

chatgpt: David Saker, a former Australian cricketer, has been appointed as the new fast bowling coach of the England cricket team. Saker will replace Ottis Gibson, who recently took up the position of head coach for the West Indies.  The 43-year-old has been in the coaching industry for quite some time and has a wealth of experience in fast bowling. His appointment was welcomed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who released a statement saying that Saker's knowledge and expertise would be invaluable assets to the team. Saker had a ten-year domestic playing career in Australia, playing for both Victoria and Tasmania. He made his mark as a fast bowler and earned a reputation as a specialist in the field. After his playing career ended, he moved on to coaching, taking up various positions in Australia and England. His stint with the English cricket team began in 2010 when he was appointed as the bowling coach. He worked with the team until 2015 and played a vital role in the team's success during this period. He then moved on to coach the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League and later the Melbourne Stars. Saker's appointment comes at a crucial juncture in England's cricketing journey as they gear up for a busy season ahead. With the Ashes scheduled later this year, Saker will play a crucial role in preparing the team's fast bowlers for the grueling series. His knowledge of Australian conditions and players will also be beneficial to the team. The ECB has expressed its excitement at having Saker on board and hopes that his appointment will have a positive impact on the team's success. Saker, too, has expressed his delight at the opportunity and is eager to get started with the team.
