Jailed: Con artist Alan Fitzgerald preyed on vulnerable pensioners, stealing £300,000 from them for jobs he never finished . An 'aggressive and dishonest' cowboy builder who robbed £300,000 from vulnerable pensioners, including one 94-year-old woman, has been jailed. Alan Fitzgerald, 47, told one elderly female victim she had asbestos in her home and would be prosecuted if she did not pay him a huge sum for unnecessary building work. The conman, from Wellingborough, who has no building qualifications, was jailed for six years after ripping off 39 victims. Fitzgerald took life savings from pensioners across Northamptonshire by overcharging them for work he never even finished. On average he would add more than £20,000 onto a bill for work, which cost less than £9,600. The prosecution described him as 'misleading, aggressive and dishonest' in court and said he would drive victims to cash points to make sure he was paid. Northampton Crown Court heard how Fitzgerald targeted elderly victims, preyed on the infirm and intimidated pensioners by warning that their homes urgently required repair work. Once he had identified a vulnerable victim, he would continue to 'tap the well', the court heard, and would return time and time again to fleece them of more cash. Fitzgerald even continued to rip-off customers after his first appearance in court last year. He has pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulent trading, one charge in relation to each of his firms. Northamptonshire County Council's trading standards team said it had received complaints about Fitzgerald dating back to 2005 and had issued him with a number of warnings. Sentenced: Fitzgerald was jailed for six years at Northampton Crown Court after he admitted fleecing dozens of victims, including one 94-year-old woman . Officers said there were a further 46 complaints not included in the formal charges. Fitzgerald who has never filed a tax return for his building company, was jailed on Tuesday. Sentencing him, Judge Richard Bray said: 'I have to sentence you for serious premeditated frauds. 'I am satisfied that you targeted vulnerable victims, pressuring them into handing large sums of money to you, often in cash and often representing substantial parts off their life savings. 'Ten of the victims in the first indictment alone were over 70. Many of them were infirm, some of them had carers, . 'One of them was a lady aged 94. You threatened her that she could be prosecuted if she didn't have repair work carried out by you. 'You obtained £6,000 in advance from her for work you didn't carry out properly, or at all. It is a truly despicable offence.'

chatgpt: Alan Fitzgerald, a 47-year-old man from the UK, has been sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of multiple counts of theft, fraud and deception. Described in court as "aggressive and dishonest," Fitzgerald targeted vulnerable people, forcing them to hand over cash for work he never completed. One of his victims was a 94-year-old woman who was falsely told she had asbestos in her home and faced prosecution if she didn't pay for it to be removed. Fitzgerald took her money and then failed to carry out the work. This is just one of many instances where Fitzgerald took advantage of vulnerable people, who were often elderly or disabled. Fitzgerald's criminal activities were uncovered after one of his victims went to the police. They discovered that he had a history of targeting vulnerable people and ripping them off for large sums of money. To make matters worse, Fitzgerald even defrauded customers after his first court appearance, proving that he had no intention of changing his ways. During the trial, the judge noted that Fitzgerald's actions had caused considerable harm and distress to his victims. They were left out of pocket and often felt violated in their own homes. His crimes also showed a callous disregard for the law and the welfare of others. In sentencing Fitzgerald, the judge noted that he had shown no remorse for his actions and that his previous convictions made it clear that he was highly likely to reoffend. The judge also praised the courage of his victims in coming forward and speaking out against him, adding that their evidence had been crucial in securing a conviction. Speaking after the trial, Detective Inspector Mark Smith from the local police force said: "Alan Fitzgerald targeted some of the most vulnerable members of our community and ripped them off for large sums of money. He showed no remorse for his actions and has now been rightly punished for the harm and distress he caused." The case of Alan Fitzgerald highlights the importance of being vigilant when hiring traders to carry out work in your home. It also serves as a reminder that the police take crimes against vulnerable people very seriously and will do everything in their power to bring those responsible to justice.
