Tragic: The 23-year-old woman died after she was stung in Rosario do Sul in Brazil . Beekeepers know that individual swarms not only have their own group 'personalities' - some are more aggressive than others, for example - but also that they can behave differently depending on the weather. Hot and humid conditions often make bees bad tempered, while mild and sunny weather tends to encourage calm behaviour. Though European bees rarely attack people, the same is not true elsewhere. A hybrid strain of bee known for its aggressiveness have been spreading north from Mexico since the Seventies . In the U.S., 'Africanised' honey bees, a hybrid strain known for its aggressiveness, have been spreading north from Mexico since the Seventies. The Africanised bee was the result of experimental breeding carried out in Brazil in the Fifties. It was designed to produce a strain that was better adapted to the Tropics than common European strains, such as the Italian honey bee, Apis mellifera ligustica. Unfortunately, combining the genes of Tanzanian and European insects produced a bee that, while productive, could be extremely defensive and even aggressive. Honey bees are considered to be potentially dangerous across much of the Tropics. The main reason bee attacks can be so serious is the way the stings encourage further assaults. When a honey bee stings, it drenches the site with chemicals called pheromones, which send a message to the other bees, encouraging them to sting the same spot. The stings will be concentrated in sensitive areas such as the nose and eyes. When a honey bee stings you, the barbed protuberance through which the poison is delivered rips away the last segment of the animal's abdomen. This means that the bee dies of severe haemorrhaging within minutes.

chatgpt: A woman, identified as Mariana Lucher, has been named as a military police trainee, but her life was tragically cut short when she was stung by a bee. According to doctors, she may have been unaware that she was allergic to bee stings. Lucher had just completed her training at the Military Police Battalion in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she was preparing for her future role as a law enforcement officer. She was reportedly in good health prior to the incident, and none of her colleagues suspected that she had any underlying medical conditions. On the day of the incident, Lucher was sitting outside, enjoying a break from her training, when she was stung by a bee. Shortly after, she began to experience difficulty breathing and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Despite the efforts of medical personnel, Lucher ultimately succumbed to her injuries and passed away later that day. Speaking to reporters, Dr. Pedro Alves Lopes, who treated Lucher at the hospital, said it was likely that she was not aware of her allergy. "It's possible that she never knew she had an allergy to bee stings," he said. "Sometimes, people can live their entire lives without ever having an allergic reaction, and then suddenly it happens." Lucher's death has prompted an outpouring of grief and tributes from her fellow trainees and colleagues. Many expressed shock and disbelief at the sudden loss of their friend and colleague, who they said was a dedicated and hardworking trainee. "She was always eager to learn and improve in her role," said Lt. Col. Ricardo Augusto Nascimento de Mello, who was responsible for overseeing Lucher's training. "She showed great promise and had a bright future ahead of her in the military police." The incident has also raised questions about the training and preparation given to military police trainees, particularly with regard to medical conditions and allergies. In response, the authorities have announced that they will be reviewing their procedures and implementing additional measures to ensure the safety and well-being of their trainees. In a statement, the Military Police Battalion expressed their condolences to Lucher's family and friends, saying that they were deeply saddened by her passing. "She was a valued member of our team and will be greatly missed," the statement read. The tragic death of Mariana Lucher serves as a reminder of the importance of awareness and preparedness when it comes to allergies and other medical conditions. It also highlights the risks and dangers faced by those who serve in law enforcement and other emergency services roles, who put their lives on the line every day to protect their communities.
