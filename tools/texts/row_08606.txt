article: Washington (CNN) -- As the rappellers on the Washington Monument check for cracks in the structure's exterior, they won't be able to see themselves in another Washington landmark: the Reflecting Pool below. It's currently a giant mud pit. The pool where tourists have been able to see majestic reflections of both the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial has been under construction since last November to address problems with leaking and to make the water cleaner with a new circulation system. Although it currently looks like a mess, Steve Lorenzetti with the National Park Service sees it differently. "I describe it as almost done with the infrastructure necessary for us to finish this project," he said. The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool project is expected to be complete in the spring of 2012. When finished, the pool will actually have about a third less water than previously and will be shallower. According to Lorenzetti, the general public won't be able to tell. "The reflective quality of this pool is of paramount importance to us," he said. "So what you will see if there is no wind is a flat, glassy surface." The Reflecting Pool is just one part of the aging National Mall that has problems, according to Caroline Cunningham, president of the Trust for the National Mall. She pointed out to reporters Tuesday other mall sites that have been neglected in recent years, including the area called Union Square up near the Capitol. "Right now, there's this beautiful reflecting pool. But, can we make it a place where people can come cool off in the summertime?" she said, referring to another, smaller reflecting pool near the Capitol. She describes the National Mall as needing help, saying it needs to be more amenable for visitors. The Trust for the National Mall is currently running a design contest to come up with a sustainable, creative solution to problems at Union Square. "It should be one of the most beautiful spaces on the National Mall and it has not really been touched since the 1970s when it was built," she said.

chatgpt: Washington D.C.'s iconic Reflecting Pool has been under construction since last November, but the wait will soon be worth it. According to the National Park Service, the completed restoration will feature a new circulation system that will keep the water cleaner than ever before. What's even more surprising is that when the Reflecting Pool reopens to visitors, it will actually hold less water than before. However, the Parks Service assures the public that this isn't a bad thing.  "The reflective quality of this pool is of paramount importance," said a Parks official in a statement. "By reducing the water level, we are maximizing the pool's ability to reflect its surrounding environment, creating a stunning visual effect that is difficult to achieve without a low water level." This effect is achieved by reducing the pool's depth and volume, which reduces the amount of water that needs to be filtered and treated, making it easier to maintain its cleanliness. In addition, the circulating system will enhance the water quality by preventing stagnant water from accumulating. The $40 million project has also replaced the pool's 80-year-old concrete floor with a high-tech, state-of-the-art membrane system that will prevent water from seeping through to the ground below. The new system is designed to be more durable and long-lasting, ensuring that the pool remains stable and watertight for decades to come. The Reflecting Pool is a popular destination for visitors to the National Mall and Washington D.C. alike. Once the restoration is complete, the pool will look better than ever before, with crystal-clear water that enhances the beauty of its surroundings. The National Parks Service is confident that the new low-water, high-reflectivity design will provide an unforgettable experience for tourists and locals alike. The project is expected to be finished by spring 2022, just in time for the peak tourist season. In the meantime, visitors to the National Mall can still enjoy the multitude of attractions, including the Lincoln Memorial, World War II Memorial, and the Washington Monument. However, with the unveiling of the newly-renovated Reflecting Pool, the National Park Service expects to attract even more visitors to the area in the coming years.
