article: Washington (CNN) -- The former vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff is under investigation by the Justice Department regarding material in a book by David Sanger, a correspondent for The New York Times, a source directly familiar with the situation said Thursday. The source could not confirm that the investigation involving retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright is specifically about the Stuxnet computer virus, which Sanger writes about in his recent book "Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power." NBC News reported Thursday, citing legal sources, that Cartwright has been told he's under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information about Stuxnet, a complex virus that infected computers in Iranian nuclear facilities in 2010. CNN has been unable to confirm specifics of NBC's report. Officials from the Justice Department, the U.S. Attorney's Office, as well as Cartwright and his lawyer have not commented. The leak about Stuxnet was one of a series of national security-related leaks last year and had details of how the United States and Israel were behind the cyberattack. The leaks appeared in the Times, Newsweek and The Associated Press stories. They prompted an FBI investigation and outraged top intelligence lawmakers. The first story involving leaked information was Sanger's June 2012 piece in the Times about the U.S. role in cyberattacks against Iran's key nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz, revelations that also appear in "Confront and Conceal." The book describes how a first-term President Barack Obama used "innovative weapons and tools of American power," including an arsenal of cyberweapons, aimed at Iran's nuclear program, according to publisher Random House. Stuxnet was discovered in July 2010 after it infected the computers used in Iranian nuclear facilities, sabotaging machinery used in uranium enrichment and causing some of Iran's centrifuges to spin out of control. Cartwright is a former commander of U.S. Strategic Command and became vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2007. He spent four years there, retiring in 2011. According to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he now serves as an expert on defense policy, Cartwright was known at the Pentagon for his technical acumen in cybersecurity, nuclear proliferation and missile defense. CNN's Peter Bergen contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The United States Department of Justice is reportedly investigating retired Marine General James Cartwright over leaked information regarding the use of cyberweapons against Iran. This information comes from sources familiar with the situation. According to reports, the investigation is connected to a book by New York Times reporter David Sanger. The book, titled "Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power," details President Obama's use of cyberweapons against Iran, including the Stuxnet virus. NBC News first broke the story, reporting that Cartwright is under investigation for allegedly leaking information about the Stuxnet virus. The retired general served as former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was known for his expertise in the area of cyber warfare. Stuxnet is a computer worm that was discovered in 2010 and is believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel. The virus targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, causing significant damage and setting back the country's nuclear program. The investigation into Cartwright is part of a larger effort by the Department of Justice to crack down on leaks of classified information. In recent years, the Obama administration has prosecuted a number of individuals for leaking sensitive information to the media. According to sources, Cartwright has not been charged with any wrongdoing at this time. However, the investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear what the outcome will be. The use of cyberweapons has become an increasingly important part of modern warfare. As governments around the world become more reliant on computer systems, the potential for cyber attacks to cause significant damage has become a major concern. The Stuxnet virus is just one example of the power of cyberweapons. Its success in disrupting Iran's nuclear program has been hailed as a major victory for the United States and its allies. The investigation into General Cartwright underscores the importance of keeping classified information secure. While the use of cyberweapons may be a valuable tool in modern warfare, it is crucial that this technology is used in a responsible and ethical manner. As the investigation into Cartwright continues, the Department of Justice will work to determine whether he violated any laws in connection with the leaked information. Regardless of the outcome, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of safeguarding sensitive information in the digital age.
