A physicist at Denmark's Niels Bohr Institute has recreated one of the two main particle detectors at the Large Hadron Collider out of Lego - and the replica machine is to scale with the tiny Lego engineers that walk through its tunnels. Sacha Melhase used 9,500 pieces of Lego to build the model - a task which took him 35 hours.The Niels Bohr Institute covered his 2,000 Euro brick bill - hoping that Mehlhase's work would inspire interest in high-energy physics. The scale model, built by Sascha Mehlhase using 9,500 Lego pieces, is of of the Atlas particle detector at the Large Hadron Collider - one of two particle detectors used in the hunt for the Higgs boson . The model took 35 hours to build - and cost 2,000 euros. Mehlhase enlisted help with sorting the bricks for his particle detector, but built it entirely himself . The Lego version of the LHC is almost exactly to scale with Lego men - and includes models of the Atlas detectors magnets and detectors . Mehlhase has contacted Lego to see if the Danish company is interested in making the model part of its official range. Planning a 3D model took him 48 solid hours of work - before he even began sorting the bricks. 'It illustrates all details, from the muon spectrometer and magnet system to the innermost pixel detector,' says Mehlhase. 'I do not have a straightforward construction manual yet, but I am working on it!' The real Atlas detector - one of two detectors that sit on the 'ring' at the LHC to monitor particles created in the high-speed collision - is about 70 feet wide and weighs 7,000 tonnes .

chatgpt: Lego has announced its latest creation, a scaled-down version of the Atlas detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The miniature replica is equipped with tiny "engineers" who work inside the tunnels, and features recreations of the original's huge magnets. The construction of the model takes approximately 35 hours, and includes intricate details that mimic the actual physics experiment. The Danish physicist who initiated the project, Dr. Mads Toudal Frandsen, contacted Lego with an offer to make the "kit" official. Lego responded with enthusiasm and the result is a tribute to one of the most iconic scientific experiments in history. The Atlas detector, located in Switzerland, is a particle detector that is used to study the interactions of high-energy particles. The real Atlas detector measures nearly 150 feet long and 82 feet tall, and weighs around 7,000 tons. However, the Lego version is much more compact and can fit on a tabletop. The miniature Atlas detector was created for educational purposes, and is intended to generate interest in particle physics among students and budding scientists. The kit includes instructions for building the model, as well as information and experiments that demonstrate the principles of the LHC. The kit is designed for students ages 14 and up, and includes advanced concepts such as particle identification, energy deposits, and calorimetry. The miniature Atlas detector is a perfect way for students to learn about the world of high-energy physics and the experiments being conducted at places like the LHC. In addition to being an educational tool, the miniature Atlas detector is also a fun activity for Lego enthusiasts. The construction of the model is a great way to spend a weekend afternoon, and the finished product is an impressive display piece for any science enthusiast. The Lego Atlas detector is a testament to the power and potential of science education. By recreating one of the most important scientific experiments in history, Lego has made it possible for students and science enthusiasts to appreciate the wonder and complexity of particle physics. The miniature Atlas detector is a must-have for anyone who loves science and engineering, and is sure to inspire future generations of scientists and engineers.
