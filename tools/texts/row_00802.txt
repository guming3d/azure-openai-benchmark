article: ATHENS, Greece (CNN) -- A strong earthquake jolted western Greece on Sunday, killing at least two people and trapping several people beneath collapsed buildings, according to officials and state-run media. Rescuers remove a victim from a collapsed building after an earthquake struck Greece Sunday. Another 37 were hurt as a result of the quake, many as they tried to flee their homes, Greek Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos said at a news conference in Athens. The temblor struck around 3:30 p.m. [8:30 a.m. ET] and measured 6.1 in magnitude, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Athens' Geodynamic Institute registered the quake at 6.5 on the Richter scale -- which is no longer used by the USGS. Its epicenter was located about 20 miles [32 kilometers] southwest of the Greek port city of Patras. Pavlopoulos immediately dispatched a rescue and recovery team, which includes members of five government agencies, to assess the damage and needs in the quake-stricken Peloponnese region. So far, most of those reported trapped have been removed -- including a 43-year-old villager who died after his house collapsed on him, the interior minister said. The other victim died of a heart attack while being rushed to the hospital, he said. "This is a very serious quake, but there will be no evacuations," Pavlopoulos said. iReport.com: Are you there?

It was "no surprise" that a strong quake hit in the area, where earthquakes are common, according to Geodynamic Institute director Gerasimos Papadopoulos. People in Athens -- about 80 miles [129 kilometers] east of the epicenter-- felt the ground shake for as long as 20 seconds. Due to its fault lines, Greece is one of the most quake-prone countries in the European Union. A quake and aftershock both measuring over 6.4 in magnitude struck near Kalamata off the southern coast of the Peloponnese peninsula in mid-February, causing no major damage or injuries. The last major earthquake in Greece was in 1999 and left about 100 people dead. Journalist Anthee Carassava contributed to this report .

chatgpt: A strong earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale, hit southern Greece causing widespread destruction in the region. The epicenter of the quake was reported to be about 20 miles southwest of the port city of Patras, and the earthquake was felt as far away as Athens, which is about 80 miles east of the epicenter.  Local authorities have confirmed that two people were killed as a result of the earthquake, and several others were trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings. Rescue teams are working tirelessly to free those who are trapped and provide medical assistance to those who are injured. According to reports, the earthquake caused widespread panic as people ran out of their homes and businesses in a bid to escape the tremors. The strong tremors caused significant damage to buildings, including hotels, offices, and homes. Local authorities have urged people to remain calm and stay away from damaged buildings. The Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has expressed his condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the earthquake. He also assured the nation that the government would provide every support and assistance to the affected people. The earthquake has also caused significant disruption to transportation and communication services in the region. Many roads have been blocked by landslides, and there have been reports of power outages in some areas. The Greek Ministry of Civil Protection has advised people to avoid traveling in the affected areas unless it is absolutely necessary. The earthquake is a reminder of the vulnerability of the region to seismic activities. Greece is located in an area known as the Mediterranean Seismic Belt, which is prone to earthquakes due to the collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates. The region has experienced several major earthquakes in the past, including a devastating earthquake in 1999 that killed over 140 people. In the wake of this earthquake, the Greek government has urged people to take precautions and ensure that they are prepared for any further seismic activities. They have also activated the emergency response plan and have deployed additional resources to the affected areas to provide assistance to those in need. The earthquake has caused significant damage and loss of life, and it is a stark reminder of the need for governments and communities to be prepared for natural disasters. It is imperative that we take steps to minimize the risks and ensure that our infrastructure is resilient enough to withstand seismic activities.
