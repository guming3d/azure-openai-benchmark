Habit: Mother-of-five Smith smoked 40 cannabis joints a day to relieve pain from an accident, she claimed . A crash victim awarded £130,000 in compensation has blown the lot - on cannabis, a court heard. Sally Smith, 39, won the six-figure pay-out after she was left wheelchair-bound when she was mown down by a car on a pedestrian crossing in 2003. But the mum-of-five was so overcome with pain she developed a 40-joint-a-day marijuana dependence. In July Smith was caught supplying £1,000 of the Class B drug to a friend and hauled before the courts. During sentencing, Maidstone Crown Court heard Smith’s money had literally gone up in smoke because she used it to fund her drug habit. On Monday Judge Charles Byers told her: ‘Both of you must understand that whatever people say cannabis is a dangerous drug. ‘It can cause the most enormous problems for the people who take it.’ Ben Irwin, mitigating, told the court his client has suffered ‘post traumatic stress disorder’ as a result of her accident. He said: ‘She turned to smoking cannabis as a way of dealing with those demons and making her day to day life all the more tolerable. ‘She couldn’t cope with having that much money and it all went far too soon. ‘It wasn’t a desire to make money or a profit. It was about making sure the pain wasn’t so acute.’ Smith, from Tonbridge Wells, Kent, admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply, producing cannabis and supplying cannabis. Verdict: Smith was sentenced to eight months jail suspended for two years by Maidstone Crown Court . The friend to whom she supplied the drug, Paul Fletcher, 34, from, Hildenborough, Kent, also admitted possession with intent to supply. Both were sentenced to eight months jail suspended for two years and ordered to each pay £250 court costs. Smith was also given a three-month curfew from 7pm to 3am while father-of-one Fletcher was ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid work, supervision for 18 months and attend a Thinking Skills programme.

chatgpt: A woman from Kent, Sally Smith, has recently come forward to talk about her 40-a-day marijuana addiction. Smith claims that she began using marijuana to alleviate pain she was experiencing after a serious accident.  Smith, now 39, says she started using marijuana around six months after the accident occurred. The pain from the accident was unbearable at times, and she found that smoking marijuana offered her some relief. However, what began as a means to alleviate physical pain soon turned into a full-blown addiction.  While many people believe that marijuana is not physically addictive, Smith's experience appears to contradict that belief. She says that when she tried to quit, she experienced a range of physical and psychological symptoms. Among these were headaches, nausea, mood swings, and anxiety.  What's more, Smith isn't alone in her struggle with marijuana addiction. According to a study published in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, around 9 percent of people who try marijuana will become addicted to it. This number rises to around 17 percent for those who start using the drug in their teens.  Experts say that one of the reasons marijuana addiction can be so difficult to overcome is that it can have both physical and psychological effects. Additionally, the drug is often used as a coping mechanism for people who are dealing with emotional or physical pain.  While medical marijuana is legal in some parts of the world and has been shown to provide relief for people with certain medical conditions, marijuana addiction can have serious health consequences. In addition to physical symptoms like headaches and nausea, addiction can lead to respiratory issues, memory problems, and even increased risk of mental health conditions like depression and anxiety.  Now, Sally Smith is working to overcome her addiction and raise awareness about the dangers of unchecked marijuana use. She is currently seeking treatment and hopes to use her experience to help others who may be struggling with addiction.  As marijuana becomes more widely accepted around the world, it's important for people to understand the potential risks involved with its use. For people like Sally Smith, the consequences of addiction can be severe and life-altering. By raising awareness about the issue, we can work toward minimizing those risks and helping those who may be struggling with addiction.
