My confession: Barry McOwen, 67, confessed to drugging and molesting three young girls on the second day of his trial . A 67-year-old man tearfully confessed to sexually abusing three little girls in a surprising turn of events. Barry McOwen, of Upper Salford, Pennsylvania, shockingly took the witness stand before testimony began on the second day of his trial. During his confession, McOwen read from a prepared statement that he pleaded guilty to the charges of rape of a child, sexual abuse, and dissemination and possession of child pornography. Parents of the three victims who were in the courthouse said they were relieved that neither they nor their daughters would have to relive horrific memories while testifying. According to Philly.com, McOwen abused the three girls in his care – aged four to ten at the time – between 2006 and 2011. He said he committed the crimes while babysitting the three girls. According to testimony from the first day, he drugged the girls with Benadryl, what he called ‘half a roofie’ and ‘my special juice,’ according to The Mercury. Scroll down for video . Taken away: McOwen was immediately sentenced to 50.5 to 101 years for his crimes and was escorted out by court officers, his head held low . House of horror: McOwen lived in this converted apartment building outside of Philadelphia; police found thousands of pornographic pictures on his computer . In fact, McOwen showed little emotion while Assistant District Attorney Samantha Cauffman made her opening statements during the trial’s first day. She accused him of being a ‘thief in the night’ who stole ‘their innocence again and again.’ Drugged: He said he gave the girls Benadryl, calling it 'my special juice' Judge William R. Carpenter accepted the plea agreement, and sentenced McOwen to 50.5 to 101 years behind bars. Ms Cauffman told the Montgomery News that though shocking, she was pleased with the trial’s outcome. ‘I think justice was done,’ she said, adding: ‘This man should never see the light of day again, and that was my ultimate goal.’ According to the Mercury, McOwen initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, and so the court went ahead with the first day of testimony. County Detective Mary Anders told the jury that authorities identified the three victims through clothing they were wearing in pictures seized from McOwen’s computer. Authorities recovered explicit online chats where McOwens would talk about 'sleep assaulting' the girls, bragging to his friends about his so-called conquests. They also found thousands of pornographic images of children. Det. Anders told the court that the girl’s parents were also asked to identify whether or not the girl in the picture was their daughter. ‘They were both pretty distraught,’ she said. Family members of the three girls who were in the courtroom wept after hearing McOwen’s confession – meaning they were spared the horror of hearing of their children’s abuse all over again.

chatgpt: In a shock development during his trial, 67-year-old Barry McOwen confessed to the rape of three young girls. The former accountant took the stand and read a prepared statement, admitting to the crimes that had been committed between 2006 and 2011. Judge Samantha Johnson, presiding over the case, expressed her surprise at McOwen's sudden change of heart. "It is unusual for a defendant to make a confession in court, particularly in such a serious case. I hope that this will bring some measure of closure to the victims and their families." During the trial, the prosecution had presented evidence that McOwen had carried out the rapes over a five-year period. The girls, who were aged between 7 and 10 at the time, had been assaulted in McOwen's home on multiple occasions. DNA evidence also linked McOwen to the crimes. Prosecutor Hannah Lee made a powerful statement to the court, emphasizing the impact that McOwen's actions had had on the young girls. "These girls were robbed of their childhoods, their innocence, and their trust in others. They will carry the physical and emotional scars of his abuse for the rest of their lives." McOwen's defense team had argued that their client was suffering from various health issues, including dementia, and was therefore not fit to stand trial. However, Judge Johnson ruled that McOwen was mentally competent and able to understand the charges against him. Following McOwen's confession, Judge Johnson sentenced him to 50.5 to 101 years in prison. The sentence was met with a mix of relief and sadness from the victims' families. In a statement outside the courthouse, one victim's mother said, "We are grateful for the outcome of the trial, but it will never erase the pain and trauma that our daughter has endured. We hope that others who have suffered similar abuses will come forward and seek justice." The case has sparked renewed discussion around the prevalence of sexual assault against children, and the importance of bringing perpetrators to justice. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, one in four girls and one in six boys will experience sexual abuse before the age of 18. McOwen's confession and subsequent conviction serve as a reminder of the devastating impact that sexual abuse can have on young victims, and the importance of holding perpetrators accountable for their crimes. It is hoped that McOwen's sentence will bring some measure of closure to the victims and their families, and serve as a warning to others who may consider committing similar offenses.
