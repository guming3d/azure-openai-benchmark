Despite being dismissed as a mostly ancient disease, the threat of leprosy still exists in the U.S. today, and it can be dangerous if ignored. Commonly referred to in the Bible, leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease) has long been thought to have been eliminated – as effective treatments are available. However, the Health Resources and Services Administration has reported that there are currently about 6,500 cases of the disease in the U.S. Disease: Leprosy has long been thought to have been eliminated - as effective treatments are available, but that's not the case in places like Madagascar, where proper medical care is scarce . While the disease can be spread between humans through respiratory droplets, health officials warn that some Americans can be at risk when in contact with armadillos. Last year, a study on the armoured mammals found that them to be the only non-human creatures that can carry the bacteria that cause leprosy. Armadillos are native to mostly the southern portion of the U.S. in states like Texas, but can also be found in states as far east as Florida. Beware the armadillo: A study last year found that the mammals are the only non-human creatures that can carry the bacteria that cause leprosy . The study, conducted by Dr Richard W. Truman and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, linked . 30-40 cases of leprosy in the U.S. to armadillos. Hardship: In the worst cases of leprosy, fingers and toes are lost and blindness can occur . Dr Truman said in a statement: . 'Leprosy has been feared throughout human history, and there are still . regions in several countries, including in the southern United States, . where new cases of this disease continue to occur.’ According to the CDC, about 1-2million people worldwide have been left permanently disabled by leprosy. Leprosy, which mainly affects the skin, is not a killer and can easily be cured today. But in countries where proper medical care is scarce like Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Nepal, the disease can lead to damaged nerves if left untreated. Contrary to popular belief, leprosy does not cause a patient's arms and legs to fall off, but can cause hands and fingers to shrink. It typically starts as a light-coloured patch on the skin that can go unnoticed because it causes no pain. In the worst cases, fingers and toes are lost or blindness occurs. The bacteria that causes the disease multiplies very slowly, with an incubation period ranging anywhere from three to 20 years. The disease is caused by two different types of bacteria: Mycobacterium leprae and mycobacterium lepromatosis.

chatgpt: A new study has found that armadillos, once thought harmless, can carry leprosy, a disease that affects millions worldwide. In the United States, there are currently 6,500 cases of leprosy, although the disease has been eradicated in most developed countries.  Often referred to as Hansen's disease, leprosy is known to severely impact the skin and nerve endings, causing immense discomfort and potential disfigurement. As per the statistics, approximately one to two million people worldwide suffer from this illness. It can also lead to nerve damage, which can become permanent if left untreated. The research team, whose findings were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine, concluded that armadillos may be the cause of some cases of human leprosy in the southern United States. The small mammals are known to carry the bacteria that cause leprosy, and their habitats often overlap with human populations in the southeastern region of the country.  Since the armadillos' range is expanding owing to climate change, the authors warned that the number of cases of human leprosy transmitted by armadillos could increase in the years to come. "Although people tend to think about leprosy as a disease of the past, it remains an important public health problem, especially in developing countries," said Dr. Richard Truman, lead author of the study and a microbiologist at the National Hansen’s Disease Programs in Baton Rouge. The average incubation period for leprosy is three to five years, which makes tracking its sources difficult. In this context, a study like this one will help in identifying potential disease carriers and prevent leprosy transmission. The findings of the study have set off alarm bells worldwide, with governments and health organizations scrambling to assess the impact of the disease on vulnerable populations. Furthermore, the ease with which armadillos can be found and the bacteria's resilience to certain drugs have led experts to call for innovative measures to curb the disease's spread. As for the future, researchers recommend that people avoid contact with armadillos and take steps to keep the small creatures out of their homes and yards. Those who must handle armadillos should do so with protective gloves and clothing to avoid coming into contact with the bacteria. In conclusion, the findings of this study have provided valuable insights into the transmission and spread of leprosy in the United States. It is essential that people take necessary precautions to avoid contact with armadillos and other potential carriers of the disease to ensure public safety, as leprosy remains a significant public health issue worldwide.
