article: Wilfried Zaha's Manchester United career took another turn for the worse on Tuesday night as the £15million forward was an unused substitute as Louis van Gaal's side crashed out of the Capital One Cup with a humiliating 4-0 defeat against MK Dons. The 21-year-old, who is still yet to start a Premier League for United since arriving from Crystal Palace in January 2013, was a noticeable inclusion on the bench at stadium:mk but failed to get any minutes on the pitch as Van Gaal opted for other alternatives. Zaha wouldn't have made the greatest first impression on the new United boss earlier this summer as he opted not to turn up to an 'optional' training session on the third day of pre-season - attended by every other available squad member.

Disappointing: Zaha has failed to impress in the Premier League so far with Manchester United and Cardiff . With first-team football hard to come by at Old Trafford, it appears Zaha's international career is being hindered as a result, with England Under 21 boss Gareth Southgate set to leave the winger out of the squad for theEuro 2015 qualifiers against Lithuania and Moldova. Zaha, who earlier this week was sanctioned for speeding in his £188,000 Lamborghini Gallardo in Surrey, withdrew from the last U21 squad in May due to a minor injury. And Southgate has insisted that attitude and application is key if players such as the United forward want to make it to the top.

chatgpt: Manchester United were dealt another blow in their Capital One Cup clash with Middlesbrough on Wednesday as they crashed out of the competition following a penalty shootout defeat. However, one player who did not take part in the match was winger Wilfried Zaha, who was an unused substitute for the Red Devils. The 21-year-old has fallen out of favour under manager Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford and has made just two appearances for the first team this season, both coming in the early rounds of the Capital One Cup against lower-league opposition. Zaha's lack of game time has led to speculation about his future at the club, with reports suggesting that he may be sold in the January transfer window. The player's representatives have denied these rumours, insisting that he is committed to United and is eager to fight for his place in the team. However, Zaha's prospects of playing more regularly for the England under-21 team have taken a hit, as he is reportedly set to miss out on a place in the latest squad. England under-21 manager Gareth Southgate has already announced his squad for the upcoming European U21 Championship qualifiers against Andorra and Turkey, and Zaha's name was conspicuously absent from the list. Despite his lack of game time at club level, Zaha has been a regular for the under-21s in recent years and was expected to be a key part of Southgate's plans for the qualifiers. The news will come as a disappointment to the player, who has been working hard to impress van Gaal and earn a regular place in the United team. However, it remains to be seen whether he will get another chance to stake his claim for a spot in the England squad later in the season. Zaha began his career at Crystal Palace, where he quickly established himself as one of the most promising young talents in English football. A move to United followed in 2013, but he struggled to make an impact under then-manager David Moyes and was loaned back to Palace for the second half of the 2013-14 season. After returning to Old Trafford last summer, Zaha was given a chance to impress van Gaal in pre-season, but failed to do so and was eventually sent out on loan to Cardiff City for the second half of last season. The winger is under contract at United until 2018, so the club may choose to retain him for the time being and hope that he can rediscover the form that made him such a highly-rated prospect at Palace. However, if Zaha continues to struggle for game time, a move away from Old Trafford may become more likely in the coming months.
