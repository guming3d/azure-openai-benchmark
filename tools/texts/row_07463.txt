article: (CNN) -- The Guardian is gone. What was left of the former U.S. Navy minesweeper was lifted off a Philippine reef on Saturday. "The stern was lifted around 1:50 p.m.," Philippine Coast Guard Palawan District head Commodore Enrico Efren Evangelista told the state-run Philippine News Agency. It was the last of the four sections of the wood and fiberglass hull the USS Guardian had been cut into in the effort to remove it from where it ran aground on January 17. Bow cut from U.S. ship . The 250-ton stern segment was placed aboard a waiting barge. "As the hull has been removed, the team is now shifting their effort to collecting minor debris that remains on the reef," the head of the salvage operation, Navy Capt. Mark Matthews, said in a statement. "We also have a collaborative team from the U.S. and the Philippines beginning to assess the condition of the reef." The Guardian is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet) of the reef, a UNESCO World Heritage site that is home to about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral, as well as whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds. The Navy has pledged to clean up the debris created when waves stripped off pieces of fiberglass covering the wooden hull of the ship and to try to restore the reef as much as possible. "(With this complete) the second phase which is the assessment and recovery phase (for the damaged reef) begins," Evangelista said. "Every salvage operation presents unique challenges. It has been difficult to extract the Guardian without causing further damage to the reef, but the U.S. Navy and SMIT salvage team with support from other companies and the government of the Philippines have really done a superb job. I could not be more proud," Matthews said. "We continue to work closely with the Philippine Coast Guard, Navy and Tubbataha Reef Park Rangers, and we are grateful for the support we have received to remove Guardian and minimize further damage to the reef." An investigation into the grounding is ongoing, but Navy officials said in January that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles. While the removal of the stern from the reef may visually mark the end of the Guardian, the ship was officially stricken from the U.S. Navy registry in February. Navy communications now refer to it as the Ex-Guardian. It has been replaced in the Pacific by the USS Warrior, which arrived at the U.S. naval base in Sasebo, Japan, earlier this month. The Guardian's crew will take over operation of the Warrior.

chatgpt: After months of effort, the grounded U.S. Navy minesweeper, USS Guardian, was finally removed from the Tubbataha Reef in the Philippines on Saturday. The ship had run aground on January 17th, causing extensive damage to the marine ecosystem. Experts estimate that the Guardian has caused damage to approximately 4,000 square meters of the reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its stunning natural beauty and biodiversity. The ship's placement in the area was unauthorized, and local authorities immediately launched an investigation into the incident. For the past several months, the U.S. Navy had attempted to salvage the ship from the coral reef, but their efforts were complicated by adverse weather conditions and the delicate nature of the marine environment. The Guardian remained stranded on the reef, threatening further damage to the ecosystem and creating safety concerns for those involved in the rescue operation. Finally, on Saturday, a combination of marine vessels and cranes were able to extricate the USS Guardian from the reef. Onlookers cheered as the battered vessel was towed away to a nearby port for further inspection and repairs. While the successful removal of the Guardian is a relief to conservationists and the local community, the damage done to the Tubbataha Reef remains an immense concern. The reef is home to hundreds of species of fish, coral, and other marine creatures, and serves as a vital habitat for endangered animals such as sea turtles and dugongs. Efforts are now being undertaken to assess the full extent of the damage done to the reef and to develop a plan for rehabilitation. Local authorities have indicated that they will be seeking compensation for the harm done to the environment, though the specific details of any legal action are yet to be finalized. The incident has also raised questions about the presence and activities of foreign military vessels in the area. While the U.S. Navy has apologized for the damage caused by the USS Guardian, many in the Philippines have called for greater scrutiny of the operations of foreign military forces in the country's waters. In the wake of the incident, there have been calls for improved coordination and communication between the Philippines and other nations whose military ships operate in the region. The Tubbataha Reef is just one of many natural treasures in the area that is threatened by the activities of human development and industry. Overall, the removal of the USS Guardian from the Tubbataha Reef marks a significant step in efforts to protect this vital ecosystem. However, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible management of our natural resources and the need for greater cooperation between nations to address environmental concerns.
