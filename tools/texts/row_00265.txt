article: (CNN) -- Nasser Al-Attiyah has called time on the defense of his Dakar Rally title, pulling out of the 2012 race after problems with his car. The Qatari quit the annual race across South America after his temperamental Hummer broke down on the ninth stage between Antofagasta and Iquique in Chile. Al-Attiyah has endured a litany of problems with his vehicle since the start of the race on New Year's Day and threw in the towel after 174km of the ninth stage having made three unscheduled stops. American Bobby Gordon didn't have any such problems as he claimed his first stage win in the 2012 race to further close the gap on overall leader Stephane Peterhansel. Gordon cuts Peterhansel's lead in stage eight . The Frenchman -- a six-time motorbike and three-time car champion in the Dakar -- finished a minute and 38 seconds behind Gordon, with Spain's Nani Roma third. With four days remaining in the race Gordon, a NASCAR veteran, trails Peterhansel by nearly six minutes in the overall standings. He said: "We had a couple of big scary moments. For us, we've got to make time. We're in a different position to him (Peterhansel). He has to conserve his time and I've got to make it. "We've got four days left, four real days of racing left and the Hummer's strong. I can't believe he could catch us there, because we were going crazy. So he's a madman; if he beats us, he's a madman. Madder than me!" In the motorbike classification, Cyril Despres won stage nine to return to the top of the overall standings in his seesaw battle with Spain's Mark Como. The Frenchman, who got stuck in a patch of mud for ten minutes during stage eight, bounced back to triumph in the 606km stretch with Como coming in second. Despres now leads Como by two minutes 28 seconds in the overall standings. He told the Dakar Rally's official website: "After a difficult day yesterday when you start to doubt, I had to get back to winning ways. "It's very competitive. Like any top level sportsman, if you don't like confrontation or squeezing the last ounces of strength out of yourself, then you're not ready for a fight. But, as for me, I'm up for it."

chatgpt: The 2012 Dakar Rally has experienced yet another unexpected turn of events with the withdrawal of defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah. The Qatari racer had been making steady progress through the race until he hit a snag on the ninth stage. Unfortunately, his Hummer broke down, forcing him to retire from the rally. Al-Attiyah had been one of the top contenders for the title, and his early exit from the race has disappointed his fans. However, the rally has continued, and American driver Bobby Gordon has emerged as a potential threat to the current leader, Stephane Peterhansel. On the ninth stage, Gordon put on a stunning performance, winning the stage and closing in on Peterhansel, who is currently leading the race. The gap between the two remains narrow, and with several stages still to go, anything can happen. Meanwhile, in the motorcycle race, Cyril Despres has regained the lead from his arch-rival Marc Coma. Despres, who has won the race on four previous occasions, had struggled early on in the race but has come back strongly over the past few stages. He now leads the race by a considerable margin and will be hoping to maintain his momentum in the remaining stages. Coma, on the other hand, had started the race strongly, winning several stages to take the lead. However, he has struggled in recent stages, allowing Despres to take the lead. Coma is still within striking distance of Despres and will be looking to mount a comeback in the final stages of the race. Overall, the 2012 Dakar Rally has lived up to its reputation as one of the toughest and most unpredictable races in the world. With defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah out of the race, there is now a chance for a new champion to emerge. With several stages still to go, the race is far from over, and fans around the world will be eagerly following the remaining stages to see who comes out on top.
