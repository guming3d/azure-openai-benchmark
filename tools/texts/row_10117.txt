article: Martin Samuel's attack on the Champions League seeding system . UEFA have confirmed a revamp to their seeding allocation for the Champions League. From the 2015-16 campaign, the champions from the top seven leagues in Europe will feature as top seeds along with the holders of the competition. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel attacked the current seeding system, highlighting the absurdity of Arsenal, who finished fourth in the Premier League last season, being in Pot 1 while title winners Manchester City were in Pot 2. Manchester City would be top seeds in the Champions League if they retain their Premier League title . But for Arsenal, the new rules leave them on the cusp of losing their top seed place in the Champions League having not won the Premier League title in over 10 years . Were the new rules in play this season, here's how Pot 1 would have looked: . 1 Spain - Atletico . 2 England - Manchester City . 3 Germany - Bayern Munich . 4 Portugal - Benfica . 5 Italy - Juventus . 6 Russia - CSKA Moscow . 7 France - PSG . 8 Holders - Real Madrid . But Sky Sports News has revealed that talks  took place earlier this year and the plans over seeding - which are the same as Samuel outlined in Sportsmail - were approved by the club competition committee in May. UEFA president Michel Platini hopes the rules would stop domestic champions in the major European leagues being ranked lower than other clubs from their nations. It would also prevent situations like in this season's Group A where the champions of Italy (Juventus), Spain (Atletico Madrid), Holland (Ajax) and Sweden (Malmo) are all in together. The system currently works on the co-efficient system, where clubs' previous Champions League performances and the ranking of their domestic league is taken into account.

Arsenal, shown by Iker Casillas, were among the Champions League top seeds . The latest seeding rules will come as bad news for the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United, should they qualify for the Champions League but not win the Barclays Premier League or, in Arsenal’s case, not land the biggest prize in European football this season. Both clubs have previously enjoyed top-seed status due to their high UEFA coefficient. Under the new rules, only the Premier League champions would go into pot one next season.

chatgpt: UEFA has announced a new system for determining seedings in the group stages of the Champions League. Beginning with the 2015-16 campaign, the top seeds in each group will be the holders and winners of Europe's top seven leagues. This means that the Premier League, along with the top leagues in Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal and Russia, will each have a top-seeded team in the competition. The new system will replace the previous method of determining seedings, which was based on a combination of UEFA coefficients and club rankings. This system came under criticism for allowing teams like Arsenal and Manchester United to be top seeds despite not winning their respective leagues. As a result of the new system, Arsenal and Manchester United could potentially lose their top billing in the competition. The Premier League has historically had multiple top-seeded teams in the Champions League, but this new system will limit the league to just one top seed. UEFA's decision to include the top leagues in the seedings will ensure that the Champions League reflects the strength of Europe's top football nations. The seven leagues included in the seedings account for over 50% of the points earned by clubs in the competition over the past five seasons. In addition to the top-seeded team from each league, the remaining seeds will be determined based on club coefficients. This will take into account a team's performance in European competition over the past five seasons, as well as their coefficient ranking. This method ensures that teams who consistently perform well in Europe will be rewarded with favourable seedings. UEFA's decision to change the seeding system has been met with mixed reactions. Some argue that the new system will provide a more accurate reflection of the strength of Europe's top leagues, while others believe it will limit the opportunities for teams from less prominent leagues. Despite the differing opinions, one thing is clear – the Champions League is set to become even more competitive with the introduction of this new seeding system. Football fans across the continent will look forward to the new season with even greater anticipation as their team battles it out for the coveted Champions League trophy.
