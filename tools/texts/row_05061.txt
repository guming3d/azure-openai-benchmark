Foreign fraudsters are trawling through public registers to target households  in a sophisticated new identity theft scam. The criminals use personal details from records such as Companies House to apply for credit and store cards. They order expensive equipment online from abroad and an accomplice then waits near the unsuspecting victim’s home to intercept the courier and sign for the goods. Step one: Fraudsters use personal details from records such as Companies House to apply for credit and store cards and order equipment online . If the parcel has already been delivered, a bogus courier will call at the house and ask for the item’s return, claiming it was sent in error. One victim, Mike Finlason, 70, from Fareham, Hampshire, received an iPhone and watch from Argos last week that he had not ordered. When he contacted the company, he was told he had applied for an Argos credit card on February 18 and bought the goods at the same time. The order had been placed from an AOL email address in  St Petersburg, Russia. Step two: The criminals wait near the unsuspecting victim¿s home to intercept the courier and sign for the goods. The applicant had given  Mr Finlason’s name, address and date of birth, and described his job as director of My Music Ltd – a now-defunct company he had set up in the 1990s. Mr Finlason said: ‘I was told that fraudsters in Russia have been going through the Companies House website for personal information like this. Argos told me it’s going on all over the country.’ The Home Retail Group,  which owns Argos, said: ‘We are continually working to combat new fraud tactics and have stringent processes in place  to protect our customers.’ A spokesman for Action Fraud – the UK’s internet crime reporting centre – confirmed that police forces around the country were investigating incidents of ‘courier scam’. Companies House said it was unaware its website was being plundered in this way.

chatgpt: Businesses and individuals who use Companies House, the UK's online registry of company information, may have been unknowingly assisting fraudsters in their criminal activities. Criminals have been using Companies House details to fraudulently apply for credit cards, according to a recent report. Fraudsters are then ordering equipment online, and intercepting the delivery to sell to unsuspecting buyers. According to the report, criminals have been using the information obtained from Companies House, such as company names, addresses, and director details, to apply for credit cards from financial institutions. The fraudsters are then using these credit cards to purchase expensive equipment and intercepting the delivery of the equipment to sell it on the black market. Companies House, however, has stated that they were "unaware" that criminals were using their site to commit fraud. Despite this, the report suggests that Companies House could still be held responsible for the information that they provide being used in fraudulent activities. The report highlights the importance of businesses and individuals being vigilant when it comes to their personal and business information. Companies House has a duty to protect the information that they hold, but customers must also ensure that they are not sharing their details with anyone who may use it for fraudulent activities. The report also suggests that financial institutions should be improving their checks and balances when it comes to reviewing credit card applications. Banks and credit card providers should be more vigilant when approving applications that contain the same information that Companies House provides on their website. Furthermore, delivery companies should also be more vigilant when it comes to delivering expensive equipment. Companies should be verifying the identity of the person who is attempting to intercept the delivery to ensure that the equipment is being delivered to the correct person. While Companies House has stated that they are taking steps to improve their security measures, individuals and businesses must also take steps to protect themselves from fraudsters. It is crucial that businesses and individuals safeguard their personal information, and be vigilant when it comes to any suspicious activity. In conclusion, the report highlights the need for Companies House and financial institutions to improve their security measures, and for businesses and individuals to be more vigilant when it comes to their personal information. With the increase in online fraud, it is vital that everyone takes steps to protect themselves against criminals who are using the internet to commit fraudulent activities.
