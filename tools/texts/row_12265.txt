article: (CNN) -- The state of New Jersey is imposing harsher restrictions on Ferris wheel safety after an 11-year-old rider fell to her death earlier this month. Officials are mandating riders be at least 54 inches to ride without supervision, according to a letter from Michael Triplett of the New Jersey Carnival and Amusement Ride Safety Unit. Triplett also "strongly recommended" that each car have at least two riders, and added that if a manufacturer has a more strict requirement, that requirement should be followed. The changes coincide with the release of a preliminary report into the death of Abiah Jones of Pleasantville, New Jersey, who fell at Morey's Piers Mariner's Landing Pier, in Wildwood, on June 3. Jones, who met a 54-inch height requirement, was on a school trip when she fell from one of the park's main attractions, called The Great Wheel. After receiving first aid at the scene, she was taken to Cape Regional Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. How the girl fell is still undetermined, and officials have no eyewitnesses, according to a report by the state of New Jersey. Surveillance footage showed her during the fall but did not show her leaving the gondola, the report said. It determined she entered the ride as a single rider and sustained "significant head trauma as well as cuts on her arms and shoulders," hitting several objects on her way to the ground. The findings also concluded operators had no knowledge of any problems, the ride had no mechanical defects, and no other problems had been reported in its 25-year history. "The fact that Abiah Jones was alone in the gondola, without any nearby passengers, may have led her to take a risk that she would have been convinced not to take if there were other riders in the gondola," the state investigator concluded. At 156 feet, the ride is one of the tallest wheels on the East Coast, Morey Piers spokeswoman Lindsey Young told CNN.

chatgpt: New regulations within the amusement park industry have been introduced to ensure rider safety. The new rules mandate that all riders must be at least 54 inches tall to ride without supervision. This comes in the wake of the tragic accident that claimed the life of 11-year-old Abiah Jones at a Wildwood amusement park.  The young girl fell to her death on June 3, with officials still unsure how exactly the incident occurred. There were no witnesses to the event, which makes it particularly difficult to determine what went wrong. However, the tragedy has served as a wake-up call for the entire amusement park industry.  In response to the incident, an official's letter has been issued that "strongly recommends" having two riders in each car. The goal is to ensure that riders have some form of supervision during the attraction.  The regulations are being welcomed by industry experts and safety advocates who have been calling for stricter adherence to safety protocols. According to a report by the National Safety Council, amusement park accidents are more common than one might think. In fact, the report states that over 4,000 people are injured in amusement park accidents in the United States each year.  This new mandate seeks to make a significant change in a park's safety culture by ensuring that proper safety measures are taken. Amusement park operators will now have to be more vigilant in enforcing these new safety measures to avoid more tragic accidents like Abiah Jones'.  Overall, the new rules are a step in the right direction for the safety of amusement park riders. While they may create some inconvenience for visitors, it is important to prioritize their safety above all else. The Wildwood incident has shown that these rules may be necessary to prevent further devastating accidents, and we can only hope that other amusement parks will follow suit.
