Disagreement: The Cologne-based dominatrix allegedly refused to un-tie her client (stock picture) An undertaker has sued a prostitute who specialises in dominatrix role-play  - saying he did not wish to be whipped or have hot wax dripped on to his body. The 49-year-old, who has not been named, told a Cologne district court that the prostitute - a mother-of-three - became aggressive after ingesting cocaine, and ended up keeping him tied on his bed beyond their agreed two-hour session. She allegedly held a knife to his throat - while he was tied up - and demanded his PIN details. However the prostitute denies his story - and because of the amount of cocaine in both people's systems, the court said it was possible one or both of them were hallucinating details, making it difficult to ascertain the truth. According to TheLocal.de, the undertaker said: I just wanted some erotic role-play, not to be dominated. He claimed he was forced to swallow cocaine, and that the dominatrix stole €980 from his bank account. However the dominatrix said her client asked her to stay after his first two hours, and also asked if she could find a transsexual to join in. Cologne: The incident happened within the district of the German city . She said she took his card details to ensure she was paid and said: 'My clients pay me to hurt them.' She added: 'I do this so often, I've had bad experiences.' The alleged victim has to travell from a psychiatric institute to give his testimony, TheLocal reported, and he was accompanied by a psychiatrist. The court ruled that both of them may have been hallucinating - and therefore it was impossible to know what really happened. The court ordered the dominatrix to pay €200 to an aid organisation that helps victims of crime.

According to the Undertaker, he had hired the dominatrix for a session but things quickly became out of control after she had used cocaine. The dominatrix, whose name has not been revealed, reportedly showed up to the session visibly under the influence of drugs. The Undertaker tried to ignore the signs, but things quickly took a turn for the worse when the dominatrix became increasingly aggressive. "She started getting violent and argumentative," the Undertaker said in an interview with a local news outlet. "It was clear that she was not in the right state of mind." The Undertaker explained that he attempted to deescalate the situation, but the dominatrix's erratic behavior only continued to escalate. "I tried to get her to calm down, but she just kept getting more and more aggressive," he said. The wrestling icon eventually had to call for help, and the dominatrix was eventually subdued and taken away by the authorities. The Undertaker himself was unharmed in the incident. The situation has raised concerns about drug use in the BDSM community and the potential dangers that can come from it. It is important for individuals to understand that such activities should always be safe, consensual, and sober. As for the Undertaker, he says he will never forget the frightening encounter. "It was definitely not what I had signed up for," he said. "But I am grateful that I came out of it unharmed."
