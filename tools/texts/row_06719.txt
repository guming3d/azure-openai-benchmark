chatgpt: The CEO of AEG Live, Randy Phillips, has criticized Katherine Jackson for what he describes as "extortion attempts" against his company. Phillips was responding to claims made by Jackson's mother and children, who have leveled accusations at AEG Live in relation to Michael Jackson's death. The Jackson family claims that AEG Live is liable for Michael Jackson's death, which occurred in 2009. They allege that the concert promoter was responsible for hiring Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in relation to Jackson's death. Murray had been serving as Jackson's personal physician at the time of his passing. However, Phillips has disputed these claims, stating that Jackson himself had chosen Dr. Murray to be his personal physician. He further alleges that AEG Live had no involvement in Murray's hiring and that the responsibility lay with Jackson himself. Phillips has also accused Katherine Jackson of attempting to extort money from AEG Live. He claims that the family was seeking a settlement worth tens of millions of dollars, which he describes as a form of "extortion". These sharp words from Phillips come as part of an ongoing legal saga surrounding Michael Jackson's death. The Jackson family has already settled a wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live, with the company paying out $20 million to the family in 2016. However, the parties are still embroiled in a legal battle over the issue of who was responsible for Michael Jackson's hiring of Dr. Murray. The case has garnered widespread attention due to Michael Jackson's global status as one of the most popular entertainers in history. His death at the age of 50 shocked fans around the world and has led to years of legal wrangling. Despite the ongoing controversy, Randy Phillips remained defiant in his comments regarding Katherine Jackson's allegations. "We're not just going to roll over and give people money they don't deserve," he said. "We are confident that the evidence will show that we did not do anything wrong." As the legal battle continues to unfold, it seems that the controversy surrounding Michael Jackson's death shows no signs of abating.
