chatgpt: Injuries have plagued Hull City this weekend as they lost two key players to injuries during their match against Sunderland. Striker Nikica Jelvaic was injured during warm-up on Saturday, while Michael Dawson injured his ankle late in a spirited draw. Jelvaic, who has been instrumental in Hull City's season so far, will be sorely missed. The Croatian international has been in impressive form, scoring a total of six goals this season in the Premier League. He had been expected to play a significant role in Hull's upcoming matches against Tottenham Hotspur, Cardiff City, and Manchester United, but his injury will keep him out for four to six weeks. Michael Dawson's injury came late in the game, and the defender was unable to continue, leaving Hull City to play with ten men. According to the club, Dawson will also miss the next four to six weeks of football. Hull City's injury woes do not stop there. Goalkeeper Steve Harper is also out with a torn bicep tendon. The veteran goalkeeper has been a reliable player for Hull City so far, making several crucial saves in the Premier League this season. Harper's injury will keep him sidelined for the foreseeable future. Hull City manager Steve Bruce said, "It's a tough time for us at the moment. Losing Jelvaic and Dawson for four to six weeks is a massive blow, but we have to get on with it. We have a big squad, and we will give some of the younger players a chance to show what they can do." Hull City will undoubtedly miss the experience and talent of Jelvaic and Dawson, but the team has shown resilience and determination in the face of adversity. Their upcoming fixtures will be challenging, but the Tigers will be determined to continue their impressive start to the season without some of their key players. Injuries are always a significant concern for any team in any sport. Hull City will have to rely on other players to step up and fill the void left by the injured trio. As the season progresses, it will be interesting to see how the Tigers cope with these setbacks and whether they can continue their good form without some of their star players.
