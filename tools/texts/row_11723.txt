From bizarre 'nerve nutrients' to strange contraptions that shot live electric currents through the body, the means used to treat mental illness weren't always the most pleasant. Now a new exhibition promises to reveal how doctors made the leap from tinctures crammed with phosphates to modern medicine over just 250 years. The exhibition, entitled Mind Maps: Stories from Psychology, also includes a section that focuses on the birth of radar, the driver for a number of breakthroughs in the early 20th century, and looks at the Victorian obsession with 'melancholia'. Painful: This electroconvulsive therapy machine was made in the 1940s for the Burden Neurological Institute . Other fascinating exhibits include a series of vintage nerve tonics, among them one named Huxley's Ner-Vigor, which claimed to strengthen the nerves, and the 'frog pistol', a bizarre contraption invented by German scientist Emil du Boise-Reymond to show the effect electricity had on dismembered frog's legs. The Science Museum, which is hosting the free exhibition, also included a grim-looking Ediswan electroconvulsive therapy machine, which was widely used between 1944 and 1960, in the display. Yet more objects show how early scientists attempted to understand the mind, frequently with the help of some very strange contraptions. Particularly odd is Fechner's double sound pendulum, which was invented by German scientists in 1898 and used by early psychologists to 'listen' to the thoughts of their patients. Fortifying: Sedating tonics such as Ner-Vigor and Spasmodene were thought to boost the nervous system . Bizarre: Fechner's double sound pendulum was thought to be able to pick up people's thoughts . Clever: The Frog Pistol, was devised by scientists to demonstrate the stimulation of nerves in a frog's leg . Equally strange is the chronoscope, an English invention used to measure the speed of thought with varying levels of success. Speaking about the exhibition, curator Phil Loring said: 'The quest to uncover the mysteries of the mind has . pre-occupied scientists for centuries and continues to do so in 2013 â€“ . where mental wellbeing remains a pressing topic in society. 'This . exhibition looks at how far weâ€™ve progressed in our understanding of the . mind and how treatments for mental health conditions have evolved over . the past three centuries.'

chatgpt: In the world of medicine, treatments and methods have evolved over time. In the Victorian Age, early treatments were frequently painful and sometimes used electricity to cure ailments. However, a new form of medicine emerged in the form of nerve tonics, many with phosphates, which became popular during this time. Nerve tonics, which consisted mainly of natural ingredients, were seen as a supplement to everyday life. These tonics were believed to be very beneficial to the body, not only to alleviate pain but also to calm nerves and provide a general sense of well-being. These tonics gained popularity quickly, and many people began to swear by their healing properties. As with all new forms of medicine, the use of tonics was met with some skepticism. Some medical professionals believed that tonics had no real medicinal value and were merely a placebo effect. However, the popularity of tonics continued to grow, and they became a staple of Victorian medicine. During this time, doctors also relied on gadgets to diagnose medical conditions. One such gadget was Fechner's double sound pendulum, which was used to test hearing. This device produced two sounds that were of the same pitch, but one of the sounds was louder than the other. By using the pendulum, doctors could determine if a patient had hearing loss or other hearing-related issues. Other gadgets during this time included the ophthalmoscope, which was used to examine the retina and diagnose eye-related problems. Doctors also relied on the sphygmomanometer to determine blood pressure, which is still used today. Despite the advancements in medical technology during the Victorian Age, some treatments remained painful and outdated. One such treatment was the use of electricity, which was used to treat a variety of medical conditions. Patients were often subjected to electric shock therapy, which was believed to cure everything from mental illness to physical pain. Although this method of treatment was seen as barbaric by many, it continued to be used up until the early 20th century. In conclusion, the Victorian Age saw a significant shift in the world of medicine. Although early treatments were often painful and outdated, nerve tonics and other new forms of medicine emerged that provided relief to those in need. Additionally, the use of gadgets such as Fechner's double sound pendulum paved the way for modern diagnostic tools we see today. While some treatments were seen as outdated, this period in medical history laid the foundation for the medical advances we see today.
