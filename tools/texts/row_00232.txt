article: (CNN) -- A Catholic aid organization operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the country's government have accused Uganda-based rebels of massacring 400 civilians during Christmas celebrations last week. The Lord's Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony, has been accused of many atrocities. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Congo put the death toll at 189 and said the Lord's Resistance Army rebels also abducted 20 children. Caritas International expressed its "shock" at the killing spree in northeastern Congo, blaming the rebels for attacking a Christmas day concert sponsored by the Catholic church in the town of Faradje. LRA rebels also burned down a church in another village, it said. "The areas have been plundered, leaving the people in desperate need of aid," the organization said in a news release issued on Monday. "Caritas says that the number of dead bodies risk spreading disease." Several Congolese officials and two Catholic priests were among those killed in Faradje, according to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, known by its French acronym MONUC. The rebels torched 120 homes in Faradje, and looted the rest of the village -- forcing its 30,000 residents to flee to neighboring towns -- according to the U.N., citing humanitarian workers in the region. Congo's Communications Minister Lambert Mende Omalanga told CNN that the attacks happened as the rebels were fleeing Congolese army forces and victims were "mostly women, children and old men -- those who could not run and escape." Congo's army, along with Ugandan and Sudanese forces, launched a raid against LRA rebels earlier this month. It came amid stalled peace negotiations intended to disarm LRA leader Joseph Kony and end a rebellion that began in Uganda over two decades ago when President Yoweri Museveni came to power. The LRA, led by Kony, who claims to have spiritual powers, sought to overthrow Uganda's government, demanding the constitution be replaced with a version of the Ten Commandments. The Ugandan government and the rebels agreed to a cessation of hostilities in August 2006, but there have been outbursts of fighting since. The LRA, which the U.S. State Department describes as "vicious and cult-like," is known for its unpredictable behavior. Local villagers and international human rights groups have accused the rebels of committing widespread abuses, including recruiting young boys and girls as soldiers and sex slaves. In October 2005, the International Criminal Court unsealed arrest warrants for five LRA commanders, including Kony, who is alleged to have "ordered LRA forces to begin a campaign of attacks against civilians in Uganda" in 2002, according to the court. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Christmas Day, a festive concert sponsored by a church in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Ituri province turned into a night of horror, as armed rebels attacked the attendees, leaving over 400 dead. Several aid groups, as well as the Congolese government, have since accused the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan-based rebel group, of being behind the atrocity. According to reports, the concert was being held in the town of Drodro, located in Ituri province in the northeast region of the country, near the border with Uganda. Witnesses say several armed men arrived on the scene and began firing indiscriminately into the crowd, leaving scores of men, women, and children dead or injured. In a statement released to the press, the aid group Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which provided medical care to some of the victims, described the attack as a "massacre" and expressed its condolences to the families of the victims. "It is deeply shocking to see civilians targeted in such a brutal and senseless manner, especially on a day like Christmas," the statement read. The Congolese government also denounced the attack, blaming the Lord's Resistance Army for the deaths. "We strongly condemn this brutal act of violence, which has claimed the lives of so many innocent civilians," a government spokesperson said in a statement. "We will do everything in our power to bring those responsible to justice and ensure that such a tragedy never happens again." A number of aid groups also accused the Lord's Resistance Army of being behind the attack. In a statement, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said it was "appalled by the horrific attack" and called for "those responsible to be held accountable." The IRC also provided emergency assistance to the survivors of the attack. The Lord's Resistance Army, which has been active in the region for over two decades, has a history of carrying out brutal attacks on civilians, including mass killings, kidnappings, and forced recruitment of children as soldiers. The group, which claims to be fighting for the rights of the Acholi people of northern Uganda, has been accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including mutilation, rape, and torture. While the exact motivation behind the Christmas Day attack is not yet clear, some have suggested that it may be linked to disputes over land and resources in the region. Ituri province has long been an area of conflict, with various ethnic and armed groups vying for control of its valuable mineral resources. The attack has sparked outrage and calls for action from both within and outside the country, with many calling for increased efforts to combat the Lord's Resistance Army and other armed groups in the region. As the investigation into the attack continues, the world watches and waits for justice to be done, and for the innocent victims of this brutal act of violence to be remembered and honored.
