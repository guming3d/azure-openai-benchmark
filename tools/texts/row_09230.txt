article: Economical: Wood-fired sources of heating have become increasingly popular to cut heating costs, with 200,000 stoves installed a year . They are in hot demand among Britons hoping to save money on energy bills. But trendy wood-burning stoves are fuelling air pollution, scientists warn. Research shows levels of a particularly nasty form of pollution surge during winter when stoves and open fires are lit. Wood-fired sources of heating have become increasingly popular to cut heating costs, with 200,000 stoves installed a year. Estate agents say they can add up to 5 per cent to a house’s value. They are also seen as environmentally friendly because carbon dioxide released by burning wood is taken up by young trees – making the fuel carbon neutral. As a result, homeowners can get government subsidies if they install wood-fired boilers. But wood may not be as green as it seems. Scientists from King’s College London say burning wood generates particulates – minuscule particles that can raise the risk of heart disease, trigger asthma and shorten lives. Their research shows levels surge during winter evenings – when wood-burning accounts for 13 per cent of particulates in the air in some British cities. In some hot spots, the pollution is comparable to that from traffic fumes. Researcher Dr Gary Fuller told the Sunday Times: ‘Although the apparent carbon neutrality of wood may make it appear environmentally friendly, there is growing evidence of adverse health effects from wood smoke. ‘Domestic wood burning takes place where people live and at times when they are at home. ‘Coupled with still night-time conditions even modest wood-burning in urban areas may lead to particulate exposures comparable to those from traffic sources. ‘We need to manage urban emissions to ensure increased wood-burning does not offset schemes to reduce traffic pollution.’ Lethal: Scientists from King’s College London say burning wood generates particulates – minuscule particles that can raise the risk of heart disease, trigger asthma and shorten lives . The Stove Industry Alliance, which represents manufacturers, said that modern stoves are greener than their predecessors. Hugh Wells, the association’s deputy chairman, said: ‘Wood-fired stoves are a genuinely green and carbon neutral way of heating your home, which can save you money and make you less dependent on the big energy companies. ‘Modern stoves are very efficient and clean, with about 14 milligrams of particulate per cubic metre of air. ‘The compares to 100mg five years ago.’ The Department of Energy and Climate Change said that the technology has ‘an important role to play in transforming the way we heat our homes.’

chatgpt: Burning wood has long been a popular way to heat homes, but it comes with a hidden cost. Recent studies have shown that the particulates generated by burning wood can pose a significant health risk, particularly for those with asthma. Despite this, the popularity of wood-burning stoves continues to grow, with many homeowners seeing them as a stylish and cost-effective way to heat their homes. However, the Stove Industry Alliance (SIA) has taken steps to address these concerns. The organization, which represents stove manufacturers in the UK, has been working to improve the design of wood-burning stoves in order to reduce the amount of particulate matter they generate. According to the SIA, modern wood-burning stoves are much more efficient than those produced in the past. Newer models incorporate features like secondary burners and airwash systems that help to ensure more complete combustion of the wood, resulting in fewer emissions. These improvements have not gone unnoticed by the public. Estate agents have reported that wood-burning stoves can add as much as 5% to the market value of a home, making them an attractive option for homeowners who are looking to increase the value of their property. Of course, the health risks associated with burning wood cannot be ignored. Particulate matter generated by wood-burning stoves can lead to respiratory problems, particularly in those with pre-existing conditions like asthma. The SIA acknowledges this risk, and has recommended that homeowners take steps to minimize the amount of particulate matter generated by their stoves. One of the most effective ways homeowners can do this is by burning dry, seasoned wood. Wet or unseasoned wood produces much more particulate matter than dry wood, so it's important to ensure that the wood being burned is as dry as possible. Homeowners should also avoid burning other materials in their stoves, such as paper or plastic, which can release harmful chemicals into the air. At the end of the day, the decision to install a wood-burning stove ultimately comes down to weighing the benefits against the risks. While the improvements made by the SIA have gone a long way towards reducing the environmental impact of these stoves, they still carry a health risk that should not be ignored. As more and more homeowners turn to wood-burning stoves as a way to heat their homes, it's important that they do so responsibly. By burning the right kind of wood and taking steps to minimize emissions, homeowners can enjoy the warmth and comfort of a wood-burning stove without putting their health at risk.
