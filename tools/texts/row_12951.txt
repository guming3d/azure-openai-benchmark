article: (CNN) -- A San Francisco Giants fan who threw a banana that landed near Baltimore Orioles centerfielder Adam Jones during a weekend game said the incident was not racially motivated, but an act of frustration at his team's poor performance. Alexander Poulides told the San Jose Mercury News that he's embarrassed and shocked, but most of all apologetic for his "indiscretion." Poulides said he was unaware of the uproar until Monday morning when he turned on the news. His heart sank when heard the outcry over an unidentified Giants fan who threw a banana at Jones, who is African-American. "Oh, my God,'' Poulides said. "I threw a banana on my way out." That's when he contacted the newspaper to claim responsibility. "I'm embarrassed and shocked by the outcome,'' he said. "In hindsight, I wish I didn't do it and I apologize. I'm very sorry." Poulides grabbed the banana from a catering cart, tossing it on the field, he said. The fruit became a projectile of disgust during the ninth inning of a blowout loss on Sunday to the Orioles at AT&T Park. The team's front office said it's continuing to investigate. "The Giants have a zero tolerance policy against this type of behavior, which results in immediate ejection from the ballpark," a statement from the team said. "While we have been investigating the matter since we learned of the situation, unfortunately we have been unable to identify the person responsible. "We would like to extend our sincerest apologies to Adam and the entire Orioles organization for this unfortunate incident. "The inappropriate actions of this individual in no way reflect the values of our organization and our fans." Jones took to his official Twitter account to express his displeasure. "I want to thank whatever (expletive) threw that banana towards my direction in CF in the last inning," he posted. "Way to show ur class u jackass." MLB senior vice president of public relations Patrick Courtney told CNN Sports on Monday: "We are looking into this situation." The Orioles overcame a two-run deficit to score 10 unanswered runs in the 10-2 victory over last season's World Series champs. Jones hit a three-run homer at the top of the ninth inning to help clinch the victory. Man charged in banana throwing incident at NHL game . CNN Sports contributed to this report .

chatgpt: The Major League Baseball (MLB) has launched an investigation into the events that took place during the Orioles-Giants game on Sunday. Orioles centerfielder, Adam Jones, took to Twitter to express his frustration after a fan allegedly threw a banana at him during the game. The incident spurred a significant amount of backlash on social media, with fans and players alike calling for action to be taken against the fan responsible. The Giants organization quickly issued a statement apologizing for the behavior of the fan and promising to work closely with MLB to investigate the matter. The incident has thrust issues of racism and discrimination in sports back into the spotlight, as many are pointing to the incident as evidence of a larger problem in the industry. Jones himself has been an outspoken advocate for social justice and racial equality, and his reaction to the incident was a powerful reminder of the importance of addressing these issues head-on. In his tweet, Jones expressed his disappointment and anger at the fan's behavior, writing, "It's 2019 and this is still happening...we are better than this." He went on to thank his fellow players and fans for their support, adding that he hoped the incident would serve as a wake-up call for the industry as a whole. MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred also issued a statement, calling the incident "completely unacceptable" and promising a thorough investigation into the matter. He emphasized the league's commitment to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all players and fans, and called on the entire industry to redouble its efforts to address issues of discrimination and bias. The incident has sparked a broader conversation about the role of sports in promoting social justice and equality. Many are calling on teams and leagues to take a more active stance on these issues, using their influence and platform to effect meaningful change in society. Others argue that sports should remain apolitical and focus solely on the game itself. Regardless of where one falls on this issue, one thing is clear: incidents like the one that took place on Sunday must be taken seriously and addressed directly. Only by acknowledging and confronting these issues can we hope to create a more just and equitable world for all.
