article: (CNN) -- England coach Roy Hodgson has overlooked experienced international Rio Ferdinand for a second time after electing to call up Liverpool defender Martin Kelly as a replacement for the injured Gary Cahill. Chelsea's Cahill suffered a double jaw fracture in England's 1-0 win over Belgium on Saturday, but instead of turning to Ferdinand, who has 81 caps, Hodgson drafted in Kelly -- who only made his international debut last month. When Hodgson named his 23-man Euro 2012 squad last month he said he omitted the 33-year-old for "footballing reasons," having been asked if it was because of John Terry's impending court case for allegedly abusing Ferdinand's younger brother Anton. Manchester United's Ferdinand used his official Twitter account on Sunday to say, "What reasons?????!!!" His agent Jamie Moralee released a statement accusing Hodgson of a "lack of respect" for the center back. "Rio's very disappointed," said Moralee. "He thought he had done enough. It's very difficult to accept. "This is a player with 81 caps for his country. I don't know anyone who understands it. It's not been handled in the right way." England's preparations have been overshadowed by Chelsea captain Terry's trial, which takes place after the June 8-July 1 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. Terry denies the charges. Terry and Ferdinand have been England's preferred defensive pairing in recent years, but while the former will travel to the team's base in Krakow this week, the latter's international career now appears to be over. Cahill joined clubmate Frank Lampard in withdrawing from the squad, with the veteran midfielder ruled out last week due to a thigh injury. Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry also misses out with a groin injury. France coach Laurent Blanc also faces injury worries ahead of the opening Group D match against England in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk on June 11. Rennes midfielder Yann M'Vila is struggling to be fit after picking up an ankle sprain during Thursday's 2-0 win over Serbia, which the French Football Federation described as "moderately serious." However, Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has recovered from a calf injury and the Bayern Munich star was due to fly out to the 2008 finalists' tournament base in Gdansk on Monday. Croatia striker Ivica Olic has been ruled out with a hamstring injury, and coach Slaven Bilic has replaced him with Nikola Kalinic of Ukrainian club Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk.

chatgpt: England coach Roy Hodgson has once again chosen not to select experienced defender Rio Ferdinand for the national team, for the second time in recent squad announcements. However, Hodgson has called up Liverpool's Martin Kelly as a replacement for the injured Gary Cahill.  Ferdinand, who has made 81 appearances for England, has been overlooked by Hodgson despite a series of impressive performances for his club Manchester United in recent months. Fans and analysts alike have criticized Hodgson's decision, questioning the coach's loyalty to his players and suggesting that Ferdinand's absence will weaken the team's defense. But Hodgson has stood firm in his decision, stating that he is looking for players who can work well together and fit in with his overall game plan. He emphasized that his selection process is based on merit and not on reputation or past achievements.  Meanwhile, France midfielder Yann M'Vila is struggling to be fit for their upcoming match against England on June 9. M'Vila suffered a thigh injury during training and missed the team's friendly against Serbia on May 31. The 22-year-old defensive midfielder has been a key player for France in recent years, and his absence would be a blow to their midfield. France coach Didier Deschamps has expressed concern about M'Vila's fitness but stated that he will give the midfielder every chance to recover before making a final decision about his inclusion in the team. M'Vila's absence would open up a spot for another midfielder in the squad, and Deschamps has several options to choose from. On the other hand, Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger is fit to travel with his teammates as they head to their training camp in Italy on Monday. The midfielder had been a doubt after suffering from an ankle injury, but he has recovered in time to join the team for their preparations for the European Championship. Schweinsteiger is a crucial player for Germany, having played in two World Cup campaigns and two European Championships. His inclusion in the squad will be a big boost for coach Joachim Low, who is looking to guide his team to glory in the tournament. In summary, Hodgson's decision to exclude Ferdinand has once again come under scrutiny, while M'Vila's injury could impact France's midfield. However, Schweinsteiger's return to fitness is good news for Germany and their fans as they gear up for the European Championship. All eyes now turn to the tournament, which promises to be an exciting showcase of football talent from across Europe.
