article: Per Mertesacker has told Arsenal's shellshocked players to raise their game after the disastrous defensive performance against Anderlecht. Arsenal were leading their Group D clash 3-0 against the Belgian champions with half an hour left to play when they came back to draw 3-3 at the Emirates. Mertesacker is refusing to take responsibility for yet another inept defensive display and insists the team must work together to prevent teams taking advantage of their fragile confidence.

Anderlecht striker Aleksandar Mitrovic (right) heads a late equaliser for his side against the Gunners . The Arsenal defender, now preparing for Sunday's trip to the Liberty Stadium to play Swansea, said: 'We will bounce back quickly and we are really good at that and have shown that a couple of times. 'It was a good warning and everyone should raise their game and give 10 per cent more when it is really needed. 'Anyway we have to defend better as a team. Even when we drop they always look dangerous. We need to be more aware of that. Everyone in the team has to be involved to defend. 'We cannot afford that we have just five or six players defending and just the back four. That's what we lacked especially in the final third in the last 20 minutes.

Mitrovic runs off to celebrate his decisive goal in front of Anderlecht's travelling supporters . 'It will be a tough game at Swansea. It will be totally different we cannot compare any game to one another.' Although Arsenal only need one more point to ensure progress to the Champions League second round, their defence was brutally exposed by Anderlecht's stirring comeback. Despite the team's disastrous defending, Arsenal had kept clean sheets in their previous two games — against Sunderland and Burnley — before the spectacular Champions League collapse. Mertesacker added: 'There is nothing to explain about that. I think everyone knows what happened actually. Everyone saw it, there is nothing to explain particularly. The team is very disappointed and it is a small setback for us. But we are good at bouncing back very quickly after small setbacks. This is a small one, it's a good warning I think.' Mertesacker is confident that Arsenal will bounce back quickly from their latest setback .

chatgpt: Arsenal threw away a commanding three-goal lead to draw with Anderlecht in the Champions League on Tuesday. The Gunners' captain, Per Mertesacker, believes that his team will bounce back quickly from their frustrating result, but acknowledges that they need to improve defensively if they are to achieve success this season. The London side raced to a 3-0 lead against their Belgian opponents, with goals from Mikel Arteta, Alexis Sanchez, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but they allowed Anderlecht to stage an incredible comeback in the final thirty minutes of the match, with the visitors scoring three goals to clinch a 3-3 draw. Mertesacker said after the match: "We have to analyse that and come back quickly. We are very disappointed, but we have to change our mindset and bounce back. It's a Champions League game, and you need to be more focused. We need to make [defensive] improvements quickly." Arsenal's defensive frailties have been a concern for some time, with the club conceding seven goals in their last three matches in all competitions. Mertesacker, who was rested in the Anderlecht match but is expected to return to the starting line-up against Swansea on Sunday, believes that a quick turnaround is necessary if the team is to avoid further setbacks. "We need to defend better as a team," said the German defender. "It's about the whole team defending and being focused. It's not just the defenders; the whole team has to be aware of what is happening. We need to improve quickly, and we will focus on that in the coming days." Arsenal's next match is a difficult away fixture against Swansea on Sunday, and Mertesacker knows that his team will need to be at their best to get a result against the Welsh side. "We need to focus on our upcoming games," he said. "We have to take the positives from the Anderlecht game, and we have to work on our negatives. We need to be more focused and more concentrated. It's all about us now, and we have to improve quickly." Arsenal currently sit in second place in the Premier League table, level on points with Manchester City, and they will be hoping to extend their unbeaten run in the league to nine matches when they travel to the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. With Chelsea and Manchester United lurking closely behind them in the table, Arsenal cannot afford any more slip-ups if they are to achieve their goals this season.
