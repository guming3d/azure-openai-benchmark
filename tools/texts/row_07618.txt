New Zealand's ONE News reports that by using the traditionally male print on women's leggings, Nike has offended many people in the Pacific community, who find it to be exploitative in the first place. Nike's Pro Tattoo Tech Tights have sparked controversy in Australia and New Zealand where some people say the design is too similar to the traditional Samoan Pe'a male tattoo . New Zealand parliament member Su'a William Sio told ONE News: 'Before you launch into something like this, there's generally a consultation.' 'I don't think Nike has taken the time to do that.' The Nike Pro Tattoo Tech collection was unveiled over a month ago and it was noted that they had taken inspiration from the tatau - the traditional tattoos - of Fiji, Samoa, and New Zealand. An online petition against the leggings was posted in early August on Change.org petition, which described them as a . 'direct violation of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific, and is . furthermore in violation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of . Indigenous Peoples'.

chatgpt: Sportswear giant Nike has come under fire for its latest workout gear design in Australia and New Zealand, with critics saying it bears a striking resemblance to the traditional Samoan Pe'a male tattoo. Activists claim that the design is exploitative and disrespectful to the indigenous culture of the Pacific. The controversy began when Nike released its new tights and shorts line, which features intricate patterns that some say closely resemble the Samoan Pe'a tattoo. The Pe'a is regarded as a sacred and significant symbol for Samoans, signifying courage, strength and resilience. However, the similarities have caused outrage among activists, who argue that the use of the design is a direct violation of the Pacific's Indigenous peoples. An online petition calling for the removal of the design from stores received over 750 signatures, with many expressing their disgust and disbelief that Nike could be so tone-deaf. One activist, Tasha Tautolo, expressed her frustration on social media, writing, "How I see it, @Nike has appropriated my culture in a disrespectful and degrading way. If you’re not Samoan and don’t understand the importance of Pe'a...in Samoan culture then don’t try to make a quick buckoff it." Others have echoed her sentiments, with some even calling for a boycott of Nike's products until the design is removed. The controversy has even spread to Australia, where Samoan Australians have expressed their own outrage over the design. In response to the backlash, Nike has released a statement apologizing for any offense caused and promising to remove the design from its collection. However, some activists argue that the apology is simply not enough and that more needs to be done to address the issue of cultural appropriation. This is not the first time Nike has come under fire for its designs. In 2019, the company released a sneaker line featuring a Betsy Ross flag, which some argued was a symbol of racism and slavery. The line was eventually pulled from shelves after backlash from several high-profile athletes. As the conversation around cultural sensitivity continues, it is clear that companies like Nike must be held accountable for their designs and the messages they convey. The question remains whether they will listen to the voices of activists and consumers who demand more responsible practices, or if they will continue to prioritize profits over respect.
