Hingis, 27, announced her retirement from tennis for the second time but  denied that she had ever taken performance-enhancing drugs. "I've never taken drugs and I am 100 percent innocent," said the former world number one who added that she was "shocked and appalled" by the results of test taken after she crashed out in the third round at the All England Club to Laura Granville 6-4 6-2. In a statement an emotional Hingis said: "I find this accusation so horrendous, so monstrous, that I have decided to confront it head-on by talking to the press. "My weapon on the tennis court is and always was one single thing: the game, the ingenuity on court. And for this style of tennis, there is only one performance enhancer -- the love of the game." Hingis said that she had hired an attorney to help her clear her name, but had decided to retire because she did not want to become entangled in a lengthy legal process. "A case like this one can sometimes take years to resolve, especially if both sides repeatedly appeal the case and take it to the next level. "And this is the reason for my announcement. I have no desire to spend the next several years of my life reduced to fighting against the doping officials." Hingis ended her season last month because of hip problems and said she would take as long as necessary to become fully fit again.

Referring to her retirement, he said, "Martina Hingis is a tremendous champion and a fan favorite the world over. In her most recent comeback, she proved again that she can perform at the very highest levels of the game." E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: Former world number one tennis player, Martina Hingis, has revealed that she tested positive for cocaine during Wimbledon in 2007. In her statement, released on Thursday, the Swiss player claimed that she has never taken drugs and is a clean athlete.  Hingis, now 37, announced her decision to retire from tennis earlier this week for the second time. The five-time Grand Slam singles champion first retired in 2002 due to persistent injuries, but returned to the sport in 2006. Her second retirement comes after a successful comeback in doubles in recent years, including winning three Grand Slam titles in 2015. However, the revelation of her positive drug test at Wimbledon in 2007 has tarnished her legacy in the sport. Hingis was forced to withdraw from the tournament that year due to a hip injury, but her doping controversy was not made public until now. Hingis has denied ever taking cocaine and has said that she was shocked and completely devastated by the news. She is appealing the decision made by the International Tennis Federation, which has banned her for two years from professional tennis.  In her statement, Hingis maintained her innocence and explained that she has always been and intends to remain a clean athlete. She wrote, "I have never taken drugs in my life and I would never do so. Ever since I was a child, I have been taught to play hard, play fair and to respect the game and its values. I have always taken this commitment seriously throughout my career and my life." Hingis was a prodigy who became the youngest ever player to win a Grand Slam title at age 16. She went on to win five singles Grand Slam titles, nine doubles titles and one mixed doubles title during her career. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2013. However, her career has also been marred by controversies outside of this recent doping scandal. In 2001, she was stripped of her Australian Open doubles title after her partner, Anna Kournikova, withdrew due to injury. Hingis was also forced to retire from a semi-final match at the French Open in 2002 due to severe cramping, but was later accused of faking the injury to avoid playing her opponent, Justine Henin. Despite these setbacks, Hingis has pursued other interests outside of tennis in recent years, including horse riding and skiing. She has also been actively involved in charity work, particularly in the area of education for underprivileged children. In conclusion, Martina Hingis' revelation of her positive drug test at Wimbledon in 2007 has shocked the tennis world and has cast a cloud over her illustrious career. While she maintains her innocence and continues to appeal the decision, her legacy as one of the greatest tennis players of all time will undoubtedly be questioned. Her retirement from professional tennis for the second time marks the end of an era in the sport and the beginning of a new chapter in her life.
