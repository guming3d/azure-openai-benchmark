article: (CNN) -- This holiday season, many people received e-book readers as gifts -- but what about the books? It has been surprisingly difficult to give someone an e-book as a gift. You could buy them a gift card for the e-book service of their choice, and maybe suggest which book to purchase, but you couldn't actually purchase it for them. In November, Amazon changed that. You can now buy a Kindle book as a gift. Recently I tested this by purchasing a holiday gift for a friend. She reported that obtaining my gift was easy -- she got an e-mail notification of the gift, clicked a link in the e-mail, clicked a link on the Amazon site to accept the gift, and then was able to download the book to her Kindle. This process also works for people who use the free Kindle smartphone or tablet apps, rather than the Kindle device. However if someone you know uses one of the other popular brand-name e-readers, they're probably out of luck for direct e-book gifting. So far, you cannot give a Barnes & Noble NookBook directly as a gift. Nor can you give an iBook, or a Sony e-book. You can, of course, buy or obtain e-books in other formats -- there are many: plain text, HTML, PDF, MobiPocket, ePub, and more. But you'd need to check first whether your recipient would be able to use these book formats, and that would probably ruin the surprise. As a Kindle user who has many friends who also use the Kindle, I'm glad that Amazon finally began offering this option. Obviously it can be done, and the experiences can be user-friendly for the buyer and recipient. But I'm surprised Apple, Barnes & Noble and Sony haven't followed Amazon's lead on this. They're just leaving money on the table -- and in the current tight economy, what retailer can afford to do that? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Gahran.

chatgpt: Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, has announced a significant policy change that allows customers to purchase and send e-books as gifts. This move was a long-awaited feature that many e-book users worldwide have been requesting for some time. However, the new policy comes with a caveat that limits the types of e-books that can be gifted.  According to the policy, customers can now give e-books as gifts to friends and loved ones as long as they have an Amazon account. But there’s a catch. You cannot directly give a NookBook, an iBook, or a Sony e-book as a gift. This means that Amazon customers can only purchase and send e-books in specific formats. The company’s decision to allow e-book gifting is a significant step for the industry, as it removes one of the biggest barriers faced by e-book users. Until now, purchasing e-books as gifts was a cumbersome process that usually involved buying gift cards or sending links to download e-books.  Amazon’s new policy simplifies the process of gifting e-books and makes it possible for e-book lovers to share their favorite books with their friends and family. However, the limitations on the types of e-books that can be gifted has drawn some criticism from industry experts who argue that the move undermines the spirit of digital reading. E-book users can, of course, buy or obtain e-books in other formats to gift, but this limits the options available to them. The inability to gift e-books from other platforms may lead to some customers feeling locked into Amazon’s ecosystem.  Overall, Amazon’s new policy is a significant step for the e-book industry, but it comes with some limitations that may frustrate customers. Nonetheless, the move is a win for customers who want to share their love of books with their friends and family, and it makes gifting e-books a much more efficient and streamlined process.  It remains to be seen how Amazon's competitors will respond to this policy change, but for now, Amazon customers can gift e-books with ease, albeit with some restrictions.
