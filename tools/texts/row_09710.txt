The 3-year-old German Shepherd's sad end began when his handler released him to help apprehend suspect Mark Salazar, 22. The Texas man, who was in Oklahoma City for unknown reasons, was seen stealing a car by police before he led them, including Kye's handler Sergeant Ryan Stark, on a high speed chase. After the car was brought to a halt, Salazar ran. Stark released Kye and the dog was stabbed several times when he overtook Salazar. Stark then shot Salazar to death. The police dog was taken to a veterinarian for emergency surgery, Nelson said. Stark is on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. The suspect is thought to have skipped out on an unpaid bar tab and then stolen a car, police said. While many believe otherwise, a police dog is not legally the same as a human partner. 'The canine, from the officer's standpoint, is considered an officer, but from a legal standpoint he's not. He's a tool or a weapon used by the officer,'  Nelson told KFOR. Captain Dexter said an officer isn't allowed to shoot solely in response to an attack on a dog. He says officers can use lethal force when close to a person with a knife.

chatgpt: A sombre atmosphere filled the stadium as hundreds of police handlers and their loyal canine partners gathered for the funeral of Kye, a 3-year-old German Shepherd who worked for the Oklahoma City police department. The beloved K9 officer had made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Kye, along with his handler, officer Ryan Stark, had been on duty last Saturday evening when they received a call about an alleged theft at a nearby bar. Upon arriving, they found a 22-year-old man, identified as Mark Salazar, who had apparently stiffed the bartender and stolen a car.  Salazar, who had been armed with a knife, refused to comply with the officers' commands and proceeded to attack Kye, stabbing him multiple times. The dog was immediately rushed to a veterinary hospital where emergency surgery was performed, but he succumbed to his injuries and passed away. In an act of self-defense, the officers were forced to open fire, shooting Salazar to death to protect themselves and innocent civilians in the area. Although it was a necessary action, it was a tragedy for all involved, especially for Kye's handler, Officer Stark, who was in tears throughout the funeral ceremony. The funeral procession was a heartbreaking affair as mourners carried Kye's body while bagpipe music played in the background. Veterans, police officers, and members of the public mourned the loss of Kye, who had served the community with distinction. Officer Stark, who had been Kye's handler for the past year, gave an emotional eulogy, paying tribute to the brave canine partner who had worked alongside him. He spoke about the hours of training and companionship that he and Kye had shared, and how the loss of his partner had left a hole in his heart. Kye was a shining example of the role that police dogs play in serving the community. He had been trained to detect explosives, find missing persons, and track down criminals, and had participated in numerous high-profile operations with the Oklahoma City police department. The loss of Kye has been felt deeply by the law enforcement community in Oklahoma City and beyond. Canine officers are often the unsung heroes of the police force, and Kye's death is a reminder of the sacrifices that these animals make in the line of duty.  Despite the tragic circumstances, Officer Stark has vowed to continue working with law enforcement and training new canine officers. His commitment to keeping the community safe in Kye's memory is a testament to the close bond between police handlers and their dogs. As the funeral came to a close, the casket containing Kye's body was loaded onto a police vehicle and taken to a special memorial burial site. As the procession wound its way through the street, people lined the sidewalks, waving flags and paying tribute to the fallen K9 officer. Kye may be gone, but his legacy will live on in the hearts of those who knew and loved him.
