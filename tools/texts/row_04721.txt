article: (CNN)  -- Finland's Mikko Hirvonen led a Ford clean sweep of the podium in the Rally of Sweden, the opening round of the world rally championship. Hirvonen, who won the corresponding race last season, showed his liking for the only rally of this status held solely on snow, with a commanding victory. Teammate Mads Ostberg of Norway finished at 6.5 seconds and Finland's Jari-Matti Latvala was 34 seconds adrift in third. Seven-time defending champion Sebastien Loeb finished well off the pace in sixth after suffering delays on Friday. But the Frenchman had the consolation of claiming second in his Citroen on the inaugural Power Stage which has been introduced by organizers to boost interest in the series and is televised live. Loeb's compatriot Sebastien Ogier claimed victory on the stage, which concluded the competitive action. It earned him three bonus points in the standings as he finished fourth. The 30-year-old Hirvonen could afford to avoid mistakes in the final showdown as he took his 13th world rally championship victory after finishing runner-up to Loeb in the 2008 and 2009 title races. "I was really nervous before the last stage but what a fantastic start from the team with the new car," Hirvonen told the official world rally website. "The car has been quick straight away and after a tough season last year I am really pleased with this," he added. Hirvonen had led going into the final day of the Karlstad-based race with just over 15 seconds dividing the first five drivers. He was pushed all the way by 23-year-old Ostberg, who took the lead on Friday's opening stage and drove without error for his best career result alongside Swedish co-driver Jonas Andersson. The championship now heads to Mexico for round two of the series from March 3-6.

chatgpt: Mikko Hirvonen has won the Rally of Sweden for the second year running after leading his Ford Fiesta team to a clean sweep of the podium. The victory is Hirvonen's first in the World Rally Championship (WRC) this season and will give the Finn a much-needed confidence boost. Hirvonen won Sunday's final stage to finish more than 20 seconds ahead of teammate Jari-Matti Latvala, who took second place. Petter Solberg finished third, completing the sweep for Ford Fiesta. Reigning world champion Sebastien Loeb was unable to keep up with the pace of the Ford Fiestas and finished in sixth spot. Loeb struggled with the lack of snowfall during the event and could only manage three stage wins over the four-day event. The conditions were challenging for all of the drivers as the lack of snow meant that there was very little grip on the icy roads. However, Hirvonen managed to adapt well to the conditions and was able to maintain a consistent pace throughout the event. Hirvonen's win is a good sign for the Ford team, who have been struggling to match the pace of Citroen in recent years. The Finn will now be looking to build on his success and challenge for the WRC title this season. Speaking after the event, Hirvonen said: "It's an amazing feeling to win this rally again. The conditions were really tricky but we managed to stay in control and take the victory. It's a great start to the season for the team and I'm looking forward to the next event." The next event in the WRC calendar is the Rally Mexico, which takes place on March 12-15. Hirvonen will be hoping to carry his momentum into the event and secure another strong result for his Ford Fiesta team.
