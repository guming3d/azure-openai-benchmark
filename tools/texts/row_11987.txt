article: (CNN) -- Police and health officials have raided a slaughterhouse and meat company in the United Kingdom as part of an ongoing investigation into horse meat that was labeled as beef, authorities said Tuesday. The West Yorkshire slaughterhouse is believed to have supplied horse carcasses to a firm called Farmbox Meats Ltd., which then sold the meat as beef for kebabs and burgers. Authorities have suspended operations at both facilities and seized all remaining meat and company files, which include a client list. Neither company was immediately available for comment. "I ordered an audit of all horse-producing abattoirs in the UK after this issue first arose last month and I was shocked to uncover what appears to be a blatant misleading of consumers," said Andrew Rhodes, Food Standards Agency director of operations. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson called the revelations "absolutely shocking." "It's totally unacceptable if any business in the UK is defrauding the public by passing off horse meat as beef," he said. "I expect the full force of the law to be brought down on anyone involved in this kind of activity." Horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100% beef sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. While authorities said there is no immediate cause for health concerns, the discovery was a new shock to an industry already reeling from a bombshell last month, when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in numerous hamburger products. Investigations are under way in France, Sweden and Britain. The supply chain being studied includes more countries. Earlier this month, Britain's National Beef Association called for more specific labeling of meat products and asked that the words "United Kingdom origin" be printed on packaging.

chatgpt: The National Beef Association has called for more specific labeling of meat products, as a firm called Farmbox Meats Ltd. has been raided amid scandal. The raid has led to the suspension of operations at both facilities, with all remaining meat and the firms' files seized. The National Beef Association has emphasized the need for more specific labeling of meat products amid the Farmbox Meats scandal. The association believes that more transparency is needed in the meat industry to ensure that consumers are not misled or misinformed about the source and quality of their meat. In response to the scandal, Farmbox Meats Ltd. has been raided by authorities, leading to the suspension of operations at both the company and the National Beef Association. The raid resulted in the seizure of all remaining meat and the firms' files. The investigation is ongoing, but it is believed that the scandal involves the mislabelling of beef products. The mislabelling of beef products is a serious concern, as it can potentially lead to health risks for consumers. For example, if meat that was labeled as being from a specific source was actually from a different source, it could contain harmful bacteria that could cause illness. The National Beef Association is urging consumers to be vigilant about the source and labeling of their meat products. They recommend that consumers should always look for specific labeling that clearly identifies the source and quality of the meat that they are purchasing. The Farmbox Meats scandal has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the meat industry. The National Beef Association is calling for stricter regulation and more frequent inspections to ensure that consumers are protected and that the highest standards of quality and safety are maintained. In conclusion, the National Beef Association's call for more specific labeling of meat products is an important step toward ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the meat industry. The scandal at Farmbox Meats Ltd. is a stark reminder that consumers need to be vigilant about the source and quality of their meat products, and that stricter regulation and inspections are necessary to protect their health and safety.
