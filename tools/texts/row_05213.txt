I was walking through the beach hoping to see a bull shark, which is something common in this area. 'They usually feed close to the river mouth, local people told me they had seen some the day before. 'From nowhere I heard a loud sound coming from the sea, at the moment I did not know what was happening, but after a few minutes I saw a huge crocodile emerging from the sea.

'I quickly hid myself in the jungle - around 15 metres from the scene - hoping not to interfere and watch them fight for a few minutes. 'Luckily I managed a few photos before the crocodile went back to the ocean with the turtle inside its mouth.' After half-an-hour, the crocodile swam along the surface where he was joined by a bull shark - thought to be attracted by the scent of the turtle's blood.

He was there hoping to capture photos of bull sharks, but instead, he found himself face to face with a huge crocodile. Prieto was stunned as the massive crocodile burst from the sea, its jaws open wide. He quickly retreated to the protection of the jungle and set up his camera, determined to capture whatever came his way. As he watched and waited, Prieto noticed a motionless object floating by the crocodile. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was a turtle. The beautiful creature appeared to be dead, and Prieto knew that he had to capture the turtle's final moments on camera. The photographer spent hours in the hot, humid jungle, waiting for the crocodile to make its move. As he watched, the turtle's limp body floated closer and closer to the predator. Finally, with a sudden lunge, the crocodile seized the turtle in its jaws and dragged it below the surface. Prieto captured the dramatic moment on camera, freezing the turtle's final moments for all time. The scene is at once beautiful and sad, as the turtle's life ends in a flash of hungry teeth. Prieto's work is a reminder of the beauty and the harsh realities of nature. Though we may not always like what we see, we cannot turn a blind eye to the truth of the natural world.
