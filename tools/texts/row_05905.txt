A friendly deer that become an internet hit after being filmed nuzzling up to a boy in Canada has been shot dead for being too friendly. A video of the amorous animal - filmed on a camera phone by the boy's mother in Kalamalka Lake, Vernon - went viral this summer. As the teenager, Miles Higgins laughed and tried to push away the deer's antlers, the animal continued to rub its head over his neck and back. The young man on the video wasn't the only one to receive attention from the animal, which was affectionate with lots of Vernon residents. However, the creature has been put down as wildlife officials claimed that because it was tame, it posed a danger to humans.

It would have been nice if they’d explored some other options.’ Ms Higgins told Global News the deer was so enamored with her son that it even followed them when they left the lake. On the video she posted on YouTube, Ms Higgins can be heard saying: 'Careful, it's not hurting is it?' as the deer's antlers catch her son's shoulder.

chatgpt: A video that went viral this summer is sparking a debate among wildlife experts in Canada. The video shows a deer brushing up against a young boy, in what appears to be a moment of tenderness between the two. However, some experts argue that the deer's familiarity with humans could pose a danger. The video, which was originally uploaded to social media, has since garnered millions of views. The footage shows a young boy standing in a field as a deer approaches him from behind. The deer sniffs and nuzzles the boy before brushing up against him affectionately. The boy remains calm and composed throughout the interaction, and the deer eventually wanders off. While the video has been praised by many viewers for its heartwarming nature, it has also raised concerns among wildlife experts. Some argue that the deer's behavior is indicative of a larger issue of wild animals becoming too accustomed to human presence. This, in turn, can lead to dangerous situations for both humans and animals. According to wildlife biologist Jennifer Dubois, there is a "fine line" between admiration and endangerment when it comes to wild animals. When they become too familiar with humans, they can lose their natural fear and become more aggressive. This can be particularly dangerous for children, who may not understand the potential risks. Indeed, this is not the first time that a seemingly innocent interaction between a wild animal and a human has ended in tragedy. In 2016, a young boy was dragged into a lake by an alligator at Disney World in Florida. In 2018, a man was killed by an infected rabid beaver in Belarus. These incidents serve as a reminder that even the most docile-seeming animals can be a potential threat. Despite the risks, some experts argue that there is nothing inherently wrong with the deer's behavior in the viral video. They point out that deer are naturally curious animals and often approach humans in search of food or other resources. In this case, the deer may have simply been interested in the young boy's scent or the texture of his clothing. It is also worth noting that the deer in the video appears to be a young buck, which may explain its playful and curious behavior. Older deer may be more cautious and reserved around humans. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to exercise caution and use common sense when interacting with wild animals. Experts advise keeping a safe distance and avoiding feeding or touching animals, as this can encourage them to become too familiar with humans. By respecting wildlife and their natural habitat, we can help to ensure the safety of both animals and humans.
