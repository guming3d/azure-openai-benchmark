article: The mystery over which congressman called New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand 'chubby' was seemingly solved this morning. The New York Times outed late Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye, a Democrat, as the man who made the offensive comment in the inaugural edition of it's political newsletter. A spokesman for Gillibrand, who is also a Democrat, didn't confirm that Inouye was the unnamed colleague who the 47-year-old female Senator referred to in her recently released memoir but he didn't deny it was Inouye, either. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat, asks questions at a Senate Armed Services hearing last week in Washington, D.C. Gillibrand has attracted attention over her claim that a male colleague called her 'chubby' after the birth of her second son . Today the New York Times announced that late Hawaii Sen. Daniel Inouye, also a Democrat, was the culprit . Inouye, a World War II veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, died in 2012. At the time of his death, President Barack Obama called him a 'true American hero' and said he was 'revered by all of us lucky enough to know him.' But as the Times points out, Inouye may not have been Boy Scout. In 1992 Inouye's former hairdresser claimed the senator made her have sex with him. The same year a Hawaii state senator accused Inouye of sexually harassing nine other women who wished to remain anonymous. The Times said today that sources familiar with the Gillibrand incident claim Inouye was the cheeky male colleague who told the female Senator after she had her second son, 'Don’t lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby!' Gillibrand served with Inouye in the Senate from 2009 until his death two years ago. Gillibrand is pictured here with her husband Jonathan and their two sons Henry, left, and Theordore . Gillibrand first made the claim that a male colleague called her 'chubby' in her memoir, released last month . While Gillibrand's office wouldn't tell the Times if Inouye was indeed the culprit, Gillibrand described the man who made the remark  as 'one of my favorite older members of the Senate' in her recently released memoir, Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World. Conservative pundits inferred from the statement that Gillibrand was likely referring to a fellow a Democrat, which is why she didn't want to name names. The Times' reporting suggests they may have been right. It still remains a secret which congressman called Gillibrand 'porky' and which lawmaker told her 'you're even pretty when you're fat.' The only clues Gillibrand has offered to their perpetrators' identities is that they were older men. 'It was all statements that were being made by men who were well into their 60s, 70s or 80s,' she told People magazine last month. 'They had no clue that those are inappropriate things to say to a pregnant woman or a woman who just had a baby or to women in general.'

chatgpt: The New York Times has published an article claiming that late Hawaii Senator and World War II veteran, Daniel Inouye, made an offensive comment regarding Kirsten Gillibrand. The comment allegedly happened before Inouye's passing in 2012. The article has caused quite a stir, as Inouye was known to be a highly respected politician with a decorated military career. Inouye passed away due to respiratory complications in 2012 at the age of 88. Gillibrand's office has not confirmed or denied the claim made by the New York Times. A spokesperson for Gillibrand's office stated that the senator will not be commenting on this matter. This allegation has put a spotlight on the issue of sexism and harassment in politics. Many have questioned why such behaviors are tolerated and important figures are allowed to get away with it. Senator Gillibrand is known for her work on women's rights and fighting against harassment in the workplace. Her stance on these issues has been praised by many but has also faced criticism from some of her colleagues. The claim against Inouye has brought to light the uncomfortable reality that even highly respected politicians can engage in inappropriate behavior. It is unfortunate that it has taken this long for such allegations to come out against a highly respected man like Inouye. The fact that both Inouye and Gillibrand are members of the same party has caused some division within the party. Some Democrats have defended Inouye and claim that the allegations are baseless, while others have criticized him and called for an investigation. It is important for such allegations to be taken seriously, and for politicians to understand that inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated, regardless of their status in the political sphere. It is also important to recognize that this issue goes beyond politics. It is a societal problem that affects millions of people. Harassment and sexism in the workplace should never be tolerated, and individuals must be held accountable for their actions. The allegations against Inouye serve as a reminder that victims of harassment and sexism should be heard and believed. No one is immune to the consequences of their actions, regardless of their status in society. As for Senator Gillibrand, it is important that she continues to fight against harassment and sexism in politics, and that her colleagues support her in this effort. It is crucial that politicians set an example and work towards creating a safe and respectful workplace culture for all individuals. The claim made against Inouye is shocking and disappointing, but it serves as a wake-up call for politicians and society as a whole. Harassment and sexism should never be tolerated, and it is up to us to create a better future for all.
