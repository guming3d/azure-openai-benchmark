article: New York (CNN) -- Police are investigating the death of a New York City college student after he was injured during a fraternity ritual on a trip to the Poconos, authorities said Wednesday. Chun "Michael" Deng, 19, a freshman at Baruch College, was brought to a Pennsylvania hospital by his friends early Sunday morning, authorities said. Deng was unresponsive and in critical condition upon arrival at the hospital. Physicians determined Deng had suffered major brain trauma and was placed on life support, according to a news release from the Monroe County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney's Office. The prosecutor's office identified the victim as Chen; the college gave his first name as Chun. Authorities learned that more than 30 members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psi had traveled to the Pocono Mountains, roughly 90 miles away from New York City, for the weekend. In the early morning hours, Deng, one of four pledges to the fraternity, was injured "while partaking in a ritual" in the yard of the residence where they were staying, according to the release. Authorities did not say what the fraternity ritual entailed. In a statement Wednesday, Baruch College said preliminary reports indicate Deng died while participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event that the college had no knowledge of. Baruch College has a "zero tolerance policy regarding hazing," according to the statement. Deng's death is a "deeply painful reminder that no individual should ever be put into a position where his or her personal safety is in jeopardy," the statement said. Along with its own internal review, Baruch is cooperating with law enforcement, the statement said. After Deng suffered the traumatic head injury, he was brought inside the residence and was unresponsive. Members of the fraternity later drove him to the emergency room, according to the district attorney's office. Deng died of his injuries Monday morning. An investigation is continuing, according to authorities. CNN's calls to Pi Delta Psi Fraternity, Inc., for comment were not immediately returned.

chatgpt: A Baruch College freshman has been hospitalized after sustaining major brain trauma during a fraternity ritual over the weekend. The victim was among a group of fraternity members who traveled to the Poconos from New York City for a weekend retreat. The incident occurred during a fraternity hazing ritual, according to authorities. The injured student was taken to a nearby hospital, where he remains in critical condition. The identity of the victim has not been released. The fraternity involved in the incident has not been named, but Baruch College officials have issued a statement condemning hazing of any kind. "We are deeply saddened by this incident and our thoughts are with the student and his family," the statement reads. "We do not condone hazing, and any students found to have engaged in this behavior will face disciplinary action." Hazing has been a persistent problem on college campuses, despite efforts to combat it. In recent years, several high-profile cases of hazing-related deaths have made headlines, prompting colleges and universities to take a tougher stance on the issue. Fraternities and sororities, in particular, have faced increased scrutiny over their hazing rituals. Many of these organizations have been accused of promoting a toxic culture that values conformity over individuality, and that puts students at risk. Baruch College officials have urged students who witness hazing or other dangerous behaviors to come forward and report them. "We take these matters very seriously and will not tolerate any behavior that endangers the health and wellbeing of our students," the statement reads. The incident at the Poconos highlights the ongoing problem of hazing on college campuses. As students return to school for the fall semester, it is important that they remember the dangers of hazing and take steps to prevent it. By speaking out against hazing and supporting their peers who may be suffering from its effects, students can help create a safer, more inclusive campus community.
