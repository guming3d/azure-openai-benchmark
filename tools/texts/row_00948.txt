Ms Riley’s son was subjected to a particularly vicious attack where two women verbally abused and attacked him for not taking a pizza to them outside. One woman got him down on the ground then kicked him in the groin more than once and also stomped on him, according to his mother. ‘We have to stand our ground,’ Ms Riley said. ‘We only ask for people to be polite but there are many loyal customers who are terrific, who make it worthwhile.’ She said business had dropped off at the shop because customers were intimidated by the anti -social behaviour of youths wandering around at night.
