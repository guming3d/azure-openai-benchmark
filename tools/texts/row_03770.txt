article: (CNN) -- France is facing fines and penalties after Europe's highest court found the government has failed to do enough to protect its hamsters. In a case that stretches back three years, the European Court of Justice said Thursday that the French government hasn't adequately conserved the remaining few hundred Great Hamsters of Alsace still living in a small enclave in eastern France. "The court finds that the measures implemented by France in 2008 were not adequate to enable effective avoidance of deterioration or destruction of the breeding sites and resting places of the European Hamster," the ECJ said in a statement. The little 10-inch rodents are considered pests by farmers there, and were trapped, poisoned almost out of existence by the early 1990s when they got official protection. But as the last surviving example of hamster left in western Europe, the court says they deserve better protection in line with the suit by European Commission regulators. "The commission complains that in 2008, France failed to take adequate measures to ensure strict protection of the European Hamster in Alsace (France), the only region where it is present," the court said. The hamster is at risk of extinction as a result of harmful agricultural practices and urbanization, which disturb its breeding and resting places, according to the court. Changing farming practices combined with encroaching building and urbanization in recent decades have led to the destruction of nearly all their burrows along the rivers there, leading to a population collapse. The commission said the switch to summer-ripening maize in many farms had further harmed the population because when the white-pawed, black-bellied hamsters wake up from hibernation in the spring, there's no seed to eat. And while the court praised a move to grow winter crops and alfalfa that the hamsters like to munch on, it found that the government-backed moves were too little and too late. There are only about 800 of the animals still alive, but that's several times more than were alive just a few years ago. Still, the court determined that there had to be nearly twice the current number of the little creatures to sustain their population. The French Ministry of Agriculture was not immediately available for comment.

chatgpt: France has been ordered by a court to improve the protection of its 10-inch hamster population after years of neglect. The hamster, the last surviving example of its kind in western Europe, has been struggling to survive in the face of habitat loss due to industrialization and urbanization. The ruling came after a lawsuit was brought against the French government by environmental groups, who accused it of not doing enough to protect the hamster, which is threatened by extinction. The groups argued that France had not taken adequate measures to preserve the species, as required by EU law. In its ruling, the court found that France had failed to take adequate measures to ensure the protection of the hamster. The court noted that, in 2008, France had not established a national action plan to protect the species, which had been designated as endangered since 2007. The court also cited a lack of habitat protection measures and inadequate research into the hamster's ecology and population dynamics. The hamster's natural habitat, which includes a mix of grasslands and crops, has been significantly reduced in recent years due to the intensification of agriculture and the expansion of urban areas. France has been given six months to improve its protection measures for the hamster. The government must now develop a national action plan for the species, which will include measures to protect its habitats, ensure its population is stable and increase research into its ecology and population dynamics. Environmental groups praised the court's ruling, saying it sends a clear message to governments that they must do more to protect endangered species. "The court's decision is a major victory for the hamster and for all those who care about protecting endangered species," said Yannick Jadot, a Green MEP. "It shows that governments can be held accountable for their failures to protect wildlife and sends a clear message that they need to do more to preserve our natural heritage." France is home to approximately 800,000 hamsters, most of which are kept as pets. The hamster population in the country has been declining rapidly in recent years, with some estimates suggesting that it has decreased by up to 75% since the 1990s. It remains to be seen whether France will comply with the court's ruling and take the necessary measures to protect the hamster. For now, the future of the species remains uncertain, and efforts to protect it will be closely watched by environmental groups and concerned citizens alike.
