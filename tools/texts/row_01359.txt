chatgpt: In a devastating accident on a California highway early Sunday morning, a suspected drunk driver collided with a Ford Explorer traveling in the opposite direction, killing all four members of the family inside. The driver, 21-year-old Olivia Culbreath, also lost the two passengers in her own car. Culbreath has now been charged with six counts of vehicular manslaughter and felony driving under the influence. The accident occurred on the 60 Freeway in Diamond Bar, California, around 4:40 a.m. Witnesses reported seeing Culbreath driving at a high speed in the wrong direction before colliding with the family's Ford Explorer. The force of the impact was so great that both vehicles were mangled and strewn across the highway. The family in the Ford Explorer has been identified as Gregorio Mejia-Martinez, his wife Leticia Ibarra, and their children Jessica, 9, and Ester, 13. All four members were pronounced dead at the scene. Culbreath survived the crash, but was critically injured. She has been recovering from a broken femur and ruptured bladder at a local hospital. Culbreath's baby, born last June, is reportedly being cared for by family members. Authorities say that Culbreath was driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. While the investigation is ongoing, initial reports suggest that her blood alcohol level may have been twice the legal limit. The tragic accident has left the community reeling. The victims were described as a loving family who were active in their local church and community. The family's relatives and friends have expressed their shock and sadness at the loss, and have called for justice for the victims. Meanwhile, Culbreath's family has issued a statement expressing their condolences to the victims' families, and acknowledging the severity of the charges against their daughter. They have also expressed hope that the incident will serve as a reminder of the dangers of drunk driving. The case against Culbreath is expected to be a difficult one. If convicted of all six counts of vehicular manslaughter, she could face up to 30 years in prison. The felony driving under the influence charge carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison. As the investigation continues and the legal process unfolds, the families of all those involved in this tragedy are left to grieve and try to make sense of what happened. The loss of six lives in a single accident is a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of driving under the influence.
