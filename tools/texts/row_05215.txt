'He is somewhat of a superstar in his own little world,' Fayette County Detention Center Officer John Casey told ABCNews.com. Earl's arrest history goes as far back as July 1970 when he was in his twenties for carrying a concealed weapon.He would go on to be arrested 33 more times that decade. Since then, Earl has been gradually increasing his frequency of arrests. In the 1980s, Earl picked up the pace with 230 arrests, most due to public drunkenness or disorderly conduct. But it wasn't until 2008, that Earl gained national attention when he found himself in court for his 1000th arrest for public intoxication. Judge Gary Payne made it an occasion by sentencing Earl to 1000 days in jail 'for your anniversary'. While Judge Payne was under the impression that it was Earl's 1,000th arrest, The Smoking Gun later discovered that it was actually number 1,333. The man with many mugshots: Earl never takes the same mugshot twice, as evidenced in the above collage from just a few of his arrests in Kentucky .
