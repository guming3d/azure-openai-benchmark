The Duchess of Cambridge switched university and took a gap year to ensure she attended at the same time as Prince William, a new book claims. It had previously been thought a coincidence that the pair met at St Andrews. Kate had a place at Edinburgh University in 2000 but gave it up and took a gap year in Italy, reapplying to St Andrews for 2001 after William’s place became public. Kate: The Future Queen, by Mail on Sunday Royal Editor Katie Nicholl, also claims Carole Middleton held a secret summit with William to ask whether he planned to propose to her daughter.

The book also tells how William and Kate took a make-or-break holiday to the Seychelles following their split in 2007 and made a pact to marry and have children. Kate achieved two As and a B in her A Levels – the grades she needed for Edinburgh – and the university was her first choice. William achieved an A in geography, a B in history of art and a C in biology and won a place to study history of art after a year out.

Applications to St Andrews rose by 44 per cent after the news emerged, meaning Kate’s decision was risky as there was no guarantee she would get a place. Jasper Selwyn, a careers adviser at Kate’s former school, Marlborough College, and house tutor Joan Gall both confirmed her first choice was Edinburgh. Mr Selwyn said: ‘Kate’s firm choice was Edinburgh and that was confirmed.’ According to her house mistress, Ann Patching, the change of heart came as a surprise. She said: . ‘After she left school, Catherine made some different decisions, but why she made those decisions I don’t know.’ In 2007 William and Kate split amid rumours she disapproved of his party lifestyle and his reluctance to propose. A make-or-break holiday followed and Kate reportedly gave William an ultimatum. According to the book, the pair then made a pact to marry and have children. However at Christmas 2009 Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, reportedly took William aside to discuss a possible engagement. A friend said: ‘She put some pressure on William to let the family know where it was all leading. William reassured her the relationship was very much on track and that there would be an engagement soon. Carole trusted William and put her faith in him.’ The book also claims that Kate and William met for the first time through mutual friends from Marlborough in the summer of 1999 at Highgrove.

chatgpt: A new book is making waves with explosive claims about the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's early relationship. According to author Robert Lacey, Kate Middleton secretly altered her higher education plans to match Prince William's, indicating her commitment to their relationship.  The book also alleges that Kate's mother, Carole Middleton, met with William on the sly to discuss the couple's future. The meeting is said to have taken place around the time of William's 21st birthday, when he was under intense scrutiny from the media and royal-watchers alike.  The Duke and Duchess have never been shy about the ups and downs of their early years together, but Lacey's book offers new insights into the couple's dynamic. In particular, he claims that Kate gave William an ultimatum during a trip to the Seychelles, where the couple spent time alone in a secluded villa.  "Either we get engaged or we break up," Lacey quotes Kate as saying to William at the time. The Duke reportedly proposed to his girlfriend shortly thereafter, and the couple announced their engagement in November 2010.  The book, titled "Battle of Brothers: William, Harry and the Inside Story of a Family in Tumult," tackles the royal rift between Prince William and Prince Harry, but includes plenty of new information about Kate and William as well.  Lacey, a noted royal biographer, claims that Kate's decision to switch her degree from art history to geography at St. Andrews University was a turning point in their relationship. William was studying geography at the time, and the two were in several classes together.  "Kate and William had an attraction from the beginning," Lacey writes, "but it was Kate's decision to switch her degree that really solidified the relationship. She was showing William that she was committed to him, and that she was willing to adapt her plans to fit with his."  Carole Middleton's alleged meeting with Prince William is also a key moment in the book. Lacey writes that the meeting was a sign of how much the Middletons were willing to do to ensure their daughter's happiness.  "Carole knew that Kate loved William and that William loved Kate," Lacey writes. "She wanted to make sure that their future was secure, and that her daughter would have the support she needed to be part of the royal family."  The book has already caused a stir among royal watchers, with some arguing that it crosses a line by revealing private conversations and details. But Lacey defends his work, saying that he was careful to corroborate his sources and to present a balanced view of the situation.  "I think the book offers a new perspective on the Cambridges' relationship and how it grew and developed over the years," he says. "It's not just about scandalous revelations; it's also about the challenges that they faced and how they overcame them."  Whether or not readers agree with Lacey's interpretation of events, it's clear that the book will be talked about for some time to come. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have not yet commented on its contents.
