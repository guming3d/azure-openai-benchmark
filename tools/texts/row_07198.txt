article: EasyJet passengers in France are facing disruption as flight attendants from the budget airline’s French branch plan to walk off the job over the Christmas holiday. The workers are planning to strike from 12:01am on Christmas Day to 11:59pm on Boxing Day in a dispute over pay and work schedules. Francois Bacchetta, general director of easyJet’s operations in France, said the Luton-based airline expects to cancel less than half of its flights from French airports.

Aviation workers are required to announce strikes 48 hours in advance, meaning EasyJet will know the extent of the cancellations on Tuesday. EasyJet expects to cancel less than half of its flights in France during the two-day walkout . In a statement, easyJet told MailOnline Travel that it ‘will do everything possible’ to minimise the disruption for travellers, although some flights will be cancelled. Passengers on the affected flights will be contacted and offered a full refund or the opportunity to rebook at no cost. EasyJet apologised to passengers and said it will issue a final cancellation list on Christmas Eve once it has final details from the SNPNC and UNAC cabin crew unions. The airline said: ‘On 26 December easyJet had more than 1,200 flights scheduled to operate. ‘The strike action will affect French domestic flights and currently no UK touching flights are cancelled. EasyJet will assure a minimum service on every route affected by cancellation.’ The carrier added: ‘EasyJet crews are in the vast majority employed under permanent contract and among the best remunerated crew in France. ‘Every year easyJet conducts negotiations with its employees and their representatives and this strike has been called while the negotiations have just begun. EasyJet remains open and committed to find a suitable resolution with the unions.’ The walkout will affect travellers on Boxing Day as there are no flights scheduled on Christmas Day . Laurent Nicolas, a representative of the SNPNC-FO union that represents 600 easyJet flight attendants, said workers are upset over schedules that ‘can change 20 times per month’. He said the scheduling makes it impossible for employees to spend quality time with their families. The union argues that the airline can afford a pay increase for flight attendants as its operating profits were up 21 per cent this year, reaching €728m (approximately £571m). That has translated into huge bonuses for management and income that is up to 300 times the average salary of an easyJet flight attendant, the union claims. Mr Bacchetta acknowledged the demands of the industry are ‘complicated’ and that he understood the ‘frustration’ of workers. But he was less understanding with complaints over salaries, and he said annual negotiations are underway.

chatgpt: Passengers traveling through French airports on Christmas Day and Boxing Day could face delays and disruptions as cabin crew from the airline's French branch are set to go on strike. According to reports, the strike will result in flight cancellations and delays affecting the airline's operations in French airports. The strike has been called by the union, which represents cabin crews based in France, in response to a dispute over working conditions and pay. The union has accused the airline of failing to adequately compensate cabin crew for their work and provide them with a safe and secure working environment. As a result of the strike, the airline has announced that it expects to cancel less than half of its flights from French airports. It has also advised passengers to check the status of their flights before traveling to the airport and has said that it will provide affected passengers with alternative travel options or refunds. The airline has expressed its disappointment at the proposed strike and has said that it is committed to working with its staff to resolve the dispute. In a statement issued to the press, a spokesperson for the airline said: “We are disappointed that the union has chosen to take this course of action, particularly at this time of the year when many of our customers are looking forward to spending time with their loved ones. We are committed to working with our staff to resolve this dispute in a timely and satisfactory manner.” The strike is expected to have a significant impact on the airline's operations in French airports, with flight cancellations and delays expected to cause disruption for passengers traveling through French airports during the busy holiday season. The airline has urged passengers to check the status of their flights before traveling to the airport, and has advised them to allow extra time for check-in and security procedures. Despite the potential for disruption, the airline has pledged to do everything in its power to minimize the impact of the strike on its customers. It has said that it will provide affected passengers with alternative travel options or refunds, and that it will work with other airlines to help affected passengers find alternative transportation. The proposed strike comes at a time when many airlines are already struggling to cope with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many airlines have been forced to cancel flights and reduce their operations in response to a sharp drop in demand for air travel, and the proposed strike is likely to add to the challenges facing the airline industry. For passengers who are affected by the strike, the airline has advised them to check the status of their flights before traveling to the airport and has said that it will provide them with alternative travel options or refunds. The airline has also urged passengers to allow extra time for check-in and security procedures, as longer waiting times are expected due to the disruptions caused by the strike. Overall, the proposed cabin crew strike is likely to cause disruption and delays for passengers traveling through French airports during the busy holiday season. While the airline has pledged to do everything in its power to minimize the impact of the strike on its customers, passengers are advised to check the status of their flights before traveling and to allow extra time for check-in and security procedures.
