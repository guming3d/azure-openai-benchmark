They say Manchester United’s defeat by Swansea was the best thing that could have happened, exposing their shortcomings before it is too late to act. Perhaps the same theory can be applied to Newcastle United. For while their 2-0 loss to champions Manchester City was rich in spirit, skill, endeavour and enthusiasm, it was nonetheless lacking one key ingredient — a shot on target. Indeed, they were the only top-flight team not to trouble an opposition goalkeeper during the opening weekend. Blunt: £6million signing Emmanuel Riviere failed to get his name on the scoresheet at St James' Park . Under pressure: Ayoze Perez, left, found his way blocked by the formidable figure of Vincent Kompany . The Magpies failed to score in 13 of their final 21 matches last season and the suspicion is that an impotent offence could undermine their progress this time around. Final balls were wayward — shooting likewise — and, for all their attacking intent, they lacked the penalty-box instinct of a David Silva or Sergio Aguero, the players who ultimately settled this affair. City boss Manuel Pellegrini agreed. ‘I didn’t feel Newcastle had clear chances to score except in the last two minutes of the game,’ said the Chilean, referencing Ayoze Perez’s goal-bound shot deflected wide by a sliding Fernando. Alan Pardew’s Tyneside tenure has been defined by goalscorers: Andy Carroll, Demba Ba, Papiss Cisse and, last season, Loic Remy. Emmanuel Riviere — a £6m signing from Monaco — is the man charged with filling his boots — and the net — this season. Comeback trail: Dutch playmaker Siem de Jong should help Newcastle get firing on all cylinders . But Pardew feels goals reside in other areas of the squad, even if some of those players remain in the treatment room. ‘We’re still missing Papiss (Cisse) and Siem de Jong, two massive players for us that we’ve paid a financial outlay on,’ he said, when asked if he would be re-entering the transfer market. ‘They’re big players. So no, I feel once they’re in and around the squad we’ll score goals. Impressive: Remy Cabella in possession during a promising display against the Premier League champions . ‘We were playing the champions today and sometimes you don’t get any shots against the champions. But I thought we had a really good go.’ Playmaker Remy Cabella was the pick of Pardew’s five debutants and the manager likened him to City’s Silva. But every Cabella needs a goalscorer to exploit his cunning. And to that end Newcastle remain short. Pardew has until September 1 to do something about it.

chatgpt: On Sunday, Manchester City started their Premier League title defence in style with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United at St James' Park. The Magpies put in a spirited performance, but ultimately lacked the firepower to trouble the reigning champions. Newcastle's striking duo of Emmanuel Riviere and Ayoze Perez failed to make an impact on the game, with both players struggling to create any clear-cut chances for their side. Siem de Jong and Papiss Cisse were also lacking in match fitness, and were forced to watch the action from the sidelines. Despite these setbacks, there was a glimmer of hope for Newcastle fans in the form of new signing Remy Cabella. The French midfielder performed well in his debut for the Magpies, showing glimpses of the skill and creativity that made him a star at Montpellier. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew was particularly impressed with Cabella, likening him to Manchester City goalscorer David Silva. City started the game with intent, and took the lead after just 38 seconds through David Silva. The Spanish playmaker pounced on a loose ball in the Newcastle box, calmly slotting it past Tim Krul in the home side's goal. Newcastle responded well to the early setback, and continued to press forward in search of an equalizer. Moussa Sissoko and Jack Colback were particularly impressive for the Magpies, with their energy and industry helping to disrupt the City midfield. However, City weathered the storm and doubled their lead on 90 minutes through Sergio Aguero. The Argentine striker latched onto a through ball from Edin Dzeko, and coolly finished past Krul to seal the victory for the visitors. Despite the defeat, there were positives for Newcastle to take from the game. Cabella's performance was encouraging, and the Magpies can also take heart from the battling displays of Sissoko and Colback. However, Pardew will be acutely aware of his side's lack of potency in attack, and will be hoping that de Jong and Cisse can regain their fitness quickly. For City, it was a pleasing start to the season. Silva and Aguero were both in fine form, and the midfield pairing of Yaya Toure and Fernandinho looked solid throughout. Manuel Pellegrini's side will be hoping to build on this victory, and cement their position at the top of the Premier League.
