He died in hospital at 4am this morning . The company said in a statement that Ferreira worked for a firm which had been contracted to build the arena's cover. They added that an internal investigation of the incident would be conducted. The Local Organizing Committee of the World Cup said work on the stadium was halted for a period of mourning, but will resume on Sunday. The construction of the stadium is behind schedule and work is under way 24 hours a day to complete it by Fifa's end of year deadline. The death is the latest tragedy linked to the construction of numerous Brazil World Cup stadiums. Linked: Several construction workers have died while working on stadiums for the Brazil 2014 World Cup - with one dying at the same stadium in May . It will no doubt add to safety concerns as the country races to finish many of the arenas by next year. Last month, two construction workers were killed when a crane collapsed as it was hoisting a 500-ton piece of roofing at the Sao Paulo stadium - where the opening match of the competition will be held. Several more workers were injured. The accident is thought to have put the stadium's completion date back by several months. Another worker fell to his death at the Amazon stadium in May and a worker died in 2012 after falling from a stadium in Brasilia. Preparations for Brazil 2014 have also been plagued by delays, accidents, cost overruns, and public anger over government waste that contributed to massive nationwide street protests in 2012.

chatgpt: Another tragedy has struck the construction of Brazil's 2014 World Cup stadiums. Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, a 22-year-old worker fell 35 meters from the roof of the Arena da Amazonia stadium in Manaus. The young man fell after a cable broke while he was working on the roof of the stadium. Reports say that he was rushed to the hospital, but he died at approximately 4 am this morning. The incident has sparked questions about the safety standards surrounding the construction and maintenance of Brazil's stadiums. It is not the first time that such incidents have occurred, as several other workers have lost their lives during the building of the various stadiums across the country. These tragedies raise serious concerns about whether the projects are being managed efficiently, and if enough is being done to ensure the safety of the construction workers. The World Cup has been a matter of great national pride for Brazil, and the construction of the stadiums has been a matter of priority to ensure the success of the event. However, the recent events have cast doubts on the country's ability to deliver safe and reliable structures for the event. The country must take more significant measures to ensure the safety of the workers. Despite the tragic circumstances, local authorities have expressed their condolences to the young man's family and have promised to open an investigation into the reasons for the accident. The investigation will be thorough and will include information on the company that employed Ferreira. The accidents have served to highlight how little the country has done to create safe working conditions for the construction workers. The workers do not have the benefit of regulatory protections such as insurance, and they have to work under difficult conditions with minimum wage concerns. It is hoped that the authorities will take this incident as a wake-up call and begin to implement measures to protect the lives of the workers who are risking their lives for the sake of the World Cup. An optimal situation needs to be implemented, which will ensure that such tragedies are put to an end immediately. Brazil will have to answer some tough questions about the standards of construction during the World Cup, and whether the event itself is worth the loss of life. It is important that such tragedies must not be overlooked by the public and the authorities who will have to account for its impact on the workers and their affected families.
