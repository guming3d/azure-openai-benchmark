article: Two elderly men escaped with minor injuries when their light aircraft crashed and ‘cartwheeled’ down a runway today, before splitting in two. The single-engine Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane landed upside down after plunging onto an airfield during high winds at about midday in Shotteswell, Warwickshire. On arrival paramedics found the pilot and his passenger had freed themselves from the aircraft - and they were not seriously hurt. Only one of the men, in his 70s, required hospital treatment. Crash: The single-engine Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane landed upside down  in Shotteswell, Warwickshire . Minor injuries: On arrival paramedics found the pilot and his passenger had freed themselves from the plane . The pilot told fire crews that he had been caught in a strong crosswind during a routine landing exercise, which made the wing hit the ground first and the aircraft cartwheel down the runway. Local resident Paul Fisher, 44, said: ‘I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the wreckage and they had survived. How they have walked away from that is beyond me.’ Another resident, who did not want to be named, added: ‘We got home after it happened and saw lots of blue flashing lights. I'm glad it sounds like the people involved are going to be okay.’ Warwickshire Police said the injured man was airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for treatment, and added that the B4100 road nearby had since reopened after a temporary closure. Upside down: The pilot said that he had been caught in a strong crosswind during a routine landing exercise . Probe: The Air Accident Investigation Branch is now investigating the incident, which happened at midday . And a Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ‘Although the pictures are very dramatic, one pilot has suffered a broken leg with the other walked away with only cuts and bruises. ‘On arrival the ambulance service had already been able to release the two casualties. Firefighters then had to make the aircraft safe as it was leaking fuel.’ The Air Accident Investigation Branch is now investigating. The other man is in his late 60s. Shotteswell, which has been in use since the Second World War, has a grass runway of just under half a mile. It is regularly used by private aircraft, helicopters, microlights and training flights. The Met Office has a severe yellow 'be aware' weather warning for wind in place today and tomorrow - although this only covers western Scotland and the north of Northern Ireland.

chatgpt: A single-engine Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane landed upside down today after crashing onto an airfield during high winds in Shotteswell, Warwickshire. Fortunately, both the passenger and pilot were able to free themselves and only received minor injuries. According to the pilot, they were caught in strong crosswinds during a routine landing, which caused the plane to lose control and flip over upon impact. Both the passenger and pilot are lucky to be alive, and they credited their safety to wearing their seatbelts and properly securing all loose items before takeoff. First responders arrived quickly on the scene and worked to extinguish a small fire that ignited upon impact. Despite the high winds and challenging conditions, emergency crews were able to quickly extricate both the passenger and pilot from the overturned aircraft and transport them to a nearby hospital for treatment. The Shotteswell airfield has since been closed temporarily while investigators work to determine the cause of the accident. While pilot error has not been ruled out, officials are also looking into the possibility that the strong gusts of wind played a significant role in the crash. In the aviation industry, crosswind landings are often considered to be one of the most challenging maneuvers a pilot can perform. Pilots are trained to take into account wind speed, direction, and other factors to ensure the safety of themselves and their passengers during all phases of flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommends that pilots receive training in crosswind landings and takeoffs before being certified to fly solo. Additionally, pilots are trained to use a technique called crabbing to help control the plane during crosswind landings, which involves pointing the nose of the aircraft slightly into the wind and using rudder control to maintain alignment with the runway. Despite the challenges inherent in crosswind landings, accidents such as these are relatively rare in the aviation industry. Pilots, air traffic controllers, and other members of the aviation community work tirelessly every day to ensure that air travel remains one of the safest forms of transportation. As the investigation into the Shotteswell plane crash continues, officials are urging all pilots to exercise caution and remain vigilant when operating in adverse weather conditions. With proper training, preparation, and the right mindset, accidents such as these can be avoided and everyone can arrive safely at their destination.
