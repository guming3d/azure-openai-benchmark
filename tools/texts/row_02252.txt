The king, like other Middle Eastern rulers, often pardons prisoners on special occasions, such as Throne Day on July 30, but the decision to release the Spaniards at the request of the monarch of a former colonial power has riled many in Morocco. 'Is this Morocco's way to reach the long-sought target of 10 million tourists a year?' asked blogger Nouhad Fathi in a sarcastic post on her Facebook wall.

chatgpt: Controversy has erupted in Morocco following the pardon of 48 Spanish prisoners, among them Daniel Fino Galvan, who raped and filmed 11 children in the city of Kenitra. King Mohamed VI granted the pardon at the request of Spain's King Juan Carlos, who visited the country last month. The decision has sparked outrage across social media platforms, with one user declaring that "the king's pardon is a second rape for the victims". Activists plan to march on Kenitra, near Rabat, to protest the move on Friday. Galvan, a former university professor, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in September 2011 for the rape and abuse of the 11 children, aged between four and 15. He was also found guilty of filming the acts and sharing them online. The pardon means that Galvan will now be freed from jail and allowed to return to Spain. The Spanish government has expressed its gratitude to the Moroccan monarch for the decision, but many have criticized the move, citing the severity of Galvan's crimes as well as the fact that the pardon was granted so soon after King Juan Carlos' visit. Human rights organizations have also spoken out against the move, with Amnesty International stating that "the pardon of a convicted child abuser sends a very poor message to the rest of the world". The organization has called on Morocco to review its approach to pardoning those convicted of such serious crimes. For the victims and their families, the pardon is a cruel blow after years of trauma and pain. Many had hoped that the perpetrator would serve out his full sentence and that justice would be done. Now, they are left to wonder if their suffering will ever truly be acknowledged or if they will ever receive the justice that they deserve. In the wake of the controversy, many are looking to the Moroccan government for answers. How could such a decision be made, and what message does it send to others who may have committed similar crimes? As activists prepare to take to the streets to demand accountability and justice, the world watches and waits to see what will happen next.
