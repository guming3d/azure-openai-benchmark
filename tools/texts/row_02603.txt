article: (CNN) -- Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei pledged to continue fighting injustice in his first interview since his release from detention. The outspoken critic of the nation's human rights record was arrested in April, detained for three months and charged with tax evasion. "Of course you might live an easier life if you abandon some rights. But there are so many injustices, and limited educational resources," Ai told the Chinese Communist party's Global Times newspaper. "They all diminish happiness. I will never stop fighting injustice." The paper describes Ai as "feisty" in his first interview since being released from prison in June after a three-month detention on tax evasion charges that some observers alleged were trumped up. A condition of his bail forbids him from using Twitter, the newspaper said, but the artist has been outspoken on the social media platform. On Sunday his tweets were innocuous: "Lunch 10 dumplings, regained 3 kilograms body weight." Another said, "Five cloves of garlic." The tweets linked to pictures, including one of feet on a scale reading 214 pounds, and another one of Ai and an unidentified male peering into the camera. The playful tweets ended Monday night when he wrote about business colleagues detained with him. "Today I met Liu Zhenggang. He talked about the detention for the first time. ... This steel-willed man had tears coming down. ... He had a sudden heart attack at the detention center and almost died." Later, he tweeted, "Because of the connection with me, they were illegally detained. Liu Zhenggang, Hu Mingfen, Wen Tao and Zhang Jinsong innocently suffered immense mental devastation and physical torment." On Tuesday afternoon, he issued a call to action: "If you don't speak out for Wang Lihong, and don't speak out for Ruan Yunfei, you are not only a person who doesn't stand up for justice and fairness, you don't have any self-respect." Ai confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that he wrote the tweets, saying "a bird needs to flutter its wings to see if it can fly." The activist was detained at the Beijing airport on April 3 while awaiting a flight to Hong Kong. Police cordoned off his Beijing studio, and an assistant told CNN that eight employees had been called in for questioning. Ai was released June 22, and Beijing police told the state-run Xinhua news agency that he had confessed to his crimes. "The decision (to release Ai) comes also in consideration of the fact that Ai has repeatedly said he is willing to pay the taxes he evaded," Xinhua reported. However, in July, a company that Chinese authorities say is controlled by dissident artist Ai Weiwei challenged tax evasion allegations. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report .

chatgpt: Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and activist who was detained for 81 days on charges of tax evasion, has given his first interview since his release. In the interview, Ai challenged the allegations against him and described his experience in detention. "I have faith in the law," Ai said. "If I did something wrong, I should be punished. But I didn't do anything wrong. I followed the law." Ai's release on bail came with a number of restrictions, including a ban on using Twitter, which he has repeatedly violated. Despite these restrictions, Ai has remained a vocal opponent of the Chinese government and its policies, particularly its human rights record and censorship practices. The Global Times, a newspaper controlled by China's Communist Party, has called Ai "feisty" for his continued activism. This characterization reflects a growing sense of unease among Chinese authorities, who have faced increasing criticism from domestic and international observers for their treatment of Ai and other dissidents. In the interview, Ai described his time in detention as "a kind of torture." He said that he was subjected to long periods of interrogation and denied access to a lawyer. He also said that he was not allowed to see his family or receive visitors. Despite these hardships, Ai said that he remained committed to his work and his activism. He said that he saw his detention as an opportunity to "reflect on the state of our society and the role of the individual in it." Ai's release on bail has been seen by many as a sign of growing pressure on the Chinese government to address its human rights record. In recent years, the government has faced mounting criticism from both domestic and international observers for its treatment of dissidents, journalists, and other individuals who challenge its authority. Ai's case has drawn particular attention because of his prominence as an artist and activist. He is known for his provocative installations and works that challenge notions of Chinese identity and culture. Despite the restrictions on his activity, Ai has continued to use social media to communicate with his followers and fellow activists. He has also been the subject of numerous international exhibitions and publications, which have helped to raise awareness of his case and of the broader issue of free speech and human rights in China. Many observers are hopeful that Ai's release will signal a new era of openness and accountability in China, and a shift away from the authoritarian policies that have defined the country for much of its history. Whether this optimism is justified remains to be seen, but Ai's continued activism and defiance suggest that the fight for human rights in China is far from over.
