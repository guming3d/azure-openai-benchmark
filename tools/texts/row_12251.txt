Samantha Cameron tried to gain access to Sarah Brown's records to copy how to be the perfect Prime Minister's wife, it has emerged. Former No.10 spin doctor Damian McBride said David Cameron's wife wanted to use Mrs Brown's emails, diary and contacts when setting up her private office. But the request was refused, and Gordon Brown's wife's strategy for handling her public profile remained secret. Samantha Cameron (left) has modeled herself on the deeply intelligent, private Sarah Brown (right) Mr McBride writes in his explosive memoir Power Trip about his admiration for Mrs Brown, and the way she stood by Gordon when the pressure of being Prime Minister mounted. 'Over the years, I came to realise that Sarah Brown was a deeply intelligent, private person with a ferocious passion for causes and people close to her heart,' he said. 'To her, Gordon was always the star and, whatever she did to support him, it was always to enhance the story of the day — not become the story herself.' Mr McBride went on: 'When she was . sworn at by the PR supremo Matthew Freud for failing to deliver Gordon . for a photo-stunt with Blair and Rupert Murdoch at Davos, she just . shrugged — because what really mattered to her was what was best for . Gordon and her boys. 'It was . little wonder that when the Tories came into No  10, they asked for . access to her emails, diary and contacts book to study ‘best practice’ for setting up  Samantha Cameron’s private office. 'They . were refused permission. Sarah, however, will always be a tough act to . follow, because — like Michelle Obama — with her, it was never an act.' Class act: Damian McBride paid tribute to Sarah Brown's quiet loyalty to husband Gordon . He has also contrasted Mrs Brown's private loyalty to her husband to Cheri Blair's love of the limelight during the long feud between Mr Brown and Tony Blair. Recalling an incident at a party conference when just as Mr Brown was saying in a speech how great Mr Blair was, Mrs Blair shouted back: ‘Well, that’s a bloody lie.’ Mr McBride added: 'You could argue, of course, that Cherie was only showing loyalty to her husband. 'But unlike Sarah Brown — who was no less fiercely loyal to Gordon — Cherie was never happy unless her loyalty was expressed publicly, with her face all over the papers.'

chatgpt: Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown's wife, Sarah, has reportedly refused a request from Samantha Cameron to access her emails and diary during her husband David Cameron's time in office. According to extracts from Damian McBride's memoirs, Sarah Brown, the then-Prime Minister's wife, did not want to set a precedent by providing such access. The book, titled 'Power Trip: A Decade of Policy, Plots and Spin', provides an insight into the workings of Downing Street under both the Labour and Conservative governments. Written by former Brown era Press Officer Damian McBride, some of the details in the book have been seen as controversial. One such revelation is that Samantha Cameron, the wife of former Prime Minister David Cameron, requested access to the diary and emails of Sarah Brown while she was in Downing Street. Cameron reportedly made the request in an attempt to oversee "best practice" for how to support a Prime Minister in office. However, the request was denied by Brown, who considered this to be an infringement on her privacy. She told Cameron that she did not want to set a precedent where the Prime Minister's spouse could access the personal communications of another Prime Minister's spouse. McBride's memoirs, which were published earlier this year, have brought to light several other details regarding the inner workings of the UK government. The book has been described as a "searingly honest" account of the years McBride spent working for Brown. McBride himself has been a controversial figure in UK politics, having been involved in a number of scandals during his time in government. Nevertheless, the book has generated significant media interest since its publication and has been cited in discussions about the role of spouses in government. The issue of privacy for Prime Minister's spouses has been a topic of discussion in recent years. In 2010, Sarah Brown was again at the centre of a controversy after her personal email account was hacked. At the time, the incident was seen as a significant breach of privacy, leading to renewed calls for greater security for private accounts used by UK politicians. While the details of Samantha Cameron's request for access to Brown's emails and diary have only recently come to light, the issue of the role of Prime Minister's spouses remains a subject of debate. McBride's memoir provides an insight into the inner workings of government and the challenges facing those who work there. Overall, the book is likely to be seen as a valuable resource for those interested in the recent history of UK politics. Its revelations regarding the role of Prime Minister's spouses provides an insight into a previously unexplored area of government, while the author's personal experiences offer a unique perspective on the challenges facing those working in government.
