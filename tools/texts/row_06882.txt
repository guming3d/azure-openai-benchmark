article: Tiberias, Israel (CNN) -- Two Americans reunited with their families Tuesday in northern Israel, a day after kidnappers freed them unharmed after three days of captivity in Egypt. "We put our faith on God, and he don't let us down," Michel Louis, one of the Americans, said from the city of Tiberias. Kidnappers in Egypt released Louis, Lisa Alphonse and their tour guide Monday after holding them hostage since Friday. Louis recalled the moment the kidnappers came aboard their tour bus. He offered himself as a hostage when gunmen took Alphonse, he said. Louis is the pastor of a Pentecostal church in Boston and Alphonse is a parishioner at another American church. "She's a member of my group. So I said I (can't) leave her to go alone, because I don't know what can happen to her, and I decide to go with her," he said. Louis, a diabetic, was given pita bread, eggs, tea and water by his kidnappers, he said, and was moved each night to sleep in a different location. Alphonse was the only female in the group. She said she feared for her life, but had faith that God would not let her die. "Where we were, we didn't know if we (were) coming back," she said. Kidnappers seized the three Friday in Egypt's Sinai region after gunmen boarded the bus, which was on its way to Israel, family members said. Michel Louis' wife was on the bus when the kidnapping occurred. The family was not aware of security concerns in the Sinai region, where Americans had been kidnapped and swiftly released in two incidents since February, said Louis' son, Jean Louis. "If we were aware, I would believe we would use correct judgment not to enter that area," he said. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, last year. In the latest incident, one of the alleged kidnappers, Germy Abu Masouh, is a member of a prominent Bedouin tribe in the Sinai. He had demanded Egyptian police free his uncle imprisoned in Alexandria on drug charges. Authorities did not give in to the kidnappers' demands, Egyptian officials said. CNN's Elise Labott, Kareem Khadder and Ed Payne contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Michel Louis, a member of a church group that was kidnapped in Egypt's Sinai region, reportedly offered himself as a hostage when the gunmen took one of his parishioners. The group, comprised of 13 Americans and four Egyptians, were on a tour of religious sites when they were taken captive on Friday. According to Louis, he told the kidnappers that if they were looking for someone to hold as a hostage, he was willing to take the place of the parishioner. "We put our faith on God and he don't let us down," he said. The kidnappers released the hostages three days later, unharmed. It is currently unclear what prompted the release, as no ransom was paid. The kidnapping highlights the ongoing security concerns in the Sinai region, which has been plagued by a wave of violence in recent years. The area is home to a number of extremist groups, including the local branch of ISIS. Egypt's security forces have been cracking down on these groups, but attacks have continued nonetheless. In February, three tourists were killed and four others injured when a roadside bomb exploded near a bus carrying them. The US State Department has issued a travel warning for the Sinai region, advising Americans to avoid non-essential travel there. The warning notes that "terrorist attacks can occur anywhere in the country, including Cairo and tourist locations." The church group's kidnapping serves as a reminder of the dangers that tourists and other visitors could face in Egypt. While the country remains a popular destination for its historic sites and other attractions, the security situation remains volatile. Louis and his fellow parishioners were fortunate to have been released unharmed, but not everyone is so lucky. As long as the threat of terrorism continues in Egypt, travelers are advised to exercise caution and stay vigilant at all times.
