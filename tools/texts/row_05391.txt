chatgpt: Former England defender and current commentator, Gary Neville, has revealed that he was enjoying social media until the last 24 hours, after he made a lighthearted comment during coverage of the USA vs Ghana match. Neville, who was working as a pundit for the BBC, received backlash from viewers after jokingly encouraging England fans to "start the car" after Ghana's goal during the match. The BBC received 445 complaints regarding Neville's commentary, and the former England defender was also subjected to abuse on Twitter. Neville, who has become a prominent figure in football punditry, took to Twitter to apologize for his comments and stressed that he did not mean to offend anyone. He said that his intention was to "lighten the mood" during a tense match. Despite the apology, Neville has faced criticism from some quarters. Social media has been rife with comments calling for him to resign from his position at the BBC or face disciplinary action. Fans called his comments "insensitive" and "inappropriate", given the ongoing sensitivity surrounding the Hillsborough disaster. In response to the controversy, the BBC defended Neville's comments, arguing that they were made in the context of a live broadcast, and were not intended to cause offence. The broadcaster released a statement, saying that they "regret any offence caused" by the comments, but added that they believed Neville's apology was sincere. Neville's comments have reignited the debate around the use of social media by celebrities and public figures. Critics argue that online comments are too often used to whip up controversy and attract attention, rather than contribute to meaningful debate. Others have pointed out that social media can be a double-edged sword, providing public figures with a powerful platform for their ideas, but also exposing them to abuse and criticism. Despite the controversy, Neville remains a popular figure among football fans, and many have come to his defence on social media. Supporters argue that the incident has been blown out of proportion, and that Neville's comments were harmless and meant in jest. The controversy comes at a time when the use of social media by public figures is under increased scrutiny. Many believe that celebrities and politicians should be held to higher standards of conduct than members of the general public, and that they should be more careful about what they say online. The debate is likely to continue as social media continues to play a more prominent role in public life.
