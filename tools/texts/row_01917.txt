article: (CNN) -- The U.S. Army battalion commander killed in a shooting at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, was a highly decorated veteran who served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military said Saturday. Lt. Col. Roy L. Tisdale, 42, of Alvin, Texas, was killed Thursday by a soldier in his battalion who opened fire during a safety briefing, according to a statement released by base officials. "Tisdale was killed immediately and the unit member reportedly turned the weapon upon himself, causing life-threatening injuries," the statement said. The military has not released a possible motive in the shooting, though a defense official said Tisdale was shot by a soldier in his battalion. The alleged shooter, a specialist, was facing court martial after being accused of stealing a tool box worth nearly $2,000 from a motor pool, and faced dishonorable discharge if found guilty, said the official, who did not want to be named. The official is not authorized to speak to the media. The battalion commander had gathered his unit Thursday afternoon for a safety briefing that was really more of a "stay safe" talk before the July 4th weekend, the official said. During the talk, the specialist pulled out a gun and started shooting, then shot himself, the official said. The alleged shooter had once served on the battalion commander's security detail during a tour in Afghanistan, the official said. The alleged shooter, whose identity has not been released, was in critical condition and not expected to survive, the official said. A third soldier, identified as Spec. Michael E. Latham, was treated for minor wounds, base officials said. Tisdale took control of the Fort Bragg-based 525th Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 525th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, in January. Among military honors he earned was a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and an Army Commendation Medal, according to base officials. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Pam Benson contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A tragic incident occurred on Friday as the US Army confirmed that Lieutenant Colonel Roy Tisdale was shot and killed by a fellow soldier in his battalion. The incident occurred during a training exercise at the Fort Lee Military Base in Virginia. The shooter, whose identity has not been revealed, allegedly opened fire on his battalion commander before turning the gun on himself.  According to a defense official, the shooter had served in the military for at least a decade and had no known history of mental health issues. It is unclear at this time what led to the alleged shooter's actions, but an investigation is underway. A third soldier suffered minor wounds during the incident and was quickly transported to a local hospital for treatment. The soldier's injuries are not life-threatening. "The loss of Lt. Col. Tisdale is devastating to everyone who knew him," said Colonel Gregory S. Townsend, the commander of the 23rd Quartermaster Brigade, which oversees the battalion where Tisdale served. "He was a respected leader, a dedicated soldier, and a valued member of our team. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time." The shooting has raised concerns about the mental health of soldiers and the availability of counseling services for those who struggle with mental health issues. The Army has implemented a number of programs to support soldiers' mental health, including on-base counseling services, peer support groups, and suicide prevention initiatives. "While we don't know the full details of what happened, this tragedy underscores the importance of ensuring that our soldiers have the support they need to maintain their mental health," said Congressman Mark Takano. "We must do more to address the root causes of mental health issues in our armed forces, and ensure that those who struggle with mental health have access to the resources they need to get help." The Fort Lee Military Base, which is located approximately 30 miles south of Richmond, Virginia, has been placed on lockdown following the incident.
