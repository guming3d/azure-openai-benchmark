article: President Barack Obama will today meet with military leaders from some 20 countries and form a plan to counter the Islamic State, amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more. Some three weeks before U.S. congressional elections, Obama will aim to show the U.S. public and allies abroad that he is committed to 'degrade' and 'destroy' the group that has taken over large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Obama will attend a meeting led by General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with foreign defense chiefs at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington  to discuss the coalition's work. No major policy decisions are expected. President Barack Obama will today meet military chiefs from around the world to discuss plans to counter the Islamic State, amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more to stop the terrorist group . Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the meeting was part of 'ongoing efforts' to build the coalition and 'integrate the capabilities of each country into the broader strategy'. The strategy is being called into question. Referring to ISIS, Republican Senator John McCain said on Sunday that 'they're winning and we're not'. The United Nations said yesterday that fighting in Iraq's western Anbar province had forced up to 180,000 people to flee after ISIS, captured the city of Hit. Analysts have said it is very important Obama shows that he is committed to fighting ISIS . Anthony Cordesman, national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the fight against ISIS 'hasn't gone badly, but it certainly hadn't gone well'. He added that it was 'very important' that Obama had to show both Americans and other countries that he was 'committed' to the fight. Representatives from Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were expected to attend the meeting. Colonel Ed Thomas, Dempsey's spokesman, said the meeting was about :'Coming together in person to discuss the vision, the challenges, the way ahead.' Having Turkey at the table will be key. Ankara has come under some pressure to send its own ground troops into Syria against ISIS. The country could announce after the meeting that it will join Saudi Arabia in training moderate Syrian rebels, Mr Cordesman said. Turkey has not reached a new agreement to let the United States use its Incirlik air base in the fight against but reached an agreement with Washington on training Syrian rebels, sources at the Turkish prime minister's office said.

chatgpt: Former U.S. President Barack Obama is set to meet with military chiefs from approximately 20 countries in Washington, D.C. The meeting, which occurs just three weeks before the upcoming U.S. congressional elections, comes amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more in terms of military strategy. According to sources, the focus of the meeting will be on counterterrorism and the fight against the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. Countries expected to be represented at the meeting include France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada. The timing of the meeting is significant, as many are speculating about the impact of the upcoming U.S. elections on the country's foreign and military policy. President Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy has been criticized by some for its aggressiveness and unpredictability, which has led to tension with U.S. allies and the withdrawal from international agreements like the Iran nuclear deal. In contrast, Obama was known for taking a more measured approach to foreign policy and working closely with U.S. allies to address global challenges. The fact that he is now meeting with military chiefs from other countries is a testament to his continued relevance in the global arena. One possible outcome of the meeting is a renewed emphasis on multilateral cooperation in combating global threats. Given the complex nature of modern security challenges, it is becoming increasingly clear that no one country can act alone to address them. In addition to its symbolic significance, the meeting could also have practical implications for U.S. military strategy. By hearing directly from military leaders from other countries, Obama can gain valuable insights into their perspectives on the current state of the fight against ISIS and other terrorist organizations. At the same time, some critics have expressed skepticism about the impact of the meeting, pointing out that Obama is no longer in office and does not have the same level of influence on U.S. policy that he once did. Despite these concerns, however, the fact that Obama remains a respected figure on the global stage means that his opinions still carry weight, particularly among U.S. allies who are concerned about the country's current direction. Overall, the meeting between Obama and military chiefs from other countries represents a potentially important development in the ongoing struggle to address global security threats. While it remains to be seen what specific outcomes will arise from the gathering, it is clear that it represents a significant step toward greater international collaboration in the fight against terrorism and other threats.
