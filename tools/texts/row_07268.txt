article: ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- The hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery took on a different tone Monday -- the usually quiet and reverent resting place of fallen heroes was buzzing with volunteers, professional landscapers and their equipment during the annual "Renewal and Remembrance" project. Monday was the annual "Renewal and Remembrance" day at Arlington National Cemetery. "Renewal" was started more than 10 years ago by an Ohio lawn-care group that wanted to give a day of service to the cemetery outside Washington, according to Bill Hildebolt, spokesman for the Professional Landcare Network. "It's grown fantastically from a few lawn-care operators to today we had over 400 individual PLANET members," he said Monday. Each year, volunteers take on several projects during the service day, including spreading lime over nearly 300 acres of the cemetery and installing irrigation systems, Hildebolt said. While the 95 companies participating Monday may normally compete for business in the lawn-care market, during Renewal the crews work together to honor the service members buried at Arlington. "It's just a day of remembrance," said Jeff Dietrich of Pennsylvania-based Joshua Tree, who has been volunteering for four years. A crew of arborists from the Joshua Tree company took on one the most expensive projects -- protecting Arlington's biggest trees from lightning. According to Dietrich, the process of lightning protection is important for protecting a valuable part of history.  Watch how trees are protected Â» . "Lightning, electricity is unpredictable at best. ... It'll blow a tree apart." To protect a tree from lightning strikes, Dietrich and his crew climb up to the top of a tree and run copper wires down the trunk with anchors that resemble rifle cartridges. The wire is then grounded by a copper pole entrenched at the base of the tree. If lightning strikes, the electricity runs down the wire and dissipates into the ground instead of harming the tree. Even though it took the Joshua Tree crew longer to reach Arlington from Pennsylvania than the four hours needed to complete their work, the workers seemed eager for their chance to volunteer, cheering each other on while working and sharing some trade secrets with other crews. "How many people can say they get to come down to Arlington, especially if they're not from around here, and climb some of these trees?" said Deitrich. For Hildebolt, providing a service for the national cemetery is a way to make a national contribution. "It's a privilege," he said. "It's a very humbling experience that I'm very proud of."

chatgpt: Every year, Arlington National Cemetery is transformed into an even more breathtaking sight, thanks to the dedication and hard work of a group of volunteers. On Monday, 95 companies from across the country came together to participate in the annual "Renewal and Remembrance" project, volunteering their time and efforts to beautify the national landmark. The Renewal and Remembrance event has been a part of the landscaping industry for over two decades. The project is held on a specific day each year, which allows landscapers to donate their services in a synchronized manner. The project was launched in 1996 by PLANET, the Professional Landcare Network, which is a voluntary trade association representing the lawn care industry. The volunteers who participate in the Renewal and Remembrance project are committed to maintaining Arlington National Cemetery's grounds and ensuring the best possible conditions for veterans and visitors alike. The teams of landscapers take on many projects that include irrigation, pruning, aerating, planting, and pest control. Additionally, lightning and tree protection are also part of the project to sustain the overall health of the cemetery's landscape. This year, the volunteers tackled the task of removing invasive plant species in the grounds. They demonstrated their tenacity and skills that transformed the grounds of the cemetery. One of the major challenges of the effort is the Arlington's warm, humid climate and its large variety of plant life. Nevertheless, the volunteers remained persistent and worked through the heat, proving their dedication to their craft. Despite the labor-intensive nature of the work, these volunteers' commitment to the cause is evident by the huge turnout every year. One of the participating companies explained that they participate every year because, as landscapers, they know the value of taking care of the grounds that hold such significance. By participating, they hope to show their appreciation for the soldiers who have served our country and are now resting at Arlington National Cemetery. The project isn't just about landscaping - it's an opportunity to pay tribute to the powerful symbol and the people it represents. By coming together and volunteering their services, participants are also paying their respects to the brave men and women who served in the military and made the highest sacrifices for the nation. As the day drew to a close, the volunteers were exhausted and somewhat dirty; however, they left Arlington National Cemetery looking like a new place. The successful event left the cemetery revived and its permanent residents' resting places neat and orderly. The Renewal and Remembrance Project, with its vast volunteer numbers and remarkable commitment, continued to make progress for veterans at Arlington National Cemetery. The extensive work done by the landscapers modeled a devotion to honor our fallen soldiers with the ultimate respect and dignity.
