article: (CNN) -- The number of journalists jailed around the world reached a record high in 2012, with Turkey the worst offender, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report published Tuesday. At the start of this month, 232 reporters, photographers and editors were in prisons in 27 countries on charges of "terrorism" and crimes against the state intended to "silence critical voices," the New-York based group said. The figure is the highest since the organization, which promotes press freedom, began record-keeping in 1990 through an annual census. Until now, the record was 185, set in 1996.

Dozens of Kurdish reporters and editors have been jailed on terrorism-related charges, it said, and several other journalists "on charges of involvement in anti-government plots." "Broadly worded anti-terror and penal code statutes have allowed Turkish authorities to conflate the coverage of banned groups and the investigation of sensitive topics with outright terrorism or other anti-state activity," the committee said. Iran came a close second, with 45 jailed journalists, according to the report. Tehran has "sustained a crackdown that began after the disputed 2009 presidential election," it said. Many of the 32 journalists behind bars in China, the third worst offender, are Tibetans or Uighurs who were imprisoned for covering ethnic unrest that flared up in 2008, according to the committee. Others are being held for expressing dissident political views, it said . In Eritrea, none of the 28 detained journalists have "ever been publicly charged with a crime or brought before a court for trial," the report said, dubbing the country "the worst abuser of due process." Amid the civil war raging in Syria, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have seized at least 15 journalists, according to the committee. "None of the detainees have been charged with a crime, and the authorities have been unwilling to account for the detainees' whereabouts or well-being," it said. On a more positive note, the committee noted that for the first time since 1996, Myanmar is not on its list of countries jailing journalists. The Myanmar government of President Thein Sein, whose recent political reforms have been welcomed by the United States and Europe, has released at least 12 journalists over the past year, the report said.

chatgpt: According to a recent report by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) there are currently 232 reporters, photographers, and editors jailed around the world. Turkey is the worst offender, with 49 journalists detained, followed by Iran, China, Eritrea, and Syria. The CPJ's annual report highlights the dangers that journalists face in many countries where freedom of the press is restricted, and where governments often use the threat of imprisonment to silence critical voices. In Turkey, in particular, journalists have been targeted for their reporting on sensitive topics such as politics, terrorism, and human rights. Despite the troubling statistics, there is some cause for hope. Myanmar, which had been on the CPJ's list of the worst countries for jailing journalists since 1996, is not listed this year. This is due in part to the efforts of the country's new government, which has taken steps to reform media laws and release some jailed journalists. However, journalists in many countries still face serious challenges. In Iran, for example, reporters are often charged with vague offenses such as "spreading propaganda against the state" or "insulting the supreme leader," which can carry lengthy prison sentences. China has also been cracking down on free speech, with journalists and bloggers being detained for reporting on sensitive topics such as corruption and human rights abuses. Eritrea is another country that has faced criticism for its treatment of journalists. The small African nation has been called one of the most repressive media environments in the world, with journalists facing arrest, torture, and forced labor. And in Syria, reporters and photographers have faced increasing danger as the country's civil war has escalated. Despite these challenges, the CPJ continues to advocate for press freedom around the world. The organization provides support for journalists facing legal or physical threats, and works to draw attention to cases where reporters have been unjustly imprisoned. As the CPJ's report shows, there is still much work to be done to protect journalists and the vital role that a free press plays in a democratic society. It is up to governments, civil society organizations, and individuals to work together to ensure that journalists are able to do their jobs without fear of retribution, and to hold those in power accountable for their actions.
