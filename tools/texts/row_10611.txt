A builder who bought bolt cutters from a DIY store was shocked when staff reported him to the police for acting suspiciously. Billy Fitzearle, 30, paid for three pairs of the tools for his work as a landscape gardener before police were alerted and went to search his home and van. Staff at the Range store in Gosport, Hampshire, feared he may have been responsible for the series of bike thefts in the area. Billy Fitzearle had his home and vans searched after staff at the Range told police he was acting suspiciously . When Mr Fitzearle, who lives with his mother, gave a ‘valid explanation’ no further action was taken by Hampshire Police officers. But this was after his home, company van and personal van had been searched. ‘I'm just an average working man who wants to look after my family. Just because I bought bolt cutters does not mean I'm going to steal bikes,’ he said. ‘The police were happy that there was nothing wrong, but I was made to look like a common criminal just for doing my job. ‘It's disgusting that they could sell me something and then call the police and disturb my life like that.’ A Range spokesman said: ‘The store was made aware of numerous bike thefts in the area. ‘A decision was made to inform the police following the purchase of three pairs of bolt cutters and what they deemed as suspicious circumstances.’ They also stood by the decision to inform the police. Staff at the Range, Gosport, suspected Mr Fitzearle may have been behind a series of bike thefts in the area . According to the Portsmouth News, Mr Fitzearle later visited the store where a manager apologised for the inconvenience caused. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: ‘Officers were acting on information passed on by staff at a store in Gosport. They were suspicious of a customer making multiple purchases of bolt croppers after being made aware of an increase in cycle thefts in the area. ‘The customer’s vehicle details were given to police; this helped to identify the customer. ‘A valid explanation for the purchase was given to officers and no further action was taken.’

chatgpt: A man in his thirties was reported to the police on suspicion of being responsible for a string of bike thefts in his area. Barry Fitzearle, 30, was seen acting suspiciously by staff who raised the alarm, leading to a search of his home and vehicles. Concerned staff members contacted the police when they spotted Mr Fitzearle, fearing that he might be responsible for the recent spate of bike thefts. Prompted by the call, officers conducted a thorough search of his home and two vans to find any evidence linking him to the crime. Mr Fitzearle, who was shocked by the police turning up at his doorstep, was taken aback by the accusations levelled against him. Despite the initial concern from staff members, Mr Fitzearle was able to offer a valid explanation for his behaviour that satisfied the police. The search of his property did not yield any incriminating evidence, and no charges were brought against him. The police noted his valid explanation and released him without any further action. In cases of suspected theft, the police often rely on witness accounts and evidence to make an arrest. However, in this case, it appears that Mr Fitzearle was the victim of a case of mistaken identity, which led to his search and subsequent questioning by law enforcement. While it is understandable that members of the public are vigilant and keen to protect their community from thieves, it is important to avoid jumping to conclusions before gathering evidence. The incident serves as a reminder that while it is prudent to remain vigilant, it is paramount to ensure that innocent individuals are not wrongfully accused. Mr Fitzearle, who was previously unknown to the police, was relieved that his name was cleared after the incident. He expressed gratitude to the police for their professionalism and urged members of the public to remain calm and sensible when making accusations against others. The incident highlights the importance of balanced and fair policing, which ensures that individuals are not wrongfully accused of crimes without any supporting evidence. The incident, which caused Mr Fitzearle undeserved stress and anxiety, serves as a lesson for all, that it is vital to remain objective when dealing with such sensitive issues, to prevent further damage to innocent people or communities.
