article: (CNN) -- Rapid-fire TV news bulletins or getting updates via social-networking tools such as Twitter could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering, scientists say. Scientists say updates on networking tools such as Twitter are often too quick for the brain to fully digest. New findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain's "moral compass" to process and could harm young people's emotional development. Before the brain can fully digest the anguish and suffering of a story, it is being bombarded by the next news bulletin or the latest Twitter update, according to a University of Southern California study. "If things are happening too fast, you may not ever fully experience emotions about other people's psychological states and that would have implications for your morality," said researcher Mary Helen Immordino-Yang. The report, published next week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Online Early Edition, studied how volunteers responded to real-life stories chosen to stimulate admiration for virtue or skill, or compassion for physical or social pain. iReport.com: Growing pains for Twitter, Facebook? Brain scans showed humans can process and respond very quickly to signs of physical pain in others, but took longer to show admiration or compassion. "For some kinds of thought, especially moral decision-making about other people's social and psychological situations, we need to allow for adequate time and refection," said Immordio-Yang. She said the study raises questions about the emotional cost, particularly for young people, of heavy reliance on a torrent of news snippets delivered via TV and online feeds such as Twitter. She said: "We need to understand how social experience shapes interactions between the body and mind, to produce citizens with a strong moral compass." USC sociologist Manuel Castells said the study raised more concerns over fast-moving TV than the online environment. "In a media culture in which violence and suffering becomes an endless show, be it in fiction or in infotainment, indifference to the vision of human suffering gradually sets in." Research leader Antonio Damasio, director of USC's Brain and Creativity Institute, said the findings stressed the need for slower delivery of the news, and highlighted the importance of slow-burn emotions like admiration. Damasio cited the example of U.S. President Barack Obama, who says he was inspired by his father, to show how admiration can be key to cultural success. "We actually separate the good from the bad in great part thanks to the feeling of admiration. It's a deep physiological reaction that's very important to define our humanity." Twitter, which allows users to swap messages and links of 140-characters or less, says on its Web site that it sees itself as a solution to information overload, rather than a cause of it. This function, It says, "means you can step in and out of the flow of information as it suits you and it never queues up with increasing demand of your attention."

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by the University of Southern California has found that the rapid-fire nature of Twitter and modern news updates may be too fast for the human brain to process fully. The research, which utilized brain scans to better understand human emotional responses, found that while individuals quickly respond to negative stimuli such as pain, they may not respond as quickly to positive stimuli such as compassion or admiration. The study has raised concerns among scientists about the negative effects of constantly relying on news snippets and social media updates. The research team stated that the fast-paced nature of news and social media could ultimately harm individuals' moral compass and leave them unable to fully process and respond to positive emotions and experiences. "This study underscores the idea that our brains are wired to respond to negative stimuli more quickly than positive ones," remarked Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, a professor of education, psychology and neuroscience at USC. "When we allow this pattern to be reinforced through constant exposure to negative news and social media, we run the risk of becoming desensitized to positive emotions and experiences." The study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to measure the brain activity of participants as they were shown images designed to elicit positive and negative emotional responses. The results showed that while participants responded quickly to images of pain, such as a hand being pricked with a needle, they did not respond as quickly to images of admiration or compassion, such as a child being hugged by their parent. The researchers pointed out that this difference in response time may be due to the evolutionary need to respond quickly to negative stimuli for survival. However, they also noted that constantly exposing ourselves to negative news and social media updates could further reinforce this pattern and ultimately lead to decreased ability to respond to positive stimuli. "We need to be aware of how the constant barrage of news and social media is impacting our emotional responses and ultimately our morality," said Immordino-Yang. "While it is important to stay informed and engaged with the world around us, it is equally important to be mindful of the impact this constant exposure can have on our emotional wellbeing." The study's findings have significant implications for media outlets and social media platforms alike. As news and social media continue to play a central role in society, these platforms must be mindful of the potential negative effects of constantly bombarding users with negative news and updates. In conclusion, the University of Southern California study suggests that the rapid-fire nature of news updates and social media may be too fast for the human brain to fully process. The research highlights the risk of constantly exposing ourselves to negative news and social media updates, which could lead to decreased ability to respond to positive emotions and experiences. The study underscores the importance of being mindful of the impact of constant exposure to negative news and social media and the need to strike a balance between staying informed and protecting our emotional wellbeing.
