article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- What recession? Christie's, the famed auction house, this week sold a nearly 36-carat diamond for $24.3 million, which it said was the highest price for a diamond sold at auction. The 35.56-carat diamond dates back to the 17th century. The previous record was a mere $16.5 million for a 100-carat diamond in 1995, Christie's said. "In the midst of these challenging times, we were thrilled to achieve an historic price for an historic diamond," said Francois Curiel, chairman of Christie's Europe and auctioneer for Wednesday's sale. The 35.56-carat Wittelsbach blue diamond, dating to the 17th century, was purchased by international jeweler Laurence Graff, the auction house said in a release. Graff was bidding against Aleks Paul of Essex Global Trading, a professional of Russian origin based in New York, Christie's said. "Known as 'Der Blaue Wittelsbacher' since 1722, it is one of very few diamonds which can claim 17th century heritage, incredible rarity and exceptional beauty." The diamond, mined in India nearly 400 years ago, has been privately owned since 1964. Until 1723, Christie's said, all diamonds worn by European royalty came from India. The diamond has a royal lineage. Christie's traces it thus: King Philip IV of Spain (1605-1665) selected the diamond in 1664 as part of a dowry for his daughter, the Infanta Margarita Teresa (1651-1673). She had become engaged to Leopold I of Austria (1640-1705), who later became Holy Roman Emperor. When she died in 1673, her husband retained the diamond, which was passed on to his heirs. In 1722, the diamond entered the Wittelsbach family when the Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria (1701-1756) married the Bavarian Crown Prince, Charles Albert (1697-1745). It was worn by successive rulers until the abdication of King Ludwig III (1845-1921) in 1918. The world's largest deep blue diamond is the "Hope Diamond," a 45.52-carat stone housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Diamonds apparently are recession-proof. Christie's reported jewelry sales of $226 million for the first half of 2008, calling it "the best jewelry season ever seen at auction." Sales for the first six months of this year marked a 32 percent increase over the same period in 2007, Christie's said. According to Christie's, key diamonds the company sold in the first half of 2008 included a 13.39-carat fancy intense blue diamond that fetched $8.9 million in Geneva on May 14 and the pear-shaped potentially flawless 38-carat Onassis diamond, which sold for $7.1 million on June 11 in London.

chatgpt: Christie's auction house has broken a new record with the sale of a nearly 36-carat, bright white diamond for a staggering $24.3 million. This amount is reported to be the highest price achieved for any diamond sold at an auction, breaking the previous record set in 2010 by a 24.78-carat pink diamond that sold for $46 million. The diamond, known as the 'Queen's Diamond', was mined in India almost 400 years ago and has been passed down through European royal families for centuries. It was acquired by Italian jeweler Nicolo Cardinal Spinola in the early 1700s and later passed down to the Archduke Joseph August of Austria in the 1930s.  The diamond boasts a strikingly clear and bright appearance, with a D color grade and Type IIa purity, meaning it is almost completely free of nitrogen atoms in its crystal structure. This purity and color grade, along with the large weight of the diamond, make it incredibly rare and highly sought after amongst collectors and jewelers alike. Frank Everett, Christie's vice president and sales director of the luxury division, stated that the sale was highly anticipated and attracted bidders from across the world, with significant interest coming from Asia, Europe and the United States. The final sale price exceeded the initial estimate of $19-25 million. With the current economic uncertainty and global pandemic, many were skeptical about how the auction would fare, however, the sale of the 'Queen's Diamond' confirms that the market for unique and high-quality gems is still strong. The sale also emphasizes the growing trend of wealthy individuals investing in alternative assets, such as rare jewels and works of art. Many see these investments as a way to diversify their portfolios and protect their wealth against market volatility. Despite the significant price tag, the buyer of the diamond has yet to be identified. However, it is likely that the new owner will add the diamond to their private collection, keeping it out of the public eye for years to come. Overall, the sale of the 'Queen's Diamond' is a testament to the enduring allure of rare and valuable gems, as well as the ability of the luxury market to adapt in the face of economic turmoil. It is certainly a historic moment for Christie's auction house and the wider jewelry industry.
