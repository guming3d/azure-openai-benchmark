article: As 'The Chosen One' banner appears amid a darkened, stormy sky, a Scottish voice sounds, 'Football, bloody hell. What the hell was that all about?'. A woman then has her say, 'I was ashamed of them'. The on-screen text is equally damning, 'Following a season of discontent' it reads. The banner, wearing the face of David Moyes, crumples to the backdrop of thunder and lightening. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal and Ryan Giggs in Man United cartoon parody . Remember him? This MUTV advert kicks off with the image of sacked manager David Moyes . Dawning of a new era: The new United, including Wayne Rooney, David de Gea and Danny Welbeck . This, however, is no fan-site illustration or rival taunt – this is MUTV, Manchester United's in-house television station. The trailer continues. 'Trust me, we'll be back,' a foreign voice adds as the United players emerge from the clouds with the message 'A new storm is breaking'. Ryan Giggs then has his say, 'Keep supporting us and the good times will come back soon'. While the statues of Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson stand guard, Giggs and new boss Louis van Gaal are cast in the troubled sky, 'The Master & Apprentice'. The neon, red lettering of 'Manchester United' breaks through the gloom, 'Start to rebuild a dynasty'. The message is clear: Moyes brought down the empire, Van Gaal and Giggs will rebuild it. MUTV makes no attempt to mask its appraisal of Moyes' efforts last season, the use of the word 'ashamed' proving particularly barbed. Statuesque: The promo also features the looming former managers Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Matt Busby . The new regime: The clouds reveal new boss Louis van Gaal and club legend Ryan Giggs . Having succeeded Ferguson – whose decision it was to appoint his compatriot – the Scot led the champions to a sorry seventh in the Premier League, missing out on Champions League football for the first time since 1995. Each passing week saw the collection of another unwanted record; it was United's worst season since the birth of the Premier League in 1992. Moyes paid with his job before the end of the campaign and Holland boss Van Gaal was appointed. Axed: Former Manchester United boss David Moyes is disparaged in the advert on the club's channel . MUTV are evidently keen to get behind the new regime and the trailer is a bold production given its setting on an in-house station. But in an age where we criticise clubs for the propaganda-like offerings from their official websites and TV channels, MUTV should at least be applauded for refusing to ignore their disastrous last campaign. We're not too sure David Moyes will agree with that sentiment, however.

chatgpt: Manchester United fans were left stunned after a MUTV advert showed a crumpled David Moyes 'Chosen One' banner. The banner, which was once famously hung at Old Trafford, was torn down in 2014 after Moyes' performance as United manager failed to live up to expectations. The MUTV advert has since resurfaced, prompting fans to question the club's motives. The advert, which is for MUTV's upcoming documentary on Louis van Gaal and Ryan Giggs, paints the duo as 'Master and apprentice', while slamming the previous regime led by Moyes. The voiceover heard in the ad is scathing, saying "I was ashamed of them," in reference to the Moyes-era at Manchester United. The Moyes 'Chosen One' banner was initially unveiled in August 2013 when the Scottish manager took charge of a Manchester United side still reeling from the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. The banner was meant to show the fans' faith in Moyes as he replaced the legendary manager, but it became a source of ridicule and embarrassment during his tenure. The banner was eventually taken down in early 2014 after a series of disappointing results, including a 3-0 loss to Liverpool, a 4-1 defeat to Manchester City and a 2-2 draw with Fulham. Moyes was sacked later that season, with United finishing outside of the top four for the first time in over 20 years. United fans on social media have been quick to criticize the club for using the Moyes banner in the MUTV advert. Many have suggested that it is disrespectful to the former manager, who should be remembered for the good work he did at other clubs, such as Everton. This is not the first time Manchester United has been criticized for their treatment of former managers. José Mourinho, who was sacked by the club in December 2018, recently claimed that his former employers did not show him enough respect or support during his time at Old Trafford. It remains to be seen how the club will respond to the criticism, but many fans will be hoping that United will show a little more class and dignity in the future. For now, the MUTV advert has only added fuel to the fire, with United fans continuing to debate whether the club's current management team is the right one for the job.
