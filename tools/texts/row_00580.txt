article: A mystery EPA employee in Denver seems more intent on spreading toxic waste than cleaning it up. The agency has received more than a dozen reports of 'beyond gross' behavior in its Denver office - including a woman who has been smearing menstrual blood and human feces on the walls. Other reports include 'a trail of [human waste] leading out in the hallway' near the men's bathroom, an employee who urinated on the toilet seat and floor of the bathroom, and another employee who defecated outside the building when he was locked out. In June, a memo from Deputy Regional Administrator Howard Cantor was released publicly that revealed the Denver office of the EPA was beset by an employee who was clogging toilets and putting human waste on the floor outside the bathroom. Toxic waste dump: The EPA's Denver office has been beset by a mystery employee who is smearing human waste and menstrual blood on the walls . A new report from environmental policy newsletter Greenwire reveals that bathroom problems were even more prevalent than previously thought. And while the incidents appear to have stopped, the perpetrator was never caught. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is calling in the Department of Homeland Security to protect employees from the contamination in the office. In emails obtained by Greenwire, employees report being 'terrified' by the perpetrator and fear she could become violent. Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service, which provides security for federal offices, has stepped up patrols. The EPA has also brought in a workplace violence consultant and increased its own security at the office. Newly-released emails from EPA employees reveal a slew of disguising behavior at the office. An employee sent a picture of this clogged toilet to EPA bosses . 'A male supervisor ... told her that management knows that it is a female on the [redacted] floor who has been wiping feces and menstrual blood on the walls (I'm really sorry, this is beyond gross) and that they are worried that her behavior is escalating,' according to one email obtained by Greenwire. Another email reported: 'The incidents of urine on the seats and the floors are still occurring regularly in the women's restrooms; however they are no longer limited to the 6th and 7th floors. Employees are now reporting incidents more frequently.' Another employee sent a picture of an overflowing toilet to bosses. In another email, an employee told bosses: 'I can think of two people right off the bat that should be checked out. .. one who under the context of emergency, defecated outside the building when precluded from coming into the building prior to 5:30am.' The incidents have led some employees to fear the perpetrator could become violent and even commit a workplace shooting. Employees have reported one coworker who was found with ammunition. Another was reported to printed off specifications for a rifle in the office.

chatgpt: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was recently shaken by a shocking incident that left many of its employees feeling violated and uncomfortable in the workplace. The incident in question involved a federal employee who engaged in what EPA officials have referred to as "beyond gross" behavior, that has caused the agency to ask for protection from the Department of Homeland Security in its Denver office. According to sources familiar with the situation, the employee in question had been displaying inappropriate and unwanted behavior towards several of his colleagues. The behavior was said to have escalated to the point where several employees began to feel unsafe in the workplace, prompting the EPA to take action. Although the exact nature of the behavior has not been disclosed, sources say that it was serious enough to warrant the involvement of the Department of Homeland Security, which has been asked to provide extra security measures at the EPA's Denver office. The EPA has stated that it takes such incidents very seriously and is committed to ensuring a safe and respectful workplace for all of its employees. In a statement, the agency said that it is "deeply concerned" about the alleged behavior and is working closely with law enforcement to identify and apprehend the employee responsible. At the same time, the EPA has also taken steps internally to address the situation, including offering counseling services and other resources to affected employees. The agency has also emphasized the importance of reporting any incidents of harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behavior, and has encouraged all employees to speak out if they feel uncomfortable or unsafe in the workplace. The incident at the EPA is just the latest in a series of high-profile cases of workplace harassment and misconduct that have come to light in recent years. From Hollywood to Capitol Hill, allegations of sexual harassment, misconduct, and abuse have been brought to the forefront, prompting calls for greater transparency and accountability in the workplace. In response to these incidents, many companies and organizations have implemented new policies and procedures designed to prevent and address workplace harassment and misconduct. These may include codes of conduct, training programs, and reporting mechanisms, as well as increased monitoring and oversight of employee behavior. For its part, the EPA has stated that it remains committed to a workplace culture that is free from harassment and discrimination of any kind. The agency has pledged to continue working with law enforcement and other organizations to ensure that all employees are able to work in a safe and respectful environment, free from the kind of behavior that has been alleged in this case. As the investigation into the incident at the EPA continues, many are hopeful that it will serve as a wake-up call for all organizations to take a closer look at their own workplace cultures and policies, with an eye towards preventing harassment and misconduct before it occurs. Only then can workplaces truly become environments where all employees are able to thrive and succeed, without fear of harassment or discrimination.
