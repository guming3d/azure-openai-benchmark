article: Three large solar flares over the last two days have released a huge cloud of particles from the sun which could knock out satellites and communication systems on Earth. A 'coronal mass ejection' (CME), a huge cloud of irradiated particles and a magnetic shockwave, could strike the planet on Friday, damaging satellites and knocking out communications. The three solar flares already caused brief disruptions to high frequency communications, such as radio broadcasts and aircraft communications, when they struck yesterday and twice on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . The sun has emitted three intense solar flares in just two days. Two on Tuesday (left and centre) and one on Wednesday (right), disrupting military radio and aircraft communications . The sun emitted two X-grade solar flares on Tuesday morning at 7.42am and 8.52am - X being the most powerful kind of solar flare - and a third X-class flare early yesterday. Solar flares are largely harmless, as Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of the harmful particles they emit. However they can cause satellites to malfunction, and disrupt the layer of atmosphere some communications pass through, causing interruptions. But if the CME strikes, then the damage could be far more severe. CME's can cause huge electrical surges, knocking out power grids and causing pylon cables to overload and snap. Events on this scale are unlikely, as the NOAA says the CME due on Friday will only strike a 'glancing blow', but satellites could be affected, leading to a drop in mobile phone signal. The last major CME to hit Earth came in 1859 when compasses were knocked out as Earth's magnetic field was disrupted. But the flares also released a 'coronal mass ejection', a huge cloud of irradiated particles and a magnetic shockwave which could hit Earth on Friday, potentially knocking out mobile phone satellites and GPS . The Aurora Borealis was also visible as far south as Cuba as particles from the sun bounced off of Earth's atmosphere. Because the last major CME happened before the planet was dependent on electronics for our day-to-day lives, little is known about what the real impact would be. But it is likely that large electronics would be badly affected, causing weeks or months of disruptions to power supplies, phone networks and the internet which could cost billions to repair. Small electronics, such as mobile phones and computers, would likely be unaffected, but would be rendered almost useless with large networks knocked out. This image provided by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center shows a significant solar flare erupting on 10 June 2014. The sun has emitted 3 X-class solar flares in two days, the most intense type of solar flares .
highlights: Three of the most intense class of solar flares released from sun in two days . Caused disruption in aircraft communications and military radio in Europe . Also released huge magnetic shockwave which could hit Earth on Friday . That could knock out mobile phone satellites and GPS communications .

chatgpt: Solar flares are a natural occurrence in our galaxy, and on Wednesday, three of the most intense class of solar flares were released from the sun. These flares, as reported by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), have caused disruption in communication networks across Europe. Aircraft communication systems and military radio in Europe have been most affected by the solar flares. Airline companies have reported that there have been several instances of lost communication with the aircraft which has led to delays in landing and take-offs. The military has confirmed that the solar flares have also impacted its radio communication network, which has raised some concerns. This is especially true given the sensitive nature of military communication and the need for quick response times. The impact of the solar flares has been magnified by the size of the magnetic shockwave that was also released from the sun. This shockwave is expected to hit Earth on Friday, and if it does, it could have severe effects. There is a high chance that it could knock out mobile phone satellites and GPS communications, which could affect people all around the world. Experts say that if the magnetic shockwave hits Earth, it could lead to widespread power outages, as well as other communication disruptions. This could also lead to significant delays in travel and navigation, which could have a significant impact on the economy. However, there is no need to panic just yet. Scientists from NASA and NOAA are closely monitoring the situation and are offering real-time updates on the status of the solar flares and the magnetic shockwave. They have asked people to remain calm and not to indulge in any sensationalist activities. While the impact of the solar flares and the magnetic shockwave is yet to be fully assessed, it is crucial that all communication networks remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to mitigate the risks. In conclusion, solar flares are a natural occurrence in our galaxy, and while they are usually not harmful, this time a huge magnetic shockwave could affect the communication and navigation systems on Earth. While the situation is being closely monitored, it is essential that everyone remains cautious and vigilant.
