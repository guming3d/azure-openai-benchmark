Young children should return to old-fashioned games such as hide-and-seek and hopscotch to beat worries over their body image, a leading expert has claimed. Independent psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos said her research has shown that children as young as five had anxieties over the way they look. She said a return to traditional outdoor games such as tag and rounders would give youngsters more confidence in their own bodies for the future and fulfill the so-called Olympic Legacy. Active play also gives less sporty children the confidence to beat anxieties, she said. Dr Papadopoulos' report, entitled Physical Activity and Body Image, found that play is just as important as sport in getting children to participate in physical activity. It said that children who have body confidence concerns are more likely to be anxious about taking part in formal sports. However, parents who engage their children in regular physical activity, such as active play, from an early age, help them to develop increased self-esteem and emotional resilience. She said both of these are important factors in developing a better body image and making children better able to cope with the external messages about body image - such as advertising campaigns - that they are bombarded with as they grow up. Speaking at the launch of the Make Time 2 Play campaign, organised by the British Toy & Hobby Association, Dr . Papadopoulos added that recent studies had found that a quarter of . seven-year-old girls have tried to lose weight at least once and one third of young boys aged eight to 12 are dieting. She said: 'A return to old fashioned . games which involve physical activity can only be good for getting rid . of worries about body image among children. Dr Papadopoulos said a return to traditional outdoor games like hopscotch would give youngsters more confidence in their own bodies for the future and fulfill the so-called Olympic Legacy . 'Youngsters who are active and having fun are more likely to develop a positive outlook on physical activity. 'For those that shy away from sport there are lots of other activities that can get children active without engaging in traditional team sports. 'Building a den, going on a nature trail or treasure hunt or even just playing tag can be great starter activities to get children active before leading on to more gentle sports style activities like rounders or playing with a ball. The key thing is to keep it fun.' The Make Time 2 Play campaign states . that play is vitally important not just to children's physical . development but to their emotional health too.

chatgpt: New research from psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos has shown that simple games can help prevent and treat anxiety in children as young as five years old. Dr Papadopoulos' report highlights the importance of play in getting children to participate in physical activity. The study also found that the percentage of children dieting to lose weight is worryingly high, with 25% of 7-year-old girls and over 30% of young boys aged 8 to 12 admitting to dieting at least once. Dr Papadopoulos stresses that physical activity and positive body image are key to reducing anxiety and depression in children, and that play can be just as important as sport in promoting such activity. The report suggests that parents and caregivers, as well as schools and other institutions, should encourage children to engage in games and other forms of play that involve physical activity. This could include traditional activities such as tag or hopscotch, as well as newer forms of gameplay like augmented reality apps and active video games. One potential benefit of encouraging such activity is the promotion of better eating habits among children. Studies have shown that young people who engage in regular physical activity are more likely to make healthy nutritional choices. Dr Papadopoulos notes that play also offers benefits beyond the physical. She argues that the social interaction and emotional engagement of play can help alleviate stress and build resilience in children. "Play offers children the opportunity to be creative, to explore their environment, and to build social connections with other children," says Dr Papadopoulos. "These are all important elements of positive mental health." While the study highlights the importance of play in promoting physical and mental health in children, Dr Papadopoulos acknowledges that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between play and anxiety in young people. Nevertheless, the findings are a reminder that while traditional sports activities are important for children, play is an equally vital aspect of physical activity and should be encouraged at every opportunity. The report also serves as a wake-up call for parents, schools, and healthcare professionals to address the harmful effects of dieting on young people's health and well-being. By encouraging positive body image and promoting healthy eating habits, society can help prevent the onset of anxiety and depression in children as they grow older.
