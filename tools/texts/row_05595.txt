The unidentified longboarder was speeding down what he thought was a deserted country road in Spain, until a white coach suddenly appeared round a sharp left-hand bend.

Earlier on during the video the daredevil can be seen negotiating a series of sharp curves with amazing skill . His gloved hands appear to brush the road surface at times as he leans down low to make the turns . It is not clear how badly he was hurt, if at all, by his brush with death. The three-minute film starts off with the adrenaline junkie pushing off vigorously as he builds speed at the top of his longboard run. He whips round a series of twists and turns on the narrow, poorly surfaced country road with stunning skill and just a helmet for protection. The film was shot by fellow boarder Alberto Alepuz, who was following behind with his camera. At the start and end of the film he warns: 'NEVER fully trust walkie talkies'. Alepuz adds underneath the video posted on his Youtube channel: 'S*** can always happen while skating open roads. 'Unexpected cars can always show up, communication can always fail. 'This guy was very lucky this time. 'Downhill skateboarding is not a game. Always be careful.'

The unidentified thrill-seeker was hurtling down the narrow road with speed and agility when he suddenly faced a coach coming towards him around a sharp bend. Quick reflexes and evasive action saved his life, as he maneuvered his board off the road to safety. Luckily, the heart-stopping three-minute downhill run was captured on camera by fellow daredevil Alberto Alepuz from Madrid. The filmmaker, who is familiar with the dangers of extreme boarding, warns against taking risks lightly. He emphasises the importance of caution and safety in the sport, urging enthusiasts to be mindful of their environment and other road users. Downhill skateboarding is not a game, reminds Alepuz. The sport demands immense skill and practice, as well as a great deal of courage. It is all too easy to get carried away by the rush of adrenaline and forget about safety precautions. But the consequences of carelessness can be severe. The video of the narrow escape serves as a reminder of the risks involved in extreme sports, and the importance of responsible behaviour. It is not just the safety of the boarders themselves at stake, but also that of other road users. It is crucial to remain vigilant and cautious, and to respect the rules of the road. Despite the dangers, the thrill of downhill skateboarding continues to attract enthusiasts from around the world. It is a sport that demands a combination of skill, courage and respect for safety. With responsible behaviour, boarders can continue to push their limits and experience the rush of adrenaline, while keeping themselves and others safe.
