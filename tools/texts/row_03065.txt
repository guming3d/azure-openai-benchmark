article: Up to 80 Russian troops were killed in a skirmish in Ukraine last month despite Vladimir Putin's claims that Russia is not fighting there, according to documents released by an opposition politician. Members of an elite Russian paratroop force spoke of the brutal battle near Luhansk, a city in eastern Ukraine, in telephone transcripts leaked to the politician and newspaper publisher Lev Shlosberg. One paratrooper says: 'We're f***ing walking along looking for these f***ing Ukrainians. Vladimir Putin claims that his troops are not fighting in Ukraine but a leaked phone conversation between two Russian paratroopers suggests a skirmish into the country took place last month . 'We get out into the open and are seen, kapow! 'We dashed out onto the road, there was a field, sunflowers, and a checkpoint. They started to bomb it — bam bam bam — and they destroyed it,' the New York post reports. The paratrooper, who was wounded in the attack, claimed that 80 men were killed in the battle and that only ten made it out alive. He was telling the traumatic story to a fellow soldier in a phone call from a hospital where he was being treated. When his comrade asks him if he was aware that he was marching off to battle before the skirmish, he says that he had already told his wife he was 'off to war'. In the leaked telephone transcripts a paratrooper from the 76th Guards Air Assault Division tells his comrade that 80 soldiers were killed in the skirmish in Ukraine (file picture) But he added: 'They don't tell us anything. They say we are off on an exercise.' The conversation was said to have taken place between members of the elite 76th Guards Air Assault Division, which is based in the city of Pskov. Ukrainian officials reported a skirmish with the 76th Guards in mid-August and the country's Defense Ministry said on its website that its troops destroyed three of the unit's tanks and seized two troop carriers. Russia has denied that the battle took place. But despite the denials, last month President Vladimir Putin bestowed one of Russia's highest awards, the Order of Suvorov, on the division. He cited 76th Guards Air Assault Division's 'successful completion of military missions' and 'courage and heroism' - words that would suggest Russian troops have seen military action.

chatgpt: A leaked phone conversation between two Russian paratroopers suggests that Moscow's claim of not having troops fighting in Ukraine may be false. The two soldiers spoke of a battle that one of them had experienced and revealed that 80 men from the elite division were killed in the skirmish last month. The conversation recorded one soldier recalling a traumatic account of being taken by surprise by enemy troops while he was 'walking along looking for f***ing Ukrainians'. The soldier claimed they had been given no information beforehand as to what they were going to do, and had been told it was just an exercise. These revelations are in direct contradiction to the repeated denials of Russian President Vladimir Putin that his country's troops have not been involved in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Putin has insisted that any Russian troops in Ukraine are not under Moscow's control and are there as volunteers. However, this recording suggests otherwise. The recording was made by one of the soldiers on a phone call to a friend. It is not clear how the call was obtained, but it raises questions over Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Despite repeated condemnations from the international community, Russia has continued to support separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The ongoing conflict has resulted in the deaths of more than 13,000 people since it began in 2014. The revelations contained in this leaked conversation are likely to further fuel tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government has repeatedly accused Russia of being directly involved in the conflict and has called on the international community to take action against Moscow. In conclusion, the leaked phone conversation between the Russian paratroopers raises serious questions about the Kremlin's repeated denials of military involvement in Ukraine. It also highlights the risks involved in soldiers being deployed without proper information or training, with disastrous consequences.
