article: Washington (CNN) -- Bristol Palin describes being dragged through the grass and called a series of obscenities during a massive brawl last month in recordings of Anchorage police interviews that CNN obtained through a public records request. She said she jumped into a fight after "some old lady" pushed her sister, Willow Palin, because "oh f***in' hell no, no one's gonna touch my sister." When she tried to find the woman, though, she said a man who others identified as Korey Klingenmeyer, the owner of the house where the party took place, knocked her down. "A guy comes out of nowhere and pushes me on the ground, takes me by my feet in my dress -- in my thong dress in front of everybody -- [and says] 'Come on you c***, get the f*** out of here. Come on you s***, get the f*** out of here," she said. No charges were filed as a result of the September brawl. 6 must-reads from Palin family brawl police report . Other people interviewed by police described the Palins as instigators in a brawl that also reportedly included Track Palin and his father, Todd, fighting several men. They said Bristol Palin punched Klingenmeyer several times before he restrained her. Klingenmeyer said he'd approached Todd Palin to say that "your daughter's out of line" and that he should get the situation under control. That didn't happen. "I told 'em all to get the hell out of here and go home," he said. He said the altercation with Bristol Palin started after she insisted she was going to beat another woman up. "I said 'this is my house, we're not having this,'" Klingenmeyer said. "She freakin' goes, 'I'll kick your a**.'" He said Bristol Palin punched him several times, and then he grabbed her fist, made a motion that isn't described verbally, and then she "fell down." Sarah Palin can apparently be heard in the background during some of the interviews. At one point, she complained that her children were being "made to feel like the bad guys." She also criticizes Klingenmeyer, saying: "What would he be doin' pushin' girls around, though?" Matthew McKenna, whose birthday was the reason for the party, told police that people had gotten "drunk and stupid" -- and that he had video of the altercation, but wouldn't share it. "I know everyone here, and it's just an unfortunate deal," he said.

chatgpt: Alaska police recently released the recordings of a violent brawl that took place in a quiet neighborhood in Wasilla. The fight involved several members of former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's family. According to the recording, Palin's daughter Bristol was heard describing being dragged across the grass and called names. The fight reportedly broke out after a disagreement between two families who were attending a birthday party. Accounts of who started the fight differ, with some attendees claiming Bristol Palin was the instigator, while others claim that her sister, Willow, and her brother, Track, were also involved. In the recordings, Bristol can be heard alleging that a man took her phone and pushed her to the ground. She then described being dragged along the grass while someone else was verbally attacking her. Other members of the Palin family can be heard in the background, yelling and swearing as the altercation continued. One of the attendees who spoke to the media after the incident claimed that Bristol Palin was drunk and looking for a fight. The attendee added that the Palin family was known for causing trouble in town. The Palin family has not publicly commented on the recordings or the fight, but Sarah Palin has previously defended her family's behavior, saying that they were the ones who were attacked. The former governor has also criticized the media for their coverage of the incident, claiming that they are unfairly targeting her family. Despite the controversy surrounding the brawl, the police did not press any charges against the Palin family or anyone else involved in the incident.
