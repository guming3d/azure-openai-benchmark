article: By . Mike Dawes . Former Sussex bowler Naveed Arif has been handed a life ban from cricket by the England and Wales Cricket Board after pleading guilty to six breaches of its anti-corruption code. All of the charges related to Sussex’s Clydesdale Bank 40 match against Kent in August 2011. Arif is now banned from taking part in any form of cricket sanctioned by the ECB, the International Cricket Council or any other national cricket federation. ECB chief executive David Collier said: 'Today’s announcement sends out a very clear message that the ECB has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption in cricket and that it will root out and punish those who pose a threat to the game’s integrity.' Forbidden: Naveed Arif has been given a life ban by the ECB for six breaches of its anti-corruption code . Reports last month stated Arif was under investigation from the ECB, who are looking to clamp down on spot-fixing. Arif acknowledged his guilt in taped interviews with the governing body’s anti-corruption unit, as well as signed statements, and has accepted his punishment. Collier added he hopes the ban will serve as a warning to all cricketers. 'We thank the anti-corruption team for their work in bringing this case and trust that it will serve as a stark reminder to all players of the dangers that corrupt activities pose to their careers and livelihoods,' he said. Arif, a left-arm seamer who also represented Pakistan ‘A’, joined Sussex in time for the 2011 campaign, spending two seasons with the south coast county. He made 11 appearances for them in the LV= County Championship, 13 in the CB40 and six in the Friends Life t20 before it was announced he would be released in September 2012 after falling down the pecking order at Hove. Arif expressed his regret and apologised for his actions, admitting he had no excuses. Guilty: Arif's (far right) charges relate to his time playing for Sussex County Cricket Club in 2011 . A statement via his solicitors said: 'Mr Arif regrets his conduct which has let himself, his team-mates, Sussex County Cricket Club and the cricket fraternity down. 'He is deeply ashamed of his actions and, consequently, bringing the game of cricket into disrepute. These actions were unacceptable and Mr Arif has no excuses. 'Being banned from cricket, the game he loves, is the most severe punishment he could receive. Mr Arif is currently considering his future, having learnt some painful lessons from his past.'

chatgpt: Former cricketer Naveed Arif has been handed a life ban from cricket by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The ban comes after Arif pleaded guilty to six breaches of the board's anti-corruption code. The charges levied against Arif related to Sussex's Clydesdale Bank 40 match against Kent in August 2011. The ECB's anti-corruption code was put in place to safeguard the integrity of cricket in the UK. Arif's actions, with regard to the charges, were deemed to have contravened this code of conduct. As a result, the board had no option but to hand him a life ban. Arif's misconduct came to light after an investigation was launched by the ECB's Anti-Corruption Unit. The unit's investigation is part of the board's ongoing efforts to stamp out corruption and maintain the values of the sport. The charges against Arif related to payment for information, failure to disclose details of a corrupt approach, and disclosure of information to others. These breaches, according to the ECB, contravened the board's anti-corruption code and the trust placed in cricketers by their fans, fellow players, and the wider cricketing community. In a statement, the ECB said it was pleased that Arif had admitted guilt and that he was now unable to participate in any form of cricket. The board's Chief Executive, Tom Harrison, thanked the Anti-Corruption Unit for its diligent work and said that the ECB remained committed to eradicating corruption in the sport. Harrison further added that the ECB had a zero-tolerance approach to corruption, and that any violators of the board's anti-corruption code would face the full consequences of their actions. Arif has since released a statement expressing regret for his actions and apologizing to the cricketing community. He said that he had used poor judgment and that he fully accepted the punishment handed down by the board. Arif's life ban means that he is unable to participate in any form of cricket, including international and domestic matches as well as franchised-based leagues. He will no longer be able to earn a living through the sport he loves. In conclusion, the ECB's decision to ban Naveed Arif for life is a significant step towards safeguarding the integrity of cricket in the UK. It sends a strong message that the board is committed to stamping out corruption and maintaining the trust of the cricketing community.
