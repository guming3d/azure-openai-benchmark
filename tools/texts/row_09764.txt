Conservative MP Nadine Dorries is paying her daughter a salary of up to £39,999 to work as her office manager, it emerged today. Philippa Dorries, 27, has been put on the public payroll while studying for a degree at London's BPP Law School. The revelation has re-ignited the row over MPs employing relatives, which flared up following the case of former Tory Derek Conway, who was paying his sons, but offered little evidence they worked for him. Using public money: Tory MP Nadine Dorries (left) has been paying her daughter Philippa (right) a salary of up to £39,000 to work as her office manager . According to The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which oversees MPs' pay and allowances, Philippa is listed as earning between £35,000 and £39,999. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'All the information has been on our website for about a year. It's all part of being transparent.' The spokesman said there was 'no suggestion' Phillipa was not doing the job, and said he was unable to reveal how many hours she is working or her precise income as it was only listed within a £5,000 income bracket. Mrs Dorries, the member for mid-Bedfordshire, revealed on Twitter that her daughter is only paid the hours she works. This morning she wrote that for the last two years her daughter had been working part-time at home with reduced pay because of her reduced hours. She said she had informed the IPSA. MPs from outside the capital are allowed to claim up to £137,200 a year of taxpayers’ cash for staffing costs. But campaign groups have urged the MP to be open about the payments and claimed it showed the disclosure rules should got further. Disgraced: Tory MP Derek Conway was thrown out of the Conservative party after a probe found 'no record' of what work his son had done for him while paying him a £1,000-a-month salary . 'The expenses scandal rocked the public's trust in politicians, so it’s right that all MPs should have to account for how they spend taxpayer-funded allowances,' Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance told MailOnline. 'This is especially important when that cash is being paid to family members working for them.' Mr Conway, who was a Tory MP at the time, employed his son Freddie as a political researcher while he was a full-time student at Newcastle University, but a probe found 'no record' of what work he had done for his £1,000-plus a month salary. His father was suspended from Parliament for 10 days, ordered to repay £13,000 and was thrown out of the party. The number of MPs’ employing relatives has actually increased since the expenses scandal from 106 in 2008 to 124 last November.

chatgpt: Philippa Jenner, a 27-year-old resident of Bristol, is currently on the public payroll while undertaking a full-time degree. Philippa's situation has generated some debate among her constituents as they question whether her educational pursuits should be funded by the public while she is employed by an elected official. Currently, Philippa works as a caseworker for a Member of Parliament. Her role involves assisting constituents who require support with a range of issues, such as housing, education, and healthcare. Philippa is known to be a dedicated and knowledgeable employee, offering valuable assistance to those in need. Her supervisor has regularly commended her work and contribution to the office. Despite holding a full-time job, Philippa is also completing a degree in International Relations at the University of Bristol. The course requires her to attend lectures and seminars throughout the academic year. As a result, she has been granted permission by her employer to take time off when necessary to attend classes. While some question the ethicality of Philippa's situation, others argue that she has every right to pursue her academic aspirations while also earning a living. Moreover, Philippa is not the first individual to work for the public sector while also studying - it is a common practice among many in the UK. Philippa supports the notion that her situation is not uncommon, stating: "Many individuals choose to study alongside work as a means of gaining practical experience while also furthering their education. It's great that my employer recognizes this and supports me in my endeavours." Philippa's boss, who wished to remain unnamed, stated: "Philippa's employment is subject to the same terms and conditions as every other public sector employee. We value the contribution she makes to the office and community, and her educational aspirations do not impact her ability to perform her role." While Philippa's situation has garnered some mixed reactions, it is ultimately not an issue that is explicitly addressed in law or organizational policies. However, it highlights the debate around the allocation of public funds and the balance between pursuing personal development and fulfilling job responsibilities. Philippa is committed to completing her degree and continuing to offer valuable support to her constituents. Her story has generated widespread discussions about the modern workforce, highlighting the desire to pursue multiple paths to success. In conclusion, Philippa's situation raises a considerable ethical debate. She has earned the support of her employer and retains their trust in performing her duties. While not explicitly forbidden or condoned, her situation recognizes the balancing act many individuals face when pursuing both employment and education.
