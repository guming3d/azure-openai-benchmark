article: By . Victoria Woollaston . A bug that leaves email attachments vulnerable to attack has been spotted on Apple’s iOS 7 software. The flaw was discovered by a security expert in Germany and it causes attachments to be sent unencrypted, even if the operating system’s data protection feature is enabled. Apple has acknowledged the bug and said it is working on a fix, but did not reveal how long the bug had been active or when the fix would be issued. Scroll down for video . The bug was discovered by a security expert in Germany.  It causes attachments to be sent unencrypted via the Mail app on iOS 7 devices, pictured. It occurs even if iOS 7's Data Protection feature is enabled. Apple has acknowledged the bug and said it is working on a fix . Data protection is available for devices that offer hardware encryption, including iPhone 3GS and later, all iPad models, as well as the iPod touch from the 3rd generation. The feature was designed to enhance the built-in hardware encryption by protecting the encryption keys with a user’s passcode. According to Apple, this provides an 'additional layer of protection for email messages attachments, and third-party applications'. To enable data protection, go to Settings, General and Passcode. Once a passcode is set, the 'Data protection is enabled' becomes visible. Andreas Kurtz, a researcher for NESO Security Labs in Germany, announced the vulnerability on his blog last week. He wrote: ‘A few weeks ago, I noticed email attachments within the iOS 7 MobileMail.app are not protected by Apple's data protection mechanisms. 'Clearly, this is contrary to Apple's claims that data protection "provides an additional layer of protection for (..) email messages attachments".' He said he verified the issued by restoring an iPhone 4 to the most recent iOS versions; iOS 7.1 and 7.1.1, and setting up an IMAP email account to give him test emails and attachments. By mounting the iOS data partition to a computer, he was able to find the email folder and see all the attachments without any encryption or restriction. The flaw was produced on an iPhone 4, 5S, pictured, and iPad 2 running iOS 7.0.4 to 7.1.1. Despite the flaw, experts have stated it is difficult to exploit because the attacker would need access to the device and need to know the passcode . He was also able to reproduce the flaw on an iPhone 5S and an iPad 2 running iOS 7.0.4. Kurtz confirmed the data protection feature was enabled elsewhere on the phone by attempting, and failing, to access the Protected Index file, in the email message database. In a statement, Apple said: 'We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix which we will deliver in a future software update.' Despite the flaw, experts have stated it is difficult to exploit because the attacker would need access to the device and need to know the passcode.

chatgpt: Reports indicate that a major security flaw has been discovered in Apple's iOS 7 operating system. The bug, which was uncovered by a security expert in Germany, affects certain versions of the iPhone and iPad, causing email attachments to be sent unencrypted. Shockingly, this issue still occurs even when iOS 7’s Data Protection feature is enabled. The bug has been found to affect a number of Apple devices, including the iPhone 4, 5S and iPad 2. It is said to affect devices running iOS 7.0.4 to 7.1.1. This means that millions of people using these devices could be vulnerable to having their email attachments sent unencrypted, potentially compromising their personal and professional information. Apple has acknowledged the bug and confirmed that it is currently working on a fix. The company has yet to release any details on exactly when this update will be available, but it is clear that they are taking the issue seriously. Security experts are urging Apple users to be cautious in the meantime, especially when sending sensitive information via email. They suggest minimizing the use of email altogether or using other more secure channels to transmit data. The discovery of this bug raises serious questions about Apple's security practices, especially considering the company's reputation for being one of the most secure tech companies in the world. While this issue may not affect every Apple user, it does highlight the importance of regularly updating your devices and software. Updates often include security patches that are designed to fix vulnerabilities like these before they can be exploited by cybercriminals. Users should also be careful when using public Wi-Fi networks or when accessing sensitive information on any device. By taking simple steps like using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication, users can greatly reduce their risk of falling victim to cyber threats. Apple has not yet released an official statement about the bug, but it is expected that they will do so soon. In the meantime, users are advised to stay informed and take steps to protect their personal and professional information.
