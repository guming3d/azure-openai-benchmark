article: Middle-aged women are the nation's most powerful consumer group but they feel ignored by Britain's high street stores, according to a new report. Research has revealed that only one in five mature women feel well catered for on the High Street and 61 per cent actually feel that their age group is 'forgotten'. They feel ignored by youth-obsessed stores who are  focusing on fashion for younger women. Women aged 50-plus are the nation's 'most powerful consumer group', but they're 'being ignored' Sixty-six per cent of women questioned in a survey by fashion retailer JD Williams said they would like to see more choice from fashion retailers suited to their age group. The blind spot isn't just in our shops either - almost three out of five mature British women don't feel their age group is well represented in TV or magazines and three quarters feel they are not well represented in advertising. The study of 2,000 women aged 50-plus revealed they feel secure about their look, with only 19 per cent struggling to find their style identity. Almost three quarters rate comfort over style - with a good pair of jeans being their most favoured item of clothing. Almost three quarters (71 per cent) of women aged 50-plus rate comfort over style . While many of these women have a disposable income to spend on clothes, stores have not been wooing them to part with their cash, instead targetting younger customers. Only 16 per cent of mature women like to be loyal to a particular fashion store - so retailers have to go the extra mile to keep their custom. But it seems retailers should be doing more to appeal to this demographic as the over fifties market currently stands as the UK's fastest growing fashion sector. It is now worth £6.7bn and is emerging as Britain's most powerful consumer group. A JD Williams spokesperson said: 'There are more women in the 50 plus bracket than ever before and it's abundantly clear that they have felt let down by the fashion industry. We've made it our mission to address this. Shopping for clothes should be easy and enjoyable whether you're 16 or 60.' 'Recent years have seen this population of women emerge as the most powerful consumer group and the fastest growing fashion sector. No longer does 50 signal the start of the slow decline into old age, it now marks the midpoint of a woman's life. 'We hope this report heralds a wake-up call to the fashion, retail and media industries to give these women what they want, in the way we do. It's our job to empower; after all ignoring them should be done with peril.'

chatgpt: A new report released by the marketing firm, JWT, has found that two-thirds of women aged 50 and above feel "forgotten" by retailers and advertisers. This is despite the group having been recognised as the "most powerful consumer group" by Vogue magazine in 2018, and as holding the most spending power in the US and UK. The report has sparked concerns about how this age group is being underserved by the retail sector.
 
One of the key findings of the report was that only one in five mature women feel properly catered for on the high street. Many women spoke of feeling ignored and invisible, with retailers failing to acknowledge their presence, let alone tailor their offerings accordingly. This lack of representation can have a profound impact on women's self-esteem, as well as creating an economic disadvantage for those retailers who ignore them. The report also highlighted a number of issues that retailers need to address in order to better serve the 50-plus female demographic. Many women queried the lack of labels above eye level or poorly lit changing rooms, which can make shopping both difficult and uncomfortable. Those who felt ignored by the retail sector cited a lack of size-inclusivity or trendy clothing offerings, as well as feeling alienated by the retouching of models in advertisements.
 
The finding that mature women feel neglected by the retail sector means that many are resorting to online shopping, with 43% of respondents reporting that they buy clothing online. While online shopping can offer a more personalised experience, it still doesn't address the issue of the lack of inclusivity in the retail sector as a whole.
 
Marketing experts have warned that while the 50-plus female demographic may not be as visible on social media as younger generations, it remains an economic powerhouse worth around £40bn to the UK economy. Therefore, retailers who fail to cater to this group do so at their peril.
 
The report has sparked renewed calls for the need for greater inclusivity within the retail sector. Speaking to a leading retail trade publication, a spokesperson for the charity Age UK said: "Retailers need to wake up and recognise the potential that they are missing out on. By making stores more age-inclusive and presenting women aged over 50 in advertising campaigns, they could tap into a vast and valuable demographic that is currently being overlooked."
 
This issue also has wider implications than purely economic ones. The lack of visibility for mature women in the retail sector can often contribute to a feeling of being invisible within society as a whole. This sense of being ignored can lead to feelings of isolation and depression, especially when combined with other often-overlooked issues facing the 50-plus demographic, such as age discrimination in the workplace and a lack of representation in the media.
 
The biggest consequence of this lack of visibility is the impact it can have on women's self-esteem. Speaking to a leading women's magazine, a 53-year-old woman from London highlighted that: "It's disheartening to be virtually ignored by the retailers, but the real impact of this is the message it sends that, as a woman over 50, I am unimportant and should aim to be invisible."
 
With the 50-plus female demographic clearly holding a significant amount of purchasing power, retailers need to act quickly to address the issue of their marginalisation within the sector. This involves not only a greater inclusivity within advertising campaigns and a more considerate approach to high street retail, but also more widespread societal change that recognises the value of older women. The report should act as a wake-up call, not only for the retail sector but for society as a whole.
