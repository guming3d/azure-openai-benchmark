Chicken nuggets are definitely made of chicken - just maybe not the parts you want to eat. Researchers in Mississippi conducted an 'autopsy' of chicken nuggets from two fast food chains in Jackson and confirmed what we all suspected about the mystery-meat medallions: they aren't too meaty. The first chicken nugget tested was made up of about 50 per cent muscle tissue from the breast or thigh and the rest was made up of unpalatable parts: fat, blood vessels, and nerves. What's in a nugget? Researchers in Mississippi examined two fast-food chains' chicken nuggets and found that half or less than half of the nuggets were made of meat. The rest was made of high-fat chicken parts . The second chicken nugget was even worse with out 40 per cent muscle, with the rest being made up of fat cartilage and bone. The researchers decided not to name the fast food chains. Dr Richard D deShazo, the study's lead researcher, encourages his patients to eat white chicken meat and while chicken nuggets may look white on the inside, looks can be deceiving. 'What has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low-fat chicken white meat, batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken,' Dr deShazo told Reuters. 'It is really a chicken by-product high in calories, salt, sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice. Even worse, it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them.' While it's OK to indulge in the junk food every so often, the problem for deShazo is that some people eat them multiple times a week. Don't make it a habit: Dr deShazo, the lead researcher of the study, said it's OK to eat chicken nuggets every once in a while but he's concerned for the people who eat them multiple times a week . Ashley Peterson, a representative of the National Chicken Council, a non-profit trade group which represents the U.S. chicken industry, argued that consumers weren't being mislead. She pointed out that nutritional information for most fast food chains is available online, and that anything for sale at the grocery store has a list of ingredients. 'Chicken nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded and fried. But it's no secret what is in a chicken nugget,' she said.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by researchers in Mississippi has revealed some startling findings about the contents of chicken nuggets served at popular fast food chains. The research team examined nuggets from two different chains and found that only about half of the nuggets were made up of muscle meat while the rest were composed of other chicken parts including fat, blood vessels, nerves, bones, and cartilage. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Medicine, analyzed samples from a total of 10 chicken nuggets obtained from two unnamed fast food chains. The nuggets were dissected and analyzed under a microscope to determine their composition. The researchers found that on average, 50% of the nuggets were made up of muscle tissue, while the other 50% consisted of what they referred to as "non-muscle" tissue. This non-muscle tissue included a variety of chicken parts, some of which may be considered less desirable, such as fat, blood vessels, nerves, bones, and cartilage. While some may find these findings concerning, others have criticized the study for its small sample size and lack of specific information about the tested nuggets. In response to the study, a representative for the National Chicken Council noted that it should come as no surprise what the ingredients of chicken nuggets are, as this information is often readily available online or on the packaging. Still, the study raises questions about the quality and nutritional value of the processed chicken products that are widely consumed in the United States. Chicken nuggets and other similar products are often marketed to children as a convenient and tasty option, but may contain high amounts of salt, fat, and calories. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the use of antibiotics in the poultry industry, particularly in the processing of chicken products. Some studies have suggested that consuming chicken treated with antibiotics may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans. As more consumers become aware of these issues, there has been a trend toward more natural and organic chicken products. Some fast food chains have responded by offering antibiotic-free chicken or other healthier options on their menus. Overall, the Mississippi study serves as a reminder that fast food products may not always be what they seem. Consumers are encouraged to read nutrition labels and make informed choices about the foods they eat, particularly when it comes to processed and animal-based products.
