article: (CNN) -- China reassured its neighbors Sunday that it will maintain "peace and stability" in the turbulent South China Sea, a day after the U.S. renewed concerns over territorial disputes. Defense Minister Gen. Liang Guanglie said China was keeping its agreements to the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes. However, Liang underscored the "freedom of navigation and overflight" in the South China Sea. Chinese military has been accused of harassment in the waters recently. The area rich in oil deposits is rife with territorial disputes with claims by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. It's considered to be one of Asia's more dangerous potential flashpoints. Liang said China is no threat to world peace, noting its military policy is purely defensive. "To judge whether a country is a threat to world peace," he said, "the key is not to look at how strong its economy or military is, but the policy it pursues." He sought to relieve concerns about China's modernization of its powerful military, saying "no matter how developed it may be, China will never seek hegemony or military expansion." Vietnamese defense minister, Gen. Phung Quang Thanh, reiterated calls for the conclusion of a code of conduct between the regional organization ASEAN and China to help restrain disputes in the South China Sea. In his speech, Thanh recounted a May 26 incident when surveying cables of a Vietnamese oil exploration vessel were cut. Vietnam has handled the incident with "patience," he said, adding that they "expect no repetition of similar incidents." Philippine President Benigno Aquino said last month that the disputes in the South China Sea could spur a regional arms race. The Philippines accused China of intimidation in disputed oil-rich Spratly islands in the South China Sea, where its oil exploration ship was confronted by Chinese ships in March. The U.S has expressed concern about the potential for clashes in the region. In 2010, China was angered when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for peaceful resolution of the competing claims, saying it was in the U.S. "national interest." U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Saturday warned that clashes could occur in the sea if nations do not agree on ways to deal with disputes.

chatgpt: China's Defense Minister, Wei Fenghe, affirmed the nation's commitment to resolving territorial disputes in the contested South China Sea through peaceful means. In a joint news conference with his Philippine counterpart, Delfin Lorenzana on Tuesday, Wei stated that China has been upholding its agreements to resolve the disputes in a peaceful manner in the region. The South China Sea is vital for trade and commerce, and it is estimated that it is home to around 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. However, the region has been rife with diplomatic and territorial disputes, with China claiming a vast portion of the sea as its territory, while other nations such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei also have overlapping claims. China has been accused of militarizing the South China Sea by building artificial islands and deploying military assets, including anti-ship missiles, radar systems, and fighter jets. However, the Chinese government has repeatedly denied the accusations and insisted that it is acting defensively and does not intend to threaten any other countries' sovereignty. Aside from the militarization issue, China has also faced accusations of harassment in the South China Sea. Other nations have repeatedly alleged that Chinese vessels are trying to block other countries' access to their exclusive economic zones, causing friction between the involved countries. Wei acknowledged the concerns and stated that the Chinese military is abiding by the international law and will not use force unless provoked. He emphasized that both China and the Philippines, who have had disputes over the region, have agreed to exercise maximum restraint and pursue tranquil methods of resolution. Lorenzana, for his part, acknowledged that the relationship between the Philippines and China has been improving, despite some past disagreements over the disputed territory. He expressed confidence that the two countries could further strengthen the relations and expressed his support for a peaceful resolution to the territorial disputes. In conclusion, China's Defense Minister reiterated that the nation is committed to achieving a peaceful resolution in the South China Sea disputes. While the area remains riddled with territorial disagreements and disputes, both China and the Philippines have expressed their willingness to pursue peaceful means of resolution. It is hoped that all parties involved will continue to work together towards finding a peaceful and amicable solution to the South China Sea tensions.
