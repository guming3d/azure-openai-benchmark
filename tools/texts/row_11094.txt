The incident, which occurred on Monday, left the child in distress and the school authorities immediately took action to prevent any such incidents from happening again. Castle View School has decided to serve only square-shaped flapjacks in the future, in a bid to prevent any further accidents. The decision has been taken after staff members expressed concern over the safety of the students during lunchtime. Speaking about the incident, a spokesperson for the school said, "We take the safety of our students very seriously and we are doing everything we can to ensure their well-being. As a result of this incident, we have decided to only serve square-shaped flapjacks to prevent any similar accidents from occurring in the future." The decision has received mixed reactions from parents and students. Some parents have expressed their support for the decision, stating that safety should always be a top priority. They have also applauded the school authorities for taking swift action to address the issue. "I think it's great that the school is taking the safety of our children seriously," said one parent. "Accidents happen and it's important that the school takes steps to prevent them." However, some students have expressed disappointment at the decision, stating that the square-shaped flapjacks are not as tasty as the original ones. "It's a shame that we won't be able to enjoy the round-shaped flapjacks anymore," said a student. "But I understand that safety is important and the school is doing what it can to keep us safe." The incident has also raised concerns among other schools, with some considering serving only square-shaped flapjacks in the future.
