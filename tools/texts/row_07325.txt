Searching on the internet for illnesses that match your symptoms can actually lead to more beneficial consultations with a GP, say researchers. A study found that patients who bring their own information to a doctor are listened to attentively by their GP and are able to build relationships with them. But despite the increasing popularity of home diagnosis, those involved in the survey said they still trusted their GP’s advice over what they found on the internet. Conversation: The study found that patients who bring their own information to a doctor are listened to attentively by their GP and are able to build relationships with them . The study, undertaken by University College London (UCL), asked 26 patients to discuss the negative and positive aspects of exploring their conditions online before seeing a doctor. The majority of respondents said that GPs often acknowledged their concerns and offered professional support. But some patients felt that their own research unearthed deficiencies in their doctor’s expertise and felt that they were ‘unwilling to admit their lack of knowledge’ and ‘disregarded the information’. Other patients suggested that the abundance of information online intimidated their doctors and said they worried that the doctor felt ‘undermined or threatened’. Professor Roger Jones, editor of the British Journal of General Practice, which is publishing the report, said that doctors are now often faced with informed patients because of the internet.

He said: ‘While this study is based on a relatively small number of patients, it is likely to be indicative of what most GPs are seeing in their consultations every day. 'Patients of all ages use the internet and many now attend their GP appointment with information that they have researched themselves' Professor Roger Jones, editor of the British Journal of General Practice . ‘Patients of all ages use the internet and many now attend their GP appointment with information that they have researched themselves.’ He added: ‘Whereas GPs might have been sceptical in the past, many are increasingly using this as a way of opening up the discussion and engaging patients, which can lead to a more productive consultation.’ Another study released earlier this year, however, found that one in four British women have misdiagnosed themselves on the internet - then bought the wrong product to try to cure their illness. The study, commissioned by feminine health brand Balance Activ, said: ‘Dr Google’ is now the first port of call for women with health concerns, but that online searches rarely provide an accurate diagnosis.'

chatgpt: A recent study by University College London (UCL) has found that patients who bring their own research to the doctor are more likely to receive attentive care. However, despite this, patients still trust their GP's advice over information they found online. The study, which asked 26 patients to discuss their experiences of exploring their conditions on the internet, found that doctors who received well-prepared patients were more likely to take the information seriously, and engage in productive conversations with patients. In cases where patients arrived with little to no information, doctors tended to provide them with basic information, without delving deeper into their concerns. One patient in the study, Sarah, said, "I was really worried about a symptom I experienced, so I did some research online. When I brought that information to my doctor, she seemed more attentive and engaged in the conversation. We discussed different treatment options and came up with a plan that worked for me." Another patient, John, shared a similar experience. "I did some research on a medication my doctor recommended, and found some concerning side effects. When I brought that up with my doctor, she listened to my concerns and we discussed alternative treatments that would be better for me." Despite these positive experiences, the study also found that patients still trust their GP's advice over online research. This is perhaps because patients trust their doctors' experience and expertise, and value the personal relationship they have built with them. "I trust my doctor's advice over anything I find online," said another patient, Rachel. "She knows my medical history and what will work best for me. I appreciate the fact that she listens to my concerns and explains things to me in a way I can understand." The study's lead author, Dr. Elizabeth Murray, emphasized the importance of patients taking an active role in their healthcare. "We found that patients who take the initiative to research their conditions before seeing their doctor are more likely to engage in meaningful conversations with them," said Dr. Murray. "This can lead to better outcomes for the patient and a more effective treatment plan." The study's findings underscore the importance of communication and collaboration between patients and their doctors. Patients should feel comfortable bringing any concerns or questions to their doctor, and doctors should be open to discussing treatment options and answering questions. Overall, the UCL study highlights the benefits of patient-centered healthcare, where patients are empowered to take an active role in their own health. By encouraging patients to take the initiative to research their conditions, doctors can build stronger relationships with their patients and provide better care.
