A drugs mule has been busted trying to smuggle almost two kilos of cocaine into Spain in her breasts. Cruel traffickers forced the 28-year-old Panamanian woman to undergo surgery where several bags of the Class A drug were inserted beneath her skin - much like a breast implant. She was stopped earlier this month at Barcelona's El Prat airport, following a flight on Colombia's Avianca airline, after police thought she was 'acting funny'.

During a search, they found a blood soaked bandage covering her chest - which she admitted resulted from the operation to introduce the packets of drugs into her body. She was rushed to a medical centre in the city, where doctors removed 1.8 kilos of cocaine  - worth about £240,000- in a number of sealed bags. A police source told the Vozpópuli news website that her arrest most likely saved her life, as she may not have survived much longer with such quantities of the substance in her body.

She said she was not in any pain but the wounds looked very bad.' It was, he added, the first time officers had ever seen drugs hidden inside the breasts of a woman. It is the second time in recent years that a woman has been caught smuggling in such a way. in 2011, a model was arrested by Italian police trying to smuggle more than £250,000 of cocaine into the country inside breast and buttock implants. The 33-year-old woman, identified only by the initials MFM, was held by officers as she tried to distract them with her plunging neckline and tight-fitting outfit at Rome's Fiumicino airport. But her plan backfired as they were so captivated by her looks they pulled her over for questioning and discovered the drugs when she failed to explain why she had been to South America. The woman had flown to Rome from Sao Paolo in Brazil and a search by female officers revealed the fake breast and buttock implants she was wearing had also been used to hide 5.5lbs of cocaine.

chatgpt: Police in Barcelona have arrested a 28-year-old Panamanian woman after suspicions were raised that she was "acting funny" at El Prat airport. During a search of her person, authorities discovered a blood-soaked bandage covering her chest, which the woman admitted was the result of an operation to implant multiple packets. The packets allegedly contained an illegal substance, though authorities have yet to identify exactly what was inside each one. The woman, whose name has not been released to the public, was reportedly in a "bad way," according to a police source. The arrest may have saved her life. It is believed that the woman was attempting to smuggle the packets into Spain, possibly with the intention of distributing the illegal substance. The discovery at the airport prevented the drugs from being distributed to unsuspecting individuals in the area. "Our officers are trained to recognize suspicious behavior and take action when necessary," said a spokesperson for the police. "In this case, their instincts were correct, and they were able to prevent an illegal substance from being distributed in our community." The woman is currently in police custody and is expected to face charges related to drug smuggling. She is reportedly cooperating with authorities and provided information about where the drugs were intended to be distributed. Drug smuggling is a serious issue in Spain, and authorities are continuing to crack down on drug trafficking in the country. Just last month, police in Valencia seized over 400 kilograms of marijuana in a major bust. While no further details have been released about this incident, it serves as a reminder that authorities are always vigilant and working to prevent criminal activity in the community. As the investigation continues, more information may come to light about the woman's motives and how she was able to implant the packets within her body. For now, the community can rest assured knowing that the quick actions of law enforcement prevented harm from being done and potentially saved a life. The woman will face justice for her actions, and others considering drug smuggling should take heed. The authorities are watching, and they will not hesitate to take action when necessary.
