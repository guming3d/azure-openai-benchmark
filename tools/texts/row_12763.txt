article: Thinking about making a film? Better leave out the foul language if you want it to be seen in Russia. The same goes for plays. Even rock stars will need to leave their potty mouths at home. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off on a new law Monday that bans swearing at arts, cultural and entertainment events in the country. Any new film containing obscene language won't be granted a distribution certificate, so there's no chance of seeing it at the movie theater. And copies of books, CDs or films containing swearing can only be distributed in a sealed package labeled "Contains obscene language," a Kremlin statement said. According to state news agency ITAR-Tass, individuals caught using foul language face a fine of up to $70, while officials can be fined up to $40 and businesses nearly $1,400. They face a higher fine and a three-month suspension of business for repeated offenses. Determination of what counts as profane language will be done through "an independent examination," the news agency said. According to the Kremlin, the legislation "bans the use of obscene language when ensuring the rights of Russian citizens to the use of the state language, and protecting and developing language culture." The law could come into effect as soon as July 1, ITAR-Tass said, but it doesn't apply to cultural and artistic works  that have already been issued. While some may hail attempts to clean up the nation's language, it will likely be seen by critics as the latest step under Putin's leadership to limit freedom of expression and promote a conservative, nationalist viewpoint. A report by rights group Amnesty International in January highlighted a denial of "basic freedoms" in Russia, which last year introduced a law barring anyone from talking positively about homosexuality in earshot of minors.

chatgpt: Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed off on a new law which will ban swearing in music, film, and books. The controversial legislation imposes a fine on individuals and businesses that use foul language in public places and in the media. This law is part of Putin's ongoing campaign to promote traditional Russian values and to curb what he sees as the growing influence of Western culture in his country. The new law comes into force on July 1st and includes a wide range of restrictions on the use of foul language in public. It covers live performances, including plays and concerts, and from now on, performers will face fines if they use inappropriate language on stage. The Russian government has also announced that new films containing swear words will not receive a distribution certificate, which means they will not be shown in cinemas. The legislation has caused controversy amongst free speech campaigners who claim it is a violation of the right to free expression. However, supporters of the law argue that it is necessary to promote respect and dignity in society and protect children from the negative influence of strong language. The implementation of the law has not been without difficulties. Many have questioned who will monitor the use of offensive language and how offenders will be identified. Critics also claim that the law is vague, leaving room for interpretation and abuse. Despite these concerns, Putin has remained steadfast in his support for the law. In a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin said: "Respect for each other and respect for ourselves are our foundation. Our language has always been one of our main national treasures," adding that "people should have the right to choose what they want to read or watch, but children should not be exposed to vulgar language." The new legislation is part of a wider cultural campaign by the Russian government to promote traditional values and reduce the influence of Western culture. Putin has previously spoken out against what he sees as the erosion of traditional morality in Russia and has called for a return to the country's Christian roots. Overall, the new law banning swearing in music, films, and books is part of a wider trend towards promoting traditional values in Russia. While some critics have raised concerns about free speech, supporters argue that the law is necessary to promote respect and dignity in society. The implementation of the law will undoubtedly be closely watched both in Russia and around the world.
