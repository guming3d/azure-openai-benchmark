chatgpt: Crown Resorts, the Australian gaming and entertainment group, has been hit hard by the recent success of high-rolling punters, with losses of $100 million in just four months. The company's CEO, James Packer, has warned shareholders that the VIPs are "killing us". Speaking at the annual general meeting, Packer said that Crown's Melbourne, Perth and Macau venues were all experiencing "weaker" economic conditions, with a significant decline in revenues from the high-roller segment. The decline in profits has been attributed to a sharp increase in competition from other gaming destinations, such as Las Vegas and Singapore, as well as tighter regulation in China. Packer acknowledged that the company had made mistakes in managing its VIP program, and that it had become too reliant on a handful of high-rolling punters. "The VIP market is volatile, and we should have been more prepared for the current downturn," he said. "We need to diversify our revenue streams and be more innovative in our approach to attracting customers." He also revealed that Crown was exploring new opportunities in non-gaming sectors, such as hotels and retail, in a bid to boost revenues and reduce reliance on the volatile VIP market. Despite the recent setbacks, Packer remains optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, citing Crown's strong brand and reputation for luxury as key competitive advantages. "We have a fantastic product, and we will continue to invest in our venues and our people to ensure that we remain at the forefront of the gaming and entertainment industry," he said. The AGM was attended by a significant number of shareholders, many of whom expressed concern about the company's recent performance. Packer acknowledged their concerns, but emphasized that the company was taking steps to address the challenges it faced. "We have a clear strategy for the future, and we are confident that, with the support of our shareholders, we can overcome the current difficulties and continue to grow and prosper in the years ahead," he said. Despite the challenges facing Crown Resorts, the company remains one of Australia's leading gaming and entertainment companies, with a strong brand and a loyal customer base. With a renewed focus on diversification and innovation, it is well positioned to navigate the challenging economic conditions and emerge stronger and more resilient in the years ahead.
