During the Cold War itself, MPs, army officials, the RAF and local police were among those who would use the underground complex to run exercises in case Britain was attacked. In the late 1980s the government extensively renovated the bunkers at a cost of around £1,000,000, but as the Cold War ended in the early 1990s the site was eventually sold off. Once the site was privately sold, plans emerged to turn it into a residential and commercial park.

chatgpt: The historic Drakelow Tunnels, built during World War II and later used as hideouts during the Cold War, are now set to be opened to the public after undergoing a £1 million renovation in the 1980s. The site, covering a staggering 265,000 square feet, was almost demolished after the Cold War ended. However, its historical significance has saved it from destruction and now it will be open for visitors to experience. The tunnels were originally built in 1941 as a shadow factory, producing aircraft parts for the war effort. Later, they were transformed into a Cold War hideout, where British government officials and military personnel could work without fear of nuclear attacks or aerial bombings. After the Cold War ended, the tunnels were almost demolished. However, a group of enthusiasts and historians spearheaded a campaign to save the complex. A £1 million renovation in the 1980s ensured that the tunnels remained intact and were in good enough shape to eventually be used as a tourist attraction. A spokesperson for the Drakelow Tunnels said that the site is a "unique experience, combining history, education, and cold war intrigue". Visitors will be able to see the original machinery used for aircraft manufacturing during the World War II era, as well as the office spaces and living quarters used by officials during the tense Cold War period.  The tunnels are also home to eerie legends, such as the apparition of a ghostly figure who was reportedly seen walking around the area. Some visitors have also experienced a haunting feeling as they make their way through the tunnels, which only adds to the site's mystique and intrigue. With the opening of the tunnels to the public, visitors from around the world will have the opportunity to experience a unique piece of history up close. The site is a reminder of the dark days of the past and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.  The Drakelow Tunnels will be open to the public from Monday to Saturday during certain hours. Tickets can be purchased at the site's entrance or online. Visitors are encouraged to explore the tunnels at their own pace, taking in the fascinating history and uncovering the secrets of one of the UK's most intriguing historical sites.
