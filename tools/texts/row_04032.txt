article: The FA are considering bidding to host the European Championships in 2028, which would be the first campaign to stage a major football tournament since the 2018 World Cup vote fiasco. FA general secretary Alex Horne, who revealed the FA's ambition in Monaco on Thursday morning to dip their toes back in the murky bidding waters, has no fears that staging the climax to Euro 2020 would impact on England's chances. The final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 are heading for Wembley with England overwhelming favourites to be allocated the showcase tournament games by UEFA in Geneva on September 18.

But Germany also have strong ambitions to host Euro 2024 and are still considering whether to pull out of 2020 final consideration in order to concentrate on their hosting blueprint for four years later leaving England in pole position. Horne said: 'We're really confident with our bid. We know what the Germans have been saying. We know that they're thinking about 2024, but nothing has been confirmed. 'I'm not going to dwell on their politics. I'm expecting that they're not going to push very hard for 2020. They've made it very clear they want 2024.' And Horne added: 'I wouldn't rule out looking at Euro 2028 for a full tournament bid.' German football chief Wolfgang Niersbach said: 'We still have the two options, to host the final rounds or four matches in the group stage. Our decision is open. We have a wonderful relationship with the England FA, but I am totally convinced that we will have both Wembley and Munich on the land map for Euro 2020.' Scotland, especially after the feelgood factor from the Commonwealth Games, as well as Wales and Ireland are also hopeful of being allocated group matches. Winners!

chatgpt: Wembley Stadium, the hallowed ground of English football, has emerged as the clear favorite to host the entirety of the European Championships in 2028. The tournament is one of the most prestigious and eagerly anticipated events in international football and would be a massive boost for sport in the UK.  The Football Association is spearheading the bid to host the tournament and has already started preparation work. The governing body is hopeful that its bid will be successful as England has a rich footballing heritage and Wembley is one of the most iconic stadiums in the world. Hosting the tournament would be a major boost for the country and would help to boost tourism and the economy. The European Championships take place every four years, and the 2028 tournament is set to feature 24 teams from across Europe. The tournament is notorious for its fiercely competitive matches and nail-biting finishes, and it is sure to be no different in 2028. However, the world champions, Germany, are expected to provide the sternest competition. The German national team has a storied history in international football, and they are one of the most successful teams in the history of the European Championships. They have won the tournament three times and have finished runners-up on three other occasions. The team is known for its attacking flair and solid defence, and they are sure to pose a significant challenge to any team they face. Should Wembley be successful in its bid to host the entire tournament, it would be a significant milestone for English and European football. England has been the host nation of the tournament twice before, in 1966 and 1996, and both times it was a resounding success. However, hosting the entire tournament would take the event to another level and would be a major test for the FA and Wembley. Wembley Stadium has been home to some of the most iconic football matches in history, including the 1966 World Cup final and the 2011 Champions League final. The FA has invested heavily in the stadium in recent years, and it now boasts world-class facilities and state-of-the-art technology. The stadium has also hosted major concerts and events, further cementing its status as one of the premier entertainment venues in the world. Football fans across the UK are eagerly anticipating the outcome of the bid, and there is a sense of excitement and anticipation in the air. If the bid is successful, it would be a major boost for sport in the country and would help to cement Wembley's reputation as one of the premier stadiums in the world. The FA is already hard at work preparing the bid, and the hopes of the nation are behind them.
