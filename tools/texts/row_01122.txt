article: (CNN) -- A Missouri man was sentenced on Wednesday to 20 years in federal prison for his role in the years-long sexual torture of a "mentally deficient" young woman that included electrical shock and mutilation, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri told CNN. A federal judge accepted a plea agreement from Edward Bagley Sr., 46, in a Kansas City courtroom on Wednesday morning, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. In January, he pleaded guilty to one of the 11 counts he faced for having a sexual relationship with a minor, who was identified only by the initials "FV" (or Female Victim) in official documents. Bagley faced life imprisonment. Bagley held the victim as a sex slave from December 2002 to February 27, 2009, in his Lebanon, Missouri, trailer home. The woman -- who was a runaway minor at the time when the abuse began -- was sometimes "hung upside down," "water boarded" and had animals she cared for shot in front of her by Bagley to coerce her to engage in commercial sex acts, the indictment read. "In or about December 2002, (Bagley) invited FV, a 16-year-old minor, who grew up in foster care homes, into his residence after she ran away from home and promised her 'a great life,' including, but not limited to, making her a model and a dancer, and 'making her dreams come true,'" the indictment read. "(Bagley) advertised and publicized FV over the Internet and in live web cam sessions as his slave who would engage in sexual acts and could be tortured during live online sessions, or in person," an indictment read. Once the victim turned 18, Bagley had "FV sign a 'sex slavery' contract" and told her the contract "legally bound her to him as his 'sex slave' with a term that 'never' ended," according to the indictment. During the six years of abuse, Bagley also performed abortions on the victim using things like "vacuums, and clothing hangers for the purpose of terminating the pregnancies," the indictment said. The victim was discovered by first responders after she suffered cardiac arrest during a torture session on February 27, 2009, the indictment read. Five other defendants, including four men and Bagley's wife, Marilyn Bagley, are scheduled to be sentenced this week. The four men were alleged to have traded Bagley things like "cigarettes, computer hard drives, sadomasochism videos, coats and meats" to use the young woman as a sex slave, according to the indictment. The U.S. Attorney's Office said that lawyers for the victim were seeking $738,250 for physical and psychological trauma to their client.

chatgpt: Edward Bagley Sr. has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of keeping a mentally disabled woman as a sex slave for six years. The victim, who had run away from her family, was just 16 years old when she fell prey to Bagley's manipulation. According to court documents, Bagley subjected the young woman to horrific torture, including hanging her upside down from a rafter for extended periods of time. On one occasion, Bagley and two other men even branded the victim's hip with a hot iron. The abuse continued for six years before the authorities were notified. The victim was discovered by police and paramedics in Bagley's Missouri home, where she was in cardiac arrest following a brutal session of torture. She was rushed to the hospital but did not survive. In the trial, the victim's family described Bagley as a "monster" who had robbed their daughter of her life. They urged the court to impose the maximum sentence possible, arguing that Bagley had shown no remorse for his actions. Bagley's wife, Marilyn Bagley, was also found guilty of sexual abuse and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Four other men, Gregory Harper, Michael Stokes, Dennis Henry, and James Noel, were also charged in connection with the case. During the trial, it was revealed that Bagley and his co-defendants had used drugs and other means of coercion to force the victim into submission. The victim was subjected to regular beatings and sexual abuse by all of the defendants. The case has led to calls for greater protection for vulnerable individuals, particularly those with mental disabilities. According to experts, this kind of abuse is all too common, and more needs to be done to prevent it. The sentencing of Bagley and his co-defendants has been welcomed by victims' rights advocates. "This case is a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for those who cannot stand up for themselves," said one activist. "We must continue to fight for justice for victims of sexual abuse and ensure that those who perpetrate these heinous crimes are held accountable for their actions."  In conclusion, the verdict and sentence of Edward Bagley Sr. and associates should serve as a warning to others who prey on vulnerable individuals for their own gratification. Let us also not forget the importance of protecting those who are unable to protect themselves.
