Workers at Poundland have slammed their Christmas bonus as 'miserly' after bosses offered them a 10 per cent store discount. The offer gives them just 10p off each item at the bargain chain. But remarkably it excludes festive treats such as fizzy drinks and chocolate - and expires on January 7. 'Miserly' offer: Workers at Poundland have slammed their Christmas bonus of a 10 per cent store discount . In contrast, staff at other major retailers, such as BHS and Marks & Spencer, are granted a 20 per cent discount throughout the year. It comes after Poundland celebrated the opening its 500th store last month - with annual gross revenues of nearly Â£1billion. Europe's biggest single-price value retailer has seen sales surge by 15 per cent in the last year alone as cash-strapped shoppers seek out bargains on the high street. Bosses say they plan to more than double the number of UK stores to over 1,000 - with at least 50 earmarked for next year. Issue: Rob Johnston, of the TUC (pictured), said the bonus was indicative of a wider problem in the economy . More than 12,000 Poundland workers were informed about their Christmas bonus by letter. One employee - who does not wish to be named - said: 'It is totally disrespectful - a slap in the face for staff who . have been coming in day in day out. 'A lot of people just ripped the letter up and put it in the bin. 'Poundland has just opened its 500th store and is one of the biggest shops in England. It is disgraceful.' The TUC's Rob Johnston said the bonus was indicative of a wider problem in the economy. 'While the Government is talking about recovery, working people aren't seeing the benefits,' he said. 'In the run-up to Christmas, the least you can expect is for companies to reward staff and stop being miserly. 'This . is not an isolated case and is indicative of a broader problem of the . economy turning a corner, but workers not getting the benefit.' However, a Poundland spokesman defended the bonus - claiming it would help make the festive season 'even more affordable'. He . said: 'To recognise the hard work and dedication of over 12,000 . colleagues throughout the year and particularly during our busy festive . period, Poundland is pleased to confirm that it has introduced a 10 per . cent discount for employees across the business, to help make Christmas . even more affordable.'

chatgpt: Christmas may be a time of giving and joy, but that doesn't seem to be the case for Poundland workers. The UK's bargain chain has recently come under fire for its holiday offer, which only gives employees a measly 10p off each item. What's more, the offer excludes festive treats such as fizzy drinks and chocolate, leading some to question the company's motives. Despite the backlash, Poundland has reason to celebrate this holiday season. The discount retailer has just opened its 500th store to record sales. The milestone comes as the latest in a series of successes for the brand, which has seen steady growth in recent years. However, some are questioning whether this growth has come at the expense of its workforce. Critics argue that the company's holiday offer is emblematic of a larger problem within the retail industry, in which workers are often underpaid and undervalued. In response to the criticism, a spokesperson for Poundland defended the company's policies, stating that the holiday offer was "just one aspect of the wider benefits package" and that it was "intended as a small thank you to our colleagues for their hard work throughout the year." Despite these assurances, many remain unconvinced. The offer has sparked renewed debate over the need for fair compensation and adequate benefits for retail workers, particularly during the holiday season. For its part, Poundland seems committed to further expansion and growth. The company recently announced plans to open an additional 20 stores across the UK in the coming year, building on the momentum of its recent success. Whether this growth will come at the expense of its workforce remains to be seen. However, it's clear that the spotlight is now shining on the retail industry, and the treatment of its workers will be a key issue going forward. In the meantime, customers and critics alike will be watching to see how Poundland responds to the backlash over its underwhelming holiday offer. Will the company step up and offer more meaningful rewards for its employees, or will it continue to prioritize profits over people? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the holiday season may be a time of giving, but for some retail workers, it's still a time of struggle and uncertainty. As consumers, it's up to us to demand better treatment and fair compensation for all those who make our holiday shopping experiences possible.
