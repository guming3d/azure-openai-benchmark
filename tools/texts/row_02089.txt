article: (CNN) -- The Vatican on Monday recalled its envoy to Ireland in the wake of a blistering report accusing church leaders of covering up extensive abuse of young people by priests. Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza was recalled to Rome "for consultations with the (Vatican) Secretariat of State," the official Vatican Information Service said in citing a statement from the Roman Catholic Church's leadership. The move came in reaction to this month's release of the Cloyne report about "allegations of abuse of minors by clergy ... and, in particular, in the wake of subsequent reactions." Released July 13, the 421-page report into abuses in the diocese of Cloyne -- near the southern city of Cork -- demolished claims by the Catholic Church in Ireland that policies it put in place in 1996 had enabled it to get a handle on the problem. It details how complaints against 19 clerics in the diocese were dealt with between 1996 and 2009. It also accused Bishop John Magee, who was responsible for policing abuse in his diocese, of not backing the policy himself and failing to take action against abusers. The Vatican last week had promised action, with the Rev. Federico Lombardi, director of the Holy See press office, saying in a statement the church "will respond appropriately." He added the Vatican's aim is to promote the protection of children and restore "an atmosphere of trust and collaboration in the Church and in society." His comments came days after Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny launched a stinging attack. He claimed that the Cloyne report exposed the Vatican as seeking to frustrate an inquiry into child sex abuse for its own benefit, even after the scandal blew up worldwide. On listening to the evidence of humiliation and betrayal, Kenny said, "The Vatican's reaction was to parse and analyze it with the gimlet eye of a canon lawyer ... this calculated, withering position being the polar opposite of the radicalism, humility and compassion upon which the Roman Church was founded." The report exposed "a tale of a frankly brazen disregard for protecting children," the prime minister added, as he praised the courage of the victims of abuse who had spoken out to investigators. Lombardi responded in a statement saying some criticisms of the Vatican went too far and "demonstrate little awareness of what the Holy See has actually done over the years to help effectively address the problem." One point of contention is a 1997 letter from the Vatican's envoy to Ireland that warns bishops to follow church law while investigating cases of suspected child sex abuse by priests. The envoy expresses "serious reservations" about requiring that such cases be reported to the police. That letter, since being revealed recently, has stoked harsh criticism in Ireland. Numerous Irish victims of sexual abuse, for example, wrote collectively in January that they are "disgusted" by the message. The Vatican, in turn, has called the letter "deeply misunderstood."

chatgpt: In a move that marks a significant development in the continuing fallout from the Irish church cover-up report, the Vatican has announced that Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza has been recalled to Rome for consultations. The announcement comes amid reports of allegations of abuse of minors by clergy, and is seen as a response to the latest revelations. The Irish government recently released a report claiming a Catholic Church cover-up of child abuse in the Dublin Diocese from 1975 to 2004. The report detailed a staggering 320 cases of child sexual abuse and revealed that the Church leadership was aware of the abuse but chose to protect and defend abusers rather than their victims. The Vatican has been criticized for its handling of the abuse scandal, with many alleging that the church has shown a chronic lack of transparency and accountability. In response, the Director of the Holy See press office, Matteo Bruni, has said that some of the criticisms of the Vatican have gone too far. It is clear that the Vatican is taking these latest allegations very seriously, and Leanza's recall is a sign that the church is determined to address the issue of clergy abuse head-on. The Archbishop will be questioned about his role in the alleged abuse and any cover-up of these crimes. His testimony will no doubt be closely watched by survivors of abuse and advocates for justice and accountability. The allegations of abuse of minors by clergy have put the Catholic Church under immense pressure, and the Vatican has been struggling to respond to the allegations in a way that is consistent with its commitment to justice and accountability. The Archbishop's recall is a significant step in the right direction, but there is still much work to be done. Many survivors of abuse have called for greater transparency and accountability from the Catholic Church in the aftermath of the revelations of widespread abuse by clergy. The Church's handling of the abuse scandal has been subject to much criticism and has raised questions about its commitment to the protection and well-being of children. The Vatican has acknowledged that there are systemic problems within the Church that have led to the abuse of minors by clergy. Pope Francis has stated his commitment to tackling these problems, but many survivors and advocates believe that the Church has not gone far enough in addressing these issues. The recall of Archbishop Leanza is a significant step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to ensure that the Catholic Church is held accountable for the abuse of minors by its clergy. The Vatican must take swift and decisive action to ensure that justice is served and that the victims of abuse are given the support they need and deserve.
