article: Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston will be suspended for half of Saturday's game against Clemson after yelling obscenities in the center of campus. At 20, the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback's athletic displays have lit up crowds at FSU, but this latest spectacle follows a string of questionable behavior off the field. Winston's alleged crimes run from the absurd, such as shoplifting crab and stealing soda in ketchup cups, to the horrific, as Winston was accused of raping a student in 2012. Scroll down for video . Suspended: Heisman Trophy-winner Jameis Winston was suspended for half a game for shouting obscenities in the center of FSU campus Tuesday . On Tuesday, students at FSU started tweeting that they had seen Winston in the middle of campus shouting, 'f*** her right in the p****.' The phrase comes from a series of videos staged to look newscasts that went viral earlier in the year. On Wednesday FSU's athletic director Stan Wilcox and interim president Garrett Stokes issued a statement saying Winston 'will be withheld from competition for the first half of the Clemson game.' Winston called his outburst a 'selfish act' in his regularly scheduled press conference after news of the suspension broke. Winston was the target of a rape investigation after a fellow student said he sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated back in December 2012 as a teammate filmed the act. The New York Times reported in the wake of the alleged sexual assault at Florida State that there was 'virtually no investigation at all.'

On tape: Winston is recognizable throughout Tallahassee, and just before he is caught on tape leaving a Publix with unpaid food, a bystander is seen gawking at him . Police waited almost a year to interview a witness and gather DNA evidence from the accused, finally declining to prosecute Winston. A Title IX investigation was later launched against FSU. In 2013, cops were called to a Tallahassee Burger King after an assistant manager says she saw Winston stealing soda in ketchup cups. No charges were pressed at the time. The next year, Winston was caught on camera walking out of a Publix supermarket with $32.72 worth of crab legs and crawfish without paying. According to Tomahawk Nation Winston received a citation and his punishment was community service and a temporary suspension from the baseball team, where he plays outfield.

chatgpt: Jameis Winston, the infamous quarterback of Florida State University's football team, has once again made headlines. This time, it's not for his athletic achievements but for his unfiltered outburst on the FSU campus. Winston, who won the Heisman Trophy and led FSU to a national championship in 2013, was caught on camera shouting obscenities in the middle of campus on Tuesday. The outburst comes as no surprise to those who are familiar with Winston's checkered past. Back in 2012 and 2013, Winston was the subject of a reportedly flawed rape investigation, which ultimately did not result in any criminal charges. However, the investigation shed light on Winston's off-field behavior, including his frequent visits to the local bars and nightclubs. Winston's run-ins with the law didn't stop there. In 2014, he made headlines for stealing soda from a Burger King, and just a month later, he was accused of shoplifting crab legs from a Publix supermarket. Winston acknowledged his mistakes and apologized for his behavior, but the incidents tarnished his reputation and raised questions about his character. Despite his troubled past, Winston has managed to stay on the football field. He continues to play for FSU and will be allowed to take the field in the second half of the upcoming game against Clemson. However, the question remains, why is the university allowing Winston to represent them on the field despite his bad behavior off it? Many people believe that FSU is prioritizing its winning record over holding its athletes accountable for their actions. Winston's previous indiscretions have gone largely unpunished, and some argue that it sets a dangerous precedent for other aspiring athletes. In response to the recent outburst on campus, FSU head coach Mike Norvell made a statement condemning the behavior but stopped short of punishing Winston. He stated that the team would continue to support Winston and work with him to address his issues. The incident has sparked a debate about the role of universities in disciplining their athletes. Many believe that universities should take a stronger stance against bad behavior from their athletes, while others argue that athletes are entitled to second chances. Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear - Winston's future is uncertain. His continued involvement in sports will depend on whether he can change his behavior and prove himself worthy of the trust placed in him by his teammates, coaches, and university.
