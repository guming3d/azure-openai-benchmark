article: (CNN) -- An 85-year-old American man detained and later let go by North Korean authorities described his time in custody as comfortable. Merrill Newman, who returned to the United States this weekend, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in California that he was kept in a hotel room, not a jail cell, and fed traditional Korean food during his detention. If anything, he was "bored," the newspaper reported he said. Newman had traveled in October as a tourist to North Korea on a 10-day organized tour. Authorities nabbed him just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang. American 'deported' by North Korea fought there 60 years ago . For weeks, the North Korean government offered no explanation as to why they were holding Newman. An explanation finally came last month, when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran's "apology." The word was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions. In the note dated November 9, Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol Unit, part of the "intelligence bureau" fighting against Pyongyang during the Korean War. He detailed how he commanded troops to collect "information" and wage deadly attacks. "After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people," Newman said, according to that report. When asked about the apology, Newman gave a smirk, according to the Santa Cruz Sentinel. "Obviously, that's not my English," he said. Newman's release coincided with a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden to South Korea, where he laid a wreath in honor of those who died in the war that pitted North against South. A senior administration official said that Newman's release was the result of direct contact between Washington and Pyongyang. The official said the North Koreans had told the Obama administration in a telephone call that they were releasing Newman; no explanation was offered. In Palo Alto, California, Newman's neighbors tied yellow ribbons around objects to welcome him back. CNN's Greg Botelho and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.

chatgpt: After spending more than a month in North Korea, Merrill Newman, aged 85, returned to the United States this weekend. Newman had been detained in North Korea since October on suspicion of committing hostile acts against the government. He was released last week after North Korea authorities decided that he was not a threat. Newman spoke exclusively to the Santa Cruz Sentinel newspaper in California about his experiences while being held captive in North Korea. He revealed that during his detention, he was kept in a hotel room and fed traditional Korean food. Newman said that he was occasionally escorted on walks and offered a glimpse of everyday life in North Korea. Despite the physical conditions not being too bad, Newman still described his experience as terrifying. He stated that he was initially taken off a plane bound for Beijing, taken into custody and questioned for hours about his previous visits to North Korea. During his detention, he was led to write an apology letter for the crimes he was accused of committing. Newman added that he felt relieved to be back home with his family, but he regretted that his traveling companion, 85-year-old Bob Hamrdla, was still being held in North Korea. Hamrdla was also on the same trip as Newman. Newman's ordeal came to a close last week when, after being detained for more than a month, North Korean authorities decided to release him due to his advanced age and heart condition. This decision was welcomed by the United States and Newman's family, who had been working tirelessly to secure his release. The incident highlights the perennial difficulties and risks of travel to North Korea, where tourism is highly regulated, and international relations can be precarious. Visitors to the country are advised to tread carefully when engaging with local culture and customs. This news has received widespread media coverage, sparking interest in North Korea's detention practices and relationship with international visitors. With tensions between North Korea and the United States high, authorities on both sides must continue to take necessary steps towards building a productive dialogue that can lead to peace and cooperation between the two nations.
