article: It has been dubbed 'Tinder for planes' - and promises to let you meet fellow passengers on your flight while you're still in the air. Called Wingman, it was created by 24 old New York copywriter Gabe Whaley. The app will use in-flight wifi or bluetooth to connect people, and is about to begin testing. The Wingman app hopes to bring a Tinder-like dating experience to the skies . Wingman works in a similar way to Tinder. Users create a profile with their picture, first name, age, occupation, flight number and the airline they’re traveling with - and whether they’re traveling for business or pleasure. The app then displays a list of travelers on the same flight, and if you find one attractive, you can opt to start a conversation. 'The beta, much like the final version, will be extremely simple,' he told MailOnline. 'To create your profile, you simply provide a photo, your first name, age, and occupation. 'All the info you provide at your discretion. 'Once you board a flight, you will input your flight number, airline, and whether you are traveling for business, pleasure or both. 'The app will then match you with other wingman users who have similar data, and you can choose to pursue a conversation or not (much like how tinder works, although with Wingman you won't have to wait for mutually anonymous "likes" before being matched.)' Wingman isn’t available yet, but you can sign up for notifications about its development. The team have been working on it since December, and hope to release it in April - if Apple allows it. However, they do have a backup plan, and will release the app as a web site if it is banned from app stores. Wingman works in a similar way to Tinder.

'It could turn out to be really good, or really bad. Either way, I think it’s really funny.'

chatgpt: A new travel app is turning the dating app trend on its head by helping passengers find people to connect with while in the air. The app, which uses in-flight WiFi and Bluetooth to connect individuals, works in a similar way to popular dating app, Tinder. The new app aims to make air travel a more sociable experience for passengers by matching them with fellow travellers who share similar interests or destinations. Passengers using the app can anonymously swipe right to indicate interest in another passenger, or swipe left to move on to the next profile. Unlike Tinder, the in-flight app also allows users to create groups and start group chats with other passengers on the same flight. This feature could prove especially useful for business travellers who may want to network or make connections on their journeys.  The app creators noted that the idea for the app came from a desire to make air travel more enjoyable and less isolating for passengers. It is hoped that the app will help users feel less disconnected from the world while they’re in the air. For security reasons, passengers can only use the app once they are on the plane and the WiFi has been enabled. This ensures that all communication is confined to the cabin, meaning passengers will not be able to connect with outsiders. The app is also designed to ensure that all personal information remains private. Passengers have the option to disclose only the information they want to share, such as their name or profession, and can hide any personal details they don't want to reveal. Initial feedback from users has been positive, with many praising the app’s ease of use and ability to connect people with similar interests. However, some users have expressed concerns about privacy risks, highlighting the need for proper safeguards to protect user data. The app creators have assured users that they have taken this into consideration and have put measures in place to protect user privacy. They note that users can block or report any suspicious or inappropriate behaviour, meaning the app provides a safe community for air travellers to connect and network. The new in-flight app is currently available on select flights, but the creators have plans to expand its reach to a wider range of airlines and destinations in the near future. With the rise of digital connectivity and the demand for more social experiences, the app is sure to be a hit with air travellers looking to connect with like-minded people on their journeys.
