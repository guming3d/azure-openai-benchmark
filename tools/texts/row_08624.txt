article: (CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot will stand trial beginning January 6 on robbery and murder charges related to a 21-year-old woman's death, a Peruvian court announced Friday. The timetable from the Superior Court of Lima came days after a panel of judges ruled against having the Dutch national face an even more stringent slate of charges, as the victim's family members had requested. Instead, he will face the original charges levied against him -- which, if he is convicted on all counts, could lead to a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Van der Sloot is accused of killing Stephany Flores in his Lima hotel room last year. Police say he took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. He was charged in September with "qualified murder" and simple robbery, which carry sentences of 28 years and two years, respectively. The victim's family asked a three-judge panel for a charge akin to aggravated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The panel ruled against the family and in favor of prosecutors' original indictment. Van der Sloot's defense attorney, Luis Jimenez Navarro, then told InSession that the judge's decision was a major victory for his client. If van der Sloot is found guilty and sentenced to the maximum penalty, under Peru's jail reduction credits, he might serve only a third of the term. As of early next month, van der Sloot will have spent 18 months in Peruvian prison. Jimenez has previously said that his client could confess to a charge of simple homicide. Despite the panel's decision, the Flores family has remained hopeful that van der Sloot will face more serious charges. A family attorney said that because of the way the justice system works in Peru, the charges could change once the trial begins. Van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the case of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which is still unsolved. He also faces extradition charges to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted van der Sloot on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother. He was given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores. InSession's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Tuesday, the Superior Court of Lima announced that the trial of a Dutch national, Joran van der Sloot, will start on January 6. Van der Sloot will face charges of robbery and murder related to the death of Stephany Flores in 2010. Van der Sloot's case gained international attention due to his previous involvement in the disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005. However, it is the charges related to Flores' death that will be prosecuted in Lima. The panel of judges who will be presiding over the trial recently ruled that they would not levy a charge that could carry a life sentence. This decision was met with mixed reactions - some are satisfied that Van der Sloot will not be facing the harshest possible penalty, while others believe that it is not enough given the nature of the crime. The trial is expected to last several weeks, with both the prosecution and defense presenting their arguments and evidence. Flore's family will be attending the trial, having waited over a decade for justice to be served. The circumstances surrounding Flores' death are tragic. Van der Sloot met Flores, a 21-year-old Peruvian woman, while he was in Lima for a poker tournament. Reports indicate that they went back to his hotel room and Flores was later found dead. Van der Sloot was arrested a few days later in Chile and eventually extradited to Peru. While Van der Sloot initially confessed to the murder, he later retracted his statement and claimed that he had been coerced by the authorities. The case has been fraught with drama and legal challenges, with Van der Sloot filing and withdrawing multiple appeals over the years. The announcement of the trial date has brought some closure for Flores' family, who have been waiting for justice for over a decade. However, it is unlikely to bring back their loved one or erase the pain caused by her untimely death. For Van der Sloot, the trial represents a chance to defend himself against the charges that he faces. It remains to be seen what evidence and arguments both sides will present, and what the final verdict will be. But for now, all eyes are on Lima as the trial date approaches.
