chatgpt: Dutch darts star Raymond van Barneveld got his bid for a fifth world title off to a flying start as he dismantled Austria's Rowby-John Rodriguez in straight sets on Friday evening. The Dutchman, dubbed Barney, looked in fine form from the outset, dropping just two legs in a dominant display that saw him smash his opponent 3-0. Barney hit three consecutive 12-darters - throwing nine perfect darts at one point - and averaged an impressive 125.25 in the final set, leaving fans in raptures at the Alexandra Palace. The 51-year-old veteran looked relaxed and focused throughout the match, showing his experience and composure to stay calm in the face of a few minor setbacks. Rodriguez, 24, on the other hand, struggled to find his rhythm and looked visibly frustrated as Barney ran away with the match. The Austrian once again failed to go beyond the first round at the PDC World Championship, while the Dutchman will now face either Matthew Edgar or Darius Labanauskas in the second round. In another high-quality match, Michael Smith outlasted Austria's Mensur Suljovic in a see-saw battle that saw both players trade blows throughout. Smith, the world number 10, trailed 2-1 at one point, but rallied to take the next three sets and book his place in the second round. The Englishman hit 14 maximum scores and averaged 99.67, while Suljovic, the 2018 Champions League winner, hit 11 180s and averaged 98.55. The two players were neck-and-neck throughout, with Smith pulling ahead in the fifth set after clinching a critical break of throw. Suljovic mounted a spirited comeback in the sixth set, but it wasn't enough as Smith held on to seal a hard-fought 3-2 victory. Smith will now face either Canadian Jim Long or New Zealand's Darren Herewini in the second round, as he looks to go one better than his runner-up finish in last year's tournament. Friday evening also saw the preliminary round conclude, with four players booking their places in the first round proper. Damon Heta, the Australian number one, dominated in his victory over Jose Justicia, while Welshman Ritchie Edhouse outlasted Boris Krcmar in a tense encounter. Filipino Lourence Ilagan edged out Noel Malicdem in a fiery all-Pinoy clash, while Spain's Toni Alcinas survived a scare to defeat America's Craig Ross. The action continues on Saturday afternoon, with the likes of Dave Chisnall, Ian White and Gerwyn Price all in action.
