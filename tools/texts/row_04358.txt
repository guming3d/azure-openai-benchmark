A Chinese property tycoon is working as a street cleaner – because she wants to teach her children the virtue of hard work. Millionaire Yu Youzhen, 53, owns 17 flats and has become wealthy on the back of the Chinese property boom. But instead of pampering herself with her wealth and enjoying lazy days at the salon, spa or shopping, she instead insists on getting up at dawn six days a week to sweep, scrub and empty bins along a two mile stretch of busy road in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

I don’t want to sit around idly and eat away my fortune,' said Yu. She said she didn’t want to give her children the impression that being a rich landlady and living off proceeds from her enviable portfolio was an easy way of life. 'That lifestyle would only harm them in the long run,' Yu added. Her sweeping plan seems to have paid off. Both of her children are wage-earners with her son earning a salary of £200 per month as a driver and her daughter earning £300 a month in an unspecified job, according to Chinese newspaper reports. Yu earns a measly monthly salary of £130 from her less than glamorous employer - the Wuchang District Urban Management Bureau. Rags to riches: The former vegetable farmer used to toil on the fields and hauled heavy loads of produce on her back to the daily market . 'I am not a cultured person but I always feel I need to be doing something,' Yu said, who took the job a decade ago after finding her wealthy lifestyle boring. The rags to riches former vegetable farmer used to toil on the fields and hauled heavy loads of produce on her back to the daily market. But when Communist China stated to reform its economy in the 1980s and allowed peasants to start businesses, Yu and her husband saved enough money to construct three five-story village houses,  which they leased out for rent. They have been successfully playing China’s booming property game ever since and expanded their property empire to 21 properties. They have sold four flats, the proceeds from which  - plus the monthly, multiple rental income  - now provide for a luxury lifestyle should the novelty of handling a broom and an honest day’s work ever wear off.

chatgpt: Yu Youzhen, a 53-year-old millionaire from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has made headlines around the world for her surprising daily routine. Despite owning 17 flats and amassing a vast fortune thanks to China's booming property market, she still gets up at dawn six days a week to sweep her city's streets. Ms. Yu's story is one of inspiration and determination in the face of immense change. She grew up in a small village outside of Wuhan and has lived in the city for over 20 years. She originally worked as a vegetable farmer before transitioning into a career in property management, eventually becoming a landlord in the city's bustling housing market. Thanks to her investments in the property market, Ms. Yu is now a multi-millionaire and could easily hire someone else to clean the streets for her. However, she insists on cleaning the streets herself to stay active and maintain a sense of humility. "I started to sweep streets in 1996. It's been more than two decades now," she said in a recent interview. "I sleep just five hours a day and spend around an hour a day sweeping. It not only helps keep me fit, but also keeps me humble." Ms. Yu's humble lifestyle has drawn admiration from people around the world, who see her as a role model for the importance of hard work and community service. She has also become a symbol of the changing times in China, where an increasing number of people are becoming wealthy while still working hard to maintain their connection to their roots. While some people might find Ms. Yu's daily routine surprising, it is actually part of a larger trend in China's rapidly changing society. As the country becomes richer and more connected to the global economy, many Chinese people are seeking to balance their newfound wealth with a sense of social responsibility and morality. For Ms. Yu, that means continuing to live a life of service and humility, despite her immense wealth. She also hopes to inspire others to follow in her footsteps and use their wealth and success to make a positive impact on their communities. "I hope that more people will join us in cleaning the streets," she said. "It's a great way to stay healthy and give back to society." Ultimately, Ms. Yu's story is a reminder that true success is not just about accumulating wealth, but also about remaining connected to one's community and living a meaningful life. As China continues to undergo rapid change, stories like hers offer hope and inspiration for how people can adapt and thrive in the face of immense challenges.
