chatgpt: A new tool for beer lovers has been developed and it's called "Pints In The Sun". This tool uses building outline data from Open Streetmap, along with a solar almanac calculation to determine the best outdoor seating at over 100,000 pubs around the world.  Pints In The Sun makes use of data from Open Streetmap to obtain a detailed layout of buildings and streets surrounding each pub. The system then factors in the location, direction, and heights of each building near the pub, along with the position of the sun at different times of the day according to a solar almanac calculation. This helps determine the best outdoor seating areas at each pub, based on the time of day and the position of the sun. This new tool is primarily aimed at beer enthusiasts who want to enjoy their drinks outside, basking in the warm glow of the sun. The tool is already available in several countries, including the UK, US, Germany, and Spain. The developers plan to expand their services to cover even more countries in the future. According to the developers, Pints In The Sun is built on the principles of "weather reusability." This means that the data used by the tool can also be reused to help predict other types of weather-related phenomena, such as rain and wind conditions. Pints In The Sun is an excellent tool for those who love to enjoy a refreshing pint on a sunny day. With the help of this tool, you can now find the most ideal outdoor seating areas at your favorite pubs, based on the position of the sun and the surrounding buildings. This is sure to make your drinking experience even more enjoyable. In conclusion, Pints In The Sun is a remarkable tool that has been designed to make the lives of beer enthusiasts easier.
