However, it has since been revealed that the footage was actually part of a satirical joke by a popular website.

The video quickly went viral, with many residents expressing outrage over what they believed to be a real incident. The website owners, who have chosen to remain anonymous, have since issued an apology for any offense caused, insisting their intention was to create a humorous take on the city's famously liberal reputation. The site is known for its satirical content, often parodying the news and current events. The incident has sparked debate online, with some critics claiming that the fake footage was insensitive to real victims of sexual assault, while others argue that it was simply harmless fun. Many Brighton residents, however, seem to be taking the prank in good humor, with some even applauding the creativity of the hoax.
