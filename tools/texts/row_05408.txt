article: A cardiologist has been found to have prescribed and administered morphine to a teenage colleague that he was dating. Dr Paul Langton, who became a registered practitioner in 1990, had formed an intimate relationship with an 18-year-old woman who worked at his hospital after she came to him for treatment in late 2010. The Medical Board of Australia condemned his treatment as inappropriate due to the woman's 'history of illicit drug use', fining him $30,000 and suspending him from practice for 18 months. Dr Paul Langton, a cardiologist at Hollywood Private Hospital in Perth, will be suspended from practice for 18 months and has been fined $30,000 . Based in Perth at Hollywood Private Hospital, Dr Langton treated and advised the woman from late 2010 until mid 2011. This included injecting her with morphine and writing prescriptions for injectable ampoules of morphine sulphate as a treatment for her chronic low back pain. The Medical Board of Australia wrote that the doctor's first recommendations should have been 'mild analgesia, appropriate exercise and referral to a physiotherapist'. It  found that the administration of morphine was entirely inappropriate due to the woman's 'history of illicit drug use, binge drinking and anxiety and depression increased the risk of addiction and inappropriate use of morphine'. However, the board's overall ruling stated that the duo's intimate relationship, 'compromised [Mr Langton's] ability to provide proper medical advice and treatment' to the woman. The board also heard Dr Langton was suffering from depression during his relationship with the teen and ruled that this played a 'significant part in him making the errors of judgment he did in advising and treating her'. He was found to have been treating an 18-year-old colleague that he had formed an intimate relationship with. This included prescribing and administering her with morphine despite her history of illicit drug use . It was also revealed that he had taken sedatives from his work place, including Propofol, Midazolam and Fentanyl, to help him sleep. Dr Langton told the ABC that he had reported himself to the board, which stated that he 'admits that he behaved in a way that constitutes professional misconduct'. He was fined $30,000 and will be suspended from practice for 18 months as of November 21. The board's ruling also requires him to undergo assessment by a psychiatrist every four months and a psychologist every three months.

chatgpt: A Perth-based cardiologist has been fined $30,000 and suspended from practising medicine for 18 months after forming an intimate relationship with an 18-year-old colleague and treating her back pain with morphine, despite her history of illicit drug use. The Medical Board of Australia received a complaint about Dr Paul Langton's behaviour in 2019. An investigation revealed that he had started a relationship with the young woman, who was working as a medical assistant at the time. The two had engaged in a sexual relationship, with Dr Langton using his position of authority to manipulate the young woman. In addition to the sexual relationship, Dr Langton had also prescribed morphine to the woman to treat her back pain. The woman had a history of illicit drug use, including heroin and methamphetamine, which should have made Dr Langton cautious about prescribing such a powerful opioid. Dr Langton recognised the severity of his actions and reported himself to the Medical Board of Australia. He has expressed deep remorse for his behaviour and has accepted full responsibility for his actions. In a statement, Dr Langton said, "I am deeply sorry for the harm and distress that my actions have caused. I accept the judgment of the Medical Board and will take steps to ensure that my behaviour never again falls short of the high standards expected of a medical practitioner." The Medical Board of Australia found that Dr Langton's behaviour had breached the code of conduct for medical practitioners, which requires them to maintain professional boundaries with their patients and never to exploit their position of trust. In handing down the suspension and fine, the Medical Board stated that they took into account Dr Langton's admission of fault, his cooperation with the investigation, and the likelihood of him committing similar behaviour in the future. The case has raised concerns about the issue of sexual misconduct in the medical profession. Doctors are in a position of power and trust, and it is important that they maintain professional boundaries and act with integrity at all times. The Medical Board of Australia has a duty to protect the public and to ensure that doctors are held to the highest ethical standards. The case also highlights the need for doctors to be cautious when prescribing opioids, particularly to patients with a history of drug abuse. The opioid crisis is a major public health issue, and doctors have a responsibility to ensure that their prescribing practices do not contribute to this epidemic. In conclusion, the suspension and fine handed down to Dr Paul Langton serve as a reminder to medical practitioners everywhere that they are expected to act with the utmost professionalism and integrity at all times. The case also highlights the need for doctors to be cautious when prescribing opioids and for the medical profession to be vigilant in addressing issues of sexual misconduct.
