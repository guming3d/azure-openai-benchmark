article: (CNN) -- Jacques Kallis has crowned his final Test appearance with an innings that typifies his status as one of cricket's greatest batsmen. The 38-year-old posted a defiant 115 runs on Sunday as South Africa piled up 500 against India in the second Test of the series in Durban. It was his 45th century in the five-day format, leaving Kallis behind only the record 51 set by Sachin Tendulkar -- who retired from the game last month. The innings also lifted Kallis into third place in the all-time Test run-scoring standings, above Tendulkar's compatriot Rahul Dravid with 13,289 in his 166th match. Kallis, who announced before the match that it would be his last, had resumed on his overnight score of 78. He was dismissed soon after passing Dravid, and Dale Steyn then fell for 44, but Robin Peterson (61 off 52 balls) and Faf du Plessis (43 off 70) combined to give the top-ranked home team a first-innings lead of 166 against No. 2 India. The tourists then slumped to 68-2 when bad light ended play on day four, still trailing by 98 overall. While that two-Test series is evenly poised after a draw in the opening match, Australia cantered to a 4-0 lead in the Ashes against England on Sunday. The home side will seek to inflict an embarrassing whitewash in the final Test after triumphing by eight wickets in Melbourne. Resuming day four on 30-0 in pursuit of 231 for victory, the Australians lost just two wickets as veteran opener Chris Rogers made 116 from 155 deliveries and Shane Watson was undefeated on 83 off just 90 balls faced, hitting 11 boundaries. Captain Michael Clarke hailed his team after bouncing back from a poor first innings, which had given England a 51-run advantage. "I think for the first time in this series, we were behind in a Test match -- and we had to find a way to claw our way back into it," Clarke told reporters. "We let ourselves down with the bat -- certainly our top six batters didn't bat as well as we would have liked in the first innings. "The way our bowlers were able to turn it around -- knocking them over for 179 -- and the way we batted today, you see the real positive sides of this team."

chatgpt: South Africa’s legendary batsman Jacques Kallis bid farewell to the cricket world with a stunning century on Sunday. Kallis scored 115 runs in his last Test match, helping the Proteas take charge of the ongoing second match against India at the Kingsmead Stadium in Durban. With Kallis’ brilliant performance, South Africa has taken a 166-run lead in the second innings, giving the visitors a daunting task of ensuring that they fight to save the match on the final day. Considered one of the greatest all-rounders of all time, Kallis' century was a fitting tribute to his illustrious international career, which spanned more than two decades. Kallis amassed 13,289 runs in Test cricket at an average of 55.37, and also claimed 292 wickets. His impact on South African cricket has been immense and it will certainly take some time before the Proteas find a suitable replacement for him. While Kallis’ knock has put South Africa in the driver’s seat, India, who are trailing by 166 runs, have a massive task of avoiding defeat on the final day. The tourists were under pressure from the start, as they lost both their openers on Sunday. This setback piled pressure on the team, as they were forced to rebuild the innings with the middle order. The visitors need to come out fighting if they hope to achieve a positive result, but with Kallis' contribution, the Proteas had a significant advantage entering the final day. Meanwhile, in the Ashes, Australia took an unassailable 4-0 lead after defeating England in the fourth Test match in Melbourne. The hosts completed a comprehensive victory, winning by eight wickets on Sunday. England won the toss and elected to bat first, but were bowled out for a paltry 179 runs in the first innings. Australia replied strongly, scoring 204 runs and taking a healthy 25-run lead. In the second innings, Australia’s bowlers were too much for the English batsmen, who could only score 179 runs again. Australia chased down the target of 231 runs with ease, reaching it in just 41 overs. With the Ashes series already decided, England will try to salvage some pride when they face Australia in the fifth Test match, which gets underway on 3 January at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In summary, Jacques Kallis' final Test century has put South Africa in charge against India, who are fighting to avoid defeat. Meanwhile, Australia completed a comprehensive victory over England to take a 4-0 lead in the Ashes.
