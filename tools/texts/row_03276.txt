article: (CNN) -- The 5-year-old son of country music singer Mindy McCready has been recovered and is in good health in the custody of officials in Arkansas, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families told CNN Friday. "We're working with local law enforcement and the Arkansas (Division of Children and Family Services) and we're going to bring him home to Florida to his legal guardian as soon as possible," Terri Durdaller said about the boy, Zander. Mindy McCready's assistant said the singer turned Zander over to the Arkansas authorities and that he would be returned to her on Monday. "She's looking forward to having her case heard in front of an unbiased courtroom," the assistant said. "She has a 99% chance of her child leaving with her on Monday morning." She described Zander as "very OK." But Mindy McCready's mother and stepfather, Gayle and Michael Inge, have legal custody of the boy and the singer has only visitation rights. "We're relieved," they told CNN. "We feel sorrow for Zander because he's traumatized, and for Mindy. We just hope she does the right thing from here on out and that this is a wake-up call for her." The boy was located hours after Gayle Inge made a public plea for her daughter to obey a court order to return her son to the care of the Inges. The imbroglio started when McCready, who has fought a public battle against drug addiction, took her son from her father's Florida home. This week, a Florida judge ordered McCready to return the boy to authorities. When she did not comply, another judge issued an emergency "pickup order," authorizing officers to pick up the boy. The singer was ordered to produce Zander and failed to do so. Though McCready said that the boy was with her, authorities considered him to be missing. McCready's publicist issued a statement, saying McCready "has not been charged with illegal wrongdoing." "Ms. McCready's No. 1 priority has always been, and continues to be, the safety of her son," publicist Kat Atwood said. McCready has asked a court to restore custody to her out of concern over the boy's safety, Atwood said. McCready burst on the music scene in 1996 with the debut album "10,000 Angels" and the chart-topping country hit "Guys Do It All the Time." Her website biography says she's had romances with musician David Malloy and actor Dean Cain, and touches on her career stalling, as well as her having an "explosive relationship" with Billy McKnight, the boy's father, who is himself a country singer. McCready participated in the 2009 season of the reality TV show "Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew." CNN's Tom Watkins, Phil Gast, Michael Martinez, Selin Darkalstanian, Dave Alsup and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Arkansas officials have taken custody of the five-year-old son of country singer Mindy McCready, who had been ordered to turn him over after it was revealed she did not have legal custody. McCready is no stranger to legal issues, and her custody battle over her son Zander has been ongoing for years.  The latest incident happened when McCready refused to turn over the child to the authorities as ordered, and took him to an undisclosed location. The situation prompted a judge to issue an emergency pick-up order, and with the help of law enforcement, the child was retrieved from McCready's custody and placed with the Arkansas Department of Human Services. McCready's legal troubles have been well-documented, and she has faced numerous charges throughout her career, including drug charges and battery charges against her ex-boyfriend. In 2004, she was charged with prescription drug fraud, and she was arrested in 2005 for driving under the influence. In addition to these legal issues, McCready has had personal struggles that have garnered media attention, including a suicide attempt in 2008 and a stint on reality television in 2010. The custody battle over Zander has also been a point of contention for McCready, with allegations of neglect and abuse being thrown back and forth between her and her ex-boyfriend, Billy McKnight. McKnight, who is the biological father of Zander, has also faced his share of legal issues, including a 2005 arrest for attempted murder. Despite her ongoing legal issues and personal struggles, McCready has continued to pursue her music career, and she released a new album in 2012. She has also been involved in several charitable endeavors, including raising money for breast cancer research and supporting veterans' organizations. The situation with Zander is just the latest in a long line of troubles for McCready, and it remains to be seen what will happen next in the custody battle. In the meantime, she continues to receive support from her fans, who have rallied around her during her difficult times. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of legal custody in child custody battles, and the consequences of failing to comply with court orders. It also highlights the challenges faced by parents who are struggling with addiction or other personal issues, and the need for support and resources to help them overcome these obstacles and provide a safe and stable environment for their children.  In conclusion, the custody battle over Mindy McCready's son Zander has taken a new turn, with officials in Arkansas taking custody of the child after McCready failed to comply with a court order to turn him over. McCready's ongoing legal and personal struggles continue to make headlines, and her fans and supporters are hoping for a positive outcome in the custody battle as she continues to pursue her music career and charitable endeavors.
