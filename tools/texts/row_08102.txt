article: It’s the game on many-a-young-person’s wish list. And for those who can’t wait for its release on next-gen consoles, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes has finally arrived on their rickety older brothers. But don’t expect to be punished for your impatience – for TT Games have squeezed every last drop of processing power from the aging Xbox 360 and PS3 to create their best-looking LEGO game to date. Hectic: for the most part, the game engine performs well - but on larger sections there can be some slowdown . Plot sees Doctor Doom teaming up with Loki to build a super-weapon from cosmic bricks, and it’s up to the Marvel team to stop them. But where LEGO Batman 2 DC Super Heroes held a lot of the playable characters back to the latter parts of the game, here you’re exposed to many playable heroes early on. From Spiderman, Thor, Hulk and Iron Man to the Fantastic Four and X-Men, it’s certainly an eclectic mix, but one that works surprisingly well. True to its roots: all of the characters are instantly recognisable . All stay true to their comic-book roots, and while some characters have abilities in common, every one has their own distinct animation and special ability. Whereas Spiderman can use his web to swing around and bind objects together, Thor can use his lightening to charge devices. And so forth. These come in handy when solving the game’s numerous puzzles – with certain characters’ abilities needed to complete each one. It takes two: co-operative mode makes a comeback and there is a wide variety of Heroes to choose from . It’s a tried and tested formula, and one that TT has long used in their LEGO games. But even though there is a slight whiff of this design starting to become stale, the open-world second part of the game more than makes up for it. Here you are given free range of Manhattan, tasked with numerous side-missions – such as checkpoint races - and unlocking new characters. It’s noticeably more populated and alive than in LEGO Batman 2, and it is backed up with mostly vibrant visuals. Sadly, though, the camera can prove an annoyance – especially when flying and playing through latter stages with a friend. Characters can get wedged in the environment, too. Thinking games: puzzles usually require a combination of multiple Super Hero powers to solve them . Flaws aside, TT Games have delivered another brilliant LEGO game. It may not be a radical change from the other outings – and maybe it’s time to try something new – but for now, it’s the best LEGO game yet. Just Marvel-ous. Version tested: Xbox 360 . LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is out now for current-gen consoles. Xbox One version has been delayed and will not be a launch title. PS4 version set for release on November 14.

chatgpt: The LEGO games have always been a popular choice amongst video game enthusiasts, with their trademark humour and colourful visuals. The latest addition to the franchise, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, takes this to a whole new level of awesomeness. The game has been hailed as the best-looking LEGO game to date, even on current-gen consoles. The graphics are smooth and polished, with vivid colours and an impressive level of detail that really brings the characters to life. The game follows the usual LEGO formula, with players controlling a range of superheroes as they battle to save the world from the evil plans of a dastardly villain. However, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes throws in a few new tricks, such as dual character abilities and the ability to transform into different superheroes on the fly. What sets LEGO Marvel Super Heroes apart from other LEGO games, however, is its sheer size and scope. The game is essentially two games in one, with an overarching story that opens up to give players Manhattan to explore. This means that even after completing the main story, players are left with plenty of content to keep them playing for hours on end. The city itself is a sight to behold, with busy streets, towering skyscrapers and plenty of hidden secrets to uncover. The attention to detail is remarkable, with each area of the city mirroring its real-life counterpart. But it's not just the visuals that make LEGO Marvel Super Heroes a great game. The trademark LEGO humour is present in full force, with plenty of jokes and Easter eggs to keep players chuckling throughout. That being said, there are still some minor gameplay issues that prevent the game from being perfect. For one, the level design can feel overly-familiar at times, with similar puzzles and obstacles cropping up across different levels. Some players have also reported issues with camera angles, although this is a minor gripe in an otherwise stellar game. Overall, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is a worthy addition to the LEGO game franchise. Its impressive city, dual character abilities, and trademark humour make it a must-play for fans of both the LEGO series and superhero games. Despite some minor gameplay issues, this game is sure to provide hours of entertainment for gamers of all ages.
