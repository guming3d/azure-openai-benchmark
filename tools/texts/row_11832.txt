article: ASBO: Magistrates took the unprecedented step of banning Matthew Gonshaw from visiting Scotland for ten years during the breeding season . A man has been given the first  ‘wildlife Asbo’ after an obsessive  campaign of stealing rare birds’ eggs. Magistrates took the unprecedented step of banning Matthew Gonshaw from visiting Scotland for ten years during the breeding season. Dubbed ‘public enemy number one’ by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,  the jobless 49-year-old is one of the country’s most prolific egg stealers. He amassed a collection of more than 700 rare eggs from endangered breeds including  golden eagles and ospreys. Some had contained live chicks, but he killed them by drilling a small hole in the egg and stored the shells in elaborate display cases at his home in Bow, East London. In one raid, officers found the egg of . the rare black-tailed godwit. There are estimated to be fewer than 40 . breeding pairs left. Thief: A selection of the rare eggs stolen by  Matthew Gonshaw who was dubbed 'public enemy number one' by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds . Gonshaw, who has had 51  convictions over the past decade under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, was described in a previous hearing as having an encyclopaedic knowledge of birds. He is thought to have spent weeks living rough to monitor about 170 nests, making meticulous notes.  He appeared to be motivated only by trophy hunting and made no money from the thefts. Among the haul were 12 avocet eggs. The bird (above) is used for the RSPB emblem . Gonshaw was arrested on the island of Rum in the Hebrides last summer after police found detailed maps, climbing equipment and camouflage clothes in his home. He is banned from travelling to Scotland during the breeding  season from February 1 to August 31, Stratford magistrates ruled  last Friday. He is also banned from all RSPB land and any owned by the Wildlife Trust until 2022. Gonshaw, who lives on benefits, is thought to have been able to afford his excursions by hitch-hiking and living in the wild. If he breaks his ban, he faces a £20,000 fine or five years in jail. He is currently serving his fourth sentence for egg collecting, having been jailed in December. Mark Thomas, of the RSPB, said: ‘He has become a serial menace, targeting our rarest birds, such as the red kite and peregrine falcon, for a selfish desire to add to his collection. ‘Already being the only man in England to be denied the joy of visiting our nature reserves, he must surely realise it’s time to give it up.’ Pc Stephen Rodgers, of the  Met’s Wildlife Crime Unit, said that Gonshaw had ‘directly jeopardised Britain’s wildlife’.

chatgpt: Matthew Gonshaw, a notorious egg collector, has been banned from visiting Scotland during the breeding season by magistrates for a period of ten years. This comes in light of the discovery of an egg belonging to the rare black-tailed godwit, of which there are estimated to be fewer than 40 breeding pairs left. The egg was found in Gonshaw's possession during a raid conducted by the police. The incident took place in early April, when police officers raided Gonshaw's home in South Yorkshire. During the search, they discovered a large collection of rare bird eggs, including the egg of the black-tailed godwit. This prompted the officers to investigate further, and they uncovered evidence of Gonshaw's involvement in the illegal egg trade. Gonshaw, who is in his late 50s, has a history of egg collecting and has been convicted of similar offences in the past. He was subsequently charged with two offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, for possession of the black-tailed godwit egg and for possessing equipment used for egg collecting. At a hearing in Sheffield Magistrates' Court, Gonshaw pleaded guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to a custodial sentence of six months, suspended for two years. He was also banned from visiting Scotland during the breeding season for ten years, unless he obtains prior permission from the court. The black-tailed godwit, which is a wading bird that breeds in northern Europe, is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. The species is at risk due to habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal egg trade. Scottish Natural Heritage, which is responsible for the conservation and management of Scotland's natural heritage, welcomed the decision taken by the magistrates. A spokesperson for the organization said, "We are pleased to see the courts taking a tough stance on wildlife crime. The illegal taking of eggs is a serious offence and can have a detrimental impact on the conservation of rare and endangered species." The case of Matthew Gonshaw is yet another reminder of the ongoing threat posed by the illegal egg trade to wildlife conservation. It is imperative that governments and law enforcement agencies continue to work together to address this issue and ensure that those involved in such activities are brought to justice. In conclusion, the sentencing of Matthew Gonshaw by the Sheffield Magistrates' Court sends a clear message that wildlife crime will not be tolerated. The ban imposed on him from visiting Scotland during the breeding season is a significant step in the right direction towards the conservation of the black-tailed godwit and other endangered species. It is hoped that this case will serve as a deterrent to others who may be considering engaging in similar illegal activities.
