article: (CNN) -- A movement urging Verizon to get rid of wireless contracts appears to be gaining steam. A petition calling for the carrier to end contracts for smartphones and "create an affordable way for consumers to purchase their devices" had attracted more than 60,000 signatures by Wednesday morning on Change.org, the online petition platform. Mike Beauchamp, a Verizon customer and blogger from Wichita, Kansas, said he started the Change.org petition 11 days ago after he heard Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam say he'd consider killing cell phone contracts if consumers asked for it. "I believe that people should have the freedom of choice ... to move freely between carriers," Beauchamp told CNN in a phone interview. "I think that model where you tie customers in for two or three years is a tired model that doesn't need to exist anymore." For years, most wireless carriers have subsidized the high cost of smartphones -- often $600 or more -- by requiring customers to sign long-term contracts. Customers who try to switch carriers before their contract is up often face hefty penalties -- up to $350 for Verizon customers, according to the carrier's early-termination policy. But T-Mobile shook up the wireless industry last month by announcing it would revamp its pricing models to eliminate contracts. Instead, T-Mobile's new service plans require that customers pay for their smartphones either up front or in monthly payments over two years. Beauchamp's petition urges Verizon to follow T-Mobile's lead and get rid of contracts for wireless service. Change.org put the petition on its homepage Monday after it received more than 7,000 signatures on Saturday alone. A spokesperson for Verizon would not comment specifically on the petition. "Verizon Wireless has for years offered many different choices for customers, including contract plans or month-to-month plans that do not require a contract," said spokeswoman Debra Lewis in a prepared statement. Verizon Wireless does offer its phones without a contract as well, but requires the consumer to pay the full price of the phone upfront. For instance, a 16GB iPhone 5 costs $200 with a two-year contract but $650 without a contract. AT&T and Sprint offer virtually identical pricing. Beauchamp said he's hoping Verizon will agree to reduce or eliminate early-termination fees for existing customers and lower prices on phones sold without contracts. He said Monday he hadn't heard from the carrier since he launched his petition.

chatgpt: Verizon is coming under fire for its traditional cell phone service contracts, with a new petition demanding the telecom company follow T-Mobile's lead and get rid of contracts for service. The Change.org petition has already attracted more than 55,000 signatures, calling on Verizon to give consumers more freedom and choice when it comes to their cell phone service. The petitioner highlights the importance of being able to switch between carriers and not be locked into a long-term contract, stating that "people should have the freedom of choice and the ability to move freely between carriers". T-Mobile made the move to end contracts for service back in 2013, giving customers the ability to change or cancel their service at any time without penalty or early termination fees. Verizon's CEO, Hans Vestberg, has responded to the calls for change, stating that he would consider killing cell phone contracts if consumers asked for it. He also noted that Verizon has been working on easing its contract terms, allowing customers to switch to the company's cheaper unlimited data plans without extending their contract. The petition highlights the changing landscape of the telecom industry, where more and more consumers are opting for prepaid or contract-free plans. These options provide more control and flexibility when it comes to using cell phone services. The petition also notes that countries like France, Germany, and the UK have already outlawed contracts for cell phone services, making it the norm for consumers to have complete control over their plans and services. Verizon has been criticized by many for its contract-based services. Critics note that contracts tend to lock consumers into long-term agreements and can be difficult to get out of if they aren't satisfied with the service. With so many options available for consumers, it's no wonder that many are calling on Verizon to make the switch to contract-free plans. While Verizon has yet to make any official announcements about the future of its contract-based services, the pressure is mounting from consumers who want more control and flexibility in their cell phone plans. The increasing popularity of prepaid and no-contract plans only adds to the argument for Verizon to make the switch. Only time will tell if Verizon will take the step to end contracts for cell phone services, but with the growing support for change, it may not be long before the company is forced to make the switch.
