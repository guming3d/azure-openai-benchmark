Described by Gizmodo as a 'stalker's wet dream', privacy campaigners have said the app highlights just how much personal information we make available online when we upload our photos. Rutgers' social media information lab put together the website, entitled 'The Beat', using data from Instagram's application programming interface (API). This stream of source code, common to many web services, allows third-party developers to use information from the site to put together their own related online apps. On The Beat, users can filter photos from Instagram by entering a related hashtag into a search bar. It then displays photos tagged with the search term with images of the address where they were taken. Out of respect for privacy, there appears to be a blacklist for certain search terms, like 'underwear', 'porn' and 'sex' which could reveal risque or explicit photos. However, other related terms, like 'bikini', are not blocked.

The application highlights how photos uploaded to Instagram become publicly available to users worldwide when they are published. It also shows how users are revealing far more data than they expect when they use the service. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'People might be happy sharing photos of what they’re doing, but how many people would want where they are doing it to be public? 'Location data is one of the most sensitive pieces of data and yet countless apps are using it without most people knowing. 'It’s one of the most valuable pieces of data to advertisers who can target you on and off-line as a result, so it’s hardly surprising companies like Google and Facebook are looking for as many ways as possible to track where you are. 'Your smartphone is a tracking device that lets you make calls.'

chatgpt: A new app has been making waves in tech circles for its ability to harvest location data and link it to Google Street View. The app, called GeoStreet, is aimed at helping users find photos and other information related to specific locations. However, critics are concerned about the amount of personal information users reveal when using such services. The app works by allowing users to enter keywords into a search bar, which then presents them with a stream of images related to that keyword. For example, if a user enters the keyword "coffee shop," the app will show them a stream of images of coffee shops located near their current location. Users can also set filters based on their preferences, such as distance, rating, and price range. While the app's search capabilities are impressive, some critics are concerned about the amount of personal information users reveal when using such services. GeoStreet harvests location data from users' devices, which it then links to Google Street View. This means that the app has access to users' exact location at any given time, as well as information about the surrounding area. Additionally, because the app shows users a stream of images related to their keyword, it's possible for users to inadvertently reveal personal information. For example, if a user enters the keyword "home," the app may show them images of their own home or other nearby homes. This could potentially reveal information about the user's address or living situation. Despite these concerns, GeoStreet has become popular among tech enthusiasts and travelers. Its ability to quickly locate information and images related to specific locations makes it a useful tool for navigating unfamiliar areas. However, some experts warn that users should be cautious when using these types of apps. "Apps like GeoStreet are a reminder of just how much personal information we reveal when using technology," said cybersecurity expert John Smith. "Users should be aware of the risks and take steps to protect their privacy." One way to protect privacy when using GeoStreet is to turn off location services when not in use. Users can also set the app to only access location data when it's actively being used. Additionally, users should be careful about the keywords they enter into the app's search bar, and avoid entering anything that could reveal personal information. Overall, GeoStreet is a powerful tool for finding information and images related to specific locations. However, users should be aware of the risks and take steps to protect their privacy when using such services. With the right precautions, apps like GeoStreet can be a useful addition to any traveler's toolkit.
