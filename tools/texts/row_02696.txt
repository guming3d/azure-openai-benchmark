article: By . Charles Sale for the Daily Mail . England will have either home or away fixtures against four European giants - Germany, Spain, France and Italy - over the next two years to help drum up backing for a national team to be watched by its lowest crowd at the new Wembley against Norway next Wednesday. FA general secretary Alex Horne called the expected crowd of between 35,000 and 40,000 ‘disappointing’ and added ‘there is some work to do’ re-engaging with disillusioned regulars. One ambitious plan is to build a new fanbase by enrolling 500,000 football fans in the revamped England Supporters Club, despite current members being upset at the way they’re taken for granted.

An FA official confirmed the low figure at Wembley next week. They told MailOnline: 'So far the ticket sales are around the 37,000 mark, including Club Wembley members.

chatgpt: Wednesday sees England take on Norway in an international friendly at the home of English football, Wembley Stadium. However, the match - which could be Roy Hodgson's final opportunity to experiment with his squad before Euro 2016 - appears destined for a less than full house. According to reports, only between 35,000 and 40,000 fans are expected to turn up to cheer on the Three Lions, with the FA's General Secretary, Alex Horne, commenting that the anticipated turnout is "disappointing."  These numbers may come as a surprise to many given that the match is taking place at Wembley, England's national stadium and undoubtedly one of the most iconic sporting venues in the world. However, it is perhaps indicative of a wider trend in international football. With clubs in the major European leagues beginning to return to action this weekend, supporters may feel that attending a friendly match a few days before more competitive encounters resume is not a priority. The reduced number of fans in attendance will have several consequences for Hodgson and his team. For starters, there is the practical issue of atmosphere. The Three Lions will be playing in front of a stadium that is unlikely to be at full volume, and this could impact on their performance. There is also the financial aspect to consider, with a smaller attendance leading to a reduced income for the FA. Finally, it is worth noting that England have struggled in recent friendly matches, drawing their last two against the Republic of Ireland and Italy, and losing to both Spain and the Netherlands earlier this year. A repeat of those disappointing performances would do little to increase interest and support from the general public going forward.  Despite the poor expected turnout, however, Hodgson will be looking for a strong performance from his side against the Norwegians. With only a handful of games left before the squad is finalised for Euro 2016, they will be looking to impress their manager and prove that they are capable of competing at the highest level. For the fans who do make their way to Wembley, there may be an opportunity to witness the emergence of some exciting young talent, or witness the return of established names such as Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere from injury. Whatever the outcome, England will be hoping for a resounding win and a positive step towards next summer's tournament.
