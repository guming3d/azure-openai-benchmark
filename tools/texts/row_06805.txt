article: By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Gone are the days when women constantly worried about their looks, a new study suggests. For the modern British woman is now so confident in her appearance that she thinks she looks five years younger than she really is. Most women do not believe they look old until the age of 46, and feel confident about their appearance into their fifties and beyond, according to a survey. Three-quarters of the 2,000 women surveyed said they looked five years younger than their real age, mostly thanks to a youthful complexion. One in ten respondents believed they looked a decade younger than they really were, while a third said they would happily embrace growing old. The study, commissioned by cosmetics brand Lancome Advanced Genifique, suggested that some women - around 10 per cent - were concerned about ageing as early as their twenties. Scroll down for video . One in ten respondents believed they looked a decade younger than they really were, the study found . Nearly 40 per cent said their concerns began in their thirties. The average age when the worries started, however, was 46. One in five women said concerns about looking old had started in their 50s or 60s, suggesting older women are more content with their looks than they were in their youth. Respondents said the secret to eternal youth included a happy marriage, avoiding getting sunburnt, using a good moisturiser, good genes and eating five pieces of fruit a day. Regular haircuts, daily exercise, religiously cleansing, toning and moisturising, good eye cream and never smoking were also crucial in the fight against ageing, they said. A glass of wine at the weekend, surrounding themselves with young people and having well-behaved children were among the other answers given. British actress Helen Mirren, 68, was the celebrity most admired for her youthful appearance, followed by comedian Joanna Lumley, 68, Pretty Woman star Julia Roberts, 46, and singing sensation Lulu, 65. Italian and French women were considered the most likely nationalities to retain a youthful appearance, followed by those from Scandinavia. Women from Russia, Germany and Ireland scored the lowest. Nearly half of respondents said they spent up to £60 a year on cosmetics which they hoped would make them look younger, 38 per cent spend between £60 and £150 and 12 per cent spent between £150 and £250. Three per cent of women said they spent more than £250 a year on skincare products aimed at beating the clock.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by the beauty brand No7 found that most British women do not believe they look old until the age of 46, with many admitting they feel much younger than their actual age. The survey, which polled 2,000 women from across the UK, found that 55% of women between the ages of 25 and 34 believe they look five years younger than they actually are. The results of the survey suggest that the modern woman is embracing ageing like never before. While many women may feel pressure to maintain a youthful appearance, a third of those surveyed said they would happily embrace growing old. Many women said they felt more confident than ever before about the natural ageing process. One woman who participated in the survey said, "I used to dread the thought of getting older, but I'm now in my mid-40s and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I ever have before. I know I look my age, but I embrace it." The survey also found that many women are taking steps to look after their skin in a bid to maintain a more youthful appearance. Nearly half of the women surveyed said they had started using anti-ageing products in their 20s or 30s, with 26% using them on a daily basis. Commenting on the findings of the survey, a spokesperson for No7 said, "We believe that feeling good in your own skin is the most important thing, and beauty should be all about empowering women to feel confident and proud of who they are." The survey's findings may come as a surprise to some, particularly given the societal pressures often placed on women to maintain a youthful appearance. However, the voices of those women who participated in the survey suggest a growing trend towards embracing the natural ageing process, rather than feeling pressure to look younger. As one participant in the study said, "I used to feel like I had to hide my age, but now I'm happy to tell people how old I am. I feel like I've earned every wrinkle and every grey hair, and I'm proud of who I am." Overall, it seems that the modern woman is shaking off the shackles of societal expectations and embracing the natural ageing process like never before. Whether this trend will continue remains to be seen, but for now it seems clear that many British women are happy to grow old gracefully.
