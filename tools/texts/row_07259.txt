The 26-year-old victim, Jeffrey Laude who went by the name Jennifer, was found strangled on Saturday . She was found with her head down a toilet in a hotel room in Olongapo City, the town outside Subic famous for its sleazy bars. 'A U.S. Marine has been identified as a possible suspect in the ongoing investigation,' the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. 'The United States will continue to fully cooperate with Philippine law enforcement authorities in every aspect of the investigation.' Dindi Tan, of the Association of Transgender People in the Philippines, said: 'The victim must be given justice. The case must not be swept under the rug, especially because the victim is a transgender.' Emmi De Jesus, representative for the Gabriela Women's Party, said: 'I condemn the heinous barbarity behind the hate crime committed on the defenseless transgender woman' A US Marine was held by American military officials aboard USS Peleliu (pictured) after he was named as a suspect in the murder of a transgender Filipino he met in a disco bar . Emmi De Jesus, representative for the Gabriela Women's Party, said: 'I condemn the heinous barbarity behind the hate crime committed on the defenseless transgender woman. 'We maintain that the US military basing in communities worsens prostitution, trafficking, drugs, and spread of diseases.' The United States and the Philippines in April signed a new 10-year security pact that allows for a larger U.S. military presence in the country as it struggles to raise its defence capabilities amid territorial disputes with China. 'We are committed to do our part to ensure that justice is served,' Philippine Foreign Ministry spokesman Charles Jose said after being informed about the crime. In 2005, a U.S. Marine was accused of raping a Filipino woman in Subic Bay. He was convicted by a lower court but an appeals court reversed the ruling after the woman recanted her statement.

chatgpt: An American Marine is currently in custody aboard the USS Peleliu after being linked to the death of a Filipino transgender woman, 26-year-old Jeffrey Laude who went by the name Jennifer. Laude was found strangled and with her head submerged in a toilet in a hotel in the city of Olongapo, in the Philippines. The Marine, whose identity has not been revealed, was among a group of troops taking part in a joint military exercise with the Philippine military. The incident has sparked widespread anger throughout the country, and many are calling for the Marine to be tried in a Philippine court. The US and the Philippines have a long-standing military relationship, and joint military exercises are a regular occurrence. However, incidents like this one have led to tensions between the two countries. The Philippine government has demanded that the US turn the Marine over to Philippine authorities, but the US has refused, citing the terms of a defense agreement between the two countries. The case highlights a controversial provision of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which allows the US to retain jurisdiction over its military personnel accused of crimes in the Philippines, as long as they are found to have committed the crime in the course of their official duties. Many Filipinos have criticized the VFA for allowing US military personnel to avoid prosecution in the Philippines, and for giving the US an undue level of influence over Philippine affairs. The case of Jennifer Laude has only increased the scrutiny of the agreement. The Philippine government has formed a special investigative team to look into the case and is working with US authorities to investigate the Marine's involvement. However, many are skeptical that justice will be served, given the history of the VFA and the power imbalance between the two countries. The case has also brought attention to the issue of violence against transgender people in the Philippines. Transgender people are often the victims of hate crimes and discrimination, and the government has been criticized for failing to protect them. The death of Jennifer Laude has sparked calls for greater protections for transgender people and for the government to take action to address their marginalization. The case is still ongoing, and the Marine remains in custody aboard the USS Peleliu. Many await the outcome of the investigation and trial, which could have significant implications for the future of the US-Philippine relationship and for the rights of transgender people in the Philippines.
