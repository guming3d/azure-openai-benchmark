Officials said the ‘great majority’ of British forces would come home but they conceded the SAS and their naval counterparts, the SBS, are almost certain to remain after the deadline, so UK personnel will still be in harm’s way. The SAS and SBS have done valuable covert work uncovering Taliban bomb factories and identifying the location of their leaders for air and ground attacks. The G8 summit in America this weekend will draw up plans for withdrawal from Afghanistan and agree to provide funds for Afghan armed forces after 2014.

Britain will contribute £70 million a year to a total fund of £700 million. The UK is also running an officer-training school in the Afghan capital Kabul dubbed ‘Sandhurst in the sand.’ The UK will begin to dramatically reduce troop numbers next year. The timetable mapped out at the summit will see Afghan forces take control of all combat missions by the middle of 2013. At that point, commanders will agree a more concrete plan on how quickly they can remove the remaining soldiers. A senior British official said: ‘Our forces will not remain in a combat role in Afghanistan beyond 2014. The majority that remain will be in a training and mentoring role. ‘But I wouldn’t rule out a small number of forces playing a counter-terrorism role if needed. 'This would be in keeping with how we are working to protect ourselves from the threat emanating from other parts of the world, such as the Arabian Peninsula.’ Security sources said the size of the British deployment would depend on where Al Qaeda was operating in 2014. The number of Special Forces could be as low as ten, but could be as high as 200.

chatgpt: Senior sources have reportedly confirmed that the British Special Air Service (SAS) will continue to support Afghan forces in their ongoing efforts to weed out insurgents in Helmand province. This decision was made as part of a plan agreed upon at the recent G8 summit, which stipulated that Afghan forces would assume responsibility for combat missions by mid-2013. The presence of the SAS, a renowned elite unit of the British military, is expected to be a key factor in helping the Afghan security forces tackle the ongoing insurgency in the region. The unit, which is known for its expertise in covert operations and counter-terrorism, is believed to have played a crucial role in stabilizing Helmand province in recent years. Despite the progress made by the Afghan forces in recent years, the fight against insurgents in Helmand province remains a formidable challenge. In addition to the Taliban, the region is home to various other militant groups who continue to pose a threat to the stability and security of the region. The decision to keep SAS forces in Helmand province comes at a critical juncture for both the Afghan government and its international allies. With US and NATO forces set to withdraw from the country in the coming years, Afghan forces will need all the support they can get in their fight against insurgents. The SAS has a long history of working in Afghanistan and has established a reputation as one of the most effective counter-insurgency forces operating in the region. The unit's experience and expertise in dealing with the complexities of the Afghan conflict is expected to be a valuable asset to the Afghan forces as they seek to maintain the security and stability of the region. The news of the SAS's continued presence in Helmand province has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the move as a necessary step in the fight against insurgency, others have expressed concern that the prolonged presence of foreign forces could fuel resentment and anti-Western sentiment among local communities. Despite these concerns, however, it is clear that the SAS's role in Helmand province will be crucial in ensuring that the gains made in recent years are not lost. With the Afghan forces set to take control of combat missions by mid-2013, the pressure is on to ensure that they have the resources and support they need to maintain peace and stability in the region. In the coming months, the SAS will work closely with Afghan forces to provide them with the training and expertise they need to take on the challenges of the insurgency. While the road ahead will undoubtedly be difficult, there is reason to believe that with the right support and resources, the Afghan forces will be able to maintain the progress made in recent years and secure a stable and prosperous future for their country.
