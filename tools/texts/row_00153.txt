article: A blind woman has spoken of her anger after an Uber taxi driver refused to pick her up apparently because she was with her guide dog. Amy Dixon says she ordered a cab through the firm's app in her home town of Darien in Connecticut on Tuesday. But when she went to open the door, she claims the driver sped off, leaving her and her dog Elvis stranded. 'Flabbergasted': Blind woman Amy Dixon claims an Uber taxi driver refused to pick her up because she was with her guide dog Elvis . She said: 'I was flabbergasted. I'm screaming at him, waving my arms like crazy thinking maybe he made a mistake because I was hoping it wasn't what I thought it was.' But her fears were confirmed around ten seconds later when she received a text saying the driver had cancelled the pick up, it was reported by NBC New York. Mrs Dixon, who lost her vision around seven years ago, managed to get another Uber car to take her home. Uber said it had fired the driver. 'Built to expand transportation options for all': Uber said it had fired the driver after being told of the incident . In a statement, it said: 'The Uber app is built to expand access to transportation options for all, including users with visual impairments and other disabilities. 'It is Uber's policy that any driver partner that refuses to transport a service animal will be deactivated from the Uber platform, which has been done in this case.' Mrs Dixon welcomed the response, but said all drivers needed to be educated about service dogs. She added: 'As soon as they sign a contract to be an Uber driver, they have to obey the law, plain and simple.' Uber is a ride-sharing service that allow users to request taxis through an app which are then dispatched to drivers. Uber drivers aren't employed by the company, but instead work on a freelance basis.

chatgpt: A woman in Glasgow, Scotland claims that a driver for a popular ride-hailing service drove away as she attempted to enter his vehicle. Amy Dixon, 24, says she was left "flabbergasted" as the car accelerated away from her, making it clear he wasn't going to wait for her to get in. Dixon says she had simply been trying to open the door of the taxi when the driver sped off. "I was flabbergasted and thinking maybe he had made a mistake," she said. "But no, he was gone." Dixon says she was left stranded and had to find an alternative mode of transport. What's more, Dixon later received a text message from the driver saying he had cancelled the pick-up. She says she was left confused by the message, as she had not asked for the ride to be cancelled. The ride-hailing service in question has come under fire in the past for the treatment of its drivers and the conditions they work under. However, this is one of the first incidents to be reported of a passenger claiming mistreatment by a driver.
 
The incident has reignited the debate around the regulation of ride-hailing services and passenger safety. Some have called for tighter regulations around driver behavior and passenger safety, while others argue that the current system is already sufficient. The ride-hailing service says it is "extremely sorry" for Dixon's experience and says it is investigating the matter. However, Dixon says she wants more to be done to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. She has called for stricter regulations and better training for drivers in order to ensure passenger safety. This is not the first time ride-hailing services have come under scrutiny for safety issues. In 2019, a woman in South Carolina was killed after getting into the wrong car, while in 2018, a woman in Arizona was killed after being hit by a self-driving car operated by a ride-hailing service. Overall, the incident shows the need for continued scrutiny and debate around the safety of ride-hailing services and their drivers, and the need for better regulation to ensure passenger safety. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that drivers are properly trained and held accountable for their behavior.
