article: (CNN) -- For centuries, Bedouins of the Middle East survived a nomadic lifestyle in unforgiving deserts by relying on animals. From camels to desert falcons, animals provided food, transportation, and even companionship in the harsh, isolated land. Today, sports utility vehicles have largely replaced the hump-backed 'ships of the desert' throughout the Middle East. But animals still play a vital role in daily life and the culture of the region. Beirut's Rescued Animals . We visit an animal shelter in Beirut that has taken up the often overlooked cause of animal abuse and rescue. Encouraging adoption and humane treatment of animals, BETA also helps humans -- the animals are part of a therapy program to help children with special needs. Rima Maktabi takes us there. Lion Whisperer . Lions, tigers, cheetahs and other exotic and endangered animals are prized pets for many Emiratis for whom it is the ultimate status symbol. When the cubs grow into adulthood and develop violent traits, many are often abandoned and it falls to private individuals and parks to take the animals in and rehabilitate. Schams Elwazer meets the Lion Whisperer Ras Al Khaima as he plays with a rescued lion and visit a woman in Dubai whose home shelters almost 300 animals from tortoises to alpacas to parrots. Pet Hotel . The United Arab Emirates is known for its luxurious resorts and seven-star hotels -- now the trend has extended to our four-legged companions. A seven-star hotel recently opened in Abu Dhabi caters to cats and dogs with suites that even include plasma screens. Camelicious . At a trendy cafÃ© near the world's tallest building, customers sip on camel milk lattes. In the high-end malls of Dubai, camel milk chocolate is a luxury brand. We look into the trend of a modern take on camel products, used by the Bedouins for centuries for transportation, milk and meat. From camel burgers to a high-tech lab processing camel milk for commercial sale in supermarkets, Rima Maktabi looks at how the dromedary is making a modern comeback. Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital . Falcons have been prized for centuries in the Bedouin culture for sport and companionship. More than just pets, they have their own passports, travel in cabins on airlines, and in Abu Dhabi have their own five-star hospital. We look into the passion behind falconry and witness the animals' care from pedicures to surgery. Cairo's Pigeon Trainers . We take to the rooftops of Cairo where flocks of pigeons weave through the skies above the urban jungle of the Egyptian capital. As Ian Lee finds out, the love for breeding and training homing pigeons transcends class boundaries and political affiliations as over two million pigeon owners escape the streets to continue an ancient tradition in the skies.

chatgpt: In the Middle East, animals have long played an integral part in the region's culture and daily way of life. From providing food and transportation to offering companionship, animals have been essential companions for centuries. This month, the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies (IME) is taking a closer look at the unique relationship between animals and the people of the region. One of the facilities IME is spotlighting is an animal shelter. Many stray animals in the Middle East are in dire need of care and attention, and this shelter is doing its part to lend a helping hand. From cats to dogs to larger animals like camels, the shelter provides a safe haven for animals that would otherwise be left to fend for themselves on the streets. For those looking for something a bit more luxurious for their animal companions, IME is also looking at a high-end pet hotel. This establishment provides a full array of services for pets, including grooming, high-end food, and even specialized medical care. For those who want nothing but the best for their furry friends, this pet hotel is the place to be. IME is also visiting a lion whisperer this month. This individual has a unique gift for communicating with these magnificent creatures, and has spent years building a relationship with the lions in his care. For those looking to gain insight into the mind of these powerful animals, the lion whisperer offers a fascinating glimpse into their world. In addition, IME is also looking at a falcon hospital. These birds of prey are highly prized in the Middle East, and many falconers place great value in their care and well-being. The falcon hospital provides a range of services for these beautiful creatures, including specialized medical care, rehabilitation, and training. Finally, IME is taking a look at Cairo's rooftop pigeon fanciers. For many Cairo residents, keeping pigeons is a treasured pastime, and rooftop coops dot the cityscape. These hobbyists take great pride in their birds, and participate in competitions that range from endurance flights to aerial races. In all, IME's focus on animals in the Middle East provides a unique glimpse into the important role these creatures play in the region's culture and daily way of life. From the humble stray animal in need of care to the pampered pets that live in luxury, the animals of the Middle East are an essential part of the region's rich heritage.
