A second man in Vermont has died from a rare but deadly brain infection transmitted through mosquitoes. Scott Sgorbati, who was only 49, died from Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), after spending weeks in intensive care. Only two weeks prior, 87-year-old Richard Hollis Breen died from the virus, which causes swelling of the brain. Fatal disease: Scott Sgorbati, left, was the second person in Vermont to die of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in two weeks; the other was 87-year-old Richard Hollis Breen, right . Transmission: EEE is transmitted through mosquitoes, and although rare, is fatal in humans in a third of cases . Mr Sgorbati, who worked as a carpenter in the small town of Sudbury, was said to have been in good health before contracting EEE. His death was confirmed earlier this week by the Vermont Department of Health. His sister-in-law Susan Sgorbati told Vermont Public Radio that he was ‘very compassionate and always there for people.’ Following the two deaths, Vermont Health Commissioner Dr Harry Chen said that the disease is still extremely rare, saying there are on average only six cases a year. ‘What’s important now is that Vermonters are aware of EEE and take steps to avoid exposure,’ he said, according to the Addison County Independent. Rarity: According to the CDC, there have been no reported cases of EEE between 1964 and 2010; Florida tops the list, with 70 reported cases since 1964 . Precautions: EEE is transmitted through mosquitoes to humans; the CDC suggests wearing long sleeves and insect repellant when out of doors to avoid contact with the pests . He called the deaths of the two men ‘a tragedy,’ but added: ‘This is a very rare disease. The risks are low.’ Virus: EEE is a member of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are two types of the illness. Approximately a third of those infected die from the disease, but it is only fatal when it affects the central nervous system. The symptoms of EEE are often abrupt and severe, and can include fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, vomiting, convulsions, and in more serious cases, coma. The most cases have been reported in Florida, with 70 cases reported since 1964. Next up was Massachusetts, with 37 cases. The CDC has no record of the disease in Vermont from 1964-2010. Now Vermont health officials are looking forward to the temperature dropping, as a cold snap will likely kill off any mosquitos carrying the disease. Until then, officials advise those outside to thoroughly coat themselves in bug repellent, wearing long sleeves and trousers, not shorts. They also say to avoid being outside at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are out in droves.

chatgpt: Scott Sgorbati, a 49-year-old resident of Massachusetts, has tragically died after contracting Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE). This comes just two weeks after 87-year-old Richard Breen also passed away from the rare disease. As a result, health officials are urging residents to take precautions when spending time outdoors, particularly during peak mosquito season from late summer to early fall. EEE is a rare but potentially fatal virus that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms can range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe cases involving encephalitis, inflammation of the brain. In severe cases, EEE has a mortality rate of around 30%. Although cases of EEE are relatively rare, the risk of contracting the disease is currently high in Massachusetts. Following this recent spate of deaths, the state’s Department of Public Health has raised the risk level for EEE to “critical” in several towns. Residents in these areas are being advised to cancel or reschedule outdoor events, especially those held after dusk, when mosquitoes are most active. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also issued a warning to residents across the country to take precautions when spending time outdoors during peak mosquito season. These precautions include wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, using insect repellent, and avoiding stagnant water where mosquitoes breed. In addition, the CDC recommends that people take steps to protect their homes from mosquito bites by installing screens on windows and doors and using air conditioning. People are also urged to empty any standing water around their homes, such as bird baths or flower pots, as this can attract mosquitoes. The recent deaths of Sgorbati and Breen have highlighted the importance of taking these precautions. In a statement, Sgorbati’s family described him as a “kind, loving, and generous man” who loved spending time outdoors. They urged others to take EEE seriously and to protect themselves from mosquito bites. Meanwhile, Breen’s family has spoken out about the devastating impact that the disease had on him. “My dad was a fighter until the very end, and we are heartbroken that he lost his battle with EEE,” said his daughter in a statement. While the recent deaths in Massachusetts have generated concern among public health officials, it is important to note that EEE is still a relatively rare disease. According to the CDC, there have been an average of just seven human cases of EEE reported each year in the United States since 2010. However, with the current elevated risk in Massachusetts and other areas, it is crucial that people take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites. By wearing protective clothing, using insect repellent, and eliminating standing water around their homes, residents can reduce their risk of contracting this potentially deadly disease.
