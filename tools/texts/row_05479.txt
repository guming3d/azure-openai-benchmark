Prosecutor Emma Downing told Bradford Crown Court that Crockett was working in the Canaries and the UK as a tribute act, impersonating Robbie Williams, Take That and Michael Bublé. Crockett, whose website claims he is the 'only choice' when it comes to Robbie Williams impersonators, illegally claimed £8,463. His separate Bublé tribute act webpage claims he 'delivers Bublés [sic] greatest hits with the same flamboyance and panache as the man himself'. The court was told that he had been voluntarily paying back £40 a month since the start of this year, but Judge Jonathan Durham Hall said the public are 'rightly outraged' by benefits cheats. Crockett’s barrister, Charlotte Worsley, said the tribute act, who claims to have 'thrilled audiences across Europe', was of previous good character and was no longer on benefits. She said he had suffered medical difficulties for a number of years, including a stroke, and was advised by his GP to move somewhere warm because of problems with his back, for which he had surgery in 2002 when he was nearly paralysed.

Miss Worsley said Crockett had made a remarkable recovery over the years and was managing to keep himself relatively fit with a strict diet, physiotherapy and exercises. However, he still suffered from significant disabilities, she said. Judge Durham Hall said he did not think Crockett, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, had any idea about the seriousness of his position and will sentence him on November 13. The judge said he was yet to decide on whether Crockett would face jail, telling him he would be 'looking at your case with great care'.

chatgpt: A tribute act, James Crockett, has admitted to making fraudulent claims for incapacity benefits in 2012. The singer, who performs under the name Andy James, claimed £8,500 from the government while he was performing Robbie Williams hits in Tenerife at the same time. The court heard that James Crockett also impersonates Michael Bublé with "flamboyance and panache," and the combination of his two personas made it difficult for him to claim that he was unable to work. During the trial, Crockett pleaded guilty to making false statements to obtain benefits. The judge in the case stated that the public is "rightfully outraged" by benefits cheats like Crockett, who take advantage of the system at the expense of honest taxpayers. Crockett's sentencing has been scheduled for next month, and he could face jail time for his fraudulent claims. The case highlights the issue of benefits fraud in the UK, which costs the government billions of pounds every year and diverts resources away from those who genuinely need support. In response to the case, a spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) stated that they take benefit fraud very seriously and will prosecute those who make false claims. They added that new technologies and data sharing measures have made it easier to identify fraudulent claims and bring those responsible to justice. The case also raises questions about the credibility of tribute acts and their ability to make a living. While many tribute acts struggle to make ends meet and rely on performing as their sole source of income, some performers such as James Crockett, choose to defraud the system instead. The National Tribute Music Awards recognizes and rewards the best tribute acts in the country, but it is up to individual performers to ensure they are making a legitimate living. Cases like this one can potentially harm the credibility of the industry and discourage audiences from attending tribute act performances. In conclusion, James Crockett's fraudulent claims for incapacity benefits have been rightfully exposed, and he will face the consequences of his actions. The case highlights the need to tackle benefits fraud and ensure that those who genuinely need support receive it. Additionally, it serves as a reminder to performers in the tribute act industry to uphold the integrity of their profession and not jeopardize their credibility by making false claims for benefits.
