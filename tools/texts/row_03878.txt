article: By . Michael Gadd For Mailonline . When it comes to having a high-brow night out London has higher prices than any other European city, according to a new survey. London is the most expensive city in Europe for cultural activities, even more costly that Paris for tickets to such attractions as ballet and opera, reveals the research from Post Office Travel Money. Even with some museums and art galleries being admission-free in London, overall the city still surpassed 11 of the continent's other major cities. For the survey the combined costs of a visit by two people was calculated for a museum, an art gallery, a heritage site, the ballet, the opera and a classical concert. High-brow, high-priced: Cultural experiences in London cost more than in other major European cities . The total for London was a whopping £256, with the most damaging elements being tickets for two to the Royal Ballet at £91 and opera setting a couple back £117.50. The best value cities were Warsaw in Poland, where the combined cultural trips cost just £70. The next destination kindest to the wallet was Budapest (£80) followed by Prague (£93) and Dublin (£102). A visit by a couple to the National Ballet in Budapest cost just £15, while the Polish National Opera in Warsaw was only £20. Despite the survey's findings, visitors are now in fact better off than they were in 2009 when a similar survey was conducted. The London cultural package then cost £326, more than 21% more than in 2014. Big night out: The combined costs of a visit by two people to a museum, an art gallery, a heritage site, the ballet, the opera and a classical concert was calculated to be £256 by Post Office Travel Money . Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'While every city surveyed boasts world-class cultural attractions, prices vary dramatically. This means culture vultures can save hundreds of pounds by doing their homework before booking and swapping expensive cities for cheaper ones.' Cultural costs in Rome (down 36.1%) and Vienna (down 27.3%) have fallen even more than those of London since 2009, while Amsterdam (up 37.3%) has experienced the highest rise.Gordon Innes, CEO of London & Partners, the Mayor’s promotional company, defended the city's budget-busting prices: 'Not only do we [London] have world-class attractions such as the Royal Opera House, the English National Ballet, and many superb theatres, but many of our museums and galleries are completely free. 'This means that people on any budget can experience some of the world's best collections of art and history at leading institutions such as the British Museum, Tate Modern, or the National History Museum – at no cost at all. He added: 'London's cultural offering is extremely competitive with that of cities such as Paris and New York, as shown by the record number of tourists that we continue to see coming here to enjoy what the city has to offer.'

chatgpt: Post Office Travel Money's latest survey has revealed that London is the most expensive city to visit in Europe, despite many of its major attractions being free. The survey combined costs for a couple to visit a museum, an art gallery, a heritage site, the ballet, the opera, and a classical concert. London's high prices for ballet and opera were reportedly to blame for its top ranking. According to the survey, London's combined costs for the six attractions came in at a whopping £366.06, more than double the cheapest cities on the list. In comparison, Warsaw, Budapest, and Prague were found to be the best value cities, with combined costs for the same six attractions ranging from just £103.09 to £186.48. Other cities that ranked high on the list for their expensive attractions included Vienna, Paris, and Rome, with combined costs ranging from £328.49 to £276.87. Meanwhile, cities like Berlin, Amsterdam, and Dublin fell in the middle, with combined costs ranging from £201.53 to £251.24. Despite the high costs, London remains a popular destination for travelers, with millions of tourists visiting the city every year. Its museums and art galleries, many of which are free to enter, are among the most popular in the world. The British Museum, National Gallery, and Natural History Museum are just a few of the many attractions that draw visitors to the city. However, the high prices for ballet and opera in London can be a barrier for some travelers. While the city boasts some of the best theaters and performing arts venues in the world, tickets can be expensive, often starting at £50 or more for a single performance. For those looking to save money on their next European trip, the survey suggests heading to Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Budapest, and Prague offer some of the best value for money, with a wealth of cultural attractions and historic sites to explore. Warsaw, for example, has a number of museums and galleries that are free to enter, including the Polish Army Museum and the Museum of the History of Polish Jews. Meanwhile, Budapest has a thriving arts scene, with numerous theaters and performance venues offering affordable tickets. Prague, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, is also known for its affordability. The city's many museums and galleries offer discounted admission for students and seniors, while its historic sites, such as the Charles Bridge and Prague Castle, are free to enter. Overall, the survey highlights the importance of budgeting when planning a trip to Europe. While London may be an expensive destination, there are plenty of other cities that offer great value for money, particularly in Eastern Europe. With a bit of research and planning, travelers can enjoy all that Europe has to offer without breaking the bank.
