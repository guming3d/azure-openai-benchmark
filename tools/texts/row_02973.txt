article: ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The suspected head of an Italian mafia murder squad eluded police for a third time, and may have escaped through the sewer pipes, according to Italian media reports. Italian police examine a sewer that may have offered an escape route for a suspected mafia boss. Giuseppe Setola, 38, is believed to have slipped into a tunnel built under his hideout near Naples, Italy on Monday, as police closed in on him, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency and reports in the La Repubblica and Corriere Della Sera newspapers. That tunnel connects to the sewer system in the nearby town of Caserta, north of Naples. Corriere published photos of anti-mafia police searching through what was described as Setola's trash-strewn bunker and the tunnel. Anti-mafia police have been searching for Setola for months, and have already arrested his wife and two suspected members of his crew, according to the reports. Monday was the third time he avoided arrest. Setola is allegedly the head of a killing team run by the powerful Casalesi clan which belongs to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra. He got out of jail last spring after a doctor ruled that he was legally blind. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into that ruling. The Casalesi clan is featured in the best-selling book "Gomorrah" -- a play on the word "Camorra" -- written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection. Saviano recently said he may have to leave Italy to escape constant death threats from the mafia and its supporters. Police began cracking down on Setola and his colleagues after the murder of six West African immigrants in the nearby town of Castel Volturno in September. After those killings, the Italian government activated the army to help bolster efforts against the Casalesi clan, which is believed to have killed more than 20 people since May. The two suspected members of his squad have given police information about his movements. In November, police arrested an Italian police officer suspected of informing Setola about police operations.

chatgpt: Italian authorities are investigating whether a notorious mafia boss has escaped from police custody through the sewer pipes. Reports suggest that Giuseppe Setola, the head of the Casalesi clan's alleged killing team, may have used a tunnel connecting to the sewer system in the nearby town of Caserta to make his getaway. Setola was arrested along with several other suspected mafia members earlier this year as part of a large-scale operation against the Camorra organized crime group. He was being held in a heavily guarded prison in the southern Italian city of Naples when he apparently disappeared. While officials have not yet confirmed that Setola escaped through the sewer pipes, they have not ruled out the possibility. "We are investigating all angles," said a police spokesperson. "We cannot exclude that he may have managed to escape through the sewers." The discovery of the tunnel leading to the sewer system has added weight to the theory that Setola may have used this escape route. The tunnel was found in a building owned by a suspected Camorra member and was apparently built using stolen building materials. Italian authorities have been cracking down on the Casalesi clan, one of the most powerful and violent mafia groups in the country. The clan is known for its involvement in drug trafficking, extortion, and murder. Setola, who was considered to be one of the clan's key figures, had been on the run for several years before his arrest in January. He was reportedly responsible for ordering the murder of several rival gang members and had been the subject of a nationwide manhunt. The news of Setola's possible escape through the sewer pipes has sparked concern among Italian authorities, who fear that he may continue to carry out criminal activities while on the run. The Casalesi clan has a long history of violence and intimidation, and officials are taking every precaution to ensure that Setola is apprehended. The investigation into Setola's disappearance is ongoing, and Italian authorities are urging anyone with information about his whereabouts to come forward. They are also stepping up their efforts to crack down on organized crime groups in the country, in an attempt to put an end to the violence and corruption that has plagued some parts of Italy for decades.
