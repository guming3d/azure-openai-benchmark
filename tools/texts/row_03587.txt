District Judge Martin Walker told the girl, who was wearing a fluffy jumper and black leggings, she would be held in secure accommodation. Separately, the 14-year-old was escorted into the warm courtroom in tears and she wiped her eyes with a tissue. Her father was in court for the hearing.

Two young defendants appeared in court in connection with her death, each accompanied by their parents.

The prosecution alleged that they assaulted Ms. Wrightson in her home and subsequently caused her death.  The court was told that Ms. Wrightson had suffered more than 100 separate injuries during the course of the attack. Many of these were caused by a variety of objects, including a television, a computer printer, and a wooden stick.  The defense argued that the teenagers had not intended to kill Ms. Wrightson and that the violence had escalated beyond their control. However, the prosecution claimed that the defendants had acted with "no remorse" during the attack and had continued to take photographs of Ms. Wrightson's injuries even after her death.
