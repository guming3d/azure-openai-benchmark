chatgpt: Manchester City fans displayed a mocking banner ahead of their match against Chelsea, reminding their rivals Manchester United of their recent defeat to inexperienced Leicester City. The banner read "United we fall - in cinemas soon," referencing Manchester United's shock 3-5 loss to the newly-promoted team last week. This stunt comes months after United supporters flew a similar banner over Old Trafford, expressing their frustration towards then-manager David Moyes. The banner was not the only talking point during the match at Etihad Stadium, which ended in a 1-1 draw. City remained unbeaten in the Premier League this season, but the draw put them two points behind Chelsea in the league table. Meanwhile, Manchester United's disappointing start to the season continued under manager Louis van Gaal, as they suffered their worst start in the Premier League history after four games played. City fans' banner acts as a reminder that United is not alone in experiencing problems on the pitch, but rather, other teams in the league are struggling as well. The Manchester clubs are known for their fierce rivalry, and it seems that even their fans are trying to one-up each other. Despite the rivalry, both sets of fans shared a similar feeling towards their respective managers and their team's performances. The banner highlights the perceived failures of United's management and the disappointment of its fans. To make matters worse, City's mockery will undoubtedly add salt to United's wounds. However, United is not alone in their struggles and will need to pull together to turn their season around. Overall, the banner displayed by Manchester City fans before their match against Chelsea adds another twist to the Manchester rivalry. With United experiencing their worst start, City fans took the opportunity to mock their rivals before their game. Fans from both sides have expressed their disappointment towards their respective managers, with United now aware that they are not the only struggling team in the league.
