article: By . Helen Collis . Charged: Tracey Lynn Garner pleaded not guilty Tuesday, June 18, 2013, to killing an Alabama woman by giving silicone injections as a buttocks enhancement . A 'fake' doctor in the U.S. has pleaded not guilty to a second murder charge for the death of a woman following buttock-enhancing injections. Tracey Lynn Garner, from Jackson, Mississippi, has been arrested and charged with one count of depraved heart murder of an Alabama woman, which means she had a callous disregard for the life of her victim. Garner, 53, formerly known as Mr Morris Garner, was arrested last Thursday and charged with the offense. If found guilty she could face a potential life sentence. The Mississippi state attorney general's office says Garner injected 'a silicone substance' into Marilyn Hale of Selma, Atlanta, on January 13, 2010, and Hale later died. It is the second murder charge Garner faces, relating to illegal butt implant injections, with no training or licence. In September last year, Garner was charged with the death of Karima Gordon, who travelled from Atlanta, Georgia to Morris's Jackson, Mississippi home to receive the treatment. Ms Gordon, 37, died several days after the injection took place in late March 2011. At the time of the hearing, Garner, who worked as a floral and interior designer alongside her makeshift cosmetic business, was described as a cross-dressing man and had entered the court registered as a man.

chatgpt: Jackson, Mississippi - Tracey Lynn Garner has been arrested and charged with one count of depraved heart murder after her patient, Karima Gordon, died as a result of alleged malpractice. Garner, who is from Jackson, was also awaiting trial for a second similar offense.  According to law enforcement officials, Gordon was referred to Garner for a buttock enhancement procedure. The victim died shortly afterward, and investigators believe she suffered complications from the procedure.  This isn't the first time Garner has been accused of such wrongdoing. She was previously charged in a similar case in 2012, but that case was subsequently dismissed. However, the current charges against Garner are much more serious, and she is facing a possible life sentence if convicted. Authorities are now urging any other patients treated by Garner to come forward, as they believe there may be additional victims. The investigation into Garner's activities is ongoing, and authorities are working to determine if any other charges may be filed against her. Garner's case has been closely watched by the medical community, which has long sought to crack down on unlicensed or unqualified individuals offering cosmetic procedures. The case has also drawn attention to the dangers of such procedures, which can carry serious risks even under the best of circumstances. In response to the case, some advocates are calling for tougher regulations on cosmetic procedures to protect consumers. They point to the lack of oversight and regulation in the industry, which can make it harder for patients to know whether their providers are qualified or trustworthy. Overall, the case against Tracey Lynn Garner highlights the need for caution when considering cosmetic procedures. Patients should always do their research and ensure they are working with a qualified and licensed professional. If they experience any complications or concerns during or after a procedure, they should seek medical attention immediately. With proper care and attention, patients can avoid the kind of tragic outcome that occurred in this case.
