Police told the New York Post that Tsai was having an affair with Dennis Melchior who was the broker of the trust until he lost his job at UBS last year. Melchior denied any wrongdoing and said that Ms Marston, who has 'zero mental capacity' and lives in a nursing home, benefited from the money being spent. Tsai was arrested on April 22 at her beachfront home. After nine hours in custody, she was released on $30,000 bond. Ms Tsai rose to prominence in the 1980s when she was part of a group of women in Toronto who threw over-the-top charity fundraisers using their husbands' extreme wealth.
