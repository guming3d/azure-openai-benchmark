article: An investigation into an Oklahoma dentist accused of potentially exposing patients to disease confirmed one case of patient-to-patient hepatitis C transmission, health officials said Wednesday. A total of 89 of W. Scott Harrington's patients tested positive for hepatitis C, but at this point only the one case has been directly tied to his dental practice in suburban Tulsa, officials said. Four cases of HIV were also found in his patients; the CDC is conducting genetic testing to determine whether those cases are tied to the dental office. "This is the first documented report of patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis C virus associated with a dental setting in the United States," state epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. "While dental procedures are generally safe, this reinforces the importance of adhering to strict infection control procedures in dental settings." State health investigators shut down Harrington's dental practice in March -- and asked 7,000 of his patients to be tested for hepatitis and HIV -- after health officials found sterilization and other infractions at the oral surgeon's offices. Investigators observed "unauthorized, unlicensed" employees using IVs to sedate patients and improper handling of needles. The drug cabinet was also rife with issues, they said. "I will tell you that when ... we left, we were just physically kind of sick," Susan Rogers, executive director of the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry, told CNN earlier this year. "That's how bad it was, and I've seen a lot of bad stuff over the years." The dentistry board launched its probe after one of Harrington's patients came down with hepatitis C. The Oklahoma Public Health Laboratory has since completed testing for 4,202 of his patients. An unknown number of patients also sought testing though their private health providers, health officials said. Scores of Tulsa dental patients tested for hepatitis, HIV exposure . Harrington voluntarily surrendered his dental license on March 20. Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to liver failure and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 70% to 80% of people living with the virus do not have any symptoms. Hepatitis B is a similar liver disease that can range from a mild illness to a serious, chronic condition. Hepatitis is of particular concern for the Baby Boomer generation -- people  born between 1945 and 1965. This population is five times more likely to have hepatitis C than other generations, the CDC says. More than 55% of Harrington's dental patients who have been identified as having hepatitis C were over the age of 50, the Tulsa Health Department reports.

chatgpt: A dental practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma is under scrutiny after multiple cases of patient-to-patient transmission of infectious diseases surfaced. The practice, run by W. Scott Harrington, has been shut down since March of this year. The latest reports indicate that at least one case of Hepatitis C has been linked to the practice, and four cases of HIV are currently undergoing genetic testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The issue began when the Oklahoma State Department of Health was alerted to a patient with Hepatitis C who did not have any known risk factors for the disease. Upon further investigation, health officials discovered that the patient had received dental treatment at Harrington's practice. Additional testing revealed that the Hepatitis C strain present in the infected patient was a genetic match to that of another patient who had been treated at the practice.  This marks the first case of patient-to-patient transmission of Hepatitis C linked to a dental practice in the United States. Officials have urged all patients who received dental treatment at Harrington's practice from 2007 to 2013 to get tested for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV. It is estimated that up to 7,000 patients may have been exposed to infection during this time. Further investigation into the practice has revealed a number of concerning practices. Inspectors found that some instruments were not being cleaned properly and may have been reused on multiple patients without proper sterilization. Additionally, some medications were found to be expired, and the facility was not equipped to handle medical emergencies. The CDC is currently conducting genetic testing on four patients who have tested positive for HIV and received treatment at the practice. These cases are still under investigation, and it is not yet clear if there is a definitive link to Harrington's practice. Meanwhile, Harrington's license to practice dentistry has been permanently revoked by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. The dentist, who has been practicing for over 30 years, has been accused of a number of violations, including performing unnecessary procedures, ignoring patients' requests for pain medication, and allowing unlicensed assistants to perform tasks such as administering medication and monitoring patients under sedation. The Tulsa Health Department has set up a hotline for patients who received dental treatment at Harrington's practice to receive information and schedule testing. Officials are urging all patients to take advantage of these resources. The case has sparked outrage and concern within the local community, with many calling for stricter regulations to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. The Oklahoma State Dental Association has issued a statement condemning Harrington's actions and emphasizing the importance of proper infection control in dental practices. The association has also urged patients to be proactive about their dental care and to make sure they are receiving treatment from a licensed and reputable professional. As the investigation into Harrington's practice continues, officials are urging patients to take this issue seriously and to seek medical care if they suspect they may have been exposed to Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV. The consequences of ignoring these warning signs can be severe, and it is important for everyone to stay educated about the risks and take appropriate action to protect their health.
