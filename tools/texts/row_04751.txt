article: By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . An Italian doctor has laid bare the country's wasteful public sector after being permitted to work for just 15 days in the past nine years. The unnamed medic, 50, has used a series of reasons to shirk his duties in the casualty department of a hospital near Catania, Sicily, since 2005. These include attending three and five-year university training courses, calling in sick, taking paid leave for 'family' reasons and obtaining a doctorate.

These include attending university training courses . Now, he is the subject of an inquiry at the hospital after being cited as the latest example of how thousands of Italian civil servants are able to avoid work by finding loopholes in the rules. Speaking of the doctor's time off, Sicilian . paper Giornale di Siracusa said: 'We are all paying for this, from . his training courses to his illnesses, to his family leave. However, the medic said he was ‘perplexed’ by the public outcry, adding, ‘Everything I did was legal and proper. 'Even the hospital confirms I have . acted correctly. Going on courses is normal and I am being punished for . developing my understanding.' Inquiry: The doctor, who says his actions were 'legal', is the subject of an inquiry at the hospital (file picture) The doctor first disappeared off on a reportedly taxpayer-funded university course after starting work in 2005, before returning to the hospital three years later, on October 31, 2008. He then immediately obtained paid family leave until May 2009, according to The Telegraph. After starting back at work, he lasted 15 days before calling in sick until July 2009. He then obtained a place on another university course lasting until June this year. He is now reportedly planning to stay off work until December 2016 to complete a phD, said ANSA.

Hospital director Franco Luca admitted that the doctor's absences were allowed within the rules. But he added that he hoped the inquiry would help to reduce time off that was 'not strictly necessary or indispensable'.

chatgpt: A doctor in Italy has come under criticism after it was revealed that he has only worked for 15 days out of the past nine years. The doctor, who is now 50 years old, spent the majority of his time attending university training courses, taking paid leave for 'family' reasons, and calling in sick. He is now planning to undertake a PhD, adding to the perception of him as an example of Italy's wasteful public sector. The doctor in question worked at a hospital near Catania, Sicily, and his lack of attendance has prompted an inquiry into the case. The investigation aims to determine how the doctor was able to take advantage of the system for so long while continuing to receive his salary.  The situation has sparked outrage in Italy, where many people feel that the public sector is bloated and inefficient. Critics argue that the delay in addressing the doctor's absenteeism reflects a broader cultural problem of the acceptance of laziness and incompetence. This case is just the latest example of this perceived issue, and it has once again brought the issue to the surface in Italy. There are many possible explanations for why the doctor was able to get away with such a lack of attendance for so long. For example, it is possible that his colleagues were covering for him, or that the hospital itself was not monitoring his attendance closely. Alternatively, there may have been systemic issues that allowed him to continue receiving his salary without showing up for work.  Regardless of the reasons, it is clear that the Italian public sector needs to do more to ensure that situations like this do not happen in the future. The waste of taxpayer money on employees who are not fulfilling their duties is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.  The case has also highlighted the need for more training and education for doctors in Italy. Many medical professionals in the country feel that they are overworked and underpaid, leading to a lack of motivation and a high level of burnout. By investing in training and professional development, the public sector could help to improve the quality of care provided in Italian hospitals, while also promoting a more engaged and motivated workforce. In conclusion, the case of the doctor who has only worked for 15 days in the past nine years is a stark example of the wastefulness of the Italian public sector. While an inquiry is now underway into the specifics of the case, there is a broader issue at play here that needs to be addressed. Italy needs to take action to ensure that its public sector is more efficient and effective, with an engaged workforce that is committed to providing the best possible care to citizens.
