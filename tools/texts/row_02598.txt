An augmented reality app has brought some of the world's most iconic paintings alive on an iPhone screen.

The iPhone screen then comes to life, displaying animated versions of the picture. Scroll down for video . One of the interactive images shows Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's the Girl with a Pearl Earring. On the iPhone, the girl looks to the camera. 'ARART lets a new story unfold, as if time trapped inside the painting had been stirred alive,' its mkaers say on their website. 'ARART offers a glimpse into the hidden story veiled behind the painting.' The team behind the project have already developed several interactive portraits. The include a version of the Mona Lisa that turns to wink at the viewer, and a version of Van Gogh's sunflowers where the plants blow in the wind. The firm also says the technique can be used for books, and has built a version of 'Alice in Wonderland' where the mad hatter springs to life on the phone screen. 'Everybody is familiar with the beautifully illustrated “Alice in Wonderland', the firm said. 'When reading this novel with ARART, the beloved characters will come to life and move about spiritedly.' The firm is also using the technology to bring books such as Alice in Wonderland to life . The phone shows characters running across pages and jumping around . The team are also developing music applications for the technology, and have already created an app for Radiohead's Kid A album which lets iPhone owners control the record and 'scratch' on their phone's screen. The team are also working with artists to develop special works to take advantage of the technology. A new work by Akamatsu Masayuki integrates sound and video into the artwork, which can only be seen on the phone handset. Radiohead's Kid A can be controlled via the app, with the user scratching the screen to control playback. When the camera is overlaid on the wall panel, ARART will play music and video according to what it sees. A second project, Yutaka Kitamura’s 'Flowering' is an artwork that features blooming flowers recorded in high speed. The paintings display flower buds and when the camera is overlaid onto the paintings, ARART will show clips of the buds blooming into flowers. The app has made three of the interactive portraits available on its website, with more being developed with galleries.

chatgpt: Japan is renowned for its technological advancements, and a new app is continuing that trend. Developed by a Japanese company, it allows users to unlock animated pictures and characters from illustrations on their phones or tablets. The app uses augmented reality to create a unique interactive experience that is both fun and educational. Augmented reality is an advanced technology that superimposes computer generated graphics on a real-world environment. In the case of this app, it uses the device's camera to track an image and then generates the animated graphics in response. This creates a magical experience for users who can watch pictures and characters come to life.  The app has already generated a buzz online, with people excited about the prospect of seeing their favorite illustrations spring to life. One of the most popular images is Van Gogh's famous sunflowers, which are shown blowing in the wind. The animation not only creates a stunning visual effect but also provides insight into the creative process behind Van Gogh's masterpieces. Another popular set of images come from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Users can point their device at the book's illustrations and watch as characters like the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter jump out from the pages. This creates a unique way to experience the classic story, and helps promote reading and imagination for children. The app is not just a fun toy but also has practical applications for educational purposes. Teachers and parents can use it to provide an interactive learning experience for children, making it easier to retain information through an interactive platform. For instance, a biology teacher could use the app to demonstrate how cells look and behave under a microscope. Similarly, a history teacher could explore ancient ruins and buildings with a touch of a button. One of the app's developers, Hiroyuki Oki, explained the app's potential to the Japan Times, “We wanted to bring art to life in a new and innovative way. By giving users the ability to experience illustrations in augmented reality, we hope to encourage their creativity and imagination.” The app is available on both iOS and Android, and is free to download. However, users must purchase image packs to unlock the augmented reality experience for specific artworks. The image packs are reasonably priced, starting at 100 yen, and include various artworks from different artists and genres. In conclusion, the app is a fantastic way to experience art and literature in a new and exciting way. It harnesses the power of augmented reality to create a unique interactive experience, providing both entertainment and educational benefits. It's clear that the app's developers have achieved their aim of bringing art to life, and it is sure to be a hit with both children and adults alike.
