article: (CNN) -- Just one week after suffering an on-field cardiac arrest, soccer player Fabrice Muamba was able to watch most of his team Bolton's emotional victory over English Premier League relegation rivals Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. "The fact he was able to watch a large part of the game, given where we were a week ago, is great news," Bolton manager Owen Coyle told the club's website on Monday. "He was pleased that his teammates won the match, although he fell back asleep when the score was 2-0." The 23-year-old midfielder's heart stopped for 78 minutes following his collapse during the previous weekend's FA Cup quarterfinal against Tottenham, which will be replayed on Tuesday following its initial abandonment at halftime. Bolton beat Blackburn 2-1, boosting the club's hopes of staying in the top division. Fans lay shirts outside the stadium showing their support for Muamba before the match, then inside they held up cards which spelled out his name and shirt number in a huge mosaic. His continued recovery has been described by the head of world football, FIFA president Sepp Blatter, as "a miracle" and his plight has attracted international attention, with players across Europe taking to the field in t-shirts expressing support for the Kinshasa-born player. "In the last 48 hours he is beginning to become aware of the global response, and he is overwhelmed by all the support," Coyle said. "His family continue to spend time with Fabrice and a couple of players will visit him over these next few days to represent the squad. He is still in intensive care and it's important that he doesn't have too many visitors as he continues his recovery, step by step." The London Chest Hospital, where Muamba is being treated, confirmed that he is making progress. "His condition is serious but stable," it said in a joint statement with Bolton. "He continues to make encouraging progress in his recovery. "Over the weekend, he has been able to sit out of bed for a short time, watch television and has begun to eat. However, he will need to continue to be closely monitored by the medical team here for some time." Born in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Muamba came to the UK with his family in 1999 at the age of 11 and went on to captain England's Under-21 team. He made his name at Birmingham before joining Bolton in 2008.

chatgpt: Former Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba, who suffered a cardiac arrest during a match against Tottenham on March 17, was able to watch some of his old team's 2-1 victory over Blackburn on Tuesday. The news was revealed by Bolton manager Dougie Freedman, who said that Muamba is progressing well but is still in intensive care at a London hospital. "He's still got a long way to go," said Freedman, "but it's great that he was able to watch the game and see the support that is out there for him. He's becoming more aware of it every day and he's very grateful for all the messages he's received." Muamba's collapse, which occurred during an FA Cup quarter-final match, shocked the footballing world and led to an outpouring of support for the 23-year-old player. He was given CPR on the pitch and taken to hospital, where he remained in a critical condition for several days. Since then, however, Muamba's condition has improved steadily. He began to breathe without the aid of a ventilator and was able to sit up and communicate with family members. It is not yet clear what caused the cardiac arrest, but doctors have said that Muamba's survival was remarkable given the severity of his condition. Freedman, who took over as Bolton manager after Muamba's collapse, has been in regular contact with the player and his family. He said that Muamba's progress had lifted the spirits of everyone at the club and was a testament to the strength of the human spirit. "He's an incredible guy and he's fighting every day," said Freedman. "Seeing him make progress has been an inspiration to all of us. It just shows you what can be achieved when people come together." Muamba's plight has also led to calls for greater awareness of heart conditions in sport. The midfielder had no history of heart problems and his collapse was completely unexpected. However, the incident has prompted many to question whether enough is being done to screen athletes for potentially life-threatening conditions. For now, though, the focus remains on Muamba's recovery. His family has expressed their gratitude for the support they have received and have asked for privacy as they continue to stand by his side. "We just want to thank everyone for their kindness and their prayers," said Muamba's father. "We are all pulling for Fabrice and we know that with God's help he will come through this."
