A British mother is desperate to get her daughter back after she was snatched in Egypt by her father for a second time. Leila Sabra fought an eight-month battle for custody of five-year-old daughter A'ishah after she was taken in 2009. The 35-year-old, from Whitefield, Greater Manchester, moved to Cairo and was reunited with the youngster after her father Saber Mesbah Sabra was arrested. Happy: Leila Sabra with A'ishah after the two were reunited in 2010 . But Mrs Sabra says he failed to return A'ishah after an access visit three months ago. She has now returned to the UK in a bid to get help from the Government after living in Cairo since 2009. A'ishah is thought to be at her father's home in the mountain village of Khafr-el-Sheikh. Mrs Sabra told the Manchester Evening News that the 'chaos' in Egypt following revolution had prevented her getting support from the country's police and courts. Kidnapper: Saber Mesbah Sabra is believed to have taken A'ishah to his home village . She said: 'I cannot believe this has happened again, I am terrified something will happen to A'ishah as Egypt is not a safe place at the moment.' Mrs Sabra added that she'd spoken to her daughter on the phone and she was 'unhappy and crying'. She had met her former husband when she went to the country on holiday in 2005. They married months later and the family lived in Egypt, where Mr Sabra ran a quad biking company. The two moved to Whitefield when Mrs Sabra began to suffer from medical problems while pregnant. A'ishah was born at St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester and the family moved back to Egypt soon after. But the relationship broke down and Mrs Sabra returned to England, agreeing that their daughter would visit once a year. A'ishah was first snatched by her father in May 2009 during a supervised visit to the east coast city of Hurghada. The two-year-old was snatched from a cafe, bundled into the back of a car and driven away. Leila searched Egypt for her daughter and the two were reunited after Leila was awarded custody by the Egyptian courts in January 2010. A'ishah's father was arrested by Egyptian police but was later released. A Foreign Office spokesperson said they were aware of the case and were providing consular assistance.

chatgpt: In a heart-wrenching turn of events, a young girl named A'ishah Sabra has been kidnapped once again by her father, Saber. This is not the first time that A'ishah has been taken from her home, as she was first snatched in 2009. At that time, her mother, Leila, fought for and ultimately won custody of A'ishah. However, despite Leila's efforts to keep her daughter safe, Saber has taken matters into his own hands yet again. Leila, who had been living in Egypt with A'ishah, has now returned to the UK in search of government help. It is unclear at this time what steps the UK government will take to assist Leila in finding her daughter, but it is likely that law enforcement agencies will be involved in the search. The details of A'ishah's abduction have not been released, but the kidnapping has undoubtedly caused great distress for both A'ishah and her mother. This is not the first time that parental kidnapping has made headlines, and it serves as a stark reminder that custody disputes can lead to dangerous situations for children and their families. According to reports, Leila had been living in Egypt with A'ishah since 2009, when Saber first took the child from her home. Leila fought in court to regain custody of her daughter and was successful, but it seems that Saber was not willing to accept the decision of the courts. Parental kidnapping is a serious crime, and those who are found guilty can face severe penalties. However, the emotional toll that these cases take on families is immeasurable. Children who are abducted by a parent often suffer from trauma, and the impact of the event can last a lifetime. It is clear that Leila is desperate to find her daughter and is seeking any help that she can. The tragedy of this situation is that A'ishah is caught in the middle of a dispute between her parents, and her life is now in danger. Many will be hoping that A'ishah is found safe and well, and that those responsible for her abduction are brought to justice. Only time will tell what the outcome of this situation will be, but for now, the focus must be on finding A'ishah and keeping her safe from harm.
