article: (CNN) -- The 2014 Grammy Awards are in the books, and in typical fashion, there were some notable moments. These five were among the best: . 1. Daft Punk and their dancin' friends perform "Get Lucky." The recorded version of "Get Lucky" -- which went on to win record of the year -- already featured Pharrell's vocals and Nile Rodgers' distinctive guitar. But the Grammys' added attraction was Stevie Wonder, who dominated the awards in the mid-'70s (he has three album of the year honors). Wonder can still bring out the best in his collaborators -- including the robot-headed Daft Punk, who played from the "control room" of the recording studio set and moved like, well, robots. Still, the group would make for a great tour. 2. Old royalty, new royalty . The Beatles' Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr were in the audience and earned frequent shout outs from such presenters as host LL Cool J, Dave Grohl and Jamie Foxx. (You'd think there was some kind of Beatles' anniversary coming up.) But there was also plenty of deference to Jay Z and Beyonce. The pair led off the show with a rousing version of "Drunk in Love," and Jay Z later won a Grammy for rap/sung collaboration. Jay Z mentioned his child-in-waiting, baby Blue, in his acceptance speech. Stars rock all-white ensembles . 3. Nifty performances, as usual . The Grammys always try hard to match known names with rising stars, and this year, the pairings paid off with several performances. There was the Daft Punk melange, of course, but also the combination of Imagine Dragons and Kendrick Lamar (with an electric "Radioactive") and the duet of classical pianist Lang Lang and metal stars Metallica. Trent Reznor, Macklemore tell us how they really feel . 4. The new faces did well . Early on, it looked like it was going to be a huge night for Macklemore & Ryan Lewis -- especially after they won three of the rap categories over competition that included Jay Z and Kanye West. The duo also won best new artist. Later in the show, it was Lorde who shined, picking up song of the year for "Royals." The 17-year-old New Zealander seemed particularly taken aback by her win, letting co-writer Joel Little give his speech first. Grammys 2014: Pharrell's hat gets life -- and Twitter -- of its own . 5. Pharrell's hat . What can be said about the chapeau that launched at least four Twitter accounts with a combined 10,000-plus followers? It looked like something Smokey the Bear might wear. Or maybe Dudley Do-Right. Either way, it became a source of fun for Grammy watchers throughout the evening. Watch out: Given the way things work these days, it could get a show of its own by March.

chatgpt: The 56th annual Grammy Awards ceremony held in 2014 was filled with memorable moments and stellar performances that captivated audiences worldwide. From groundbreaking collaborations to outstanding solo acts, the night was a tribute to music. One of the highlights of the evening was Stevie Wonder's electrifying rendition of Daft Punk's hit "Get Lucky". Accompanied by Nile Rodgers and Pharrell Williams, the performance was a tribute to the soulful 70s era that inspired the Grammy-winning song. Wonder's energy on stage, along with the musical prowess of Rodgers and Williams, brought the audience to their feet and set the tone for the rest of the evening. Another notable mention at the ceremony was The Beatles. With the 50th anniversary of their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, affectionately referred to as the "Beatles Invasion", the band was on everyone's mind that night. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr came together on stage for the first time in years to perform McCartney's song "Queenie Eye". The audience was transported back in time to the early days of Beatlemania, and the nostalgia factor was palpable. But one of the most talked-about moments of the night was Pharrell Williams' hat. The singer-songwriter, known for his quirky fashion sense, donned a tall, bell-shaped hat that drew comparisons to the Arby's logo. The internet was ablaze with jokes and memes about the now-famous headgear, with some even speculating that the hat had its own Twitter account. Nevertheless, Williams stole the spotlight that evening and made a lasting impression with his unique fashion sense. The 2014 Grammy Awards were also a platform for spreading the love and positivity that music can bring. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis performed their hit "Same Love" with Mary Lambert, joined by Queen Latifah and a group of couples who were wed on stage during the performance. The song, which celebrates equality and acceptance, was a powerful message that resonated with audiences around the world. The legendary duo of Beyonce and Jay-Z also had a joint performance, cementing their status as one of the music industry's power couples. The Queen Bey sang her hit "Drunk in Love" while Jay-Z joined her on stage, and the chemistry between the two was palpable. In summary, the 2014 Grammy Awards were filled with moments that will be remembered for years to come. From Stevie Wonder's iconic performance to Pharrell Williams' unforgettable hat, the ceremony was a celebration of the best in music. It was a night full of surprises, positive messages, and outstanding talent, showcasing just how much music can bring people together.
