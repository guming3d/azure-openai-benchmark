article: By . Louise Eccles . Missing: Mami Konneh Lahun, who finished 20th in the London Marathon, disappeared after the race . Sierra Leone’s fastest long-distance runner has disappeared after completing the London Marathon. Police said Mami Konneh Lahun, 24, vanished after crossing the finish line on Sunday in 21st place. The alarm was raised when she failed to return to her accommodation in Greenwich, East London, ahead of her flight home on Monday. It is thought the athlete may have fled to avoid returning to Sierra Leone. It is not uncommon for athletes from developing nations to run away during international competitions or claim asylum. During the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, two-thirds of the Sierra Leone team disappeared. Twenty-one people from the 30-strong team failed to catch their flight home. At the London 2012 Olympics, 82 athletes, coaches and officials claimed political asylum. Police admitted last year that they were still looking for 21 people who had vanished after the Games. Miss Lahun, who was nominated for Sports Personality of the Year in Sierra Leone last year, has won marathons in her own country and neighbouring Liberia. She was the first runner to represent the West African nation in the London Marathon, finishing the race in two hours and 46 minutes.

chatgpt: Mami Konneh Lahun, a 24-year-old athlete from Sierra Leone, made history at the London Marathon on Sunday as she became the first woman to represent her country in the prestigious race. However, she has been reported missing since finishing the 26.2-mile course. According to witnesses, Lahun crossed the finish line with a time of 2 hours, 46 minutes, and 48 seconds, which placed her in the top 20 finishers out of over 40,000 participants. She was elated to have represented her country and was looking forward to flying back to Sierra Leone on Monday. However, concerns arose when Lahun failed to make her scheduled flight back to her home country. Scotland Yard police officials have launched a search effort to locate the missing athlete, and her family and friends have expressed grave concern for her safety. Lahun's family shared their distress, stating that they have not heard from Mami since she crossed the finish line on Sunday. Her father, Moses Konneh, said, "We are praying for her safe return. She's the pride of our family and country, and we're anxious to learn where she is and that she's okay." As the search continues, the London Marathon organizers have also extended their support, releasing a statement saying, "We are concerned for the welfare of Mami Konneh Lahun, who was reported missing after the race. We are working with the police to help them in their search efforts and extend our deepest sympathies to her family and friends at this time." Lahun is known for her dedication and passion for athletics, particularly in the area of long-distance running. Her participation in the London Marathon was a significant feat, and her achievement in representing her country as the first Sierra Leonean woman was a tremendous accomplishment. The police investigation into Mami's disappearance is underway, and authorities are urging anyone with information about her whereabouts to come forward. Anyone with information can contact the London Metropolitan Police.
