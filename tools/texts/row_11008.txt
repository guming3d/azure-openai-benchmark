More than 350 rescue workers -- a mix of police, firefighters and military personnel -- began climbing two separate routes up the mountain on Sunday morning, authorities in the nearby village of Otaki said. They said they observed 17-20 inches (40-50 centimeters) of volcanic ash covering the ground in some areas. High alert . The Japan Meteorological Agency has raised the Volcanic Alert Level for Ontake from 1 to 3. That means the public is advised to not approach the volcano, the summit of which is at an altitude of 10,060 feet (3,067 meters). The agency warned that another large eruption could take place in the next six days or so. Small continuous eruptions continued Sunday. The volcano's plume of smoke and ash was reported to have disrupted air travel in Japan, causing delays at several airports. Mount Ontake, the second tallest volcano in Japan, after Mount Fuji, is a popular destination for hikers, especially in the fall when the foliage's rich autumn colors are on display. The last major eruption of Mount Ontake, which is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of Tokyo, took place in 1979, according to the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian Institute. That eruption lasted months, spewing out more than 200,000 tons of ash, the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported.
