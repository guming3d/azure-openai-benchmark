When  this brazen fox snuck into Fred Rossington’s home, his first thought was to ensure his grandchildren and wife were safe and out of its way. His second thought was to grab the camera. Mr Rossington who lives with his wife, Karen, in Horsham, West Sussex, spotted this pesky fox race across his living room after it crept in through the back door - left open for just a few minutes. The fox entered Fred Rossington's house looking for a tasty snack . The bold animal had run past the Rossington’s pet dog in the garden and even his pen of chickens – a more traditional snack for foxes - in pursuit of a more human treat. And it seems the fox would go to great lengths to find it. After coming to face-to-face with Mr Rossington in the lounge, undeterred, he ran over the top of the couch and headed for the kitchen. Foxes have been spotted in broad daylight as they have become used to human contact . He then leaped on to the work tops, scattering sharp cooking knives all over the floor, clambering over their Aga cooker in a desperate hunt for food. It was only upon being shooed and kicked away that the fully-grown mammal gave up and left the house. Mr Rossington said: ‘Amazingly, it then ran ten metres, stopped and looked back at me, before wandering off to the fields. ‘After telling my wife to close the door and stay in the living room, I was just thankful none of my grandchildren were at the house, as they often are. The grandfather of five said that both his lounge and kitchen are decorated in cream so his main concern became that ‘it would defecate everywhere, ruining the furniture. My wife wouldn’t have been happy about that.' Mr Rossington, who runs a data installation company with his wife, added: The fox was not frightened of me at all, it must have been used to human contact. The smell of my dog must have been everywhere to.’

chatgpt: In a quiet neighborhood in the outskirts of London, a family has a terrifying experience with a wild animal that crept its way inside their home. The Rossingtons were just settling in for the evening when they heard a commotion coming from the kitchen. Upon investigation, they discovered a fox had found its way into their home through an open back door. At first, the Rossingtons were stunned by the unexpected visitor. But as they watched the animal rummaging through their kitchen, they quickly realized the danger it posed to their family and their pets. Wasting no time, Fred Rossington made sure his family were safely out of harm's way before attempting to deal with the fox. Despite being outnumbered, the fox did not seem intimidated by the presence of the Rossingtons. It appeared to have a singular objective in mind, and that was to satisfy its hunger. It bypassed the chicken pen outside in favor of the food that the Rossingtons had prepared in their kitchen. Fred Rossington then proceeded to try and get the animal out of their home by taking photographs of it. However, the fox was not in the mood for such intrusion, and a scuffle began between the two. With his adrenaline pumping, Fred managed to get the fox to retreat, and soon after he closed the door to ensure the animal wouldn't make a comeback. The Rossingtons were fortunate to come out of the ordeal unscathed. However, the terrifying experience has left them shaken and concerned about the safety of their home. They urge all families to be vigilant when it comes to keeping their homes secured to avoid similar incidents. The local wildlife conservation authorities have advised on the proper measures to take when dealing with wild animals, particularly those found in residential areas. They suggest that homeowners put measures in place to prevent wild animals from entering their homes, such as installing screens on doors and windows and using secured garbage bins. In conclusion, the Rossingtons' experience highlights the importance of home security, particularly when it comes to dealing with wild animals. By taking the necessary steps to protect their family and pets, they were able to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. It is a lesson that all homeowners should take to heart, particularly those living on the outskirts of cities where wildlife is more prevalent.
