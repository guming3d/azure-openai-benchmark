article: A leading New Zealand wine brand will begin their upcoming harvesting season by herding an unorthodox new team into their workforce. South Island winery Brancott Estate will employ Wooly Workers, a flock of about 2000 sheep, to pluck leaves from the vine canopy and uncover the ripening grapes in preparation for picking. The breed of Romney/Corriedale cross-ewes create a speedier and more efficient means of preparing grapes to be picked at their prime. Woolly Workers pave the way for harvest at Brancott Estate on South Island New Zealand . The flock of 2000 sheep will pluck leaves from the vine canopy and uncover the ripening grapes in preparation for picking . Patrick Materman, Chief Winemaker at Brancott Estate, told Daily Mail Australia the Wooly Workers'have been years in the making. 'We have been experimenting with a few different methods for years. In 2011 we first realised the sheep could be integral to harvesting juicy grapes,' he said. 'Not only are they quicker and more efficient than human or mechanical leaf-pluckers, they are just the right height to pluck all the leaves around the bunches, without causing any damage to the fruit.' While using tractors to pluck the leaves burns an immense amount of diesel, human labourours are highly cost ineffective. Leaf removal is particularly important for Pinot Noir vines, as the developing fruit needs to be exposed to sunlight to increase flavour and colour in the berries.

'New Zealand has cool weather, so this method is very important here. What's more, the dry summer weather means there tends to be very little green feed left on the farms in Marlborough, so they love to come here for a good meal – and luckily for us, they're not interested in the grapes.' While the method has proven highly effective, it does require close monitoring of the sheep to ensure they do not eat the higher canopy's. 'You'd be forgiven for thinking we're pulling the wool over your eyes,' said Materman. 'But sheep play a vital role in preparing the vineyards for harvest.' The dry summer weather means there tends to be very little green feed left on the farms in Marlborough, so the sheep are ready for a good meal .

chatgpt: New Zealand winery Brancott Estate has found a unique solution to its vineyard maintenance problem – sheep. The winery will employ around 2000 sheep as leaf pluckers for its vineyards. These 'woolly workers' have been brought in to pluck leaves from the vine canopy to uncover the grape bunches, which will help the grapes ripen better in the sunlight. According to the company, the sheep are more efficient than human or mechanical leaf pluckers when it comes to plucking leaves from the vines. This is because the sheep can carefully nibble on the leaves, leaving the grapes untouched. The sheep will only remove the leaves that are shading the grapes from the sunlight, which helps the grapes to fully ripen. The climate in New Zealand is well-suited to grape growing, but exposing the vines to sunlight is crucial for a successful season. If the grapes do not get enough sunlight, they will not fully ripen, which can lead to a poor quality harvest. The sheep will help to ensure that the grapes are fully exposed to the sun so that they can ripen properly. Brancott Estate has a long-standing commitment to sustainable and eco-friendly practices in its vineyards. By using sheep as natural leaf pluckers, the winery is reducing both the use of fossil fuels and the amount of labor required for vineyard maintenance. Moreover, sheep manure is a natural fertilizer and will help to enrich the soil, promoting healthy vine growth. The sheep employed by Brancott Estate are a specific breed of sheep called "Wiltshire Horns". These sheep do not have wool, which makes them ideal for working in the vineyards. Unlike woolly sheep, Wiltshire Horns are resistant to woolly aphids, which can damage the grapevines.  The use of sheep in vineyard maintenance is not a new concept. Many wineries in Europe have been using the animals for centuries to keep the vineyards tidy. However, this is a relatively new concept for New Zealand wineries. The employment of sheep as leaf pluckers is not only good for the environment but also a humane practice. The sheep will graze freely in the vineyards and help to keep the vines healthy without being harmed in any way. The use of sheep in vineyard maintenance is just one innovative idea that Brancott Estate is using to promote sustainability in its winemaking practices. The winery also produces wine in an eco-friendly way, using solar power and other sustainable technologies. In conclusion, Brancott Estate's employment of sheep as natural leaf pluckers is an innovative and sustainable solution to vineyard maintenance. This practice will help the winery to produce high-quality grapes, while preserving the natural environment and promoting animal welfare. With the use of these 'woolly workers', Brancott Estate is leading the charge for sustainable vineyard practices in New Zealand.
