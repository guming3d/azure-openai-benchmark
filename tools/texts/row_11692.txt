chatgpt: Projection company, Artichoke, is offering art enthusiasts a chance to have their creativity displayed on a grand scale. The company is setting up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for individuals to have their image of artwork, message or photograph projected onto the iconic White Cliffs of Dover. The project follows the success of the H&M marketing stunt, where David Beckham was projected onto the cliffs in 2013 donning the brand's underwear range. The projection attracted worldwide attention, and since then, Artichoke has planned to allow the public to experience the same privilege. The idea is to offer artists and the public the chance to see their creations displayed on one of the most recognizable natural landmarks in the world. Although it is not clear when the projections will take place, the company is thrilled about the opportunity. Helen Marriage, Artichoke's co-founder and artistic director, claims that "the White Cliffs of Dover are one of the most potent symbols of our island nation, and we're delighted to be opening them up in this way." Artists who are interested in the project can submit their ideas through Artichoke's website. The online application process closes on Friday 21 May, and successful applicants will be notified by Friday 28 May. Those successful will need to confirm their participation by Tuesday 1 June to ensure they are included in the final shortlist. The projections will have a duration of approximately 30 minutes, with the finalists' artwork displayed over the four consecutive nights in September from the 8th to 11th. The timing of the event takes advantage of a new moon, which provides ambient lighting to highlight the cliff's natural beauty. This unique idea provides an extraordinary opportunity for budding artists to showcase their work on the iconic landmark. As well as being a distinct PR tactic, projecting onto the cliffs is a rare artistic spectacle that demonstrates the creativity that can be used to capture the essence of exceptional locations. The White Cliffs of Dover are a significant draw for tourists and are a symbol of the United Kingdom's history and geography. The project aims to celebrate the Kent coastline and bring back tourism to the area. The region has had a tough year with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the project aims to showcase England's coastline positively. With a chance to be part of an iconic spectacle, Artichoke's public projection opportunity is sure to attract significant interest from artists and the public alike. For those passionate about art and the UK coastline, submitting their artwork for inclusion is an opportunity not to be missed.
