article: (CNN) -- Eduard Khil, a Soviet-era singing star who found renewed popularity as the viral Web's "Mr. Trololo," died Monday, Russian media reported. Khil had been in a St. Petersburg, Russia, hospital since suffering a stroke in April. He was 77. Khil was considered one of the Soviet Union's great performers in the '60s and '70s. But his claim to fame in the rest of the world came in 2009 after a YouTube video posting of him performing the Russian pop song "I Am Glad, 'Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home." With a toothy grin, Khil delivers a clearly lip-synced performance minus lyrics, instead using a series of made-up syllables, including the "trololololo" that captured the hearts of millions. According to New Music Express, the original lyrics, about a cowboy riding his horse home to meet his sweetheart Mary, were censored because they were deemed "un-Soviet." That led to his "mouth music" version, which ends up sounding like a mash-up of yodeling and jazz-era scat singing over a cheesy orchestral arrangement. Soon, the video was being used online as a new target for the bait-and-switch Rickroll meme in which a user posts a link to something supposedly relevant or interesting but turns out to be a ridiculous or annoying video or image instead. The original video was viewed more than 12 million times, with alternate versions and parodies racking up millions more. Khil became aware of the song's viral success after hearing his grandson humming the tune, according to Know Your Meme. Khil performed it several times afterward, with family members even starting a YouTube channel for him. On Monday, Khil was remembered on the same social-media sites where his video spread. Several tributes had been voted up to the main page of Reddit, and both his real name and "Mr. Trololo" were trending on Twitter. "Oh no, Mr. Trololo (i.e. Eduard Khil) has died," Jon Fingas, an editor for tech blog Engadget, wrote on the site. "The world is a sadder place. ... I'm glad the Internet gave him a lasting memory!"

chatgpt: Eduard Khil, a popular singer of the Soviet era, may have passed away in 2012, but his memory still lives on as an internet sensation. Known to many as “Mr. Trololo,” Khil’s wordless song and quirky performance brought him renewed fame decades after his early career in the ’60s and ’70s. The story begins when Khil recorded a song called “I Am Glad, Cause I’m Finally Returning Back Home,” in 1976. However, the Soviet censors weren’t too pleased with the lyrics, as it contained a reference to the American cowboy, and they banned it from being performed. Despite this hurdle, Khil was determined to share his music and began performing the song without the lyrics, instead using nonsense syllables to create a melody. Khil’s performance of the newly titled “Trololo” became an unexpected hit, both in the Soviet Union and around the world after it surfaced on the internet in the late 2000s. The bizarre and comical nature of Khil’s delivery, combined with his distinct mustache and fashion sense, made him an instant sensation. It wasn’t long before the video of his performance became a new form of the iconic Rickroll meme, where unsuspecting viewers would be directed to the video under false pretenses. Many viewers couldn’t help but be drawn in by the sheer enthusiasm that Khil radiated as he sang. His looks and mannerisms were just as remarkable as his voice, and he quickly became an internet sensation. Even as he passed away in 2012, his music has continued to thrive, and his face remains widely recognizable on the internet today. Many people consider Khil to be one of the pioneers of the “viral video” movement. In many ways, Eduard Khil’s legacy is proof that creativity and ingenuity can flourish in the most unexpected places. Despite the Soviet regime’s attempts to suppress new art, Khil’s determination to express himself led him to create something that resonated with a global audience long after it was first recorded. Today, he is remembered as a symbol of artistic freedom and a beloved internet icon that captured the hearts of millions.
