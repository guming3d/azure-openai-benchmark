article: Washington (CNN) -- Louisiana won't know which candidate will represent the state in the next Congress until December. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy will face off in a December runoff, CNN projects. The two candidates also faced off against another Republican, tea party-backed Col. Rob Maness (ret.) in Louisiana's "jungle primary" system. The system gave candidates from both parties a chance to slug it out together instead of settling on a nominee in the summer like most states. But one candidate has to hit 50% of the vote to avoid a December runoff. The polls have favored a runoff for weeks now, with the No. 3 candidate Maness pulling enough votes from the right to keep Cassidy neck-and-neck with Landrieu and below the 50% threshold. Landrieu's rough fight for re-election came amid sagging approval for President Barack Obama in the state, where only 40% of Louisiana voters approved of Obama according to a CNN/ORC poll. The three-term incumbent even tied Obama's unpopularity in the state to racism in the South last week. "I'll be very, very honest with you. The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans," Landrieu told NBC News' Chuck Todd, while also citing Obama's moratorium on off-shore drilling and energy issues as the "number one" issue for why Louisianans do not like the president. "It's been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader." And while Cassidy hammered Landrieu over those comments, he faced heat over racially-tinged remarks in September when he said Harry Reid "runs the Senate like a plantation." Like many other Democrats with tough reelection challenges, Landrieu has kept Obama at arm's length and has sought to deflect Republican attacks tying her to the President. Landrieu has also faced attacks from her Republican opponents over her reputation as one of the Senate's most frequent flyers -- billing the federal government more than $47,000 in flights in 2013 alone. And in September, Landrieu's campaign reimbursed the federal government more than $33,000 in flights that should have been billed to her Senate office. View the full results .

chatgpt: After a closely watched election night, it seems like the Louisiana Senate race is headed for a runoff in December. With neither of the two major party candidates reaching the required 50% threshold, incumbent Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu will now face off against Republican Representative Bill Cassidy.  Tuesday's election in Louisiana was a unique race, known as a "jungle primary," where candidates from both parties are listed on the same ballot and compete against each other in a winner-takes-all showdown. This system is used by only a handful of states, including California, where voters can choose from any candidate, regardless of party affiliation.  Under the Louisiana primary system, if no candidate reaches the 50% threshold, then the top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, will compete against each other in a runoff election. This is what will happen in December when Landrieu and Cassidy square off. With millions of dollars spent by both the Democratic and Republican parties, plus various outside groups, the stakes in this race are high. Control of the Senate is at risk, and given Louisiana's conservative leanings, Republican Cassidy is seen as the frontrunner heading into the runoff. After serving in the Senate since 1997, Landrieu is now facing her toughest re-election battle yet. She has gained national notoriety in recent months due to her support for the Affordable Care Act, which is deeply unpopular in many parts of the state. Additionally, her voting record has been highlighted by Republicans as being too closely aligned with President Obama. Meanwhile, Cassidy is a current member of the House of Representatives, representing Louisiana's 6th Congressional District. As a doctor-turned-politician, he has gained much of his support by attacking Landrieu's record on healthcare and emphasizing his own experience as a physician. Despite the bruising and expensive nature of the primary election, the two candidates are expected to double down on their previous campaign strategies during the runoff election. With all eyes on Louisiana, the Senate race is sure to be one of the most closely watched races of the 2014 midterm elections.
