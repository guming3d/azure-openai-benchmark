article: For most of us, roadside services are a road trip's necessary evil - an oasis off the motorway offering fast food, pre-packaged sandwiches and fuel. For Nicole Scherzinger, they're an adventure worth celebrating and sharing with the world. After performing at the Free Radio Live concert in Birmingham, Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton's other half did a service to services everywhere by giving them, bizarrely along with Britain as a whole, her most enthusiastic endorsement in a fun Instagram saga. Scroll down for video . Nicole Scherzinger begins her fun Instagram saga at a roadside services after the Free Live Radio concert . The opening scene, shot on a smartphone on Saturday and posted on Sunday, is her mouth-wide-open shock and delight at seeing a Papa John's at the services. 'Here's alit story, an adventure with #Scherzy when she's on the #Run after a show and discovers a service station in the #UK!' she posted with a sneaky plug for her single Run from her second solo album Big Fat Lie. But then came her disappointment at said pizza joint being closed. After her excitement at seeing a Papa John's, the singer is disappointed to see the pizza outlet closed . Scherzinger, 36, performs at the Free Radio Live concert at Birmingham's LG Arena on Saturday . 'Sweet baby Jesus! there's a #PapaJohns in the UK! Wait, What?! It's not open???' All wasn't lost though for our intrepid adventurer though, with a taste of her home in the US, Kentucky, on offer. 'But wait! #KFC is still open, taking me back, to back home #KY. Live it, love it taste it, Who doesn't want some of that!?' Of course, it was then time for a romantic interlude in the former X Factor judge's little tale with the love interest being a Krispy Kreme outlet - she was so taken by the sugary treats her hashtag was all-encompassing. 'Is that a #krispykreme I dare see?! #everything,' she posted . Home comforts! Scherzinger, who calls Kentucky home when in the US, plugs its associated Fried Chicken . Far from her glamorous usual self, the star straddles a Krispy Kreme doughnut stand - also closed . She had to settle for a selection of chocolate bars at the end of her 'adventure', but didn't seem to mind . After flashing her washboard abs during an energetic set, Scherzinger went hunting fast food . Chocolate bars served as the stars for the big finale, though we doubt their ending is as happy as Scherzinger's. 'My adventure has come to an end and I figured why not top it off with some English candy bars! I love this country and their service stations.' Unfortunately, it is not known which services exactly received such praise from the star, but surely it won't be long until they're cashing in on the Scherzinger seal of approval.
