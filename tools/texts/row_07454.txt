article: Free: Kristle Vandever, 44, has escaped criminal charges despite admitting to having sexual relations with students . An elementary school teacher who admitted having sexual relations with students has escaped prison after prosecutors declined to bring charges against her. Kristle Vandever, 44, resigned two years ago after the allegations first emerged - but she has only just had her teaching licence revoked. Shortly after quitting, the 21-year veteran wrote an email admitting: 'I just can't help wanting these hot young boys... and they want me.' She also appeared to imply that she could have faced legal action if her victims had spoken up as she wrote, 'no witnesses coming forward'. Vandever taught English as a second language at McNary Heights Elementary School in Umatilla, Oregon, having qualified as a teacher in 1989, according to the Hermiston Herald. After an investigation into allegations she had had sex with students was launched in early 2010, she resigned from the school in May 2010. Just weeks after her resignation, she sent an email from her work account saying: 'No jail for me and that is only because of luck... no witnesses coming forward. 'He said he was of legal age, but he lied. I just can't help wanting these hot young boys... and they want me. 'Who am I to spoil a young man's fantasy. Damn.' However, after a lengthy police investigation, the local District Attorney declined to file criminal charges against Vandever. The state's Teacher Standards and Practices Commission launched its own inquiry into the teacher's behaviour, and found a number of serious offences. Resigned: Vandever stepped down from her job at McNary Heights Elementary School in May 2010 . A report concluded that she had performed oral sex on 'one or more' students in her car, as well as giving students alcohol. It also found that video of Vandever engaged in sexual activity with a boy was filmed on a cell phone and passed round other students. Last month, the teacher had her licence withdrawn as a result of the findings. She did not appeal against the revocation or the conclusions of the report.

chatgpt: In a stunning revelation that has shocked both parents and educators alike, Kristle Vandever, a former elementary school teacher in a small town in Louisiana, has resigned from her position amidst allegations she had sexual relations with students. However, despite mounting evidence against her, she has so far escaped prosecution for her actions. The matter came to light after a report was filed to the school district authorities, stating that Vandever had indulged in sexual activities with multiple students in her car. Additionally, the damning report also mentioned that the footage of these activities was circulated around the school, adding to the gravity of these allegations. The report led to an investigation that corroborated the allegations against Vandever. Following the investigation, the school district authorities informed the police and revoked Vandever's teaching license. The police also interviewed the students involved and their parents, leading to a greater understanding of the situation and the recognition of the gravity of the situation. Vandever, who had taught at the elementary school for several years, immediately resigned after the allegations surfaced. However, despite the evidence against her, she has not yet been charged for her actions. Legal officials are currently reviewing the case and will decide whether or not the case merits a criminal investigation. The parents of the affected students and other members of the community have expressed outrage and concern over the incident. Many have criticized the school district for not acting swiftly enough in the matter and demanded better safeguards for their children. In a statement, the school district authorities expressed their deep regret over the matter and vowed to ensure that such incidents do not occur again in the future. The school board also committed to stricter screening and vetting processes of teachers and other school personnel to ensure the safety and well-being of children. The incident has sparked a renewed debate over the safety of children in schools and the role of teachers and school authorities in ensuring their safety. The authorities have called for greater attention and resources to be dedicated to protecting children from incidents of abuse and exploitation. As the investigation continues, the community remains in shock and disbelief over the allegations against Vandever. Whether or not justice prevails, the incident serves as a warning of the dangers that can lurk in school environments and the need for greater vigilance and action to prevent incidents of child exploitation and abuse.
