article: (CNN) -- Same-sex marriage in Alaska can move forward after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected the state's request to delay enforcement. The one-sentence order from the justices denying a stay means gays and lesbians could soon legally wed. Less than an hour later, a federal judge in Wyoming did the same in that Western state. Barring any continued legal intervention, that would make Alaska and Wyoming the 30th and 31st states to allow same-sex marriage, up from 19 states at the beginning of the month. In Alaska, a federal judge in the state in recent days had ordered gays and lesbians be allowed to apply for marriage licenses and to wed after a normal three-day waiting period. But everything was on hold pending emergency action from the justices. Some couples had begun applying for marriage licenses as early as Monday and in at least some cases, couples were married when they were granted expedited waivers. Alaska had requested a stay, saying it needed more time to file more detailed appeals to show its sovereign power to define marriage was being usurped by the courts. Officials, including the governor, had said waiting until the broader legal questions are resolved was best for all Alaskans. But a number of same-sex couples cited a federal appeals court ruling last week that struck down bans in Nevada and Idaho as unconstitutional. That appeals court's legal jurisdiction also includes Alaska and other Western states. Wyoming officials have not indicated whether they will appeal the ruling from federal Judge Scott Skavdahl. The judge said it was preferable the voters or the legislature decide such matters as defining marriage, but concluded "that ship has sailed." "Binding precedent of [higher courts striking down similar bans] mandate this result, and this court will adhere to its constitutional duties and abide by the rule of law." A federal appeals court in June became the first such judicial body to strike down same-sex marriage, in Utah and Oklahoma. That court also has jurisdiction over appeals in Wyoming, known as the Equality State. The Supreme Court later allowed those federal rulings to stand. Gay and lesbian couples could begin marrying on October 23, sooner if the state decides to drop any plans to appeal. The Wyoming case is Guzzo v. Mead (14-cv-200). The Alaska case is high court case is Parnell v. Hamby (14A413).

chatgpt: A federal judge has ruled that same-sex marriage is legal in the state of Wyoming, making it the 30th state in the US to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed. The decision came after a long legal battle that saw five Wyoming couples fighting for the right to be legally married. The ruling, which came down on Friday, was met with cheers and tears from same-sex couples and their allies across the state. However, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon expressed his disappointment, saying that he believes the state should define marriage as being between one man and one woman. Governor Gordon's stance is not an uncommon one, as many conservative politicians and religious leaders have long opposed same-sex marriage. However, the tides seem to be turning, as a majority of Americans now support marriage equality. While Wyoming has joined the ranks of states that allow same-sex marriage, Alaska is still fighting the ruling. The Supreme Court rejected Alaska's request to delay enforcement of the decision, which means that the state will likely become the 31st to allow same-sex marriage. There is no doubt that this ruling will have a significant impact on the lives of LGBTQ+ people in Wyoming and Alaska. Same-sex couples will now be able to exercise the same legal rights as heterosexual couples, including the ability to file joint tax returns and make medical decisions for their partners. Many advocates of marriage equality are celebrating the news, but they also acknowledge that there is still work to be done. Discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is still prevalent across the country, and efforts to roll back the rights of same-sex couples are ongoing. Still, for the couples in Wyoming and Alaska who have been fighting for their right to marry, this ruling is a significant victory. It sends a message that love is love, and that all couples deserve to be treated equally under the law. As the fight for marriage equality continues, it is clear that momentum is on the side of those who support it. With more and more states legalizing same-sex marriage every year, it seems that the arc of history is bending towards justice for all.
