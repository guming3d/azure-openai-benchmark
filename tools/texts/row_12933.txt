A Soldier who volunteered for one final tour of duty in Afghanistan was among those killed by a rogue Afghan policeman, it was revealed yesterday.

Tragically, the selfless soldier was shot dead alongside two comrades by an officer in the civil order police named as Ziarahman. He opened fire on the three mentors at a checkpoint in Helmand province following an argument. The fallen servicemen were named last night as WO2 Thomas, from the Royal Corps of Signals, and Guardsman Craig Roderick, 22, and Guardsman Apete Tuisovurua, 28, of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards. The men, members of an Afghan Police Advisory Team, had been helping organise a shura – or meeting of elders – at Checkpoint Kamparack Pul in Nahr-e-Saraj when they were killed on Sunday. A fourth British soldier was injured and is in a stable condition in hospital. The killer, who is thought to have been armed with an AK47 assault rifle, was shot and captured alive. Initial reports said a row broke out when Ziarahman was challenged about taking bribes from Afghan civilians.

He leaves behind his mother Sylvia, long-term partner Rachel, and younger brother Tristan, 43. His family described him as ‘a military man through and through’.

chatgpt: Troops who were helping to organise a meeting of elders in Afghanistan have been killed in a cowardly attack. The man responsible for the shooting is now in custody, according to a statement from the Ministry of Defence. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond expressed his sadness upon hearing about the tragic incident. He described it as a cowardly act, and said that it was a reminder of the dangers faced by British troops in the country. This attack is the latest in a growing number of so-called ‘green-on-blue’ attacks, where Afghan soldiers or police turn their weapons on their coalition partners. Four other British soldiers have died in similar circumstances this year. The attack is a stark reminder of the precarious situation facing UK forces in Afghanistan, as they approach the end of their combat mission in the country. British troops have been stationed in Afghanistan for over a decade, and have been involved in supporting the Afghan government and military in their efforts to maintain stability and combat the Taliban. Whilst the UK government has said that it will withdraw all of its combat troops from the country by the end of 2014, there are still around 5,000 British personnel currently serving in Afghanistan. These troops continue to support Afghan forces in their fight against the Taliban and other extremist groups. Despite these efforts, the situation in Afghanistan remains unstable, with frequent clashes between Taliban and Afghan forces. The Taliban have also mounted a number of high-profile attacks in recent months, including an assault on the Afghan parliament in June which killed two people. As the UK prepares to withdraw its combat forces from the country, there are concerns that the security situation in Afghanistan could further deteriorate. While the Afghan government and military have made progress in recent years, there are fears that they may struggle to maintain stability once international forces depart. The UK government has committed to continuing to support Afghanistan after the withdrawal of its combat forces. This support will include providing financial assistance to help support the Afghan economy and encouraging political reconciliation between different factions within the country. Meanwhile, troops in Afghanistan continue to face daily challenges and dangers, as they work to maintain stability and keep the country safe. The attack on troops helping to organise a meeting of elders is a tragic reminder of this reality, and of the sacrifices made by British personnel serving in the country. The Ministry of Defence has not released any further details about the circumstances surrounding the attack or the identity of the man in custody. However, the incident is being treated as a serious matter by both the UK military and the Afghan authorities, who have condemned the attack and promised to bring those responsible to justice. This latest attack is a stark reminder of the ongoing danger faced by troops in Afghanistan, and of the complex and challenging security situation in the country. As UK forces prepare to withdraw from the country, there are many questions about what the future holds for Afghanistan, and how the international community can support the country in its efforts to maintain stability and peace.
