Despite the material's waterproof qualities, the fabric is made from 100 per cent cotton . 'The Cavalier shirt contains no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals, and is completely safe to wear - as a shirt should be.' Still breathable, the Australian invention's technology boosts the material's resistance to water and stains by causing it to simply bead up and roll off the fabric. Creating a natural self-cleaning effect, any residue left on the material can be removed by just wiping or rinsing off it off with water. Lewis Pitchford of the label said the the waterproof technology did not rely on the T-shirts being coated in hydrophobic sprays available in the U.S. such as Ultra-Ever Dry, reported the Herald Sun.

There is speculation the fabric could be revolutionary for restaurants and cafes, where spills on tablecloths and aprons are a daily occurrence and also in the medical sector and hospitals, reported Eftm.com.au. Machine washable, the waterproof effect will last for up to 80 washes. The T-shirts are available for men and women and retail for $65 each, while children's T-shirts are coming soon.

chatgpt: An innovative Australian label, Threadsmiths, has turned the idea of a traditional cotton T-shirt on its head by creating a unique, waterproof version of the classic garment. This incredible new invention has been patented and is entirely chemical-free, making it an environmentally-friendly choice for those looking to stay dry in any weather. The technology woven into the fabric has the ability to repel both liquid and dirt, ensuring that the wearer stays looking and feeling fresh all day long. The cotton itself has also been specially enhanced to ensure that it remains breathable and lightweight, despite the waterproofing properties. The founder of Threadsmiths, Daniel McBride, says that the idea for a waterproof T-shirt came to him while he was travelling in Laos. "I was stuck in a downpour, and only had a cotton T-shirt to wear," he explains. "I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if this were waterproof?" After extensive research, McBride and his team finally came up with a solution that has now become their signature product. The waterproof effect is achieved through a process that coats each individual fibre of the cotton with a waterproof material, before the fabric is woven together to form the T-shirt itself. This innovative approach means that the waterproofing effect can last for up to 80 machine washes, making it a durable and long-lasting choice. And, because there are no chemicals involved, the fabric retains its non-toxic properties even after multiple washes - making it a great choice for those with sensitive skin. But the benefits of Threadsmiths' waterproof T-shirt don't just stop at keeping the wearer dry. The fact that it repels dirt means that it requires less frequent washing, making it an environmentally-friendly choice. And, because it can be worn for longer periods of time, it also means that fewer T-shirts will need to be manufactured, reducing waste. The 100% cotton construction of the T-shirt means that it is soft and comfortable to wear, while the waterproofing technology is integrated seamlessly into the fabric - meaning that the T-shirt still looks and feels like a regular cotton tee. The range of colours available means that there is a style to suit everyone, whether you're looking for a classic white tee or something a little more vibrant. Despite being a relatively young company, Threadsmiths has already won fans from all over the globe, with the waterproof T-shirt being sold in over 140 countries worldwide. And, with plans to expand the product line to include everything from jackets to backpacks, it seems that Threadsmiths is well on its way to becoming a household name. So, if you're tired of getting caught in the rain or worrying about damaging your clothes with spills and stains, then the Threadsmiths waterproof T-shirt could be the solution to all your problems. A durable, environmentally-friendly and stylish choice, it's sure to become a staple in any wardrobe - whether you're hitting the trail or just heading out for a casual brunch with friends.
