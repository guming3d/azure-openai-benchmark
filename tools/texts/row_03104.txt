chatgpt: Indian cricket team captain, MS Dhoni, may be making a comeback from injury in Adelaide, where his team is geared up to face off against Australia on December 6. Dhoni, who had been sidelined because of a muscle injury, flew to Australia on Saturday and is reported to have started training on Sunday. Had the first Test taken place as planned on Thursday, Dhoni would have been forced to miss the game. But with the Test now scheduled for the coming week, Dhoni may have a chance to make a comeback. India has named Wriddhiman Saha as its wicketkeeper for the first Test, but should Dhoni return to full fitness, he is expected to take over the gloves. Dhoni's absence from the team had raised concerns regarding the Indian lineup's depth and experience. The Indian skipper has been the primary wicketkeeper for the team and has been instrumental in their success in recent years. Meanwhile, former Australian captain, Michael Clarke, who retired in 2015, has been training with the Australian team at Adelaide Oval. Clarke, who is considered one of the best captains in Australia's cricketing history, has been working with the team as a consultant. His inclusion in the team's training sessions has raised questions about his potential return to the sport. Clarke, who retired after an Ashes series defeat in England, has been quite vocal about his desire to return to the game. He has often expressed his eagerness to help the Australian team in any capacity. While he has made it clear that he has no plans of returning to competitive cricket, his presence at the training sessions has fueled speculation about his potential return. The Indian team is gearing up for what promises to be a challenging Test series against Australia. The last time these two teams faced each other in a Test series in Australia, the hosts won 2-0. However, India's recent form suggests that they may have a chance to turn the tables this time around. With Dhoni potentially making a comeback, India's batting lineup is expected to receive a significant boost. The Indian skipper is known for his calmness under pressure and his leadership skills, and his return to the team could be just what the team needs to defeat Australia. The first Test in Adelaide promises to be an exciting game and cricket fans around the world will be eagerly awaiting the outcome.
