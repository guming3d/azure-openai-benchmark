article: (CNN) -- NASA's New Horizons explorer is hurtling through space on its way to the outermost reaches of the solar system for a rendezvous with the small, icy "dwarf planet" of Pluto and its five moons. It's a staggering decade-long, 3 billion mile journey that started with the New Horizons launch in 2006. The space probe is expected to reach Pluto next summer, the only spacecraft to visit it. It's also only the fifth probe to ever journey so far from the sun across such vast reaches of space, according to NASA officials. New Horizons is reminiscent of another historic undertaking: NASA's Voyager 2 mission to Neptune. Monday marks the 25th anniversary of Voyager's fly-by of Neptune and its moon Triton on August 25, 1989. The mission gave humanity its first close-up glimpse of the eighth planet from the sun and its largest satellite. Marking the 25th anniversary, NASA has released a global color map of Triton using Voyager's extraordinary footage of the moon and a video of the fly-by. The space agency says the map's colors are a close approximation of the moon's natural colors. NASA says the image of Triton and video provides a sneak peek of what scientists expect when New Horizons reaches Pluto. "Although Triton is a moon of a planet and Pluto is a dwarf planet, Triton serves as a preview of sorts for the upcoming Pluto encounter," NASA said on its website. But the space agency also says it expects great differences in the large moon and the dwarf planet. "Although both bodies originated in the outer solar system, Triton was captured by Neptune and has undergone a radically different thermal history than Pluto. Tidal heating has likely melted the interior of Triton, producing the volcanoes, fractures and other geological features that Voyager saw on that bitterly cold, icy surface." Pluto, which is slightly smaller than Triton, will likely be very different from Neptune's large moon, but researchers expect the dwarf planet to have similar features to Triton, including internal density and bulk composition, and similarly low temperatures on its frozen surface. Voyager also discovered atmospheric plumes on Triton, according to NASA. The discovery, said NASA researchers, made it "one of the active known bodies in the outer solar system, along with ... Jupiter's moon Io and Saturn's moon Enceladus." Scientists are hoping the New Horizons mission will help establish whether Pluto or its largest moon, Charon, falls into this category. Space agency officials caution, however, when New Horizons makes its closest fly-by of Pluto on July 14, 2015, "it will not be a replay of Voyager, but more of a sequel and a reboot." New Horizons is more technologically advanced than Voyager, and it's also exploring a whole new planetary system, so researchers expect to make new discoveries. Monday, August 25, also marks another milestone anniversary for NASA: Two years ago, Voyager 1 reached interstellar space, defined by Voyager Project Scientist Dr. Ed Stone as "the space between the stars."

chatgpt: NASA's New Horizons mission is sailing through space at a record-breaking pace towards a historic rendezvous with the dwarf planet Pluto in July of 2015. Launched from Cape Canaveral in January of 2006, New Horizons has covered more than three billion miles in its journey to the edge of the solar system. Pluto, located on the distant periphery of the solar system, has remained a mystery since its discovery in 1930. Just 1/6th the size of Earth, it is known as a "dwarf planet," but its size is not its only peculiar characteristic. Its orbit is highly elliptical and its rotation is retrograde, meaning it spins in the opposite direction of most planets in our solar system. NASA is excited for New Horizons to complete its mission, as it will mark the first time mankind has ever visited Pluto. This accomplishment has been a long time in the making, as it took almost a decade to reach Pluto, but it is a feat that has been well worth the effort. As the New Horizons spacecraft speeds towards Pluto, NASA is reflecting on another historic mission that celebrated its own milestone just last month. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, recently marked its 30th year since passing by Neptune and its moon Triton on August 25th, 1989. Although the Voyager 2 mission was not specifically targeted towards Pluto, the information gathered from the mission undoubtedly provides a glimpse of what the New Horizons team can expect on their own journey. Along with its impressive flyby of Neptune, the Voyager 2 mission was the first to visit Uranus and is the only mission to have traveled to all four outer planets. Voyager 2 was able to capture stunning images of these planets and their moons, including objects not previously seen by scientists. The wealth of data that the mission collected helped astronomers to gain a better understanding of Saturn's rings and the geologic processes at work on Uranus and Neptune. As New Horizons prepares to make its own mark on space exploration history, scientists eagerly await the vast quantities of data that will be sent back to Earth. The spacecraft carries a suite of seven scientific instruments designed to photograph and analyze Pluto and its five known moons; Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. Not only does the New Horizons mission offer the potential for groundbreaking scientific discoveries, but it also represents a major milestone for humanity's exploration of the solar system. Just as the Voyager missions inspired a new generation of astronauts and space enthusiasts, New Horizons serves as a reminder of the importance of continued investment in space exploration. As the spacecraft hurtles towards its historic destination, the excitement surrounding the New Horizons mission continues to grow. The scientific data and breathtaking images that it will send back to Earth will undoubtedly alter our understanding of Pluto and its surrounding space for generations to come.
