article: (CNN) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday ordered U.S. nuclear power plants to begin implementing safety recommendations made in an effort to prevent a crisis from occurring as it did in Japan after last year's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Among the recommendations, plants must install improvements to protect safety equipment and devices to monitor water levels in spent fuel pools. A third order applies only to plants with boiling-water reactors that have so-called Mark I or Mark II containment structures. Mark I containment housing is the same design that was used at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, where three reactors melted down after the station was struck by the tsunami that followed Japan's historic earthquake in March 2011. The disaster resulted in the widespread release of radioactive contamination that forced more than 100,000 people from their homes. The disaster occurred when a 15-meter (49-foot) tsunami inundated the coastal plant, knocking out the cooling systems for the three operating reactors and their associated spent fuel pools, causing the reactors to overheat and hydrogen gas explosions that blew apart the building housing reactors No. 1 and 3. Another hydrogen blast is believed to have damaged the inside of the No. 2 reactor, while engineers were struggling to manage an estimated 100,000 tons of highly contaminated water that was used to cool the reactors during the emergency. "These reactors must improve venting systems that help prevent or mitigate core damage in the event of a serious accident," the NRC said in a news release announcing the orders for U.S. plants. In addition to the changes in safety procedures, the NRC is also seeking information from every operating U.S. nuclear power plant regarding risks caused by earthquakes and flooding and the plants' emergency procedures in the event of prolonged power loss. The plants have until the end of 2016 to fully comply with the safety orders, according to the NRC.

chatgpt: Plants across the world have until 2016 to comply with safety orders issued in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan last year. The recommendations were made by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and have been taken up by a number of countries with nuclear power plants.  The orders are designed to ensure safety and operational practices in plants, as well as to better prepare for potential disasters. One of the orders involves plants with structures similar to that of Fukushima Daiichi, where a tsunami caused a meltdown at the plant's reactors. The disaster resulted in the release of radioactive material and cost an estimated $200bn to clean up.  While many of the orders involve updating or improving existing safety mechanisms, some also call for implementing new measures to enhance safety procedures. The IAEA has emphasized that the orders are essential to prevent disasters, and to maintain public trust in nuclear energy.  Nuclear power has been an important source of energy for many countries, but has also been the subject of considerable controversy, especially since the 2011 disaster in Fukushima. The disaster in Japan led to a strong backlash against nuclear energy, with many countries beginning to phase out its use, and others calling for increased safety measures.  The IAEA's orders are part of a broader trend towards increased scrutiny and regulation of nuclear energy. There have been calls for greater transparency in the industry, as well as for more stringent safety standards.  Despite the ongoing debates over the future of nuclear power, many countries continue to rely on it as an important source of electricity. In response to this, the IAEA has emphasized the importance of maintaining strict safety standards to ensure that the benefits of nuclear energy can be realized without causing harm to the environment or human health.  Overall, the orders issued by the IAEA represent a step forward in nuclear safety, and highlight the importance that regulators place on ensuring that the potential dangers of this energy source are minimized. With plants around the world working to comply with these orders, we can hope to move towards a safer and more responsible use of nuclear energy in the years to come.
