article: (CNN) -- In a tiny car repair shop in the Jordanian capital of Amman, one can encounter the latest efforts to solve the country's sky high youth unemployment rate. It's here that 23-year-old Khaleel Anwar can now fix his sights on a career after a year-long apprenticeship program. "I learned so many things such as how to monitor a car using an electronic device, also how to fill gas the proper way using this device," Anwar said. After years of debate on how to lift up the most vulnerable, training programs are targeting the informal economy and small businesses that need qualified workers. This is a regional challenge. Youth unemployment in the Middle East and North Africa is running above 27%, the highest in the world. Jordan's is slightly above that average and the government has allocated ample resources to try and reverse this trend. According to the World Bank, this equates to some 10% of GDP for the last two decades. But the challenge is to close the gap between what happens here in the classroom and what is needed by industry. This is where Yasser Ali of the International Labour Organization (ILO) comes into the picture. For their auto academy pilot program, the ILO brought together trade unions and private sector companies to see what is needed in the labor market. "Thinking like this can make a step forward in order to address youth unemployment but it needs involvement of all partners in this process," Ali said. And the early results are promising. Trainer and mentor, Youssef Rahal, said he's taught nearly 200 students with a placement rate of 89%. "There is a drastic change in the students," Rahal said. "They come to us with no skills; they are either drop outs or only have high school degrees, they are 17, 18, 19, 20-year-olds." Countrywide endeavor . It's not just in the inner cities that are the focus of the training programs. In the rural Bedouin area of Mafraq two hours drive from Amman, there is ground breaking work taking place inside a local community center. Up to 50 women, many who have not held jobs before, are being trained to work in a textile factory that is being built nearby. "There is strong demand because it's a ladies environment and everything is available for us," said Tahani Salama, a worker in the factory. "The most important is transportation that is guaranteed." Her colleague Ruwaida Thamri agrees. "It has helped me to meet new people. I now know how to communicate with my manager and my colleagues." According to the local tribal leader, Nimer Al Fawwaz, such progress has only been made possible by having a dialogue with parents to get support for women to enter the workforce -- which represents a cultural breakthrough in itself. "We want more courses and more attention to it and focus on more production companies within this area," Al Fawwaz said. Call it a small success story for a big problem plaguing the region.

chatgpt: Jordan has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the world, with a staggering 27% of those aged between 15-29 left without work. Recognizing the scale of the problem, the country has partnered with the International Labour Organization (ILO) to find solutions. As part of these efforts, several training programs have been launched with the aim of bringing more young Jordanians into the workforce. These programs seek to bridge the gap between the skills possessed by job seekers and the needs of employers. Through offerings such as work placements and vocational training, they are providing Jordan's youth with the resources and experiences they need to thrive. The need for such programs has been highlighted by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated Jordan's existing employment challenges. Economic downturns have starkly revealed the flaws of a system that provides limited opportunities for the country's young people. Experts have also found that the pandemic has had a disproportionately negative impact on women, who face additional barriers to employment. In response to these challenges, the ILO has collaborated with the Jordanian government on several initiatives to address youth unemployment. One such program, Decent Jobs for Youth Jordan, focuses on improving access to employment opportunities for Jordanian youth. By bringing together government bodies, private sector employers, and civil society organizations, the project aims to encourage economic growth and reduce poverty. Another key initiative is the Support to the Jordan Compact, a program jointly implemented with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The project supports vocational training programs in key sectors such as construction, hospitality, and manufacturing. By tailoring training to specific industry needs, these programs help to ensure that young people have the in-demand skills necessary to compete in the job market. Significant challenges still face the country. Despite progress in the implementation of new training programs, some have criticized the ongoing reliance on short-term solutions. For example, some argue that the skills taught in many training programs do not align with the genuine needs of employers, and do not offer adequate long-term career opportunities. Additionally, there are concerns about the low participation rates of many eligible program beneficiaries. Experts have identified the lack of awareness, low training quality, and inadequate outreach methods as reasons for low levels of uptake. Despite these obstacles, training programs remain an essential piece of Jordan's efforts to address youth unemployment. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened the urgency of these efforts, making it clear that more robust and lasting solutions must be found. With continued commitment from Jordanian authorities and international partners, it is hoped that these programs can contribute to a brighter future for the country's youth.
