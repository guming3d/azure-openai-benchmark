The shark bit his foot, causing him to require stitches and be put on crutches. Despite the injury, Cozzan is not deterred from getting back in the water as soon as the stitches come out. The incident occurred at a popular beach in Florida where Cozzan was enjoying the waves. He had barely gone into the water when he was attacked by the shark. He was quickly rushed to the hospital, where he received the necessary medical attention. According to reports, Cozzan suffered a deep cut on his foot and required numerous stitches. The injury has left him on crutches and unable to attend school for several days. However, he remains in good spirits and looking forward to getting better. In a statement, Cozzan expressed his gratitude for the quick thinking of those around him that day. "I was so scared, but the people at the beach were so helpful and got me to the hospital quickly. I am grateful for their help," he said. Despite the traumatic experience, Cozzan remains optimistic about his future in the water.
