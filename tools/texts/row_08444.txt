chatgpt: Julie Platner, a video journalist, had spent over a year with the National Socialist Movement, a white supremacist group, to make a documentary about their beliefs and activities. However, before she could finish her film, tragedy struck. Jeff Hall, a prominent member of the National Socialist Movement, was killed by his own 10-year-old child.  This sudden and shocking event left many unanswered questions for Platner. How would it affect the documentary that she had been working on? What would happen to the National Socialist Movement now that one of their leaders was gone? And perhaps most importantly, what would happen to Hall's family and the child who had committed such a heinous act? It's not clear what initially drew Platner to the National Socialist Movement as a subject for her documentary. The group is known for its extreme ethno-nationalist beliefs and its advocacy for a white ethno-state in the United States. They have been involved in numerous hate crimes and acts of terrorism over the years, including the infamous Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in 2017. Platner's film was intended to shed light on the inner workings of this secretive and controversial group. She spent countless hours with its members, attending rallies, meetings, and even living with some of the families involved. She gained unprecedented access to their world and was able to capture footage that few had ever seen before. However, the sudden death of Jeff Hall changed everything. Hall had been one of the most vocal and visible members of the National Socialist Movement, and his loss was felt deeply by the group. Platner had to grapple with how to incorporate this event into her documentary. Should she focus on Hall's death and its aftermath, or should she continue with her original plan and try to capture the ongoing activities of the National Socialist Movement? Despite the difficult circumstances, Platner decided to press on. She continued to film with the National Socialist Movement, documenting their reactions to Hall's death and the impact it had on their organization. She also reached out to Hall's family to try to understand how they were coping with the loss. The result is a documentary that is both revealing and poignant. It offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of a hate group and the impact that such groups can have on individuals and families. It also sheds light on the often-overlooked issue of domestic terrorism and the role that extremist groups can play in fomenting violence. Ultimately, Julie Platner's documentary is a testament to the power of journalism to bring important issues to light. Despite the challenges and the tragedy she faced, she was able to capture a nuanced and compelling portrait of a complex and controversial subject. The film serves as a warning about the dangers of hate and violence, and a call to action for those who seek to combat it.
