article: Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The death toll from the disastrous building collapse in Bangladesh last month has risen above 700, authorities said Tuesday, as recovery workers continued to pull bodies from the rubble. The building, which housed five factories full of garment workers, caved in nearly two weeks ago, burying hundreds of people in a heap of mangled concrete in Savar, a suburb of the capital, Dhaka. It is the South Asian nation's deadliest industrial disaster. Rescue workers managed to save more than 2,400 people in the aftermath of the collapse, but their work for the past week has focused on using heavy machinery to uncover the remaining bodies buried inside the ruins. The number of people confirmed dead from the disaster reached 705 on Tuesday, according to Jitendra Kumar Nath, a senior official with the district administration of Dhaka . A large number of people have continued to wait near the site of the collapse for news of missing relatives. Their gathering point is a school playing field where bodies retrieved from the ruins are taken for initial identification attempts. The task of identifying is made all the more difficult by the decomposed state of many of the bodies. The recovery effort is expected to continue for several more days. From Boston to Bangladesh: 'My heart hasn't stopped breaking' Blame spread around . The owners of the building and the factories are under police investigation over accusations they ordered workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse despite cracks appearing in the structure the day before. Preliminary results of a government inquiry into the building collapse found that "heavy machinery and high-capacity generators" were "largely responsible," the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha News Agency reported last week. "During the inquiry, we have found that use of substandard materials during the construction also contributed to the building collapse," the leader of the inquiry, Main Uddin Khandaker, told BSS. Bangladesh vs. the U.S.: How much does it cost to make a denim shirt? Bangladesh's $20 billion garment industry accounts for 77% of the country's exports. Among those caught up in the finger-pointing after the building collapse disaster are Western retailers and clothing brands that Bangladeshi suppliers say put heavy pressure on prices, resulting in bad pay and conditions for workers. At the weekend, representatives of Bangladesh's government, industry and workers issued a joint statement laying out an "action plan" to improve worker safety in the wake of the disaster. The European Union has said it is considering trade action against Bangladesh if it doesn't take clear steps to improve the safety conditions of its millions of garment workers. In November, a fire at Tazreen Fashions Factory, a garment maker in another suburb of Dhaka, killed at least 112 people. Opinion: The bloodshed behind our cheap clothes .

chatgpt: The death toll from a catastrophic building collapse in Savar, Bangladesh, has reached 705, according to a government official. The tragedy has shocked and saddened the world, and authorities continue to search for bodies buried in the rubble. It is believed that more than 2,400 people were rescued after the disaster, which occurred on April 24th, 2013. The building, an eight-story garment factory, collapsed without warning, trapping many of its occupants inside. The disaster has once again brought the issue of worker safety in Bangladesh to the forefront of the international community's attention. Bangladesh has long been criticized for lax safety standards in its garment industry, which provides clothing for major retailers around the world. There were initially conflicting reports about how many people were in the building when it collapsed. Authorities have now said that around 3,122 people were present on the day of the disaster. Of these, 1,045 were injured, and 705 people lost their lives. Tragically, many of the victims were young women who worked in the factory. Rescue workers have been working around the clock to find any remaining survivors, and the search for bodies is ongoing. Some families have been waiting for weeks to hear news of their loved ones, and the slow pace of the recovery effort has been frustrating for those affected. Despite the tragedy, some workers have returned to their jobs in other factories, with some unions advising their members to continue working. However, others have organized nationwide protests, calling for increased worker safety and better working conditions. The disaster has also highlighted the complex issue of international responsibility for worker safety. Many Western retailers source their clothing from factories in Bangladesh, and some have been criticized for not doing enough to ensure their suppliers are meeting basic safety standards. In response to the disaster, some major retailers have pledged to improve worker safety in their supply chains. However, progress has been slow, and many workers continue to face dangerous conditions while producing clothes for the global market. Bangladesh's government has also faced criticism for failing to enforce basic safety regulations. In response to the crisis, the government has promised to improve worker safety, but it remains to be seen whether these promises will be kept. Overall, the Savar disaster has cast a harsh light on the precarious situation faced by millions of workers in Bangladesh's garment industry. As the search for bodies continues, it is clear that major changes are needed to ensure the safety and dignity of those who work in the global garment trade. The world is watching, and the pressure is on for action to be taken to prevent similar tragedies from happening again in the future.
