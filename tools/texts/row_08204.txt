article: (Oprah.com) -- A decade ago Alissa Everett was holed up in her cubicle at an investment bank in San Francisco, flipping through acceptance packages from two top MBA programs. Numb from 100-hour workweeks, she'd applied to business school "because that's what everyone else was doing," she recalls. But as she read about statistics, accounting, and operations courses, "I had an aha moment," she says. Oprah.com: 10 pieces of advice to get you through a terrible day . It suddenly seemed ridiculous to take on crushing debt to study subjects she wasn't passionate about. Within weeks, Everett had tossed her acceptance letters in the trash, quit her job, and flown to Southeast Asia to do some soul-searching. Oprah.com: The one thing everybody in the world wants . Backpacking for months through Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Burma -- and later the Balkans, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, and Egypt -- she snapped thousands of photos.

Everett made a gut decision "to go where the news was happening," she says, hoping it would help her get her work published. She drove over the border from Jordan with a fellow journalist, and after she met an army media person, got embedded with the 101st Airborne. When U.S. forces killed Saddam Hussein's sons in Mosul that July, Everett was in the right place at the right time. She showed her photos to an NBC producer, who ran them on Dateline.

Eschewing the sensationalized scenes of explosions and gunfire favored by many news outlets, she tries to capture war's more mundane human dramas: a farmer reaping a modest harvest in ravaged Darfur, a rape victim refugee starting a sewing business in the Congo. "I'm drawn to under-the-radar stories that have passion, hope, and optimism," she says. Everett's time in Sudan inspired her to cofound Care Through Action, which raises funds for women and children who are victims of human rights abuses; her photos help fund the charity.

chatgpt: Alissa Everett was faced with a tough decision. She was contemplating an MBA program, but something didn't feel right. It wasn't until she took some time to do some soul-searching that she realized what her true passion was - photography. As a child, Alissa always dreamt of being a National Geographic photographer. She was fascinated with the stories and images that the magazine produced, and she knew that she wanted to be a part of it. But life took her on a different path, and she found herself working in finance. But the dream never died. And so, Everett decided that it was time to chase it. She started taking photos again, just for fun at first, but soon realized that photography was where her heart was. She found that through her photographs, she could tell stories for people who couldn't tell them themselves. Everett's photographs are striking, powerful, and emotional. She has a particular talent for capturing the essence of her subjects, even those who are often overlooked. Her photographs reveal the humanity in the people and places she captures, and that is what sets her apart from others. One of Everett's most compelling projects was a series of photos taken in homeless shelters across the country. She spent months getting to know the people who called these shelters home, and she captured their lives in a way that was both honest and sympathetic. Her photos humanized the homeless, giving them a voice that they don't often have. Another project that Everett is particularly proud of is her work with children in developing countries. She has traveled to places such as Africa and India, capturing the lives of children who are growing up in poverty. Through her photographs, she hopes to raise awareness of the challenges that these children face and to inspire others to take action. Everett's work has been featured in numerous publications, including National Geographic, Time, and The New York Times. Her photographs have won awards and have been shown in galleries across the country. But for Everett, the true reward comes when she sees the impact that her work has on others. "When people see my photographs, I want them to feel something," says Everett. "I want them to connect with the people and places that I capture. And maybe, just maybe, I can inspire them to make a difference in the world." As for her decision to pursue photography instead of an MBA, Everett has no regrets. She knows that she's found her true calling, and she's grateful every day that she took the leap of faith to follow her dreams. "Life is too short to do something that doesn't make you happy," says Everett. "I feel so lucky that I get to do what I love every day." And lucky we are to have photographers like Alissa Everett, who are willing to venture into the world and capture its beauty and pain, one photograph at a time.
