His actions are not dissimilar to those of Pascal Chimbonda, who infuriated Wigan by handing then boss Paul Jewell a transfer request while leaving the pitch following the final game of the season in 2006. Shaw, however, has long been expected to leave Southampton this summer and join one of England's biggest clubs. Sportsmail broke the news that Shaw's move to United was all but a done on May 12.

chatgpt: Southampton's talented left-back, Luke Shaw, is reportedly on the verge of a £27m transfer to Manchester United this summer. The 18-year-old is expected to put pen to paper after finishing his World Cup campaign with the England team. Shaw, who is considered the country's second-choice left-back behind Leighton Baines, has been a rising star in the Premier League over the last two seasons. His performances for Southampton have earned him a reputation as one of the most promising young defenders in Europe, with many top clubs vying for his signature. Manchester United have been leading the race for Shaw's signature, with reports suggesting that the club's new manager, Louis van Gaal, sees the teenager as a vital component in his new-look team. The club has reportedly offered the player a lucrative five-year contract, which is likely to appeal to the youngster. Despite Manchester United's offer, Shaw is also being chased by other top Premier League clubs like Chelsea and Manchester City. Both teams are said to be preparing rival bids for the defender, who they think would bring great energy and talent to their squads. However, it seems like Manchester United are going to win the race for Shaw's signature. The club's rich history and tradition, as well as their recent struggles on the pitch, have not discouraged the teenager from joining the Red Devils. Additionally, the opportunity to work with a renowned manager like van Gaal is likely to have influenced his decision. This move would make Shaw the latest in a long line of Southampton players to join Manchester United in recent years. Players like Adam Lallana, Morgan Schneiderlin and Rickie Lambert have all made the switch to Old Trafford, and Shaw may feel that it is the right time for him to do the same. Despite his young age, Shaw has already proven that he is capable of competing at the highest level. His impressive performances for Southampton have earned him a place in England's World Cup squad, which is no mean feat for a player who only made his full Premier League debut in November 2012. If he does complete his move to Manchester United, Shaw will be expected to compete with the likes of Patrice Evra and Alexander Buttner for a starting spot. However, given his immense talent and potential, it is likely that he will become a regular fixture in van Gaal's first team sooner rather than later. All eyes will now be on Shaw as he takes part in the World Cup in Brazil. If he continues to impress on the world stage, his £27m price tag may look like a bargain compared to what he could offer Manchester United in the future.
