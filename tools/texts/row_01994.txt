article: Read Martin Samuel's column here . A final thought on the toxic fall-out between Rio Ferdinand and John Terry. Might the Football Association have been able to broker a rapprochement? Here were two players who had stood side by side through countless internationals. With Ferdinand now saying he sought a quick resolution, a simple apology, and did not consider Terry a racist, was there not more common ground than was previously assumed? The police involvement was the prime complication, yet even this may not have been insurmountable. In a less complicated era, matters on the football field were invariably handled by the FA alone. The police did not want to be involved every time two players got into a fight, and the FA did not want confrontations to end up in court.

Did they even try? At the time, it more appeared that they backed off the moment the police were involved. Most likely the nature of the offence would have left them terrified; frightened to be thought complacent, or accused of going soft and ignoring racial sensitivities if they merely tried to bring the sides together. Yet a less punitive, swifter and more positive resolution is what Ferdinand says he wanted. Why, three years on, is the wound still sore?

chatgpt: Former Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand has clarified his position on the incident involving himself and former England captain John Terry. Ferdinand has stated that all he wanted was a quick apology from Terry for the alleged racial abuse, which was aimed at Ferdinand's younger brother, Anton.  However, police involvement in the case was a major complication, according to Ferdinand. The Football Association's decision to pursue disciplinary action against Terry came after the police charged the Chelsea defender with a racially-aggravated public order offence. Ferdinand says that the police became involved quite early, which made the situation more complex.  Ferdinand has suggested that the Football Association could have told the police they would deal with the matter themselves, rather than the police pursuing Terry for a criminal offence. He has also questioned why the FA did not take a similar approach to the case of Arsenal midfielder Paul Davis, who was punished by the FA in 1988 for punching Southampton's Glenn Cockerill.  Ferdinand's comments come at a time when the issue of racism in football has once again been brought to the fore. Following the recent arrest of a 12-year-old boy who allegedly racially abused Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha, former Arsenal striker Ian Wright has called for greater action to tackle racism in the sport.  In a video posted on social media, Wright said: "As a society, we have to now wake up and say enough is enough. We have to try and find a way of punishing these people. It's no longer just an insult, it's a hate crime. This young kid has got to learn that this is not something that we do."  Ferdinand's comments also highlight the ongoing debate around whether the Football Association is doing enough to address racism in the sport. While the organisation has taken some steps to tackle the problem, such as launching its "Football For All" campaign, many believe that more needs to be done.  As for Ferdinand's personal situation with Terry, the two players have now buried the hatchet. Ferdinand has stated that he has forgiven Terry for the incident, although he still believes that the issue should have been dealt with differently by the Football Association.
