article: (CNN) -- Rory McIlroy says he needs to cut out his "stupid mistakes" if he is rediscover his form ahead of the Masters at Augusta in two weeks' time. The 23-year-old lost the world no.1 spot to Tiger Woods this week and is still searching for his first tournament win in 2013 . Woods, a 14-time major winner, climbed back to the top of the rankings with victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, Florida on Sunday. In a friendly text message, the American challenged McIlroy to respond at the Houston Open tournament which began on Thursday at the Redstone Golf Club, Texas. But it was a difficult first round for McIlory who carded a one-over-par round of 73 to leave him in danger of missing the cut unless he improves over the next 18 holes. The 2012 PGA Champion bogeyed the par-four second before needing seven strokes to sink the par-five eighth hole. "Stupid mistakes, silly bogeys" The back nine was a happier hunting ground for McIlory as he mixed four birdies with two bogeys but when he was asked in Houston what he needed to do to improve he said: "I'm not too sure. "I think if I just eliminate the stupid mistakes and the silly bogeys then I feel like I'm playing OK and hitting the ball well." McIlroy's slump in form has been linked to his switch to Nike equipment this year in a deal reported to be worth $250m. The 23-year-old indicated that he was still not comfortable with his competitive game. "I'm still maybe a bit tentative out there on the golf course," he added. "I'm not committing to my shots fully. "Hopefully another three rounds this weekend and some good scores will give me confidence going into the Masters." American D.A Points held a one-shot lead over compatriots Cameron Tringale and John Rollins after finishing on eight under for the day in Houston. Points revealed he was using a refurbished version of his Mom's putter that he had borrowed from her golf bag when he was a teenager.

chatgpt: Rory McIlroy, the Northern Irish golfer, has set his sights on cutting out "stupid mistakes" ahead of the upcoming Masters tournament. McIlroy finished the first round of the Houston Open one over par, but he is determined to improve his game to be in the running for the prestigious green jacket. The 30-year old golfer has had a challenging start to the year, losing his world no.1 spot to Tiger Woods earlier this week. Despite being the reigning PGA Champion, McIlroy has struggled to find his form this season, with inconsistent performances in recent competitions. In an interview after the first round of the Houston Open, McIlroy spoke candidly about his desire to improve his game, specifically by cutting out mistakes that he feels are preventable. "I'm making way too many stupid mistakes," he said. "Those are the things that I need to get out of my game if I want to be competitive at Augusta next week." McIlroy has identified a sense of tentativeness as a contributing factor to his recent struggles. He stated that he still feels a lack of confidence in his game, particularly during live competitions. "I'm still a little tentative on the golf course," he said. "I need to get my confidence back up and really trust my instincts." Despite his recent setbacks, McIlroy remains optimistic about the upcoming Masters tournament. He believes that he has the skills and determination to compete at the highest level, and he is working hard to get back into peak form before the tournament begins. The Masters, which takes place at Augusta National Golf Club, is one of the most prestigious events in the sport. With a rich history and a tradition of excellence, the tournament attracts the world's top golfers and is widely considered to be the pinnacle of the golfing calendar. For McIlroy, winning the Masters would be a career-defining achievement. Although he has already won several major tournaments, including the PGA Championship and the US Open, the green jacket has proved elusive thus far. With his sights set firmly on success, McIlroy will be working hard over the coming days to ensure that he is ready to compete at the highest level in Augusta.
