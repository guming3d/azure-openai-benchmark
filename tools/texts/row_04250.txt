article: (CNN) -- If you want to salute, race or flirt with other drivers in Nevada, you could soon be out of luck with some cars. That's because on Monday, Nevada became the first to approve a license for "autonomous vehicles" -- in other words, cars that cruise, twist and turn without the need for a driver -- on its roads. The license goes to Google, the Silicon Valley technology giant known more for its search engine and e-mail service that nonetheless has been known to dive into other big ideas such as space elevators to Internet-enabled glasses. In a 2010 post on Google's official blog, engineer and Google X founder Sebastian Thrun said that the self-driving vehicle project aims "to help prevent traffic accidents, free up people's time and reduce carbon emissions by fundamentally changing car use." He noted that the "automated cars use video cameras, radio sensors and a laser range finder to 'see' other traffic, as well as detailed maps ... to navigate the road ahead." There is no driver needed, though one is typically in the front seat ready to take control if need be. Earlier this spring, Google said it had "safely completed over 200,000 miles of computer-led driving." Monday marked a new milestone for the project, when Nevada issued a special license after demonstrations on state freeways, state highways, in Carson City neighborhoods and on Las Vegas' landmark Las Vegas Strip, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles said in a news release. The new plate is red and features the infinity symbol and the letters AU, for autonomous vehicle. All such cars on the road are "test" vehicles for now, though the state signaled it intends to be "at the forefront of autonomous vehicle development." "I felt using the infinity symbol was the best way to represent the 'car of the future,' " state DMV Director Bruce Breslow said. "When there comes a time that vehicle manufactures market autonomous vehicles to the public, that infinity symbol will appear on a green license plate." Google was the first company to apply to test its self-driving system in Nevada, the state said, while indicating that "other auto manufacturers have indicated their desire to test and develop" such technology in the state.

chatgpt: Nevada has become the first state in the US to approve a license for autonomous vehicles, paving the way for companies like Google to test out self-driving cars. The new red license plates, which feature an infinity symbol, will soon be seen on roads in the state as tech giants race to gain a competitive edge in the autonomous vehicle market. Google has already logged over 200,000 miles of autonomous driving without any accidents, and the company is now planning to test out its technology on Nevada's roads. Other companies are expected to follow suit in the coming months, as the race to develop self-driving vehicles heats up. The decision by Nevada to approve a license for autonomous vehicles is a significant milestone in the development of this technology. It reflects the growing interest in autonomous driving among both automakers and technology companies, and suggests that self-driving cars may soon become a commonplace presence on the roads. For Google, the decision represents a key opportunity to test out and improve its technology. The company has been working on its self-driving system for years, and has continually refined its software and hardware to improve safety and reliability. By testing its technology in real-world conditions, Google will be able to gather important data on how its system performs in different environments and conditions. In addition to testing out its self-driving technology, Google will also use its autonomous vehicles to gather data on road conditions and traffic patterns. This data will be used to improve its mapping and navigation software, which is a key component of its autonomous driving system. While the introduction of autonomous vehicles on public roads represents a significant technological achievement, it also raises a number of ethical and legal questions. For example, who is responsible in the event of an accident? If an autonomous vehicle causes an accident, is it the fault of the vehicle's owner or the technology company that developed the system? These issues will need to be addressed as autonomous vehicles become more prevalent on our roads. However, for the time being, the focus is on developing and testing out the technology, and Nevada's decision to approve a license for autonomous vehicles is an important step in that process. With Google and other companies now racing to perfect their self-driving technology, it's clear that the future of transportation will be an autonomous one.
