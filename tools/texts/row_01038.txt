article: Midfielder Mo Salah's lack of game-time with Chelsea means he is not fit enough to inspire the Egypt national team, according to Pharaohs coach Shawky Gharib. Salah, signed from Basle last January for £11million, has yet to feature for Chelsea in the new domestic season, which Gharib believes meant the 22-year-old lacked sharpness as Egypt lost 2-0 against Senegal in African Nations Cup qualifying on Friday. 'We had many mistakes in passing the ball and we failed to put the required pressure on our opponents, but the defenders are not the only ones to be blamed,' Gharib said, reported by Ahram Online Sports.

The Spanish team will be hoping that he is able to pass the fitness test and feature in their next game. In conclusion, both Egypt and Spain will be hoping for their star players to pass their respective fitness tests. Salah’s poor fitness highlights the importance of properly managing players' workload, while Costa's potential absence illustrates the impact an injured player can have on a team.
