A Greek restaurant faces losing its licence after locals reported being woken up to the sound of loud bouzouki music and smashing plates. Bosses of the Mythopolis restaurant have been ordered to attend a licensing hearing at Islington Council today after repeated complaints about noise. The eatery, in Islington, north London, had been granted a late licence to serve alcohol and play live music until 3.30am, but a stream of complaints led to council chiefs confiscating music equipment last week. Complaints: Greek restaurant Mythopolis in Islington could lose its licence after locals reported being woken up to the sound of loud bouzouki music and smashing plates (stock picture) Officers seized thousands of pounds worth of music gear, which has been impounded before the hearing when licensing chiefs decide on whether to withdraw the restaurant’s licence. Neighbours reported hearing ‘very loud’ traditional Greek music - played on a bouzouki - blaring until 3.30am and complained it was stopping them sleeping. Locals living near the restaurant also said that other noise included loud singing, smashing plates - a traditional Greek folk custom during celebrations such as weddings, birthdays and parties - and shouting. The restaurant is hailed as one of London’s only ‘Greek pop music’ venues and regularly hosts sessions played by performers from Cyprus and Greece. One local who complained to the council by letter but was not named said: 'The noise is an issue during the week where live music is played at an unacceptable noise level at unacceptable times. 'I must wake up early in the morning to go to work and find it hard to function due to lack of sleep.'

Another local, who asked not to be named, said: 'The music is the main issue, but there is also a problem with people standing around smoking and singing and shouting outside the restaurant. 'People have also heard plates being smashed, but I suppose that could just be kitchen staff dropping them by accident.' Owner Stephanos Makis said recently that he did not want ‘problems with the neighbours’, adding: 'We don’t have any fights, we don’t have any drugs. 'We do make mistakes but I think it’s the only Greek place in the Islington area.' Bosses at the restaurant have previously pledged to soundproof the restaurant but it will be up to councillors today as to whether to restrict the opening times of the venue or close it down completely.

chatgpt: Mythopolis bosses have been ordered to attend a licensing hearing at Islington Council following multiple complaints by local residents. The restaurant, which had a license to serve alcohol and play live music until 3.30am, has had its music equipment confiscated by the council after several complaints were filed regarding loud music and noise levels in the early hours of the morning. The hearing, scheduled for next month, will give Mythopolis bosses an opportunity to argue why their license should not be revoked in light of the recent noise complaints. The council has emphasized the importance of reducing noise pollution in residential areas, and warned businesses that violate licensing laws will not be tolerated. According to reports, local residents had become increasingly frustrated with the level of noise coming from Mythopolis, particularly late at night. Some residents said that they were kept up until the early hours of the morning, making it difficult to function properly the next day. "I've complained several times to the restaurant and the council about the noise coming from Mythopolis," said one local resident who wished to remain anonymous. "It's been incredibly disruptive and has affected my quality of life. I'm glad something is finally being done about it." The council acknowledged that it had received several complaints from local residents about the noise levels in the area, and had subsequently launched an investigation. The council concluded that Mythopolis had violated the terms of its license, which restricts the level of noise that can be produced after a certain time. The council has since confiscated Mythopolis' music equipment, effectively ending their ability to play loud music until the matter is resolved. Mythopolis released a statement expressing their regret for the inconvenience caused to local residents and vowed to take steps to address the issue. "We're deeply sorry for the distress caused to our neighbors by the noise coming from our restaurant," the statement reads. "We've taken immediate steps to address the issue and will continue to work closely with the council to ensure that we comply with all licensing regulations moving forward." The hearing will be an opportunity for Mythopolis to argue their case and demonstrate that they are committed to reducing noise pollution in the area. The restaurant owners will have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments showing that they are taking the matter seriously and are committed to being good neighbors. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the hearing will be, but one thing is clear: the council is determined to crack down on businesses that violate noise regulations and disrupt the peace of local residents. Mythopolis will have to work hard to demonstrate that they are serious about addressing the issue and complying with all licensing requirements.
