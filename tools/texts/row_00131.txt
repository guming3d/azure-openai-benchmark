article: The NTSB continues to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly Bronx train crash while adding to the possibility that human error was involved. Federal safety investigators have all but eliminated mechanical problems as the cause of the December 1 derailment but added one more clue suggesting the engineer might not have been as attentive as he should have been. At 7:11 a.m. that Sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train's headlights as required when it passed another train, the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday. Engineer William Rockefeller Jr. acknowledged to investigators having a lapse in attention as the train approached a sharp curve, according Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, and his union representative.  The train's motion might have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed "highway hypnosis." Four people died and dozens were injured when the train, traveling at about 82 miles per hour, derailed on the curve, which has a 30 mph limit. The NTSB said Monday it believes that positive train control, a high-tech system that targets human error, could have prevented the crash.  The safety board has pushed the system for about 20 years.  Congress is requiring most major railroads, including Metro-North, to install the costly systems by the end of 2015. Railroad announces safety upgrades . The NTSB said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies. The "dead-man" switch -- a foot pedal that must be depressed to keep the train moving -- was also working, the board said.  Nor did it find problems with speed sensors, the brake control unit or the train's propulsion controller. The board reiterated that it found no problems with the tracks or the signal system. Finally, the board said it conducted a "site/distance" test and found no problems with visibility. "As a result, at this time, the NTSB believes that if positive train control technology was installed on this line and train, it would have required the engineer to slow the train to an appropriate speed or stop the train in the event the engineer did not do so, likely preventing the derailment," the board said in a statement. Investigators are still awaiting results of crew drug tests and cellphone records, the board said, and it is continuing interviews with passengers, Metro-North employees who were riding on the train and first responders.

chatgpt: Federal investigators looking into the tragic December 1 train accident in Washington have all but ruled out mechanical issues as the cause, according to a recent statement by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The accident, which left four people dead and dozens more injured, occurred when Amtrak's southbound train 501 derailed while traveling over a newly constructed section of track, sending several train cars plummeting onto a busy highway below. Since the incident, investigators have been working tirelessly to determine the cause of the derailment. While it was initially rumored that the accident may have been caused by a problem with the track, it has since been confirmed that there were no issues with the newly constructed segment. Now, after weeks of investigation, the NTSB has revealed that the cause of the accident can likely be attributed to human error. Specifically, they found that the train's engineer failed to follow standard protocol when passing another train on the same track. According to the report, the engineer failed to dim the train's lights, as required by industry regulations.  The failure to dim the lights may have temporarily blinded the engineer of the other train, causing the tragic derailment. As a result, the NTSB has announced that it plans to work closely with Amtrak officials to ensure that proper safety protocols are followed in the future. In the wake of the accident, Amtrak officials have expressed their condolences to those affected and have reiterated their commitment to safety. The company has also announced that it will be conducting an internal review of its safety policies and procedures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. Meanwhile, the families of those killed or injured in the accident have expressed their frustration with the investigation, noting that more needs to be done to prevent future tragedies. They have called on Amtrak officials to take more decisive action to address safety concerns and have urged lawmakers to pressure the industry to increase safety standards. As the investigation into the accident continues, it is clear that there are still many unanswered questions. However, one thing is certain - this tragic event has served as a stark reminder of just how important it is to prioritize safety in the transportation industry.
