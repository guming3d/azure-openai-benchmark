chatgpt: Josh Sundquist, a 30-year-old athlete from the United States, is celebrating his selection for the U.S. soccer team. This is a significant accomplishment for the athlete, who not only excels as a soccer player but also uses his platform to bring light to his disability with humor. Sundquist, who lost his left leg to bone cancer at the age of 9, has become renowned for his hilarious costumes worn during racing competitions, including a flamingo and a partially eaten gingerbread man. In an interview with CNN, Sundquist shared that "my humor is a way to connect with people, and it's a way to say, 'Hey, I'm comfortable with who I am, and I hope you are too.'" Sundquist's sense of humor has helped him gain a sense of perspective when it comes to his disability. Even as a child, he perceived his missing limb as an opportunity. In his book, "Just Don't Fall," he wrote, "I remember being seven years old and figuring out that when people saw me, they thought, 'There goes the one-legged boy.' But if I was good at something, they could think, 'There goes the boy who's good at something, who just happens to have one leg.'" As his soccer career evolved, Sundquist's ambition increased with it. Earlier this year, he became a member of the U.S. national amputee soccer team. He currently serves as the team's captain and star forward. The soccer player's insistence on using humor as a way to cope with his disability has landed him spots on national talk shows and gained him more than 100,000 followers on social media. This is not Sundquist's first brush with internet fame. In 2018, he posted a video on TikTok of himself recreating the famous parade scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off with his prosthetic leg. The video went viral, landing him interviews with national news stations and providing yet another platform to advocate for disability acceptance. Sundquist's journey serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of humor and positivity in overcoming adversity. His accomplishments on the soccer field and his advocacy for disability acceptance have earned him a well-deserved spot on the U.S. national amputee soccer team. He is a true inspiration to others who face similar challenges and a reminder that anything is possible with hard work and a positive attitude.
