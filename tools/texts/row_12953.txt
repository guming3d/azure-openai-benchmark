article: Popular international air routes connecting Europe, North America and Asia are at risk after airplanes were warned to avoid airspace near an erupting Alaska volcano as it spews ash 30,000 feet above sea level. Winds have blowing ash from Pavlof Volcano to the west and southwest, warned the National Weather Service on Saturday. Pavlof began erupting on Wednesday, pushing lava out from a vent near its summit and by Friday the ash cloud had reached 16,000 feet. Warning: Pavlof began erupting, pushing lava out from a vent near its summit, on Wednesday. On Friday, the ash cloud reached 16,000 feet . Rising: The eruption intensified at 6 a.m. on Saturday, sending the ash cloud higher . The eruption intensified on Saturday morning, sending the ash cloud higher, said Dave Schneider, a geophysicist at Alaska Volcano Observatory. It's not clear how long this eruption will last, Schneider said. Pavlof's eruptions may last for weeks or months with varying levels of intensity, he said. Pavlof is Alaska's most active volcano and is located about 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It's had more than 40 recorded eruptions, including earlier this year and last year. It also lies along popular international air routes connecting Europe, North America and Asia. On the map: The volcano is located in an uninhabited region nearly 600 miles (966 km) southwest of Anchorage . Spewing: Pavlof (pictured this week) is Alaska's most active volcano and is located about 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It's had more than 40 recorded eruptions, including earlier this year and last year . The eruption has had little effect on people on the ground. The closest community, Cold Bay, is 40 miles away. Observers there reported seeing dark snow on the surface of the volcano on Wednesday, indicating an eruption had started. There have been some small avalanches of hot rock down the north flank of the volcano. These may produce local mud flows to the north, but scientists say they would likely be minor. Growing: A pink arrow on this map shows the brown ash plume extending 125 miles (200km) northwest . In 2013 Pavlof released ash plumes as high as 22,000ft, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory .

chatgpt: Pavlof Volcano, located in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, began erupting on Wednesday and has been spewing lava and ash ever since. The volcano lies along popular international air routes that connect Europe, North America, and Asia. The cloud of ash has now risen to 30,000 feet above sea level, prompting aviation authorities to issue warnings to airlines. The eruption of Pavlof Volcano is a reminder of the potential risks faced by commercial airlines that fly over active volcanic regions. When ash particles are ingested by airplane engines, they can cause engine failure, damage other critical systems, and pose a significant threat to public safety. Experts warn that the eruptions may last for weeks or months with varying levels of intensity. Nearby residents have been advised to stay indoors, close windows and doors, and avoid outdoor activities to minimize their exposure to the ash. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has raised the alert level to "watch" and the aviation color code to "orange," which means that an eruption is underway or may occur at any time. The USGS has also warned that more ash emissions and lava flows are possible in the coming days. Pavlof Volcano is one of Alaska's most active volcanoes and has a long history of eruptions. In 2016, the volcano produced a similar eruption that lasted for months and disrupted air travel in the region. The volcano has erupted more than 40 times since 1762. Aviation authorities have advised airlines to avoid flying over the area until the situation is under control. Several airlines have already canceled flights or rerouted them to avoid the ash cloud. The eruption of Pavlof Volcano is a reminder of the unpredictable nature of volcanic activity and the importance of monitoring and responding to such events. The USGS and other agencies will continue to monitor the situation and issue regular updates to keep people informed of any new developments. In the meantime, residents and aircraft operators in the area must remain vigilant and take appropriate precautions to ensure their safety. The situation is evolving, and it is essential to keep up with the latest news and recommendations from authorities.
