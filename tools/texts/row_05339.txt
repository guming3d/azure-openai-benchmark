Now a survey of 2,364 fans from around the country, conducted by the Welsh Conservatives and the Football Supporters Federation, has confirmed that the majority would like to see it trialled in stadiums. The survey also suggested that 84 per cent believe it would decrease problems between stewards and fans and 97 per cent feel that modern technology can make standing safe at grounds.

Director of Communications for the Football Supporters Federation Michael Brunskill said: ‘Many fans love to stand at games, it can vastly improve the atmosphere and camaraderie at games, it's only natural to stand when you sing. ‘Safe standing areas exist on the continent and the FSF believes they should be introduced into our grounds as well. These areas are modern and safe, a million miles from the crumbling death traps of the 80s. ‘It's fantastic to see fans, clubs, and politicians coming together to deliver this message to Westminster. We need a safe standing pilot - and why shouldn't that be in Wales?’ Standing areas at football grounds in the Premier League and Championship has been outlawed since 1994 at the recommendation of the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool supporters.

chatgpt: The campaign to reintroduce standing areas in football stadiums has been gathering momentum recently. The idea has generated a lot of conversation among fans, officials and football authorities alike. Now, the campaign has received a significant boost with the announcement of support for standing areas at Old Trafford by Ed Woodward, the chief executive of Manchester United. Woodward made his comments in a recent interview, where he spoke about the importance of listening to the views of supporters. He stated that he believed it was time to reassess standing in stadiums and give fans the choice to stand or sit during games. Woodward also revealed that Manchester United would be looking to test standing areas in certain parts of Old Trafford in the near future. This announcement comes on the back of a recent survey conducted by the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF), which revealed that a majority of fans are in favour of the reintroduction of standing areas. The survey, which polled 2,364 supporters across the country, found that 94% of respondents believed that fans should be given the option to stand during games. Additionally, 71% of respondents said they would prefer standing to be trialled in some areas of stadiums. Manchester United is not the only club to voice their support for standing areas. Aston Villa, Hull City and Swansea have also expressed their backing for the idea. The clubs have pointed to the success of standing areas in Germany, where they have been in use for many years. Despite the support for the campaign, there are still concerns over safety issues. Back in 1989, the Hillsborough disaster led to the death of 96 Liverpool fans and resulted in the banning of standing areas in top tier English football. However, supporters argue that standing areas can be safe if implemented correctly, with modern barriers and stewards trained in crowd management. The debate over standing areas is likely to continue for some time, but this recent surge of support will undoubtedly add pressure on football authorities to reconsider the current regulations. With the backing of several clubs and high-profile figures, it seems the campaign to bring back standing areas in stadiums is gaining traction, and it may not be long before the Premier League sees the return of swaying terraces.
