article: (CNN) -- A crew member on a U.S.-flagged cargo ship captured by pirates off the coast of Somalia is suing his employers, claiming they sent him into pirate-infested waters without adequate protection, his attorney said Monday. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse has been charged with piracy in federal court in New York. Richard Hicks of Royal Palm Beach, Florida, a crew member on the Maersk Alabama, filed suit Monday against Waterman Steamship Corp. and Maersk Line Limited, according to the attorney, Terry Bryant. A spokeswoman for Mobile, Alabama-based Waterman Steamship Corp. said she did not know about the suit and did not immediately comment. A spokeswoman for Maersk Line Limited did not immediately return a call from CNN seeking comment. The Maersk Alabama was hijacked by pirates April 8. Hicks, working as chief steward and preparing food for other crew members, heard over the loudspeaker that pirates were on board, and he and other crew members gathered in the ship's engine room for nearly 12 hours, according to a news release from Bryant. "The engine room was dark and hot, maybe 130 degrees," Hicks said in the news release. "We were all cramping up with heat stroke symptoms when we were able to take a pirate hostage and tried to negotiate the return of our captain." The pirates promised to exchange Capt. Richard Phillips for the pirate hostage, but reneged on that agreement, the news release. Phillips offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the freedom of his crew. He was held on a lifeboat until U.S. Navy snipers on a nearby ship fatally shot three pirates, rescued Phillips and arrested a fourth pirate. The ship's owners -- the two companies -- knowingly exposed their employees to danger and took no steps to provide appropriate security and safety for the crew, Bryant alleges. "Waterman Steamship Corp. and Maersk Line Limited chose to rely on the United States military and taxpayers to provide after-the-fact rescue operations," Bryant said in the news release. "This choice caused substantially more cost and risk to human life than what would have been incurred by defendants had they provided appropriate levels of security in the first place." Hicks is seeking at least $75,000, and "reserves the right to amend this pleading for a certain amount in the future, as it is too early to determine the maximum amount of plaintiff's damages," according to the suit. Hicks is still suffering from injuries as a result of the incident and is afraid to return to work, the news release said.

chatgpt: A lawsuit filed by Richard Hicks, a former steward of the Maersk Alabama, alleges that the ship's crew was sent into pirate-infested waters without proper protection. The suit focuses on the events leading up to the ship's hijacking by pirates who boarded the vessel on April 8, 2009. Hicks, who is from Royal Palm Beach, Florida, claims that the owners of the ship failed to provide adequate protection, even after receiving warnings about the dangers of the area. The Maersk Alabama had been carrying relief supplies for Somalia when it was hijacked by a group of Somali pirates. The incident attracted worldwide attention as it was the first Americn-flagged ship to be hijacked in over 200 years. The ship's captain, Richard Phillips, was taken hostage and held by the pirates for five days before being rescued by US Navy SEALs. According to the lawsuit filed by Hicks, the ship's owners were aware of the risks associated with sailing through pirate-infested waters but failed to provide adequate protection to the crew. Hicks claims that the owners failed to provide armed security and refused to allow crew members to carry weapons, despite being aware of the risks. Representatives of the ship's owners have not yet commented on the lawsuit. However, the incident prompted the shipping industry to increase its focus on security in response to the growing threat of piracy in the region. Many ships now carry private armed security guards to protect crew members and deter pirates. The Maersk Alabama incident was not an isolated case. Piracy in the region has been a persistent problem for many years, with Somali pirates targeting ships for ransom. In recent years, there have been fewer incidents due to an increased focus on security, including the deployment of military assets to the region. The lawsuit filed by Richard Hicks is a reminder of the risks that crew members face when sailing through pirate-infested waters. While the shipping industry has taken steps to improve security, there is still a long way to go to ensure that crews are adequately protected. The Maersk Alabama incident also highlighted the bravery of the crew members who faced the pirate threat head-on. Captain Phillips became a hero for his actions in protecting his crew, and the incident was later dramatized in a Hollywood movie. As the shipping industry continues to grapple with the threat of piracy, it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure the safety and security of crews. The lawsuit filed by Hicks serves as a reminder of the importance of taking all necessary measures to protect crew members from harm. The shipping industry must continue to work together to develop strategies to improve security and ensure that incidents like the Maersk Alabama hijacking never happen again.
