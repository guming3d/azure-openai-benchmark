A Navy veteran who refused to kowtow to Hitler has finally been stopped in his tracks – by 'ageist' health and safety red tape. Albert 'Dusty' Miller, 89, has been barred from serving as a marshal and standard-bearer at Royal British Legion events because he is too old to be insured. The ex-serviceman – who served with distinction in the Royal Navy both in the Atlantic convoys and as a submariner in the Burma campaign – was told he could no longer help organise and lead parades, a role he has carried out for 38 years. Albert 'Dusty' Miller, 89, served with distinction in WWII but was told he could no longer act as parade marshal because he was too old . Mr Miller was given the bad news just before the dedication of Liverpool's Garden of Remembrance – and told he could only attend future events as a 'guest'. Jim Ryan, chairman of the Legion's Merseyside and West Lancashire branch, said he had not been eligible for insurance since he was 85, but the organisation had only just realised the oversight. Mr Miller, from Kirkby, Merseyside, said: 'Hitler couldn't stop me but red tape has rained on my poppy parade. 'I never even knew standard-bearers had to be insured.' A close friend of Mr Miller's, who still works with the Legion and refused to be named,  said: 'To say that anyone over 85 is redundant to an organisation like the Royal British Legion flies completely in the face of  that message. 'It is indirect ageism by jobsworths – and from an organisation that highlights the plight of war veterans that is crazy.' (File picture) Mr Miller, from Kirkby, Merseyside, served on the Atlantic convoys in World War II . Mr Miller joined the Royal Navy at the age of 16 as a cadet and received four campaign medals – the 39-45 Star, the Atlantic medal for the convoys, the Burma Star with a Pacific clasp, and the International Submarine Service medal. The Royal British Legion insisted that its hands were tied for 'health and safety reasons'. A spokesperson said: 'The Legion has a duty of care towards all parade marshals and standard bearers. 'For health and safety reasons, the Legion's insurance policy only covers persons up to the age of 85. 'We are extremely grateful to Mr Miller for his years of dedicated service to the Legion and of course welcome him to attend future parades as a guest.'

chatgpt: An elderly veteran who served with distinction in World War II has been barred from serving at events organized by the Royal British Legion. The 89-year-old Albert 'Dusty' Miller had hoped to continue his service by becoming a marshal or standard-bearer at events organized by the Legion, but insurers have deemed his age too high-risk, and as such, he has been barred from performing these roles. Mr. Miller was surprised by the decision, stating that he had no knowledge of the age restrictions for these positions. In an interview with a local newspaper, he said, "I never even knew standard-bearers had to be insured." He went on to express his disappointment in being unable to continue his service with the organization. Mr. Miller is not alone in his disappointment; many veterans across the country have voiced their concern over the decision. Some have even suggested that the Legion is discriminating against elderly veterans by imposing age restrictions on its roles. However, the Legion has defended its actions, stating that its hands are tied for "health and safety reasons." A spokesperson for the Legion said, "We have a duty of care to ensure that all those involved in our events are safe and secure. Unfortunately, due to insurance restrictions and health and safety concerns, we have had to impose age restrictions on some of our roles, including marshall and standard-bearer. This is not a decision we have taken lightly, but we must prioritize the safety of all involved." Mr. Miller's service in the Royal Navy during World War II was commendable, and the restrictions placed on his role is most likely not a reflection of his abilities or character. The Royal British Legion has acknowledged his service, and while they are unable to allow him to serve as a marshal or standard-bearer, they hope that he will continue to support their activities in other ways. The imposition of age restrictions on veterans is a touchy subject, and many believe it to be unfair. However, the Legion has a duty to protect all those involved in its events, and it is understandable that they would want to minimize the risks involved. This may, unfortunately, mean that some veterans are unable to serve in certain roles, but their service and contribution to their country should not be forgotten. In conclusion, the case of Albert 'Dusty' Miller highlights the stringent safety measures that organizations like the Royal British Legion have to comply with. While it is understandable that restrictions may cause disappointment, the safety of all involved must be the top priority, and it is hoped that Mr. Miller and other veterans like him will continue to find ways to support the work of the Royal British Legion.
