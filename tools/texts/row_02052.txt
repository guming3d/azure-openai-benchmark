article: Venezuela's President severed diplomatic relations with Panama Wednesday, accusing the Central American nation of being a "lackey" for the United States in a conspiracy plot against his government. "There are maneuvers by the U.S. government plotting with a lackey government that has a right-wing president who is leaving in the next few months, who is not worthy of his people, who has been working actively against Venezuela," President Nicolas Maduro said in televised remarks. He accused Panama of pushing for regional organizations to intervene in Venezuela. As a result, Maduro said he was cutting off diplomatic and political ties and freezing trade relations with Panama's current government "in defense of the homeland's sovereignty." Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli said in a Twitter post that he was surprised by Venezuela's decision. "Panama only longs for its brother country to find peace and strengthen its democracy," he said. The latest bout of diplomatic wrangling comes after weeks of anti-government protests in Venezuela, which are the biggest threat Maduro has faced since his election last year. In a statement late Wednesday, Panama's government denied Maduro's accusations and said it had tried to encourage action by the Organization of American States to help promote dialogue, democracy and human rights in Venezuela. "We reject as unacceptable the insults uttered by President Nicolas Maduro against our country and its highest authority. The foul language used is inappropriate for the president of a brother country," the statement said. Last month Maduro expelled three U.S. diplomats form Venezuela, accusing them of conspiring against his government. The United States expelled three Venezuelan diplomats last week in retaliation. The State Department has repeatedly denied Venezuela's accusations that it's funding opposition efforts to topple Maduro's government or involved in other conspiracy plots. "Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people," U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters last month.

chatgpt: In a move that could further fuel the already tense relationship between Venezuela and other Latin American countries, the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced the cutting of diplomatic and political ties with Panama. The decision came after Maduro accused Panama of being a "conspirator" against Venezuela and acting as a "lackey" for the United States. Maduro's decision was announced in a speech to supporters in which he tersely stated that he would no longer tolerate "any form of interventionism or conspiracy against Venezuela". Maduro went on to accuse Panama of "playing into the hands of the American empire and its lackeys", a clear reference to the United States. The announcement was met with condemnation from many in the international community, who expressed concern about the deteriorating political situation in Venezuela. The United States issued a statement expressing concern that Maduro's decision to break ties with Panama would hurt the people of Venezuela and further isolate the Maduro regime. In response to the announcement, the Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli expressed his desire for peace and prosperity in Venezuela. Martinelli stated that "Panama stands ever ready to help Venezuela find a way to peace and democracy" The decision to sever ties with Panama is the latest development in a series of troubling incidents in Venezuela, where the Maduro government has been facing street protests and accusations of corruption and mismanagement. The Maduro regime has been criticized for its handling of the economy, which is suffering from hyperinflation, food shortages, and high unemployment. The Venezuelan government has become increasingly isolated in recent years due to its erratic behavior and crackdown on opposition. This latest move to cut ties with Panama only further cements Venezuela's status as a pariah in the international community. Many fear that the situation in Venezuela could spiral out of control, with the country becoming increasingly unstable and authoritarian. The Maduro government has been accused of human rights abuses and political repression, and the country's political future remains uncertain. In the meantime, the international community continues to watch events in Venezuela with growing concern. The situation is rapidly deteriorating and many fear that unless something is done, it could result in a major humanitarian crisis.
