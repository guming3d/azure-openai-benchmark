article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy arrested nine more suspected pirates off the coast of Somalia Thursday -- the second capture in two days -- after receiving a distress call from an Indian-flagged commercial ship. Suspected pirates are arrested in the Gulf of Aden. According to the Navy announcement, at 4 a.m. local time the Indian-flagged Premdivya sent a distress call to all ships in the area reporting that she had been fired upon by a small skiff, and suspected pirates were attempting to board it. A U.S. Navy helicopter crew was launched from the USS Vella Gulf and fired two warning shots at the small boat to get them to stop. A Navy boarding team was then launched to investigate the skiff's crew and found rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons on board the small craft, according to Navy officials. The suspected pirates were taken aboard the USS Vella Gulf and processed. They'll be moved to a temporary holding facility aboard the larger USNS Lewis and Clark, according to the statement. The Navy is now holding a total of 16 suspected pirates while the U.S. and Kenyan governments work out legal details on how the suspects will be moved to Kenya for prosecution. Last month, the United States and Kenya signed an agreement saying that suspected pirates captured by U.S. ships will be moved to Kenya to be tried for their crimes. The capture Wednesday of seven suspected pirates marks the first time the United States was able to capture and hold pirates since its forces began patrolling the dangerous waters off Somalia. Piracy has become a chronic problem off the Horn of Africa in recent years, with some pirates operating from largely lawless Somalia. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau. The task force led by the Vella Gulf was set up in January in an effort to clamp down on the attacks in the region, the southern approach to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.

chatgpt: Nine suspects have been arrested off the coast of Somalia, marking the second major arrest in as many days. The United States and Kenya have been working together to apprehend those responsible for piracy and other illegal activities off the coast of Somalia. The arrests were made as part of a joint operation between the United States and Kenya, with both countries working together to track down and capture suspected pirates and other criminals. The operation was carried out off the coast of Somalia, where piracy has become a major problem in recent years. The suspects were taken into custody after their boat was intercepted by Kenyan and U.S. Navy vessels. They are believed to be involved in a range of criminal activities, including piracy, smuggling, and arms trafficking. The suspects were taken to a Kenyan port, where they will be held while legal proceedings are carried out. The United States and Kenya have been cooperating closely on these types of operations in recent years, as both countries seek to combat piracy and other criminal activity in the region. Kenya has become a key partner for the United States in this effort, with the two countries working together to share intelligence, coordinate operations, and carry out joint patrols. The arrests come at a time when piracy in the waters off the coast of Somalia has been on the rise once again. The region had seen a significant decline in piracy activity in recent years, but there has been a surge in the number of attacks in recent months. The United States and its partners in the region are working hard to combat this trend and bring those responsible to justice. The legal details of the latest arrests are still being worked out by authorities in the United States and Kenya. Both countries are expected to cooperate closely on this matter, with the goal of ensuring that those responsible for piracy and other illegal activities are brought to justice. This latest operation serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges that the United States and its partners face in combating piracy and other forms of criminal activity off the coast of Somalia. Despite these challenges, however, the joint efforts of the U.S. and its partners have led to significant progress in recent years. With continued cooperation and vigilance, it is hoped that these efforts can help to make the waters off the coast of Somalia safer and more secure for all.
