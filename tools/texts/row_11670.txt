article: (CNN) -- Governors in three Eastern Seaboard states Friday called on National Guard troops to help evacuate people from flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida. Strong winds and rain from the powerful storm have left thousands without power. Ida lost momentum but not the ability to generate winds and rain as it made landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast earlier this week, forecasters said. The National Weather Service had flood advisories in effect Friday for areas of coastal Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey. At least 160 National Guard troops were deployed in sections of Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey to evacuate residents in high-water areas as well as provide cots, sandbags and potable water, according to the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau. "About 40 members of the Delaware National Guard have provided support to civilian emergency relief agencies in Kent and Sussex counties," the bureau said. The New Jersey National Guard sent 18 guardsmen with trucks to help with evacuations in the Cape May and Atlantic counties, where the governor Thursday declared a state of emergency due to flooding, Guard officials reported . Almost 100 guardsmen with high-water vehicles were helping firefighters in Portsmouth, Virginia. Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine declared a state of emergency, saying the remnants of Ida had combined with another storm to cause dangerous conditions in some areas. By early afternoon, at least 155,000 customers were without power in the state -- mostly in and around Norfolk, according to the Dominion Power Web site. "With the National Weather Service indicating that eastern Virginia could experience flooding and storm surge comparable to the effects of a Category 1 hurricane, it's critical that Virginians make the necessary preparations," Kaine said. "While we will continue to monitor conditions, the commonwealth is preparing for a period of coastal flooding through at least Friday evening."

chatgpt: A powerful storm has swept across the East Coast, leaving devastation in its wake. Strong winds and heavy rain have caused power outages and flooded roads in several states, including Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey. As the storm moved through the region on Friday, flood advisories were issued for low-lying areas. The National Guard Bureau responded quickly, deploying at least 160 troops to assist in high-water areas. Their efforts were concentrated in Delaware, where the Brandywine River reached flood stage and posed a threat to nearby homes and businesses. In Virginia, Dominion Power reported that at least 155,000 customers had lost electricity by early afternoon. The company said that crews were working around the clock to repair the damage caused by the storm, but warned that some customers could remain without power for several days. Emergency officials urged residents to stay indoors and avoid driving through flooded areas. In Delaware, state authorities warned that floodwaters could contain hazardous materials, such as sewage and chemicals, and advised residents to take precautions to protect themselves from exposure. The storm caused significant disruptions to transportation, with several airports canceling flights and Amtrak suspending service on some routes. Travelers were urged to check with their airlines and transportation providers for updates. Across the affected states, residents took stock of the damage and began the process of cleaning up. Local officials reported downed trees and power lines, flooded streets, and other storm-related problems. As the storm moved further up the coast, officials in New York and New England were monitoring its progress and preparing for potential impact. Forecasters warned of high winds, heavy rain, and the risk of coastal flooding. With the storm expected to persist over the weekend, authorities urged residents to remain vigilant and prepare for potential power outages, flooding, and other hazards.
