Authorities urged motorists in north-central and northeast Iowa to stay off roads because of poor visibility caused by blowing snow. Authorities prohibited tow trucks from operating on U.S. Highway 20, near the border with Minnesota, because of concerns the tow trucks would get stuck. Forecasters said wind chills of 20 below and 30 below zero were possible in much of the rest of the Midwest, prompting wind chill advisories and warnings for the region into Monday morning. Blizzard warnings also were expected to be in effect into Monday for parts of Maine and western parts of Michigan's lower peninsula. In much of Maine, between 10 and 18 inches of snow was expected to fall Sunday and Monday, the weather service said. Whiteout conditions were expected at night, with wind gusts of up to 45 mph, the weather service said. The Minnesota Department of Transportation ordered snowplow drivers off the road until Sunday morning in 13 southwest counties, because of poor visibility, blowing snow and wind gusts up to 40 mph, an agency spokeswoman said Saturday. The western U.S. has also been hit with the cold blast. Parts of Washington saw 2 to 3 feet of snow last week.

He also said he's been unable to free his car. "Everything is sold out -- snow shovels, ice melt, salt, chains ... so I don't know how to get out," he said. The storm system is expected to move eastward, where people are already dealing with air traffic delays and power outages brought on by snowfall earlier this week. "This is essentially the reincarnation of the same storm that brought the heavy snow to parts of California, southern Nevada and northern Arizona," Steve Corfidi, lead forecaster with the weather service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, told CNNRadio.

chatgpt: Blizzard conditions have hit parts of Maine and Michigan, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a warning, urging people to stay indoors. Authorities in the north-central and northeast parts of Iowa are also advising residents to avoid driving on the icy roads. The intense winter weather has proven to be deadly, with at least one person losing their life due to the storms. Authorities have not released any further details regarding the fatality. The blizzard warning in Maine comes as a result of a powerful winter storm that is expected to bring heavy snowfall and strong winds, resulting in near-zero visibility. The situation in Michigan is similar, with residents advised to expect high winds and significant snow accumulation. As a result of the blizzard warnings, several schools and businesses have announced closures in the affected areas. Air travel has also been impacted, with several airlines canceling flights to the region. Vehicular traffic on highways and roads has been significantly reduced as well due to the icy conditions and low visibility. Authorities have been working diligently to treat the roads with salt and sand to improve travel conditions, but the snowfall has made it an arduous task. They are strongly advising motorists to avoid driving unless absolutely necessary, stating that road conditions are treacherous and can result in accidents and injury. Residents in the affected areas have been advised to stay indoors and remain warm, especially as temperatures are expected to drop significantly. Those who must venture outside should dress in layers and avoid overexertion to prevent hypothermia and other cold-related health concerns. The blizzard warnings come as winter weather continues to affect large parts of the country, including the Midwest and Northeast regions. Several states have already experienced multiple snowstorms this season, and many are bracing for more winter weather in the coming weeks. With the winter weather set to continue, authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant, stay informed about their local conditions, and take all necessary precautions to ensure their safety. From avoiding driving on icy roads to bundling up and staying indoors, residents should do what they can to protect themselves during these frigid winter months. In conclusion, the blizzard warnings in Maine and Michigan, combined with the winter weather conditions in Iowa have put pressure on residents to stay safe indoors. This is a stern warning for those who decide to brave the winter weather that the hazards of the blizzard can result in accidents and injury. Authorities remind residents to enforce safety measures including avoiding driving on icy roads, dressing appropriately, and staying informed about developments in their area.
