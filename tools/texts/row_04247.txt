article: (CNN) -- Islamist militants had been saving one last blow to deal to France after its military conducted a bloody, unsuccessful hostage rescue attempt in Somalia Friday. Al-Shabaab declared Wednesday that it has killed the hostage. In the war of words, it was important to the militia to announce the killing occurred not during but after the raid -- as retribution for it.

The French defense ministry has said it believed the militant group killed military agent Denis Allex during Friday's intense firefight thus thwarting the operation's objective on the spot. The al Qaeda affiliate claimed soon after the raid that it had moved Allex unharmed to a new location and would decide his fate shortly afterward in light of France's deadly military operation.

In the long statement on its decision to take his life, al-Shabaab accused the French soldiers of killing Muslims in military operations abroad and mistreating them at home. It mentioned France's current role in Mali, where 1,700 troops are to join forces with neighboring African countries to rout out an Islamist occupation of the country's north. All of this in sum warranted Allex' killing as an act of vengeance, al-Shabaab said. Read more: French bid to rescue hostage in Somalia fails, leading to soldier's death . At least 17 al-Shabaab fighters and two French soldiers died in Friday's mission in the village of Bulo-Marer, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of Mogadishu. The French defense ministry originally reported one of the two soldiers as missing, but al-Shabaab later posted a photo of his purported corpse to its Twitter feed, saying he had died of wounds suffered during the heated battle that ensued during Friday's operation. Allex was abducted on July 14, 2009, while on a mission in Mogadishu in support of the transitional Somali government, the French Defense Ministry said. French media reports suggest that Denis Allex is a pseudonym for the military serviceman. French officials said they launched the rescue attempt after the terror group failed to negotiate for the hostage's release for years while holding him in inhumane conditions. On Monday, French Defense Dinister Jean-Yves le Drian said the failure of the rescue mission was "extremely regrettable." CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report .

chatgpt: Somali Islamists have claimed responsibility for the killing of a French intelligence agent, Denis Allex, who was held hostage for nearly four years. The Islamists claimed that the killing was revenge for a French military raid conducted on Friday in which several Islamist militants were killed. The French government has stated that they believe Allex died during their rescue attempt. However, Al-Shabaab, the Islamist group which has been holding him, claimed that they had kept him alive after the French forces’ operation. In a statement released soon after the killing, Al-Shabaab said that France had killed Muslims around the world, and that the killing of Denis Allex was a response to French aggression. “It is a response to the recent French operation in Bulo Marer,” the statement read. The French government confirmed the military raid on Bulo Marer, which is a stronghold for Al-Shabaab. The operation reportedly targeted a high-ranking Al-Shabaab commander who was suspected to be planning attacks against Western interests in the region. The French have been actively involved in counter-terrorism operations in the region. They have been supporting the Somali government in their fight against Islamist militants, who have been trying to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state in the country. The killing of Denis Allex marks a painful reminder of the high stakes involved in counter-terrorism operations in the region. The French government has been working closely with the Somali government to target militant groups, but the conflict remains complex and difficult to resolve. The situation has also highlighted the risks involved in holding hostages in regions that are prone to conflict and instability. Denis Allex was held hostage for nearly four years before he was killed. The French government had been trying to secure his release for several years, but their efforts were unsuccessful. The killing of Denis Allex has drawn condemnation from several Western governments, with the French government calling it a “despicable act of terrorism.” The situation highlights the ongoing threat of Islamist militancy in the region and the need for a continued and coordinated response from the international community. In conclusion, the killing of Denis Allex by Al-Shabaab has underlined the risks of counter-terrorism operations in volatile and conflict-prone regions. It has also highlighted the ongoing threat of Islamist militancy in the region and the need for a sustained and coordinated response from the international community.
