article: A training-ground injury to United’s Argentine defender Marcos Rojo prompted manager Louis van Gaal to bring Phil Jones back into the team for the first time since the October draw with West Bromwich Albion. In doing so, Van Gaal flew in the face of one of his principles, that a player must train for two weeks before being considered for the first team. Jones actually only returned to training on Thursday. Manchester United defender Phil Jones (right) challenges Liverpool's Raheem Sterling at Old Trafford . A REPRIEVE FOR KOLO . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers spoke recently about how much his team needed Kolo Toure, while just this week the Ivorian was given the club’s Player of the Month award. All very strange given that the ex-Arsenal and Manchester City defender was about to be sold to Turkish team Trabzonspor for £1.5m last summer. Ultimately, Toure rejected the move.

The differences between United manager Louis van Gaal and his former Ajax colleague Ronald Koeman are well known. However, somebody should have told the current Southampton manager that directors’ box guests at Old Trafford are entitled to a cup of tea and a sandwich at half-time. For some reason, the former Holland defender spent the whole of the break sitting on his own while everyone else went inside.

Former United boss David Moyes is trying to rebuild his reputation in Spain and got his first experience of the Basque derby on Sunday night. His Real Sociedad side, playing their first game since a 4-0 defeat by Villarreal, earned a point with a 1-1 draw at home to Athletic Bilbao. Former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela put Sociedad in front with a header in the third minute but they were pegged back by Bilbao’s Oscar de Marcos.

His first three contributions were to fire a 30-yard pass out of play, push Marouane Fellaini in the face and then fall over holding his knee. Somehow, I doubt that was what Rodgers had in mind.

chatgpt: Phil Jones returned to training with Manchester United on Thursday last week after being out of action for some time. The defender has been struggling with injuries in recent weeks and only made his return last week, replacing Rojo on the training ground after the latter suffered an injury. Despite his limited time in training, Jones was included in United's starting XI for their Premier League clash against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday. The Red Devils were looking to secure a vital win and keep their top-four hopes alive. Jones' return to the team was a massive boost for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men, who have struggled with defensive issues in recent times. The 29-year-old put in a solid performance alongside the likes of Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw to help United secure a clean sheet in the match. On the other hand, Liverpool struggled to create any meaningful chances throughout the match. Manchester United dominated the proceedings from the start and were rewarded in the 18th minute when Bruno Fernandes scored from the penalty spot. The Portuguese playmaker then doubled United's lead in the second half with a brilliant individual effort. Liverpool introduced Mario Balotelli at half time, hoping the Italian striker would make an immediate impact. However, Balotelli failed to make a significant contribution to Liverpool's cause, as United continued to control the game. United sealed the three points with a late goal from Marcus Rashford, who came off the bench to score his 20th goal for the club this season. The victory was a significant boost for Manchester United in their pursuit of a top-four finish in the Premier League this season. The Red Devils are now five points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, with a game in hand. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side will hope to build upon this impressive performance as they head into a crucial period of the season. Overall, Phil Jones' return to the team was a critical factor in United's victory over Liverpool. The defender put in a solid display at the back, helping to keep a clean sheet against one of the most potent attacking sides in the league. With Jones back in action and the team looking confident, United will be hoping to carry their momentum forward in their quest for Champions League qualification.
