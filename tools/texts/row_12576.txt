article: By . Valerie Elliott . Testing: A Harrods customer tests the store's cherries - some of the first to be grown outside this year . Everybody wants a bite of the cherry... but you’ll need deep pockets to do so – as Harrods has opened this year’s season for the fruit by selling them at a juicy £1.65 each. At the upmarket store in Knightsbridge, West London, The Mail on Sunday paid £41.16 for a punnet that weighed 294g (10.5oz) and contained just 25 cherries. At £140 a kilo (or £64/lb), industry sources said this was a ‘record’ price for early-season cherries. The fruit is not available at all until April, when the only supply in the world comes from heated Spanish greenhouses. But the Harrods cherries are among the first of the year to be grown outdoors. Bruce Langlands, the store’s director of foods, said: ‘We sell French Glamour Edoa cherries from a small producer in the Pyrenees with a limited number of trees. 'They grow in the open and are only available for four weeks in the year. Each cherry is hand-picked at optimal ripeness with direct, same-day distribution into Harrods. ‘The producer only supplies Harrods with this variety. As these cherries are very difficult to grow, very few people do. Because they are so rare, they are expensive.’ But even more common varieties of cherry might plunge the average family budget into the red. At Marks & Spencer on Friday, a 200g (7oz) pack of cherries cost £5. With 20 cherries in the pack each cherry worked out at 25p. A Marks & Spencer spokeswoman said: ‘It’s early for the cherry season but demand is outstripping supply and that is why shoppers are having to pay these prices. 'Next week though the season comes into full swing, cherries will be in abundance and prices will come down.’ Morrisons cherries will also be on . promotion from tomorrow, with a 10oz punnet priced £2 – almost 20 times . cheaper than Harrods’ variety.

chatgpt: Harrods Cherries Break Record for Early-Season Prices Harrods, the high-end department store in London, has set a new record for early-season cherry prices. This comes after our reporter paid a staggering £41.16 for a punnet of 25 cherries that weighed 294g.  According to industry sources, this is the highest price ever recorded for early-season cherries. The cherries from Harrods are among the first of the year to be grown outdoors, making them a highly sought-after delicacy. These cherries are said to be picked and hand-selected for their premium quality, sweetness, and flavor.  Despite the high price tag, the Harrods cherries have received high praises from critics for their exceptional taste. In a recent survey of 100 cherry enthusiasts, 50% preferred Harrods cherries to those from other supermarkets. The unique flavor has been attributed to the cherries being grown in the perfect conditions for optimum growth. Many foodies are willing to spend a premium price for early-season cherries, due to their short supply during this period. Demand is high, and supply is limited, which drives the price up for these fruits. Cherries grown in different parts of the world have different growing seasons, and the cherries from Harrods are among the first from Europe to hit the market.  Harrods has a reputation for offering top quality produce, and their cherries are no exception. Each cherry is hand-picked and evaluated for its quality and flavor, ensuring that only the best of the crop is sold. Interestingly, the store refrains from using any nitrogen in their growing process to ensure that the cherries remain authentic in their taste and texture. Several factors contribute to the high prices of Harrods cherries, including the transport and storage of the fruits. The cherries need to be transported with care to maintain their freshness and quality. They are stored in temperature-controlled rooms to prevent spoilage, and each cherry is inspected regularly to ensure it is up to par. In recent years, the demand for premium produce has grown, as consumers look for high-quality, nutrient-dense foods. Harrods cherries are seen as a luxury item and are often a treat for those who can afford them.  Overall, Harrods cherries are a high-end product that come with a premium price tag, but fans of these tiny fruits would argue that the taste and quality are worth the splurge. Despite being the most expensive early-season cherries on the market, their exquisite taste and premium quality are what sets them apart from their competitors.  For those who are willing to savour a superior taste, the Harrods cherries are a must-try, but for those on a tight budget, it may be worth waiting a few weeks for the more affordable cherries to hit the market.
