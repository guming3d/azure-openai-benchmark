article: (CNN) -- A volunteer at a golf tournament in 2012 accused embattled Miami Dolphins player Richie Incognito of inappropriately touching her with a golf club, according to a newly disclosed police report. No charges were filed, according to CNN affiliate WPLG-TV, which first obtained the police report. The station reported that the woman declined to comment, saying she had signed a confidentiality agreement. The Dolphins also declined to comment, the station said. Attempts by CNN to reach Incognito's attorney and the NFL team late Thursday night were unsuccessful. The team suspended Incognito on Sunday for unspecified allegations of improper conduct. ESPN, NFL.com and other media outlets have reported that representatives for teammate Jonathan Martin submitted voice mails and text messages in which Incognito used racial slurs and threatened physical violence. Martin left the team left week and is now considered "on leave." Incognito declined to comment on those reports but predicted Tuesday he would "weather the storm." Also Tuesday, gossip website TMZ posted a video of Incognito in a bar shouting profanities and using a racial slur to refer to a teammate who was with him. TMZ said the video was recorded this year. The latest report from police in Aventura, Florida, concerns a golf tournament sponsored by the Dolphins' charitable foundation on May 18, 2012. The police report quoted the 34-year-old woman, who was a volunteer at the tournament, as saying Incognito had been drinking before he approached her. The woman said Incognito used his golf club to touch her crotch, stomach and chest and then knock sunglasses off her head, the police report said. The woman said Incognito then leaned against her buttocks as if dancing and finally emptied a water bottle in her face, the police report said. The woman said Dolphins officials were notified, but she believed they took no action, the police report said. The police report said she wanted an apology from Incognito. The police report classified her allegations as simple battery. The report showed police listed the case as "cleared" the same night it was filed, although the woman was told how to proceed if she wanted prosecutors to file a criminal charge.

chatgpt: Miami Dolphins' offensive guard, Richie Incognito, is in the news once again after a woman reported to police that he had touched her with a golf club and leaned against her. The woman, whose identity is being kept confidential, claimed that she went to police because she believed Dolphins officials took no action against Incognito. However, no charges were filed against Incognito, and the woman said she cannot comment further due to a confidentiality agreement she has signed. This is not the first time Incognito has faced controversy. Earlier this month, the Dolphins suspended him, following accusations from teammate, Jonathan Martin, of using racial slurs and making violent threats against him. The report of Martin's allegations sparked an investigation by the NFL into the Dolphins' workplace conduct.  The team, however, has defended Incognito in the past, with head coach Joe Philbin stating he was unaware of any evidence of misconduct prior to the suspension. Incognito has also received support from some of his teammates who have publicly spoken out in his defense. The Dolphins have since released a statement expressing their disappointment in the latest turn of events but have not commented further on the matter. The team remains focused on the ongoing investigation into their workplace culture. Meanwhile, Incognito's future with the team remains uncertain. His suspension has been extended indefinitely, and he may face further disciplinary action from the NFL, pending the results of its investigation. The NFL has been facing increasing scrutiny over the past few years regarding its handling of player misconduct, particularly in cases of domestic violence and sexual assault. The league has launched several initiatives aimed at addressing these issues and promoting healthier and more respectful relationships among players. In the case of Incognito, the league will undoubtedly be monitoring the situation closely and taking appropriate action to ensure that all players can work in a safe and respectful environment. The investigation may take several months, but the NFL has made it clear that it will not tolerate any behavior that violates its policies and standards. In conclusion, this is a developing story, and we will continue to monitor and report on any new developments regarding Richie Incognito and the Miami Dolphins.
