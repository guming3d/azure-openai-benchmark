article: Chicago (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton lit into members of Congress on Wednesday night in Chicago, questioning their resolve to legislate as opposed to their desire to play politics. "The basic problem is we have lost leaders on both sides of the aisle, particularly at this point in history, on the other side of the aisle, who are more interested in governing than in posturing, more interested in problem solving than in partisanship," Clinton told an audience of business leaders at The Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday night. Clinton, the former senator from New York and Democrats' presidential favorite, said this became clear for her during the 16-day partial government shutdown in 2013, when President Barack Obama had to cancel his trip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia. At the time Clinton was secretary of state. "I don't care what party you are, Democrats never did that to George W. Bush despite our deep differences with President Bush on taxes, on Iraq, on so many other things," Clinton said. "We never did it." Clinton waffles on Obamacare tax question . Clinton's remarks were more stepped up than in the past, questioning not only Congress' resolve, but their commitment to doing their jobs. "You have to ask yourself, do these particular members of Congress really understand the world? Understand what it means for the United States to lead and to be perceived as a leader? Or do they just not care," Clinton posited. "Do they just have a whole other agenda that enables them to say whatever they want to say and spout whatever rhetoric they want to spout?" Clinton has been outspoken in her longing for political leaders who could negotiate and cut deals. Her stump speech regularly includes lines that decry partisan politics. "It is deeply distressing to me that we have people running for Congress, both House and Senate, who proudly go around their districts and their states proclaiming that you should send them to Washington because they will never compromise," Clinton said, pulling a line from previous speeches. Sizing up a Clinton-Romney race . Clinton urged the 900 well-heeled business leaders and philanthropists in the room to make their disapproval known. "That is why it is imperative that you have people in business and other positions of responsibility basically say... 'Get out there and do your job. Stay off the talk shows. Get back to the Congress. Legislate and solve America's problems.'" She added later, in an apparent appeal to independents, this call: "The only way to solve this is for the American people, the American voters... who constitute the great middle of the American political system, to just call a halt to it."

chatgpt: Former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed her concerns regarding the current state of Congress during a recent interview. In her view, legislators on both sides of the aisle have lost the resolve to enact meaningful and necessary laws. "The basic problem is we have lost leaders on both sides of the aisle," Clinton stated. She further criticized the political climate in which politicians prioritize party politics over the needs of the country. "Too many people are more interested in scoring points against the other side than actually getting results that help the American people," she added. Clinton's comments come at a time when the approval rating for Congress is at an all-time low. According to a recent Gallup poll, only 15% of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing. This frustration with the legislative branch is not new, as the approval rating has consistently been low in recent years. Clinton specifically cited issues such as the lack of progress on gun control legislation and healthcare reform as examples of Congress' inability to act in the best interest of the public. Regardless of political affiliation, Clinton emphasized the importance of electing leaders who prioritize working towards solutions rather than political gamesmanship. Clinton's comments are not only directed towards Congress but also towards American voters. She argues that voters must choose representatives who are committed to passing meaningful legislation for the sake of the country's future. The former senator encourages voters to research candidates' records and positions to ensure they align with the voter's values and the country's needs. "The American people need to demand more from their leaders," Clinton stated. She warned against disengagement from politics and urged Americans to stay informed and active in the political process. Clinton's critique of Congress highlights a fundamental issue in American politics: the importance of bipartisanship and unity. In these times of political polarization, it is essential to remember that politicians represent all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs. Elected officials must prioritize the welfare of the country over their party agendas. In conclusion, Hillary Clinton's comments on Congress' resolve to legislate are a reminder that the American people deserve better from their elected representatives. Collaboration, bipartisanship, and commitment to the country's needs must take precedence over partisan politics. As the 2022 midterm elections approach, Clinton's message to voters is clear: choose leaders who prioritize progress over partisanship.
