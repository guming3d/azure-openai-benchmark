article: (CNN) -- Most outrageous fish tales begin with an arching arm gesture and "a fish this big" -- but this one starts with "fish that traveled this far." Just over two years after the Japan earthquake and tsunami, researchers made a startling discovery in a 20-foot-long Japanese fishing vessel that washed ashore last month near Long Beach, Washington: five tropical fish, alive and well. They are called striped beakfish, and they are native to warmer waters near Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. The five stowaways, roughly the size of your palm, lived in a cozy spot at the back of the boat. A 20- to 30-gallon containment hold in the boat's stern lost its cover, and that part of the boat was submerged as the vessel drifted in the ocean, said Allen Pleus, a scientist with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. That "created like a cave they could go in and out of," Pleus said. Japanese tsunami debris makes its way into Hawaiian birds . Pleus said most debris out in the ocean attracts fish, so it's not surprising these fish found a home in the debris. But it is surprising they survived the nearly 5,000-mile journey. "It's very rare that you'd see something like this," Pleus said. "Obviously, fish are very robust and we are learning this on all of the species that come across." When researchers first explored the boat, they saw just one of the fish in the holding tank. They collected it in a bucket and took it to Long Beach City Hall. Someone at City Hall called the Seaside Aquarium in Seaside, Oregon, to come and get it. Fish and Wildlife personnel found three more in the tank's murky water. Finally the boat was towed to a state yard, where the fifth fish came swimming up to Pleus. The one that went to the aquarium will live out its life there. General Manager Keith Chandler says it'll go on display Saturday. "He is a pretty cool fish, and I just wonder if there are more out there," he said. The other four had the honor of contributing to research at Oregon State University, where researchers will dissect them learn their ages and what they've been eating. Sea anemones, scallops, crabs, worms and sea cucumbers that hitched a ride on the same boat also will be studied. Massive dock washes ashore on national park beach .

chatgpt: Five Japanese beakfish have survived a grueling journey of 5,000 miles to arrive in the United States. The five fish were contained in the fishing boat's stern, where they were able to live and thrive during the long and arduous journey.  These five fish are a rare find and are therefore highly sought after by researchers and aquariums across the country. The journey from Japan to the United States is usually too taxing for these fish, and it is not often that they arrive in good condition. Thankfully, these five were not only healthy, but they also managed to survive the journey in excellent condition.  One of the five fish is going to be raised and placed on display at one of the country's most popular aquariums. The aquarium's staff is excited to welcome this rare and unique specimen and will do everything they can to ensure that it acclimates well to its new home. Unfortunately, the other four fish will be dissected. This practice is common among researchers who want to better understand the biology and behavior of these rare fish. While it may seem cruel to some, the information that is gleaned from these dissections can be used to help protect these creatures and improve their overall welfare.  The beakfish is a strange and unusual creature, with its distinctive beak-like mouth and long, tubular body. It is a type of ribbonfish that is found in the Pacific Ocean, and is usually encountered in deep waters. Despite their rarity, beakfish are an important part of the marine ecosystem, and researchers are working hard to understand more about these fascinating creatures. The arrival of these five fish in the United States is a significant event in the world of marine biology. It is rare for them to survive the journey and arrive in good condition, especially given the long distance that they had to travel. The fact that they did so is a testament to the resilience of these animals, and also speaks to the skill and expertise of the crew that transported them across the ocean. Overall, the arrival of these five beakfish is a positive development for the scientific community and aquariums around the country. While some will be sacrificed in the name of research, others will go on to live in captivity and be studied for years to come. With luck, the information that is gathered from these fish will help us to better understand this fascinating species, and ultimately help us to better protect them and their fragile ecosystem.
