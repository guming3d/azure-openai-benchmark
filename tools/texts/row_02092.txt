article: The Co-operative said sales of its own-brand prosecco were up 60 per cent in week before Christmas and expects to sell three a second today . Sales of prosecco have soared ahead of New Year's Eve celebrations, with one retailer expecting to sell three bottles every second. The Co-operative said  sales of its own brand prosecco were up 60 per cent in the week before Christmas and it anticipated selling three bottles every second that it is open today - up from two bottles a second on Christmas Eve. It saw bottles of prosecco outsell milk, the usual best-seller, in the lead-up to Christmas. The Co-operative Food customer director, Andrew Mann, said: 'As a leading convenience retailer we've seen a shift in consumer habits and prosecco has fast become the nation's favourite drink with which to mark an occasion or celebrate. 'Over the last few days it has even outsold milk.' Marks & Spencer said sales of prosecco were up 45 per cent on this time last year and it had sold 1.6 million bottles over the last 12 months, up from 1.1 million last year. M&S wine buyer Dror Nativ said: 'The ongoing prosecco boom has of course been fuelled by the affordability and approachability of this wine, but what is most interesting is the new trend for enjoying prosecco as an everyday drink rather than solely on celebratory occasions. 'Our customers are enjoying prosecco midweek, at dinner parties with friends or simply as a treat, and sales show no sign of slowing down.' Tesco has announced that its prosecco sales are up 50 per cent this year and Waitrose has reported an annual increase of 58 per cent. Earlier this month wine merchant Laithwaite's predicted prosecco would comfortably outsell Champagne again this Christmas. Laithwaite's UK managing director David Thatcher said: 'We have a good picture of the nation's habits and prosecco is already outselling Champagne this year.' Waitrose said prosecco continued to be the 'fizz of choice' to bring in the New Year, outselling champagne by 1.7 bottles to one. Waitrose head of wine, beer and spirits-buying Pierpaolo Petrassi said: 'We know that our customers' love for prosecco shows no sign of abating.'

chatgpt: Co-operative, the UK grocery and retail giant, has revealed that it is expecting to sell three bottles of prosecco every second on Christmas Day. This staggering figure is a testament to the increasing popularity of one of the nation's favourite drinks, as well as the growing trend of indulging in a glass of bubbly during the festive period.  In the week leading up to Christmas, sales of Co-operative's own-brand prosecco increased by an impressive 60%, with customers keen to stock up ahead of the big day. This surge in demand has meant that Co-operative has had to increase production to ensure that there is enough stock to meet the needs of its customers.  Co-operative is not the only retailer who has seen a significant increase in sales of prosecco. Marks & Spencer, another popular UK retailer, revealed that it had sold 1.6 million bottles of prosecco in the last 12 months alone, highlighting the continued popularity of the drink.  In fact, prosecco has become so popular that it has even outsold milk, which is usually the best-selling beverage in UK supermarkets. This shift in consumer preferences is a reflection of the changing tastes and habits of the general public, who are increasingly turning to more indulgent treats, even during the festive period.  The rise of prosecco can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, prosecco is seen as more affordable than traditional champagne, making it more accessible to a wider audience. Secondly, it has a sweeter taste than other sparkling wines, making it more palatable to those who prefer sweeter drinks. Lastly, over the past few years, prosecco has been popularised through various events and occasions, such as brunches and hen parties, which has contributed to its overall appeal.  Despite the popularity of prosecco, Co-operative has also seen a rise in sales of other festive beverages, such as mulled wine and gin. This suggests that customers are keen to try out new drinks and are becoming more adventurous in their choices.  Co-operative has also made efforts to cater to customers who choose not to drink alcohol or who are designated drivers during the festive period. The retailer has introduced a range of non-alcoholic beverages, including fizz and beers, to cater to this growing market.  Overall, it is clear that prosecco has become a staple of the festive period in the UK. With Co-operative expecting to sell three bottles every second on Christmas Day and other retailers reporting similar figures, it is clear that the trend shows no signs of slowing down.
