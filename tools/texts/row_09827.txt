chatgpt: A new product has hit the shelves at Boots that is set to revolutionize haircare. Free From Frizz 6 week Blow Out is the UK's first home-based keratin treatment that claims to eliminate frizzy hair for more than 40 days. Developed over the course of five years, the product allows users to 'paint on' the formula. According to Free From Frizz, five million women in the UK suffer from frizzy hair, which can be caused by humidity, rain or just natural hair texture. This new product is set to provide a solution to this issue, allowing women to enjoy frizz-free hairstyles for over a month. The product contains keratin, a natural protein that is already present in hair, as well as other ingredients that work to smooth and condition the hair. The formula is easy to apply and can be done at home, which makes it convenient and cost-effective. At £14.99, it is significantly cheaper than professional salon treatments which can cost up to hundreds of pounds. The keratin treatment works to smooth the hair cuticle and form a protective layer around each hair strand. This highly effective treatment is said to work for over 40 days, and some users report that their hair stayed frizz-free for up to two months. For best results, users are advised to use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to maintain the effects. The product is suitable for all hair types and colors, although it is not recommended for use on very damaged or bleached hair. Many women across the UK have already tried and tested Free From Frizz 6 week Blow Out and are ecstatic with the results. 32-year-old marketing executive, Sarah Wilson, shared her experience with the product: "I've always had frizzy hair, and it's been a constant battle to keep it under control, especially in the summer months. But since I started using this product, I've noticed a huge difference. My hair is much smoother and shinier, and I don't need to spend as much time styling it every morning. I would highly recommend it to anyone who struggles with frizz." The product is already generating a lot of buzz on social media, with many users raving about its effectiveness. Beauty bloggers and influencers have been sharing their experiences with the product, creating a wave of excitement and anticipation among beauty enthusiasts across the country. The launch of Free From Frizz 6 week Blow Out marks a new era in haircare, allowing women to achieve professional-looking results in the comfort of their own homes. It is a game-changer for many who have struggled with frizz for years and are now able to enjoy sleek, smooth locks with minimal effort.
