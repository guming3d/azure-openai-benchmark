article: (CNN)Kurt Busch, NASCAR's 2004 Cup champion, lost both appeals of his indefinite suspension and will miss Sunday's season-opening Daytona 500, the auto racing circuit said late Saturday. Busch twice challenged NASCAR's decision Friday to ban him after a Delaware civil court found he likely committed domestic violence against  former girlfriend Patricia Driscoll. An initial appeal was denied by a three-member panel. A second request for reinstatement was heard Saturday by NASCAR's final appeals officer and  also denied. NASCAR has not announced what Busch will have to do to be reinstated. Busch's attorney said after the first appeal was denied that his client will challenge the court's decision. "We will continue to exhaust every procedural and legal remedy we have available to us until Kurt Busch is vindicated.  Along the way, we intend to continue to call attention to the facts and witnesses that will shed light on Ms. Driscoll's true character, motivations and history," Rusty Hardin said. The suspension was announced Friday after the family court's decision. Hardin said then that the court's decision "will turn out to be a travesty of justice." NASCAR Executive Vice President Steve O'Donnell told reporters Friday: "NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership ... that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated." Busch was accused by Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times while they were in Busch's motor home at Dover International Speedway in October. The commissioner in the civil case found her story to be true, ESPN reported. Hardin has said Driscoll lied during her testimony and she had tried to intimidate witnesses. Busch has not been charged with a crime. In 2004, Busch captured the Cup series title, winning the first postseason 10-race tournament in NASCAR's top division. He has also won titles in the second-level series (now known as the Xfinity Series) and the truck series. His Cup team, Stewart-Haas Racing, said Regan Smith would replace him in the No. 41 car on Sunday. Busch's brother, Kyle, also will not race Sunday, and perhaps for months. He was injured Saturday in a hard crash during an Xfinity Series race. CNN's Quand Thomas contributed to this report.

chatgpt: NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has been denied his second appeal by a NASCAR official on Saturday night. The suspension remains indefinite, and NASCAR has been tight-lipped about what Busch needs to do for a reinstatement. Sources suggest that the 2004 Cup Series champion needs to take anger-management courses and complete an evaluation before being able to return to the track. Busch was suspended indefinitely before the Daytona 500 after a civil court in Delaware ruled that he had likely assaulted his former girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, in September 2014. She accused Busch of slamming her head against the wall of his motorhome three times during her visit. The suspensions came as a surprise to some who thought Busch's actions would go largely unpunished. However, NASCAR has recently implemented a new set of rules that aim to hold drivers accountable for their actions off the track. Under the new regulations, drivers are held to a higher standard of conduct, both on and off the track. They are required to comport themselves as ambassadors for the sport, which means that they must be held responsible if their actions bring the sport into a negative light. Busch was suspended for violating Section 12.1.a of the NASCAR rulebook, which states that "NASCAR reserves the right to discipline members for actions detrimental to stock car racing." The suspension is not expected to be lifted until Busch completes the necessary steps mandated by NASCAR. The suspension has sparked heated debates online, with fans and experts divided over NASCAR's decision. Some argue that NASCAR is right to hold drivers accountable for their off-track actions, while others feel that the suspension is too harsh and that Busch has already served his time. Despite the controversy, Busch's suspension remains in place. The driver will now have to decide whether to comply with NASCAR's rules or challenge the organization's decision in court. Either way, Busch's reputation has taken a significant hit, and his future in the sport remains uncertain.
