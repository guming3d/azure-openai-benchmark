Prior to the match, the 27-year-old had been out for almost three months due to finger and shoulder injuries.

chatgpt: In a stunning display of batting prowess, Rohit Sharma destroyed the Sri Lankan bowling attack to score an amazing 264 runs in their recent ODI clash. Sharma's astonishing performance helped India post an unbelievable 404 runs on the board, a record high for any one-day team. The knock was even more impressive considering the fact that Sharma had not played a single match in almost three months. The Mumbai batsman had been out of action with various injuries, and this was his first game back in the Indian lineup. But Sharma looked in fine fettle right from the outset, taking on the Sri Lankan bowlers with some clean hitting. He was particularly severe on left-arm spinner Chaturanga de Silva, smashing him for sixes at will. Sharma's innings included 33 fours and nine sixes, and he batted for more than four hours before his wicket finally fell. But the Indian opener was not done yet, claiming after the match that he could have batted for another 50 overs if needed. Sharma's performance was all the more remarkable as he became the first player in history to score two career double centuries in a 50-over match. His previous record-breaking knock of 209 against Australia in 2013 was the previous highest score in the format. Indian captain Virat Kohli was full of praise for his teammate, calling Sharma's innings "unbelievable" and "excellent". He added, "He's got the ability to demolish attacks and today he showed why he's such a special player - one of the best in the world." The Sri Lankan bowlers were left shell-shocked by the onslaught, with de Silva bearing the brunt of Sharma's fury. The spinner conceded 106 runs in his 10 overs, the worst ever figures in a one-day international. Despite Sharma's heroics, Sri Lanka did manage to put up some resistance with the bat, thanks to a fighting century from Angelo Mathews. But they fell well short of their target, finishing on 251 for eight in their 50 overs. India now lead the five-match series 4-0, with one more game left to play. But as far as Sharma is concerned, he has already done enough to secure his place in the side for the foreseeable future. This was a truly special innings from one of the game's most talented batsmen, and it will be remembered for a long time to come.
