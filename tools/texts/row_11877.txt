article: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani government has reversed a recent hike in fuel prices, an effort that could help shore up the country's crumbling governing coalition. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced the move on Thursday in the National Assembly. It comes days after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement quit the government over fuel price increases and other complaints -- a move that cost Gilani's Pakistan People's Party its majority in the assembly. Gilani called for the establishment of a team that would devise a strategy to combat fluctuation in world petroleum prices and avoid harsh measures, such as the fuel price increase. The government crisis comes at a turbulent time. The U.S. military has been counting on the government to do a robust job of taking on militants in the Pakistani tribal region, but the loss of support is putting Gilani's government on shaky ground. The MQM is one of the largest and most liberal parties in Pakistan, with its stronghold in the southern city of Karachi. Its exit follows December's withdrawal of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal ur Rehman, a leading religious party. Muhammad Anwar, a senior coordinator for the MQM, told CNN that the last straw for the party was the fuel price increases that took effect Saturday. Pakistan's government had raised gasoline prices by 9.2% and increased kerosene prices by nearly 6%, blaming higher crude oil costs for the move. Anwar also said the government had failed to crack down on "rampant" corruption and maintain law and order -- particularly in Karachi and the surrounding southern province of Sindh. Businessmen in Karachi "are virtually hostage" to extortion and kidnapping rings, he said. MQM leader Faisal Sabzwari said Sunday that the PPP-led government also has imposed unfair taxes on the poor and allowed an energy crisis to fester. The Pakistan Muslim League, another political party, said Wednesday said it will not support the government in its quest to regain a majority. Gilani said recently the ruling PPP would be able to function without a majority in the National Assembly.

chatgpt: In a political turn of events, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) quit the ruling coalition over fuel price hikes and other issues. The move by MQM cost the prime minister's party its majority in the assembly as another party had withdrawn in December. The MQM, which represents middle-class citizens of Karachi, decided to take a stand against the governing coalition due to the uncontrolled fuel price hikes that were hitting the nation's economy hard. Additionally, the party's officials have accused the government of overlooking Karachi's infrastructure problems. The move has created a challenging situation for the ruling party in Pakistan, which is already under pressure from opposition parties on several fronts. However, the Prime Minister has suggested that he is not daunted by the situation and is determined to find a way forward. The PM has already announced plans to develop a strategy to combat price fluctuation, which would benefit the country's growing industry in the long run. He has also assured the public that the government is taking all possible measures to control the price of essential commodities. In December, another party withdrew from the ruling coalition over similar grievances. The government promised to review its policies but was met with criticism over its failure to keep its word. The current crisis in the government is not only affecting the political process but also causing concern for Pakistan's economy. The fluctuating fuel prices have a direct impact on the cost of goods and services, hitting the public the hardest. With the MQM's departure, the ruling coalition will have to work hard to rebuild its majority in the assembly or look for alternative political allies. The situation demands immediate attention, given the country's ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and the delicate economic condition. The Prime Minister has affirmed his commitment to resolving the issue, promising to find a solution to the grievances of the parties that have left the coalition. However, he also emphasized that his government has a clear mandate to govern and will do everything possible to ensure that it is maintained, even in the face of opposition from parties losing faith in the coalition. The situation remains uncertain as the government tries to come to terms with the loss of support from the MQM. It remains to be seen what impact this crisis will have on Pakistan's political, economic, and social landscape. The fate of the government and the country's stability, both hinge on critical decisions that need to be made in the coming days.
