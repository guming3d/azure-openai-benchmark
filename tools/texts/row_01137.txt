article: By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . The many roles that teachers are expected to fill beyond the bounds of educator seem to be increasing every year. Now there is greater pressure than ever for them to take on the role of a doctor too, as the number of children who need regular medication during school hours continues to rise. However the perils of this were proven earlier in the week when a young boy was given another student's medication by accident, the Herald Sun report. Teachers are now taking on more responsibility than ever and at many schools are administering their students' medication . A six-year-old boy called Mitchell who needed ritalin - which is used to treat attention deficit disorder - was apparently given another child's medication by accident. The child's teacher apparently figured out what had happened very quickly, but he had already swallowed the wrong tablet. Mitchell's dad Gus Reynolds told the publication he understands that accidents occur but he was not happy with the way the his son's school - Iramoo Primary School in Melbourne's west - handled the situation. This week a young boy was given the wrong medication at school when it was mixed up with another child's . 'As humans we can make mistakes, but it was the way it was handled', Mr Reynolds said. The teachers apparently did not keep an eye on the boy to check for any potential side effects. However Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace pointed out that the demands on teachers are increasing and the responsibility they have is much greater than a decade ago. Ms Peace also said as some children need various doses of some medications at various times throughout the day - this can be very difficult to keep track of. Some students require medication more than once a day and this places pressure on teachers . The issue is a complex one and in some cases teachers are taking on the role of doctors, when they are not necessarily trained to do so. The increase in children taking medication is said to be due to a rise in the number of kids with either allergies or behavioral issues which require medication as part of their treatment. Iramoo Primary School's principal said the mix-up occurred because one of the medication wasn't labelled properly and therefore got combined with another student's. The school is now apparently looking at a new system which could see children's pictures attached to their medication to avoid any further issues.

chatgpt: A young Melbourne boy was given the wrong medication this week, igniting concerns about the role of teachers in administering medication. Teachers at the Melbourne primary school mixed up the boy's medication due to incorrect labeling, representing the growing challenge educators face in managing the increasing medical needs of students. The situation arose when the boy's parents provided medication to the school to treat his medical condition, with instructions for the school staff to administer it during the day. However, the medication was incorrectly labeled, and as a result, the child received the wrong medication from the school nurse. The incident has highlighted the dilemma faced by schools as they strive to meet the growing medical needs of students. As student health issues become more complex, teachers are taking on greater responsibilities for managing the medical needs of their students. But for a profession that isn't trained medically, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find the right balance between safety and accessibility. The principal of the Melbourne primary school acknowledged that this incident was unacceptable and that they would be conducting a thorough investigation. The school has since implemented new control measures to ensure that such situations do not arise in the future. This is hardly a unique occurrence. Similar incidents have arisen in schools across the country, with teachers administering medication to students without full medical training. For instance, they may misread the labels, misunderstand the dosages, or lack proper instructions on how to administer medication. Education unions have voiced concerns about the safety of teachers administering medication. While some teachers are trained in first aid, it's still crucial that they receive adequate training and support to deal with the increasing medical needs of their students. "It's just not realistic to expect teachers to understand every single medical condition and medication they come across in their classrooms," says the Australian Education Union Victoria branch’s President, Meredith Peace. "The government needs to recognize that schools need better support in managing students' complex health issues. Teachers should not be expected to cross the line into the medical profession." The pressures on teachers to manage student health issues are mounting, with an increasing number of students requiring medical assistance at school. Some of these students may need help with administering medication, such as insulin, to manage their health conditions. But managing medication in school is not straightforward. It requires careful coordination between parents, healthcare professionals, and school staff to ensure that students are receiving the correct medication, in the right dose, at the right time. This requires ongoing communication and a strong culture of safety. The Victorian Department of Education and Training has highlighted the importance of schools having clear policies and procedures in place for managing medication. This includes the need for medication to be stored correctly, administered by trained staff, and the documentation of any adverse reactions. In conclusion, the incident at the Melbourne primary school highlights the need for greater support for teachers in dealing with the increasing medical needs of students. While teachers have always played a vital role in supporting students' well-being, expectations must be tempered with appropriate training and support to ensure student safety.
