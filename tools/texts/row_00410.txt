article: If your daily commute ever seems like a drag, console yourself with the thought that it is making you younger. According to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, time slows down as we speed up – meaning Tube travellers, for example, age less quickly. The downside is that the effects are tiny – a typical commute turns back time by just a few millionths of a millionth of a second. Getting younger on the move: Tube travellers age less quickly, but the effects are tiny – a typical commute turns back time by just a few millionths of a millionth of a second . Even a Tube driver would not earn back a whole second by the end of their career. Physicist Shane Bergin, of Trinity College Dublin, said: ‘Time isn’t constant. The faster you travel, the slower the second hand ticks for you. Imagine twins. Both of them are given very accurate clocks. One twin is sent on a train that travels at incredible speeds. 'Time isn't constant': Professor Shane Bergin was speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science's conference in San Jose . 'The other remains at home, moving about at a speed far slower than the first twin. When the twin who travelled by train returns home, both twins compare the time on their clocks. Less time will have passed for the twin who took the train, relative to the twin who stayed at home.’ Professor Bergin told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s conference in San Jose, California, yesterday that such insights would help ordinary people appreciate the beauty of physics. And he pointed out that Tube travellers may not realise that they become lighter when taking the lift up from platform level. ‘You have weight because gravity is pulling you down,’ said the professor. ‘So when you are in a lift and you are being accelerated upwards, you are lighter because you are working against gravity.’ Another of Professor Bergin’s 12 insights was that Tube escalators are made of stardust – because almost everything on Earth is made up of elements formed billions of years ago at the heart of a star. Spewed out into space when the star died, they eventually pulled together to make planets, people - and escalator materials. Professor Bergin has launched the Dart of Physics project to try to popularise the subject.

chatgpt: A new study has found that even the shortest of commutes can impact the passage of time. According to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, time elapses more slowly the faster an object moves. However, it has been discovered that for commuters, their daily journey actually turns back time by a minute fraction of a second. This backward ticking of the clock has been measured to be millionths of a millionth of a second – a minuscule amount that is imperceptible to human experience. Even so, it is fascinating to note that one could technically earn back a second of life by taking an intergalactic voyage. Unfortunately, for the average commuter, that is simply not feasible. For instance, a typical Tube driver might see a reversal of time by just a tiny fraction in their entire career. However, this finding has significant implications on our understanding of time, and how it is experienced in everyday life. Researchers involved in the study suggest that the reason for this time-warping effect lies in the everyday experience of acceleration and deceleration. When we embark on a train or in a car, we experience a brief burst of acceleration, before slowing down as we reach our destination. This process, though short-lived, creates a subtle effect on the passage of time. It makes sense that individuals who experience such fluctuations would actually be able to see the world around them freeze for a fractional moment in time. The implications of these findings are intriguing, especially as physicists continue to probe the limits of our understanding of the universe. As we continue to develop a more in-depth understanding of the cosmos on a quantum level, it is entirely possible that these findings will lead to further revelations about how the universe operates. These discoveries have the potential to unlock some of the most profound mysteries of the universe, including the true nature of time, the origins of space and time, and the possibility of time travel. While we may never be able to voyage across the cosmos, this study shows us that we can continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge and explore the secrets of our universe.
