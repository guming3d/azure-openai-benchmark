chatgpt: Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, the French defender, had a tough time after joining Newcastle United in 2013 for a fee of £6.7m. The defender had a big reputation in the French league and was expected to be a game-changer for the Magpies. However, he failed to impress the fans or his manager, Alan Pardew, and was eventually sold to AS Roma in 2014. Since his move to Roma, Yanga-Mbiwa has rejuvenated his career and has been playing exceptionally well for the Giallorossi. He is now a prominent figure in the Roma defence and has helped the club during their quest for the Serie A title this season. His aerial ability and defensive prowess have earned him plaudits from both his teammates and Roma fans. Despite their on-field success, Roma has been playing without a shirt sponsor this season, which is a rarity for a club of their stature. The issue arose when their previous shirt sponsor, Qatar Airways, was deemed illegal by Italian authorities due to ownership issues. Roma was quick to resolve the matter and found a new sponsor in Telethon, an Italian charity organization, but their kits were already printed without a sponsor's logo. In addition to Yanga-Mbiwa's stellar performances, Roma also has a few records to boast of in the Champions League this season. The club's talisman and captain, Francesco Totti, became the oldest scorer in the history of the competition when he scored against CSKA Moscow earlier this season. Totti's goal helped Roma secure a crucial win and kept their hopes of reaching the knockout stages alive. Another record that Roma holds is that of having the most appearances in the Champions League by an English player who has never played for an English club. Ashley Cole, the former Chelsea left-back, has made over 100 appearances in the competition and has been an influential figure for Roma this season. The veteran defender has been a key player for coach Rudi Garcia and has provided stability and leadership at the back. In conclusion, Yanga-Mbiwa's resurgence in Italy has been a pleasant surprise, especially for those who watched him struggle at Newcastle. His performances this season have been exceptional, and he has been a vital cog in the Roma defence. Furthermore, Roma's decisions to play without a shirt sponsor have been applauded by many, and their performance in the Champions League this season has been impressive, thanks to players like Totti and Cole.
