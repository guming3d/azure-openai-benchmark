article: (CNN) -- Health authorities indicated Friday there have been 361 cases of mumps in central Ohio, a significantly higher number than was reported just a few weeks ago. Most of these cases -- 208, to be specific -- have been linked to Ohio State University in Columbus, the city's health department said. The 361 total includes cases from Franklin, Delaware and Madison counties and was current as of 2:30 p.m. Friday. Some 139 of those diagnosed were students at Ohio State, while a number of others worked at or otherwise had a connection to the university. As recently as March 21, the same agency was reporting 63 mumps cases, of which 45 were tied to the university. The outbreak originated in February with a cluster of cases at Ohio State.

Melanie Amato, an Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman, attributes the spike to many students heading home, where they could end up spreading mumps or at least be seen and diagnosed by doctors. "We don't expect the numbers to go down soon," Amato said. Eleven people have been treated at area hospitals for mumps, according to Columbus Public Health. But none were still in hospitals as of Friday, and no deaths have been linked to the disease, Amato said. Those affected range in age between 4 months and 80 years old, with about 60% being female. The Ohio Department of Health reports the first symptoms tied to this outbreak arose on January 7. Jose Rodriguez, a Columbus health department spokesman, has said that the earliest OSU case was on February 11. CNN Health Library: Learn more about mumps . There is a vaccine available for mumps, but it's only 88% effective, Amato points out. She explains: "A lot of these people who got mumps were vaccinated." Mumps typically begins with a fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite, which is followed by the swelling of salivary glands, according to the CDC. It is "a highly infectious disease" that spreads the same way as a cold or flu does -- through respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. There is no specific treatment for mumps, and patients usually recover after a week or two, but occasionally the disease can cause serious complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, deafness or inflammation of the breasts or ovaries in girls who have reached puberty, the CDC said. Five days of isolation is required, "and that can be complicated in a university setting," according to Rodriguez. Even more frightening -- one-third of cases have no symptoms, he said. Mumps isn't the only infectious disease outbreak that Ohio is dealing with. Earlier this week, authorities reported 68 people had come down with measles in the state, part of what is already an 18-year high of measles cases in the United States. 2013: East Coast mumps outbreak linked to nightclub .

chatgpt: In central Ohio, the Columbus health department has reported a staggering 361 cases of mumps. This news follows the agency's report of 63 cases just a few weeks ago. Despite many of those infected being vaccinated, state officials are warning that this is a serious health concern. "A lot of these people who got mumps were vaccinated," said one state official. This raises concerns about the efficacy of the vaccine and whether it is truly protecting individuals from contracting the virus. Of the 361 reported cases, 11 of those infected were treated in hospitals. However, it is worth noting that none are currently receiving treatment in hospitals at this time. While this is good news, the high numbers of reported cases are alarming and should not be taken lightly. Mumps is a viral illness that is highly contagious and is spread through respiratory secretions. Symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, and swollen salivary glands. While most people fully recover from mumps, some may experience complications such as hearing loss, meningitis, and encephalitis. The vaccine for mumps is typically given as part of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the MMR vaccine is highly effective at preventing mumps, with a two-dose series being 88% effective at preventing the disease. While the numbers of reported cases in Ohio may lead some to question the effectiveness of the vaccine, it is important to remember that the vaccine is not perfect. Additionally, the fact that vaccinated individuals are still contracting the virus does not necessarily mean that the vaccine is ineffective. Rather, it is a reminder of the importance of continued vaccination efforts and improved public health education efforts to ensure that individuals are aware of the risks associated with contracting and spreading the virus. In light of the current outbreak, the Columbus health department is urging individuals to take precautions to prevent the spread of mumps. This includes practicing good hand hygiene, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing, and staying home if you are sick. Additionally, if you are experiencing symptoms of mumps, seek medical attention right away. This will not only help ensure that you receive proper treatment, but it will also help prevent the spread of the virus to others. As the number of reported cases of mumps in Ohio continues to rise, it is important for individuals to take this outbreak seriously and take the necessary steps to protect themselves and those around them. With continued vaccination efforts, improved public health education, and individual precautionary measures, we can help prevent the spread of mumps and keep our communities safe and healthy.
