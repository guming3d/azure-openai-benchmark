chatgpt: Zara Phillips may be well-known for her prowess in three-day eventing, but the Queen's granddaughter has also proven herself to be a skilled horse trainer on the point-to-point circuit. Phillips has trained seven winners on this challenging and competitive circuit, demonstrating her versatility as an equestrian. Now, Phillips is set to showcase her training skills once again as Act Of Kalanisi, her first under rules runner since 2008, takes to the track at Bangor on Friday. The six-year-old bay gelding is trained by Phillips and owned by Terezia Koczka, and is expected to be a serious contender in the 2m7f handicap hurdle at the Welsh track. Despite her extensive experience in the equestrian world, Phillips is staying humble about her chances of success. She admits that training a winning racehorse is never easy, and that every race comes with its own set of challenges. "I'm excited to see what Act Of Kalanisi can do, but I'm also realistic about the competition we'll be facing," Phillips comments. "There are some strong horses running in this race, and the track at Bangor is notoriously tricky. But I have faith in my horse, and in the team we've assembled to support him." One key member of that team is amateur jockey Tom David, who will be taking the ride on Act Of Kalanisi on Friday. David is no stranger to success on the point-to-point circuit, having ridden over 100 winners in his career so far. He is thrilled for the opportunity to ride Phillips' promising young horse in a competitive race setting. "This is a big moment for both Zara and myself," David says. "We've worked hard to get to this point, and we're determined to put in a good showing at Bangor. Act Of Kalanisi is a talented young horse, and I'm excited to see how he handles the pressure of racing under rules." For Phillips, the chance to see one of her horses compete at a higher level is a thrill in itself. While she remains committed to her career in three-day eventing, she is excited by the challenge of taking on the point-to-point and racing circuits as a trainer. "I love working with horses, and I love the variety that equestrian sports offer," Phillips says. "Whether I'm competing in a three-day event or training a racehorse, I'm always learning something new and pushing myself to be better. I'm grateful for the opportunity to showcase another side of my equestrian skills, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for Act Of Kalanisi and the rest of my horses."
