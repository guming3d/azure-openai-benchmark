chatgpt: Manchester United managed to secure a 3-1 home victory over Newcastle on Boxing Day. Despite being without the services of Marcos Rojo, the Red Devils managed to pull off a fine performance and earn a well-deserved win. Rojo, an Argentine international, missed the match due to a thigh injury. Instead of watching the game from the stands, he decided to spend some quality time with his near and dear ones. The defender, along with his close friends and family, headed to a local bowling alley and enjoyed a fun-filled evening. Although Rojo was undoubtedly missed on the pitch, Ole Gunnar Solskjær's men managed to cope without him. The United boss adopted a cautious approach with his team selection, opting to go with a back four of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, and Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The move paid dividends as the defense looked rock solid and hardly allowed any clear-cut chances to the Magpies. The midfield trio of Nemanja Matic, Scott McTominay, and Juan Mata looked comfortable in possession and controlled the tempo of the game. United took the lead through Anthony Martial, who scored his eighth goal of the season after pouncing on a rebound. Mason Greenwood then doubled the lead before Marcus Rashford made it 3-0 with a stunning individual effort. Newcastle did manage to pull one back through Matty Longstaff, but it proved to be nothing more than a consolation goal. Solskjær seemed pleased with his team's performance, saying, "It was a good result and a well-deserved win. The players executed the game plan perfectly, and we looked comfortable throughout the match." Overall, it was an impressive performance from Manchester United, especially considering their recent struggles. The victory will give them a much-needed boost heading into the busy festive schedule. As for Rojo, he may have missed out on the action, but he certainly made the most of his evening off.
