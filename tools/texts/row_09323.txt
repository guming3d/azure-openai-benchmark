article: (CNN) -- Stolen medical files that may be those of Michael Schumacher are being offered for sale, the injured former F1 racing driver's manager said. Schumacher has been undergoing hospital treatment since a skiing accident last year but is now out of a coma. Manager Sabine Kehm said the documents had been offered for sale for several days. She added, "We cannot judge if these documents are authentic. However, the documents are clearly stolen. The theft has been reported. The authorities are involved." Medical files are confidential, and it is forbidden to buy or publish such data, Kehm said. "We will therefore, in every single case, press for criminal charges and damages against any publication of the content or reference to the medical file," she said. Schumacher, 45, suffered severe head trauma in a December 29 skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel. The champion driver, from Germany, was transferred last week to Switzerland for rehabilitation from a hospital in Grenoble, France, where he was kept in a medically induced coma for more than three months. The Grenoble hospital's media office said in a statement that Kehm "told us that a person intended to sell to the press a document allegedly issued from the medical records of Michael Schumacher." "Without knowing the precise nature of the document, the Grenoble Hospital decided to sue for 'theft and breach of medical confidentiality' so that an investigation can be initiated." A spokesman for the German newspaper Bild, Tobias Frolich, told CNN that the tabloid was among a number of media outlets to be offered Schumacher's alleged medical records, but that "the editorial office decided to reject the offer." A French prosecutor investigating the accident concluded that speed was not behind the fall suffered by the seven-time world champion, whose F1 career ended in 2012. CNN's Stephanie Halasz, Diana Magnay and Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Former Formula One racing driver Michael Schumacher was transferred to a Swiss hospital for rehabilitation after a skiing accident in 2013 left him with severe brain damage. Schumacher's medical condition has been closely guarded since the incident, but new reports reveal that his medical records were stolen and are now being offered for sale as those of the driver. According to German tabloid Bild, it was approached with an offer for Schumacher's medical records but rejected it. The French hospital where Schumacher was initially treated has decided to sue the individuals responsible for the theft for "theft and breach of medical confidentiality." Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm, confirmed the theft of the medical files and released a statement saying, "For several days stolen documents and data are being offered for sale. The offerer claims them to be the medical file of Michael Schumacher. We cannot judge if these documents are authentic. However, the documents are clearly stolen. The theft has been reported. The authorities are involved." Kehm added that the stolen files contained "confidential and private data" and urged everyone not to purchase them to protect Schumacher's privacy. The incident has sparked outrage in the racing community and beyond, with many questioning the ethics of stealing and selling private medical documents. Schumacher, who is widely considered one of the greatest drivers in Formula One history, has been out of the public eye since his accident, and the news of this theft has only added to his family's stress and anxiety. Despite the challenges he's faced, Schumacher's family remains hopeful that he will recover. In a statement released earlier this year, they said, "You can be sure that he is in the very best of hands, and that we are doing everything humanly possible to help him. Please understand if we are following Michael's wishes and keeping such a sensitive subject as health, as it has always been, in privacy."
