article: (CNN) -- One stands as tall as a red British phone booth. The other is the height of six stacked cans of baked beans. On Thursday, for the first time, the man with the tallest recorded height in the world and the shortest man in the world met at an event in London, where they posed for photos and stretched for an awkward handshake. The occasion was the 10th annual Guinness World Records Day, which celebrates record-setting achievements around the globe. The Guinness folks flew the two men, Sultan Kosen of Turkey and Chandra Bahadur Dangi of Nepal, to London for the unique photo op. Kosen, 31, is a part-time farmer who measures 8 feet, 3 inches tall and can reach a basketball hoop without jumping. He became the world's tallest living man in 2009, overtaking China's Xi Shun, who stood a mere 7 feet 9 inches. Dangi, 74, is just 21½ inches tall and is the shortest adult human ever verified by Guinness World Records. A weaver who also helps look after buffaloes and cows in his remote mountain village of Reemkholi, he weighs just 32 pounds. "To be able to finally meet Chandra after all this time is amazing," Kosen said at the event. "Even though he is short and I am tall, we have had similar struggles throughout our lives, and when I look into Chandra's eyes, I can see he's a good man." Kosen also holds the record for largest hands on a living person. His measure 11.2 inches from the wrist to the tip of his middle finger. Thousands of people took part in Guinness World Records events around the world Thursday, with records tumbling in Australia, France, Dubai, China, Germany, Japan, the UK and the United States. In Shanghai, 388 people went for a record for the largest communal breakfast in bed.

chatgpt: In a historic meeting, the tallest recorded man in the world, Sultan Kosen, met the shortest man, Chandra Bahadur Dangi, for the first time. Kosen, a 31-year-old farmer from Turkey, measures a staggering 8 feet and 3 inches tall, while Dangi, a 74-year-old weaver from Nepal, stands at just 21½ inches. The two men were brought together in London for the 10th annual Guinness World Records Day. Surrounded by media and fans, Kosen and Dangi couldn't help but stare at each other in disbelief. Kosen, who has held the title of tallest living person since 2009, said he was amazed by how small Dangi was. "I've never seen someone so small before, it's incredible," he said. Dangi, who holds the record for the shortest living person ever recorded, was equally as amazed. "I never thought I would meet someone so tall," he said through a translator. "It's like looking up at a building." The meeting was a rare opportunity for both men, who had previously only seen each other in the pages of the Guinness World Records book. Kosen and Dangi spent time chatting and posing for photos before exchanging gifts. Kosen gave Dangi a pair of traditional Turkish slippers, while Dangi gifted Kosen a handmade Nepalese hat. Despite their vastly different sizes, Kosen and Dangi found common ground in their shared experience of holding world records. "It's an honor to meet someone who's also in the Guinness World Records book," Kosen said. "We're both part of history." The meeting between the tallest and shortest people in the world was a reminder of the incredible diversity of humanity. As Guinness World Records Editor-in-Chief Craig Glenday put it, "The beauty of Guinness World Records is that it recognizes the extremes of human potential." As Kosen and Dangi said goodbye, they left a lasting impression on each other and the world. Their meeting will go down in history as a moment of awe-inspiring contrast and unlikely connection.
