article: "You're listening to Fukushima FM." The cheery jingle on the radio reminds you of a different time in this part of eastern Japan, a different world that existed before March 11, 2011. Driving past houses that residents can no longer call home, you can still see sandbags holding down tarpaulins on damaged roofs. They're the result of the devastating earthquake and tsunami more than two years ago, and repairs the owners have not yet been able to carry out. We're inside the original 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone, an area completely evacuated after the tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems for three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, causing them to melt down and emit radioactive material. Residents can now return to certain parts of the outer exclusion zone but only during the day. The government does not want to run the risk of accumulative radiation exposure if people stay for a full 24 hours. By the side of the road we pass along, teams of workers are clearing the ground of radiation and have been since the summer of 2011. It's a colossal task that involves painstakingly removing the top layer of soil and grass to remove as much absorbed radiation as possible. The government-funded operation will have cost $1.5 billion by the end of this fiscal year, according to the Japanese government. On any given day up to 8,000 people are working on the clean-up around Fukushima Prefecture. More than a year ago, the workers here wore full protection suits, today they simply wear gloves and the basic face masks you can see anywhere in Japan -- a sign that the radiation level here has dropped. Thousands of industrial-size black bags hold the contaminated soil. They are lined up in fields, waiting for their final resting place -- wherever that may be. This is a reminder that the problem of what to do with radioactive water at the crippled Fukushima plant is not the only storage issue this country has to deal with. During the day, the steady volume of traffic in this outer part of the exclusion zone belies the invisible threat that still exists. It's a threat that two-and-a-half years later has residents wondering when, or even if, they will be able to move back home.

chatgpt: Efforts to clean up the extensive areas of Fukushima near the crippled nuclear plant are ongoing, more than two and a half years after the catastrophe. The original 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone surrounding the facility remains in place, and residents are only allowed access to the outer parts of this area for limited periods. The operation, which involves the removal of highly contaminated soil from the surrounding areas, is complex and expensive. A vast network of bags containing radioactive waste line the roads around the Fukushima Daiichi plant as part of the decontamination effort. The Japanese government has committed billions of dollars towards the clean-up, and it is expected to take several decades to complete. Despite the efforts, radioactive leaks from the Fukushima plant continue to cause concern. In September 2013, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) confirmed reports of a new leak of highly radioactive water from a holding tank at the plant. The leak was classified as a Level 3 incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which indicates "serious radiation exposure". Local residents and experts have called for greater transparency from TEPCO, the company responsible for the plant. The president of the company has apologized for the latest incident, but some have criticized the company for a lack of accountability and transparency regarding the ongoing containment efforts. In addition to these concerns, there is also the issue of the long-term impact of the radiation on the environment and human health. Studies have shown that exposure to even small amounts of radiation can increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. As the authorities continue to grapple with the containment and clean-up of the Fukushima plant, the tragedy has served as a harsh reminder of the potential dangers of nuclear power. It has led to a renewed debate over the safety and sustainability of nuclear energy, which some believe is a necessary part of the transition to a low-carbon future. Despite the challenges, the clean-up operation around Fukushima is a testament to the resilience and determination of the Japanese people. It also highlights the importance of global cooperation in responding to disasters of this magnitude, as countries around the world have offered support and resources to assist with the ongoing efforts.
