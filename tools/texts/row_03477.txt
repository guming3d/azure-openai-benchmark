A cheerleading group in Arizona are smashing through age stereotypes as they delight audiences with their acrobatic and high-energy routines, despite all being over 55-years-old. London-based photographer Todd Antony recently spent some time in Sun City, a retirement city with 37,000 residents close to Phoenix, Arizona, where he captured The Sun City Poms in action.

The group perform at over 50 venues a year, ranging from sports centres and high schools to conventions and fundraiserss . Although their grey and white hair might slightly jar with the tight colourful lycra outfits, these ladies show that despite their age, they don't lack enthusiasm ... or flexibility! They were very happy to be photographed striking a pose, with some ladies even raising their legs above their heads, against the backdrop of their sunny paradise. Antony says: ‘Spending time with these ladies made me consider how Americans view the aging process; at one end of the spectrum are the child beauty pageants with children trying to fast-track their years whilst at the other end are these fabulous pom pom ladies who are successfully and gracefully holding back the years.' The Sun City Poms were started in 1979 cheering for the Sun City Saints women’s softball team, and now consist of a marching unit and supporting unit along with the main performing unit. Prospective Sun City Poms must also possess: 'dance skills of rhythm, agility, poise, energy, and showmanship for performing' The Poms are smashing through age stereotypes as they delight audiences with their acrobatic and high-energy routines .

The Sun City website states: ‘Fry’s Sun City Poms come from all walks of life, and are more than entertainers.  They represent the fulfilment of life at any age.
