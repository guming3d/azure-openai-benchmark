This announcement was met with mixed reactions from the public, particularly on social media, where users mocked the choice, claiming that “Aussies need to get a better dish.” The meat pie with sauce is a popular savory pastry dish made with minced meat that is encased in a crispy pastry crust and served with tomato sauce. It is a simple and traditional dish, often enjoyed during sporting events and other casual occasions. While it is undeniably a favorite of many Australians, it was seen by some as a more basic choice compared to some of the other gourmet foods that the country is known for. Many Australians were quick to express their disappointment with the choice of the meat pie as the country’s national food. On social media, users complained that the meat pie was an embarrassing choice, and called for a more representative and sophisticated dish to be selected. Some even went as far as to suggest alternative national dishes, such as seafood from the coastal regions. Despite the backlash, the organizers defended their choice, pointing out that the meat pie is a beloved food in Australia that is enjoyed by people from all walks of life. They also noted that the choice of the meat pie was based on a recent poll that was conducted across the country, where participants were asked to name their favorite dish. While some Australians may be unhappy with the choice of the meat pie as the country’s national food, it is important to recognize that food is a deeply personal and cultural experience. What one person may see as a basic choice, another may see as an essential part of their culinary heritage. In the end, the controversy surrounding the meat pie with sauce as Australia’s national food highlights the diversity of Australia’s food culture and the need for greater recognition of the country’s culinary traditions. Whether it is meat pies or gourmet seafood, Australia has a unique and vibrant food scene that deserves to be celebrated and shared with the world.
