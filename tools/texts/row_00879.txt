chatgpt: Lee Oliver, a 38-year-old daredevil from East Sussex, was riding his motorbike at an unprecedented speed of 130mph with his friend Lee Cunningham when things went horribly wrong. Oliver attempted a dangerous stunt and was flung from his bike on the country road they were racing on. The incident took place on 21st June 2021, and details of the incident have recently emerged. It was a beautiful sunny morning, and the two friends were out for a ride. They decided to film themselves reaching a speed of 130mph and were recording the ride using a camera mounted on their motorbikes. However, things quickly took a turn towards disaster when Oliver attempted a wheelie while still going at a high speed. The stunt went wrong, and he lost control of his bike. Oliver tumbled 45ft down the road, and the impact was so severe that he slammed into a white van that was driving close by. It is not clear why the van was there, but it also had a dashboard camera that recorded the incident. The footage is said to be damning, showing the recklessness of the two friends and the danger they caused to other road users. Thankfully, Oliver escaped with minor injuries, but his friend was reportedly unharmed. However, the incident has resulted in severe consequences for Oliver. He received a four-year driving ban and was told by the judge that he could easily have killed himself or others with his dangerous actions. The ban may seem like a small price to pay, but it could have been much worse for Oliver and other road users. Reckless driving has been a significant issue in the UK for a long time, and this incident is an alarming reminder of the dangers that it poses. Speeding and performing stunts on the road is not just illegal; it is also incredibly irresponsible and endangers the lives of everyone on the road. Many people use motorbikes for comfort, convenience, and leisure, but it is crucial to remember that they are also powerful and dangerous machines. Oliver's situation illustrates the importance of responsible behavior while driving. Road safety should never be taken lightly, and drivers need to be aware of the possible consequences of their actions. Taking risks on the road can have devastating consequences, not just for the drivers, but for their families and other road users. In conclusion, the incident involving Lee Oliver and his friend is a stark reminder of the dangers of reckless driving. The video recording of their dangerous stunt is a warning to other drivers about the consequences of such behavior.
