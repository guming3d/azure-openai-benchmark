article: I doubt that Tomas Berdych will be saying anything to Andy Murray again on court in a hurry. His brief few words as they changed over at the end of the first set created the perfect double whammy — it did him as much harm as it did Murray good. I am aware that I said prior to the match that Andy should not let this get personal, but the fact is the timing of Berdych’s remark was so perfect for Murray — and disastrous from the Czech’s point of view — that it swung the match around. Both players had invested so much in the first set, which was over an hour-and-a-quarter of really hard tennis, that it was massive for Tomas to win it. Tomas Berdych stares at his opponent Andy Murray during their tense Australian Open semi-final . You can be sure that he will have been pumped and his opponent deflated, especially as Andy knew he had chances to take it. I was surprised that Berdych initiated it because confrontation is not really in his character and his level completely dropped afterwards. He virtually donated the next two games and lost 16 out of the next 20 points. Murray celebrates victory against Berdych (left) and acknowledges coach Amelie Mauresmo's role (right) As for Andy, the incident just helped him forget those 76 long minutes after which he had ended up with nothing. Instead of being down on himself he got fired up all over again and started playing more positively, especially on his forehand side. He rode this momentum all the way through the next two sets and, as I predicted beforehand, ended up winning in four. It was not a big altercation but the key thing was that it suited Andy’s personality while it did not suit Tomas at all. Murray had actually been as emotional for a first set as I recall, so he was up for this from the start. He could have faded after that lost tiebreak but his opponent unwittingly ensured that it did not happen.

chatgpt: In a thrilling match that went on for almost three and a half hours, Andy Murray emerged victorious against Tomas Berdych in the Australian Open semi-final. The match was filled with several moments of tension as both players fought tooth and nail to advance to the final. However, in the end, it was the Scot who prevailed, with a final scoreline of 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5. The first set was a closely contested affair, with both players holding serve and not giving each other an inch. However, it was Berdych who eventually prevailed in the tiebreak, winning it 8-6. This only seemed to spur Murray on, as he came out firing in the second set, winning it 6-0 in just 26 minutes. From then on, it was all Murray. He seemed to find his rhythm and began dictating the pace of the match. He broke Berdych's serve twice in the third set, winning it 6-3. The fourth set was a much closer affair, with both players refusing to give an inch. However, it was Murray who eventually broke Berdych's serve when it mattered most, winning the set 7-5 and the match. With this win, Murray has now reached his fourth Australian Open final, an impressive feat by any standards. He will face either Novak Djokovic or Stan Wawrinka in the final, both of whom are formidable opponents. However, Murray seems to be in good form and will no doubt be looking to win his third Grand Slam title. Speaking after the match, Murray said, "I'm really happy with the way I played today. Tomas is a tough opponent, and he really made me work for every point. But I managed to find my game in the second set, and from then on, I felt in control. I'm now looking forward to the final, and I'll be giving it my all." Murray is no stranger to Grand Slam finals, having reached 11 in his career so far. He has won two of them, both at Wimbledon, in 2013 and 2016. A win on Sunday would be a massive achievement for the Scot, and would firmly establish him as one of the best players in the world. The final promises to be a thrilling affair, with Murray facing off against either Djokovic or Wawrinka. No matter who he faces, he will no doubt be giving it his all, and his fans will be cheering him on every step of the way.
