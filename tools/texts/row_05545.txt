Vauxhall has announced 550 new jobs for its two UK factories - including 250 at the firm's Luton headquarters . The jobs boost was announced by Opel-Vauxhall's executive vice president and president of parent company General Motors Europe Karl-Thomas Neumann (Monday) during a visit to Britain. He praised the motivation of the UK workforce compared to that of plants on the Continent and in the USA. 'It's an incredible turnaround. A year ago we were speculating which factory to close. Now we are announcing new jobs.' A Vauxhall spokesman said: 'As its business grows and with another new model on the horizon Vauxhall has confirmed that it will take on 550 new employees at its manufacturing sites in Ellesmere Port and Luton, the first significant new-hire programme for a decade.' He added: 'Around 300 new jobs will be secured at the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire. The plant currently operates on two shifts but as sales volumes build more employees are required to cope with increased output at the facility. The new jobs will be phased in over the first quarter of 2015.' In 2012, Ellesmere Port won the contract to build the next generation, all-new Astra. Production of this model begins towards the end of 2015.. The agreement runs into the next decade and secured a £125 million investment.

A second shift is to be added to the Luton van plant in January 2015, creating around 250 new jobs. The Luton facility builds the recently launched all-new Vivaro van and will be taking on these new employees to increase output next year. In 2011, Luton won the contract to build the new Vivaro, entailing a £185 million investment. 'This is great news for Vauxhall and for British manufacturing,” said Tim Tozer, Vauxhall’s Chairman and Managing Director. “Both of our UK manufacturing plants have won long contracts with all-new product and as the business strengthens, we now need to take on more people to build these exciting new Vauxhalls.'

chatgpt: Vauxhall has announced plans to create 550 new jobs at its two UK factories. The new employees will help to build the new Astra model and Vivaro van, which the company hopes will boost its fortunes. The news has been warmly welcomed by workers, who had feared that the company might scale back its operations in the UK. Many are hoping that the new jobs will help to secure the long-term future of the two factories. The announcement was made by Vauxhall's president, who praised the "incredible" turnaround in the company's fortunes. In recent years, Vauxhall has faced tough competition from overseas manufacturers, particularly in the Asian market. However, the company has worked hard to improve its efficiency and quality, and has taken steps to make its vehicles more appealing to buyers. The new hires will be spread across Vauxhall's two factories, which are located in Luton and Ellesmere Port. The Luton plant will focus on building the Vivaro van, which is a popular choice among commercial buyers. Meanwhile, the Ellesmere Port factory will be responsible for producing the new Astra model, which is expected to be a hit with families and commuters. Vauxhall has a long history in the UK, having first started producing cars in the country in the early 1900s. Over the years, the company has become one of the most recognisable brands in the country, and its vehicles have been a familiar sight on UK roads for generations. The new jobs are seen as a major boost for the UK's manufacturing sector, which has been hit hard in recent years by the decline in traditional industries such as steel and coal. However, the car industry has remained a bright spot, with several manufacturers, including Vauxhall, investing heavily in their UK operations in recent years. The UK government has welcomed the news, with a spokesperson saying that it demonstrates the country's continued attractiveness as a destination for investment in advanced manufacturing. The spokesperson added that the government will continue to work closely with Vauxhall and other manufacturers to support the growth of the UK's manufacturing sector. Overall, the news of the 550 new jobs is a major boost for Vauxhall and for the UK as a whole. It shows that the company is committed to investing in its UK operations and that the country remains an attractive place for manufacturing firms to do business. With the new Astra and Vivaro models set to hit the market soon, many will be watching closely to see whether Vauxhall's latest investments pay off.
