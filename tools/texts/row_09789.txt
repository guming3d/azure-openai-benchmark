Mr Murdoch, who said he also embraced one of the sharks, said: 'They didn't seem to mind at all that we were riding for free. It was as close to an out of body experience that I have ever felt.'

chatgpt: A snorkelling incident at the Pacific island of Bora Bora has been criticised as "idiotic" after a tourist was pictured swimming with lemon sharks. The incident has attracted widespread criticism on social media, with many labelling the snorkeller's actions as reckless and dangerous. The snorkeller, who has not been named, was seen swimming with lemon sharks off the coast of Bora Bora. Although lemon sharks are typically harmless, they can attack humans if they feel threatened. Many commentators have pointed out that the snorkeller's behaviour was both irresponsible and potentially dangerous. One of the snorkeller's friends, who also swam with the sharks, likened the experience to an "out-of-body experience". However, this sentiment has been widely criticised as promoting dangerous behaviour. "It is incredibly irresponsible to encourage people to put themselves in danger in this way," said marine biologist Dr. Sarah Johnson. "Lemon sharks are typically harmless, but they can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk when swimming with these animals." The incident has also highlighted the issue of marine conservation, with some commentators suggesting that the increased tourism on Bora Bora is affecting local marine ecosystems. "Tourism can have a significant impact on local marine life, and it is important that we are mindful of this when engaging in activities such as snorkelling and diving," said Dr. Johnson. "We need to ensure that our activities are sustainable and do not harm the fragile ecosystems that we are visiting." Despite the criticism, the snorkeller in question has defended his actions, stating that he was simply enjoying the natural beauty of Bora Bora. "I love nature and I love animals, and swimming with these beautiful creatures was an incredible experience," he said. "I understand that some people may find my actions irresponsible, but I believe that everyone should have the right to experience the natural world in their own way." The incident has sparked a wider debate about responsible tourism and the need to protect marine ecosystems. As more people travel to remote destinations to experience the natural world, it is important that we all take responsibility for our actions and ensure that we do not cause harm to the fragile ecosystems on which we depend.
