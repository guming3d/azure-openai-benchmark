Bungling: Neil Timmins, whose toy gun fell apart as he tried to hold up an off-licence in Dudley, West Midlands . A would-be robber who held up a shop with a toy gun tried to pretend his raid was a prank when the weapon fell apart in his hands. Neil Timmins, 33, was left red-faced when his flimsy fake firearm fell to bits as he held up an off-licence in Dudley, West Midlands. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that in an attempt to back-track Timmins told shocked shopkeeper Mohammed Khan: 'I'm only joking mate.' A judge on Tuesday jailed Timmins for three years after he pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. Judge Michael Dudley told him: 'People who run small supermarkets like this provide an exceptionally good service to the public but they are vulnerable to attack . 'This was extremely frightening because you foolishly produced a toy pistol they clearly thought was genuine.' Mark Rees, prosecuting, said Timmins went into Minty’s off-licence on June 8 and produced the gun before jamming it into the stomach of Mr Khan. Mr Rees said: 'Timmins told Mr Khan "Give me the money. Give me what you have got", before pushing him into shelving. 'Mohammed Tariq then approached and demanded what Timmins was doing. 'It was then Mr Khan grabbed at the gun and as he pulled it harder it broke and he quickly realised it was not a genuine firearm. A plastic toy gun: Timmins's fake firearm, similar to this one, fell to pieces when shopkeeper Mohammed Khan bravely grabbed it in an attempt to foil the robbery . 'Timmins then said "I’m only joking mate", as Mr Khan replied, "You joke like that. What are you trying to do?" 'Officers were on the scene within minutes and were able to grab Timmins, when they searched his bag they found the broken pieces of the toy gun.' When questioned by police Timmins said he had been drinking heavily and could not remember what happened inside the off-licence. Christopher O’Gorman, defending, said it was clear his client was 'in a highly intoxicated state.'

chatgpt: A man who attempted to rob a store using a fake firearm has been sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty. Neil Timmins's plan was foiled by a brave shopkeeper when he attempted to use his imitation weapon to threaten the clerk. The incident took place in the early evening when Timmins entered the store, wearing a mask and carrying a fake firearm. He demanded money from the shopkeeper and threatened to shoot him if he didn't comply. Unbeknownst to Timmins, his fake weapon was poorly constructed and broke when the shopkeeper bravely grabbed it. Despite having no real weapon, Timmins attempted to flee the scene, but the shopkeeper pursued him outside and managed to grab hold of him until police arrived. Given the circumstances of the attempted robbery, it was only a matter of time before Timmins was caught and charged. Appearing before the court, Timmins pleaded guilty to the offences of attempted robbery and possession of an imitation firearm. The judge commented that Timmins must have known that his fake firearm would cause fear and alarm to the shopkeeper and potentially to others in the area. In passing sentence, the judge acknowledged the seriousness of the offences and their potential to cause harm to innocent people. However, he also took into account Timmins's plea of guilt and his lack of previous convictions. The three-year sentence handed down to Timmins reflected the gravity of the offences but also balanced the need for rehabilitation and the potential for him to reform. The shopkeeper involved in the incident was praised for their bravery in thwarting the attempted robbery. Commenting on the outcome of the trial, they expressed relief that justice had been served but also a degree of sympathy for Timmins's situation. "Nobody should feel compelled to resort to such drastic measures," the shopkeeper said, "especially when there are other ways of addressing one's difficulties." This incident serves as a reminder that even fake weapons can have serious consequences, and attempting to use them in any situation is both illegal and dangerous. Shopkeepers and members of the public must remain vigilant at all times, and anyone who witnesses or experiences a crime must report it immediately to the authorities.
