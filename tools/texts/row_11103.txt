article: (CNN) -- South Korean singer Psy has conquered the world with his "Gangnam Style" hit -- and his country continued its dominance of Asian club football on Saturday. Ulsan Hyundai's players celebrated by performing a victory dance in homage to the pop phenomenon after winning the region's Champions League title for the first time. Ulsan defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Ahli 3-0 to become the third K-League team in four years to lift the trophy. "Ulsan have had to wait for a long time to come to final so I told the players we must win the game and to do that we must play a normal game," coach Kim Ho-gon said after goals from captain Kwak Tae-hwi, Brazilian striker Rafinha and midfielder Kim Seung-yong completed a run of nine successive wins in the competition. "After the first group game every game felt like a final, but the final did not feel like a final as we had done so well in the semifinal." The victory at Ulsan's Munsu Stadium earned the club a place at December's Club World Cup in Japan, with a quarterfinal tie against Mexico's Monterrey. "I am so happy for the players," Kim said on the Asian Football Confederation website. "They wanted to play in the FIFA Club World Cup and it is the same for me. This is the happiest day in my coaching career." Al Ahli had reached the final for the first time in the tournament's present format, though the club lost in the title match of the 1986 competition when it was known as the Asian Club Championship. "The team learned a lot this year by playing against different strong teams," said Ahli's Czech coach Karel Jarolim. "Al Ahli is a very young team and these players have gained experience this season and they will work hard for next year and will try to do our best." His team booked a place in next year's tournament by finishing second in the Saudi league, but Ulsan may miss out after dropping outside the K-League's qualification places.

chatgpt: Ulsan Hyundai Football Club secured a place in the FIFA Club World Cup after winning the Asian title with a convincing 3-0 victory over Al Ahli in the Champions League final. This is the third time in four years that a Korean club has won the prestigious tournament. Ulsan Hyundai dominated the final, with goals from Kim In-sung, Junior Negao, and Yoon Bit-garam, securing the victory for the K-League team. The win also means that Ulsan has won all nine games on their path to the Asian title. The triumph was a testament to the team's excellent form, with Ulsan having lost just one game all season. However, despite their impressive performance in the Champions League, Ulsan are still battling to qualify for next season's tournament. Ulsan Hyundai's journey to the final was not without its challenges. They faced strong opposition from teams across the continent, including Japan's Vissel Kobe and China's Beijing FC. However, Ulsan showed their class by topping their group and winning all their knockout matches en route to the final. The victory was a significant achievement for the K-League, which has produced three of the last four winners of the Champions League. Ulsan Hyundai's success in the tournament also marks a remarkable turnaround for the club, who were relegated to the second tier just two years ago. This will be Ulsan's second appearance in the FIFA Club World Cup, having finished fourth in their debut appearance in 2012. They will be hoping to improve on that performance and emulate the success of fellow Korean teams, Pohang Steelers and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, who finished third in 2009 and 2016, respectively. The FIFA Club World Cup will take place in December 2020 in Qatar, and Ulsan Hyundai will be joining the likes of Bayern Munich, Al-Duhail, and Auckland City in the tournament. The K-League champions will be hoping to make an impression on the global stage and bring glory to their country.
