The plans for the 4768 square metre site triggered several protests from residents with some waving anti-Islamic signs throughout the approvals process. A week earlier the plan triggered a hate-filled Facebook page directed at councillorÂ Chris Robbins, which she alleged was riddled with death and rape threats levelled against her. Prior to Tuesday's decision the council received a record 3867 submissions and eight petitions containing 5511 signatures against the proposal. Ms Robbins claimed she was subjected to 'horrific vilification' on Facebook when damming comments were posted about her in relation to the mosque, which she voted against on Wednesday. The councillor had an image of her pictured on the anti-Islamic page which she requested Facebook take down. Councillor Chris Robbins and the Facebook page opposing the development of the mosque .

Ms Robbins said the page was defamatory and called for all comments directed toward her to also be removed. 'Horrific vilification, threatening all kinds of nastiness directed at me because I'd basically gone to the meeting and said council's got an application for a mosque and we will be assessing it as we're obliged to by law,' she said. 'That essentially peeved some people who wanted me to stand up and say that at the end of the day this wouldn't happen.' She said the lack of accountability for the Facebook page's authors is despicable and highlights how easily people can target victims through social media with little fear of consequences. Ms Robbins led the calls against the mosque on Tuesday saying the council had let down the community by not fully assessing the impact it would have on them. About 30 opponents cheered and booed from the public gallery with about 10 officers on standby in case violence erupted. Councillors from both sides of the debate expressed concern that the decision to refuse the application would result in a court appeal which could be costly for ratepayers.

chatgpt: In a surprising decision, Gold Coast council has rejected a controversial mosque that was planned to be built in the city. The proposed site, a Curumbin-based warehouse that was slated to be converted into a worship hall, has been the source of a great deal of controversy in recent weeks. The decision to reject the mosque was made at a council meeting on Wednesday, following a record number of submissions that were made against the proposal. Protesters gathered outside the council chambers in anticipation of the decision, and they cheered when it was announced that the mosque would not be built. The proposed mosque was to be a massive 4768 square metres in size, and would have been one of the largest religious buildings on the Gold Coast. The size of the building, along with concerns about traffic and parking, had raised the ire of many residents in the area. Despite these concerns, the mosque had gained the support of many members of the local Muslim community, who saw it as a vital addition to the region. They argued that the mosque would provide a much-needed place of worship for Muslims in the area, and would help to foster greater understanding and tolerance between different faiths. However, this argument ultimately didn't sway the council, which is now facing accusations of Islamophobia and religious discrimination. Critics of the decision argue that it sets a dangerous precedent, and that it sends the message that Gold Coast is not an inclusive or welcoming place for people of all faiths. For their part, the council has defended their decision, citing concerns about traffic congestion and the impact that the mosque would have on the surrounding community. They also pointed out that the decision was made in accordance with the council's planning regulations, and that they had followed due process in considering the proposal. Despite these statements, many in the community remain deeply divided over the issue. Some see the decision as a victory for common sense and local democracy, while others view it as a harmful and discriminatory act that violates the rights of religious minorities. As the debate continues to rage, it is clear that the issue of the proposed mosque is unlikely to go away anytime soon. Its rejection marks the end of a long and controversial chapter in the history of the Gold Coast, but it also raises important questions about the nature of religious freedom and tolerance in modern day Australia.
