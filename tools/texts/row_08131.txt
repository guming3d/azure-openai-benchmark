Both of the district attorney investigators allegedly stole the comic books which were evidence in an embezzlement case that they were investigating in May 2012 against Anthony Chiofalo. The case centered on Chiofalo, who, was accused of embezzling about $9 million from his client, a company that manufactures heavy cranes. He bought sports memorabilia including a baseball helmet signed by Pete Rose, rare comic books and other collectibles with the stolen cash. Authorities were called in after the crane company discovered the missing funds. Meanwhile, Chiofalo kept hundreds of the items bought with the cash in his home and a storage unit in Spring. During the investigation, investigator Deutsch had the keys to get into the storage units giving him ample opportunity to steal the items. In October 2012, Blevins sold thousands of dollars worth of rare comic books to a dealer in Chicago who later discovered they were the same items purchased by Chiofalo from an online auction house.

chatgpt: Dustin Deutsch, 41, of New York City, has been indicted for felony theft in connection with the alleged theft of thousands of dollars worth of vintage comic books. Deutsch's former partner, Lonnie Blevins, 39, was also involved in the crime and has been charged with theft. According to the indictment, Deutsch and Blevins stole numerous vintage comic books from a storage unit in the Bronx, which contained valuable items ranging from the 1930s to the 1970s. The two then allegedly sold some of the comic books on eBay and at various comic book stores. Prosecutors say that Deutsch and Blevins stole the valuable comic books over a three-year period. In total, the comics were worth more than $10,000. "Theft is a serious crime, and it is particularly egregious when it involves the theft of valuable items such as these vintage comic books," said John Doe, the prosecutor in the case. "We will do everything in our power to hold those responsible for this crime accountable for their actions." Deutsch and Blevins have both been charged with theft, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. They are both scheduled to appear in court at a later date. Comic book theft is becoming increasingly common, with criminals targeting collections or storage facilities. In 2019, a man was arrested in Florida for stealing valuable comic books from a storage unit. In another case, a group of individuals were charged with stealing comic books worth more than $1 million from a vendor at the San Diego Comic-Con. Experts say that the value of vintage comics has been rising in recent years, making them attractive targets for thieves. Many of these rare comics are worth tens of thousands of dollars or more, and there is a vibrant market for collectors. The rise of online marketplaces like eBay has also made it easier for thieves to sell stolen goods, making it more important than ever for collectors to be aware of the risks and to take steps to protect their valuable items. In the case of Deutsch and Blevins, it remains to be seen what their defense will be against the charges. However, if convicted, they could face a significant period of incarceration and will likely face significant financial penalties as well.
