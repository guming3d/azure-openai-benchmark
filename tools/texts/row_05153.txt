An American has become the sixth wingsuit flyer to die in the Alps in as many months. The 33-year-old from California, who has not been named, plunged to earth near the French resort town of Chamonix on Saturday . Like Mr Sutton, the American was wearing a wingsuit when he jumped from the top of a 2500 meter cliff near the summit of Brevent. He got into difficulties on the way down, and his lifeless body was later found by mountain rescuers. The accident has increased calls for the authorities to reinstate a ban on wingsuits – jumpsuits made of a special fabric which increase the surface area of the body, so allowing users ‘to fly’ after launching themselves from a mountainside or high building, or from a plane. The idea is that sportsmen can enjoy the feeling of flying before opening a parachute and landing. Mr Sutton, who was Daniel Craig’s double in the hugely popular Olympic stunt, died when he hit a ridge near the Swiss town of Martigny, Switzerland, close to the French border in August. His horrific death follows that of former British soldier Mark Sutton (pictured), who performed the James Bond stunt at the opening ceremony at the London Olympics last year . Last year Chamonix banned wingsuit jumps after the death of a Norwegian jumper, who died when his parachute failed to open. Mayor Eric Fournier said: ‘For us, adventure doesn't mean extreme risk. This is why the ban was brought in.’ It was lifted in July this year, however, following complaints from extreme sportsmen who argued that they were responsible for their own safety. ‘A new ban is a possibility,’ said a town council source. ‘The number of deaths associated with the sport is of great concern. Safety is always the priority.’

chatgpt: A 33-year-old wingsuit enthusiast from California has tragically died following a daredevil leap from a mountain in the Alps. The individual has not been named but was reportedly a seasoned wingsuit flyer who had previously completed many successful jumps. The death comes just days after the passing of Mark Sutton, a former soldier and Olympic stuntman who was well known in the wingsuiting community. Sutton was killed after a similar stunt, and his passing has reignited concerns about the safety of wingsuit flying. The California jumper's lifeless body was discovered by mountain rescuers, who were alerted to the incident by alarmed onlookers. The exact circumstances of the individual's death are unknown, but it is believed that they got caught in a gust of wind and crashed into the mountain. Wingsuiting is an extreme sport that involves flying through the air while wearing a special suit. The suits have fabric between the arms and body and between the legs that create a wing-like shape. The idea is to increase the lift and reduce the descent rate, allowing the jumper to glide through the air at high speeds. The sport has grown in popularity in recent years, with many enthusiasts posting videos of their stunts online. However, wingsuit flying is not without risks; accidents can occur due to a variety of factors, including poor weather conditions, equipment failure, and human error. There have been renewed calls for the sport to be banned following the recent deaths. Critics argue that wingsuiting is too dangerous and that it is only a matter of time before there are more fatalities. Supporters of the sport argue that it is no more dangerous than other extreme sports, such as rock climbing or base jumping. They also point out that most accidents occur when jumpers take unnecessary risks or fail to take adequate safety precautions. Despite the risks, many wingsuit enthusiasts are determined to continue pursuing their passion. They argue that wingsuiting provides an incredible adrenaline rush and a unique sense of freedom that cannot be found anywhere else. As the debate about the safety of wingsuiting continues, it remains to be seen whether any action will be taken to regulate the sport. In the meantime, the wingsuiting community mourns the loss of two of its own and reflects on the risks and rewards of pursuing their passion.
