article: (CNN) -- Following a volatile week in Myanmar that has seen a surge in deadly sectarian violence, a group of Islamic organizations in the country announced that it had canceled all celebrations for Eid al-Adha, the four-day religious holiday observed by many Muslims. No reason was given in the announcement from the All Myanmar Islam Association, a collaboration of five major Islamic organizations there. But locals are seeing it as a precautionary measure after the violence in recent days. Clashes between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims have flared this week, killing dozens of people and burning thousands of homes to the ground in the western state of Rakhine. There has been tension between the two ethnic groups since May, when violence began after three Muslim men were arrested on suspicion of raping and killing a Buddhist woman. New satellite imagery obtained by Human Rights Watch shows what it said was extensive destruction of buildings in a predominantly Rohingya area of the coastal town of Kyauk Pyu. The swath of arson, the group said, stretched over 35 acres and included houseboats and floating barges. The government in Myanmar "urgently needs to provide security for the Rohingya ... who are under vicious attack," said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. "Unless the authorities also start addressing the root causes of the violence, it is only likely to get worse." The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Myanmar doesn't recognize them as citizens. Q&A: What's behind the sectarian violence in Myanmar? Unrest between the Rohingya and majority Buddhists has tested President Thein Sein's administration, which is trying to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. The government has sent extra security into the troubled region and declared a state of emergency. The president's office warned Thursday that "manipulators" behind the violence can expect to be found and prosecuted. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, speaking in Parliament on Friday, called for a greater security presence and urged authorities to investigate suspected human rights offenses. CNN's Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A group of Islamic organizations in Myanmar has canceled Eid al-Adha celebrations due to ongoing violent clashes between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. Protests and riots have been escalating for weeks, but the latest outbreak of violence has left dozens of people dead and thousands of homes burned down. Rohingya Muslims have long been the target of discrimination in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country. The government has denied them citizenship and basic rights, despite their presence in the country for generations. This has led to tensions between the Buddhist majority and minority Muslim communities. The violence started on Monday when a Buddhist monk was attacked by a group of Rohingya men. This led to retaliatory attacks by Buddhists in the area, which quickly escalated. The violence has spread to other parts of Rakhine state, where most Rohingya Muslims live, and has left many families homeless. The situation has become so dangerous that several Islamic organizations have canceled their Eid al-Adha celebrations, a major holiday in the Muslim calendar. This decision was made in order to avoid any further violence and to show respect for the victims of the recent clashes. It is a sad reflection of the state of affairs in Myanmar that such an important religious celebration cannot be held due to the ongoing conflict. The international community has condemned the violence and called on the government of Myanmar to do more to protect its citizens, regardless of their religion or ethnicity. Many human rights organizations have accused the government of turning a blind eye to the persecution of the Rohingya and a failure to prevent outbreaks of violence like the one currently taking place. In conclusion, the cancelation of Eid al-Adha celebrations in Myanmar is a stark reminder of the ongoing conflict between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. The recent outbreak of violence has left many dead, and thousands homeless, and highlights the urgent need for the government to take action to protect all of its citizens. The international community must also continue to put pressure on Myanmar to address the root causes of this conflict and to support those affected by the violence.
