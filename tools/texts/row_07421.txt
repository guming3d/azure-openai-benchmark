article: Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain has warned Barcelona that the Premier League champions 'have plenty of confidence' ahead of a repeat of the Champions League fixture that eliminated Manuel Pellegrini's side from the tournament at the same stage last season. After a home defeat to CSKA Moscow in November, City were at the bottom of Group E and struggling to see a way of progressing in Europe's most illustrious club competition. But a hat-trick from Sergio Aguero inspired City to a 3-2 win against Bayern Munich and they followed it with a 2-0 victory at the Stadio Olimpico against Roma  to advance to the second round, where they meet Barcelona again.

But Begiristain believes that the character City showed to reach the knock-out stages ensures that belief is high and Barcelona will have a harder proposition than last season. 'We have plenty of confidence with the way we qualified beating Bayern Munich at home and Roma away, so the players will be working hard to get fit and arrive in confidence for those games,' Begiristain told Sky Sports. 'We have really improved our squad and feel we are more solid, stronger than last season. 'We have the same quality up front, but are more solid behind, and that gives us confidence for the run.' Barcelona were 4-1 aggregate winners against City last season, following up a 2-0 victory at the Nou Camp with a 2-1 win at the Etihad. Begiristain also commented on how City continue to draw the same teams from previous years of involvement in the tournament, after Pellegrini's side also took on Bayern Munich and CSKA for the second time in as many years in the group stages.

'It’s unbelievable – we don’t need to come next year,' he joked. 'Every tie in that draw is the same, it's fantastic, so we're looking forward to it.' Pellegrini will be hoping City's upward trajectory in European form will continue when they play Barcelona at home in the first leg on February 24, with the away fixture taking place on March 18.

chatgpt: Manchester City will have to face Barcelona in the second round of the Champions League, raising the stakes of the contest for the English Premier League leaders. The draw was made earlier this week and sees City coming up against their opponents in the round of 16, a repeat fixture that saw them eliminated at the same stage last year. Director of football Txiki Begiristain, in an official statement, said that he was not daunted by the challenge of playing one of Europe's strongest teams. However, the Catalan side boast one of the most comprehensive attacking systems in the world, led by the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, putting even the strongest defences in Europe to the test. City have been drawn against Barcelona twice before in the competition, and will be hoping to finally get one over their Spanish opponents. The club will be looking to put up a better performance than the last time they faced Barca, losing 3-1 on aggregate. The two sides are set to compete at the Etihad Stadium on February 18th and at the Nou Camp on March 9th. Manchester City has been a formidable force in the Premier League so far this season, and their manager, Pep Guardiola, will be looking to extend their success to the European stage. The team has been dominant in domestic play and currently holds an impressive six-point lead over second-placed Manchester United. Guardiola has a wealth of experience having won the Champions League twice during his time at Barcelona, and will no doubt be eager to replicate past successes. While Manchester City may not have the same depth of experience that Barcelona has, with a younger team, there is no doubt that they will certainly put up a good fight. City's attacking talent, led by the likes of Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling, presents a real threat to the Spanish giants. They have also been bolstered by the signing of Ruben Dias, who has made a significant impact in his short time at City. Regardless of the final outcome, the upcoming clash between Manchester City and Barcelona is set to be a thrilling match, with both teams bringing their best to the pitch. It is a must-watch fixture between two of Europe's top clubs, and fans from all around the world will no doubt be eagerly anticipating the outcome. The game is expected to be a close encounter, with both sides evenly matched on paper, but the Catalan giants will no doubt be seen by most as the favourites to progress to the next round.
