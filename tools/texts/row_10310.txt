The pair have been dating for over six years, and gossip is rife - denied by all concerned, naturally - that theirs might be the next royal engagement to be announced. Last month, Beatrice's mother Sarah Ferguson spent the weekend at Balmoral as a guest of Her Majesty, accompanied by her ex-husband and their two daughters, leading some to speculate on the reasons for this royal rapprochement. Ever the gentleman, Dave held a protective arm around Beatrice as they left the high end restaurant, which is situated inside the London Edition hotel just off Oxford Street. Berners Tavern, which serves up such culinary delights as crispy pigs head, fois gras and black pudding, watercress and pickled onion salad, or macaroni and cheese with braised ox cheek brioche and bone marrow crumble, is very much in keeping with Beatrice’s normal choice of restaurant. The princess is known to frequent A-list favourites such as Chiltern Firehouse, Zuma, Nobu, Restaurant C and Balthazar. Beatrice looked decidedly slim in a high-waisted black skirt cinched in at the waist with a wide black belt . But alongside all the high-end partying and expensive dining, Beatrice often donates her time to good causes. Last week on September 11 the young royal tried her hand at investment banking in London at the annual BGC Charity Day; selling shares for a good cause, while commemorating the bank's employees who perished on 9/11. The daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson joined a slew of celebrities as she brokered deals on the phone joining the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Dynamo, Stephen Fry and Jack Whitehall, as each celebrity raised money for their chosen charity. David Gandy, Yasmin Le Bon, Clive Owen, Amanda Holden and James Haskell also gave brokering a go for a good cause.
