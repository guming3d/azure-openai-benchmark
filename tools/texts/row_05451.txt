The yobs took Mr Paxman's BMX bike and his Blackberry after giving him a beating. The victim was so traumatised, he moved away from the city. On August 6, prosecuting barrister Julian Kesner told Gloucester Crown Court: 'This defendant played a significant role in this group attack on a vulnerable young man who has a speech impediment and learning difficulties. 'When the victim's phone rang one of the gang grabbed it and handed it to this defendant. 'The defendant then punched Mr Paxman around the face.

chatgpt: Sophie Duckett, a woman from Gloucester, has been sentenced to an additional seven hours of community service for breaching an 18-month order. The breach occurred when she lost her unborn child, which was a violation of the order. Duckett had previously been sentenced to an order in August, along with 180 hours of unpaid work, for punching a man in the face and stealing his phone. During her sentencing in August at Gloucester Crown Court, Judge Jamie Tabor QC had warned Duckett against getting pregnant again. The recent breach of the 18-month order occurred when Duckett lost her unborn child. The exact details of the order are not known, but it is believed that it may have included restrictions on Duckett's behavior and activities. Duckett's legal troubles began earlier this year when she was charged with assault and theft. The charges stemmed from an incident where Duckett punched a man in the face and stole his phone. She was sentenced to an order in August, along with community service, as a result of these charges. Judge Tabor QC had said during the previous sentencing that if Duckett, who had a history of substance abuse and mental health issues, was to get pregnant again, it would not be in the child's best interests. The judge had also warned Duckett that she needed to stay out of trouble and comply with the order. It is not clear why Duckett lost her unborn child, but the loss is believed to have been a contributing factor to the breach of the order. The judge was reportedly unhappy with the breach and warned Duckett that if she failed to comply with the order, she would face harsher penalties. Duckett's case highlights the difficulties that individuals with mental health and substance abuse issues can face when trying to comply with court orders. These individuals often require additional support and resources to help them stay on track and avoid further legal troubles. The case also raises questions about the effectiveness of orders and community service as a means of rehabilitation. While these measures are intended to help individuals turn their lives around and avoid future legal troubles, they may not always be effective. Duckett will now be required to complete the additional seven hours of community service on top of the 180 hours she was already sentenced to. It remains to be seen whether she will be able to comply with the order and stay out of trouble in the future.
