article: A saltwater crocodile up to four metres long cleared a popular Australian beach on the weekend after it was spotted lurking in the water. Broome’s Cable Beach, in Western Australia, is a major tourism hotspot – attracting thousands of people to the 22km stretch every year. But the popular beach was closed on Saturday after the male crocodile was seen lazing about in knee-deep water for the entire day. Catching waves: The four-metre saltwater crocodile closed Broome's popular Cable Beach for a day before it moved on . Broome woman Sharon Scoble said she was amazed by how big the reptile was. ‘He was a big boy - his head was huge,’ she said. ‘It would be all over red rover if he got hold of you.’ The croc did not show signs of aggression, but Ms Scoble said it was looking at people on the beach. ‘I felt really humbled but you probably wouldn’t feel that way if you were out there on a paddle board or having a swim," she said. By Sunday morning, the crocodile had moved on. Parks and Wildlife senior operation officer Dave Woods said he believed it was the same crocodile that had been spotted in a number of locations in the area around December. Rolling in the deep: A four-metre crocodile was caught surfing at Broome's iconic Cable Beach in Western Australia . He estimated it was 3.5 metres to four metres long. Officials are now searching for the animal in order to move it to the Malcolm Douglas Wilderness Park, 16km east of Broome. The sighting follows the disappearance of a 12-year-old boy last month, who was taken by a saltwater crocodile while swimming with friends in the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. In that incident, witnesses saw the crocodile approach the group and bite a 15-year-old boy on the arm. The reptile, dubbed one of Australia’s most dangerous predators, let go of the 15-year-old when he began to fight back and turned on the 12-year-old, before swimming off with him. Experts said the ‘wet season’ is the most dangerous time to be swimming in waterholes and creeks.

chatgpt: A saltwater crocodile measuring about four meters in length was spotted in the waters of Cable Beach, causing the beach to be temporarily closed as a precaution. The menacing reptile was said to be "lurking" in the waters, which caused concern among beachgoers and local authorities. The sighting was quite alarming because it was believed to be the same crocodile that was sighted in the same area last December. It was not clear how long the crocodile had been in the area, but authorities are advising locals to be cautious when swimming in nearby waters. Experts have explained that the fact that the crocodile is still in the area is quite concerning, since it is not common for crocodiles to stay in one area for a long time. It is presumed that the crocodile is still in the vicinity since it is not uncommon for the species to stay in the area for several weeks or even months. This recent sighting of the crocodile comes after an alarming attack on a 12-year-old boy in the Northern Territory. The attack has renewed fears about the dangers posed by crocodiles in the wild. Crocodile attacks in Australia are not uncommon, and experts emphasize the need for better protection and awareness. Cable Beach was closed last year after a crocodile was spotted in the area, although the beach was reopened after several hours. This time around, the beach remained closed until local authorities could ascertain that the area was safe for swimming. The Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPAW) has advised locals to be vigilant and to report any sightings of the saltwater crocodile to the authorities. Saltwater crocodiles are one of the largest species of reptiles in the world, and can grow up to seven meters in length. While they are not naturally aggressive towards humans, they are territorial and have been recorded attacking humans who enter their habitat. Crocodiles are known to be highly adaptable creatures and can survive in both saltwater and freshwater environments. In conclusion, the sighting of a four-meter-long saltwater crocodile in Cable Beach has renewed fears about the dangers posed by these creatures. It is important for local authorities to take appropriate measures to ensure that the public remains safe from any potential danger. It is also essential for locals to stay vigilant and report any sightings of the crocodile to the DPAW.
