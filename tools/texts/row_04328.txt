chatgpt: Former Olympic trampolinist, David Smith, recently made headlines when he performed a record-breaking stunt in the latest extreme sport craze - Freedropping. This new sport involves jumping onto an airbag and performing twists, flips and turns in mid-air. Smith, who won a silver medal for trampolining in the 2012 Olympics, is no stranger to high-flying stunts. However, he admits that freedropping is a completely different game. "It's an adrenaline rush like no other. You have this sense of weightlessness and freedom that you just can't achieve on a trampoline," he explains. The sport began in Europe and has been steadily growing in popularity around the world. It's a mix of gymnastics, parkour and skydiving, with participants performing acrobatic moves as they freefall towards the airbag below. The soft landing provided by the airbag ensures that participants can push themselves to the extreme without risking injury. Despite its relative safety, freedropping is not for the faint-hearted. Participants must be physically fit and mentally prepared to take on the challenge of jumping from heights of up to 30 feet. But for Smith, the risk is worth the reward. "I live for the rush of pushing my limits and achieving new heights. Freedropping is the ultimate challenge for me," he says. Smith's record-breaking stunt involved performing a triple backflip from a height of 20 feet onto the airbag below. It's a feat that has never been achieved before and has earned him recognition from the freedropping community. "David's stunt was truly incredible. It's a testament to the skill and dedication required to excel in this sport," says John Thompson, a freedropping enthusiast. As more and more people try freedropping for themselves, the sport's popularity continues to grow. It's being touted as the next big thing in extreme sports, with competitions and events planned around the world. But for Smith, it's all about the thrill of the jump. "When you're up there, nothing else matters. It's just you, the air and the thrill of the jump," he says. Freedropping may not be for everyone, but for those brave enough to take on the challenge, the rewards are truly exhilarating. With athletes like David Smith leading the way, it's clear that this new sport is here to stay.
