Harry Nicolaides behind the bars of a Thai holding cell. Harry Nicolaides, 41, was arrested last August over his 2005 book titled "Verisimilitude." The book includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that authorities deemed a violation of a law that makes it illegal to defame, insult or threaten the crown. CNN has chosen not to repeat the language because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand. Mark Dean, a lawyer for Nicolaides, said he was released Friday and taken to the Australian embassy in Bangkok, where he stayed until leaving for Australia at about midnight. "He is obviously very relieved and grateful that the pardon was granted," Dean said. Nicolaides was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty last month. He faced a term of up to six years before the plea.  Watch shackled Nicolaides at court Â» . His lawyers then requested the pardon. King Bhumibol Adulydej had pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past. Dean said Nicolaides was deported from Thailand, but that he did not know of any other stipulations related to the pardon. In an interview with CNN International, Dean avoided repeating what Nicolaides wrote, but said the passage was presented as a rumor, not a fact. "This is probably not the best time to repeat the passage that was found to be offensive," Dean said. "But it concerned the crown prince of Thailand and a rumor that was being circulated in Thailand about the crown prince." Nicolaides had been living in Thailand since 2003, lecturing at two universities about tourism. He was about to leave Thailand when he was arrested on August 31. It is not clear why the authorities waited three years after the publication of his book to bring charges against him. Fifty copies of the book were published, and only seven were sold. Thailand's king is highly revered in the Buddhist nation. But even he has said in the past that he can be criticized. Thailand's prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, also has told CNN he is concerned about what he called misuse of the law. Still, other cases of violating the law are pending before the Thai Criminal Court, involving both Thais and foreigners.

chatgpt: Harry Nicolaides, a 41-year-old Australian writer, made headlines when he was arrested in August 2008 over his 2005 book, which mentions the king and the crown prince. The authorities deemed a paragraph included in the book as a violation of a law that makes it illegal to insult the Thai monarchy. The law, which mandates jail sentences of up to fifteen years for violations, has been a subject of controversy and criticism for its use in stifling freedom of expression. Nicolaides, who lived in Thailand for several years, had previously taught political science at a local university. His book, titled "Verisimilitude," was a novel that received little attention upon its initial publication. However, the authorities took offense to a particular paragraph in the book where the fictional Kingdom of "Suvannabhumi" is described as being ruled by a king who "is not revered by everyone." The authorities interpreted this as an insult to the Thai monarchy, prompting them to arrest Nicolaides, who had already left the country, upon his return in August 2008. He was detained without bail for several months and had to endure horrendous conditions in a Thai prison. His case drew widespread international attention and condemnation, with many human rights organizations calling for his release. In 2009, Nicolaides was convicted of the offense and sentenced to three years in jail. However, due to his guilty plea and cooperation with the authorities, his sentence was reduced to six months. He served his time and was finally released, but his life was forever changed by the experience. After his release, Nicolaides was finally able to leave Thailand and return to his home country of Australia, where he was greeted by his family and supporters. His lawyer stated that he was relieved to be able to leave Thailand and put the whole ordeal behind him. However, he also suffered significant physical and emotional scars from his time in prison. Many have criticized the Thai monarchy's strict laws regarding disrespect and insult as being overly harsh and severe. They believe that these laws are used to silence dissent and criticism, thereby stifling freedom of expression and the press. Nicolaides' case is just one example of how these laws have been used to punish those who speak out against the monarchy. In conclusion, Harry Nicolaides' ordeal serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of censorship and repression of free speech. It is a stark reminder that the fight for freedom of expression and the press is ongoing and that we must remain vigilant in protecting these fundamental human rights.
