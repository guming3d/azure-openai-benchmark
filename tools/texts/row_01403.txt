article: By . Chris Hastings . and Peter Henn . A manhole cover designed by Antony Gormley, one of Britain’s most celebrated sculptors, has been stolen after being praised in a blog. Gormley, 63, who is best known for his Angel of the North statue, created the distinctive cover for a street in Peckham, South London, where it remained for a decade. But the iron plate, designed around the artist’s feet, was stolen after a blogger gave details of where it was. Ian Mansfield, 44, included a picture of the cover and went on to describe how he felt standing on it. One-in-a-million: The Antony Gormley manhole cover before it was stolen . After: The replacement that was placed in the hole after the theft . Writing on his IanVisits blog, Mr Mansfield, who lives in London’s Docklands, said: ‘On a small side street in deepest Peckham, without notice or warning, can be found a piece of Antony Gormley art work. Hundreds of cars drive over it every day.’ He added: ‘You can find the spot for deep contemplation on the junction between Maxted Road and Sandison Street.’ It is not clear whether the thief read the blog but several people have posted complaints questioning the wisdom of drawing attention to its location. One wrote: ‘Nice work telling everyone exactly where it was with such a detailed map. I hope you are pleased with yourself.’ Fame: Antony Gormley working on some his sculptures at his studio . Another described Mr Mansfield as a ‘dumbo’ and urged him to use some common sense in future. A spokesman for Thames Water, which commissioned Gormley  to create the piece, said: ‘We’re appalled Antony’s manhole cover has been stolen. We’ve since gone out and put a new bog-standard cover down, but his was one-in-a-million – in fact, more than one-in-a-million, as we have 1.2 million manhole covers across our region.’ He added: ‘We’re determined to track down whoever did this and get back what is ours.’ Mr Gormley declined to comment last night.

chatgpt: Renowned artist Antony Gormley, 63, has recently created the latest addition to Peckham's vibrant street art scene. However, the artwork’s location had remained a mystery until Ian Mansfield, 44, discovered it and posted the details on his popular IanVisits blog. The sculpture, which covers the entire length of the street, features several metal human figures, each standing in a different pose. Gormley is known for his thought-provoking sculptures, including one of the Angel of the North. However, it seems that not everyone is a fan of the latest addition to Peckham's street art. Thames Water, which is responsible for the area's sewer network, has expressed their concerns about the sculpture. In a statement, a spokesperson for Thames Water said they were "determined" to track down the culprit who installed the artwork on top of one of their access points. The spokesperson went on to say that "tampering with our network like this is not only illegal, but it also poses a risk to the public and our engineers, who may need to access these points for maintenance or in the event of an emergency." They urged anyone with information about the installation to come forward and help them find the culprit responsible. The statement also emphasized that Thames Water is working closely with the local council and the police to resolve the issue. Gormley is no stranger to controversy with his public art installations. In 2008, his One and Other project featured members of the public taking turns to stand on the Fourth Plinth in London's Trafalgar Square. The project received mixed reviews, but Gormley defended it, stating that it was intended to challenge the idea of who is and isn't worthy of public representation. It remains to be seen whether the latest addition to Peckham's street art scene will remain in place or be removed by Thames Water. What is clear is that it has caused quite a stir, with opinions divided between those who see it as a beautiful addition to the area and those who are concerned about the potential safety risks.
