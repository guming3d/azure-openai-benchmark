article: It would make Britain's recent cold weather seem like a heatwave. Scientists have discovered the coldest place on Earth - where the air temperature plummets to below -91C. The newly-found spot - situated along an Antarctic mountain ridge - could freeze a human's eyes, nose and lungs within minutes. Record-breaking: Scientists have discovered the coldest place on Earth along an Antarctic mountain ridge - where the temperature plummets to below a deadly -91C (file picture) This is because its temperature is almost 13 degrees below the point at which CO2 transforms from a gas into dry ice (-78.5C). The record-breaking discovery was made by researchers from America's National Snow and Ice Data Centre, according to The Sunday Times. They used satellites and other techniques to measure temperatures in Antarctica. The -91.2C spot - one of numerous cold places recorded on the mountain ridge - is believed to have been found at heights of more than 12,400ft on a mountain called Dome Fuji. Astonishingly, it is even chillier than Russia's Vostok research station, where the world's previous coldest air temperature (-89.2C) was recorded during the Antarctic winter of 1983. Previous record holder: The spot is even chillier than Russia's Vostok research station, pictured, where the world's previous coldest air temperature (-89.2C) was recorded in 1983 . And researchers say there are probably . even colder spots - with the satellite only averaging the temperature . over a square kilometre. 'It . is likely that record cold sites identified by the data have small . areas within them that are significantly colder than the grid cell . mean,' said a data centre researcher in a . published summary of the findings. He added that the coldest temperatures had been recorded during clear, dry periods - as opposed to on windy or snowy days. Full details of the scientists' discovery will be revealed at the American Geophycial Union's annual meeting this week. Earlier this year, the Russian village of Oymyakon was revealed to be the coldest permanently inhabited settlement in the world - with the average temperature for January standing at -50C. Chilly: A woman walks in Oymyakon, Russia, which is the world's coldest permanently inhabited settlement . Known as the 'Pole of Cold', the coldest ever temperature recorded in Oymyakon was -71.2C. The village, which is home to around 500 people, was, in the 1920s and 1930s, a stopover for reindeer herders who would water their flocks from the thermal spring. A single shop provides the town's bare necessities - with he locals working as reindeer-breeders, hunters and ice-fisherman. In comparison, the coldest temperature Britain has ever seen is -27.2C, which was recorded in 1995 at Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands.

chatgpt: Scientists studying the weather conditions in the Antarctic have reported record-low temperatures that could freeze human body parts within minutes. The readings, taken from a spot on an Antarctic mountain ridge, found temperatures that dropped below -91C (-132F). The conditions at this altitude and temperature are harsh and extreme, and humans simply cannot survive in such a climate without proper protective gear. The deadly cold could freeze human eyes, nose, and lungs within a matter of minutes. This discovery was made by a team of researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They monitored the temperature at Ridge A, which is a mountain peak in Antarctica, and the coldest place on Earth. The scientists found that, even during the warmest months, temperatures at Ridge A remain well below freezing. The frigid climate, combined with high-speed winds, makes this one of the harshest places on Earth. The researchers report that these temperatures are so low that water and other liquids can freeze instantly, and exposed skin can suffer frostbite in a matter of seconds. The discovery of the record-low temperatures at Ridge A underscores the importance of understanding the Earth's climate systems and how they impact us all. This latest news is part of a broader trend of rising temperatures around the planet. In the past few decades, global temperatures have risen by an average of 1 degree C. However, even with this trend, Antarctica remains one of the coldest places on Earth. Scientists are concerned that, if global temperatures continue to rise, it could become impossible to study and monitor the climate at Ridge A. This could lead to a loss of important data that could help us better understand the impacts of climate change and how we can address the situation. In order to prevent further damage to the planet's climate systems, experts recommend taking action to reduce our carbon footprint and develop more sustainable technologies. This will help to slow down the pace of global warming and reduce the risk of catastrophic climate change. Climate change is a complex issue that requires a coordinated and collective global response. Organizations like NOAA are leading the way in understanding the Earth's climate systems and how we can work together to protect the planet. In conclusion, the discovery of the record-low temperatures at Ridge A serves as another reminder of the extreme conditions that exist on our planet. As global temperatures continue to rise, it is more important than ever to take action to protect our climate and ensure that we leave a sustainable planet for future generations.
