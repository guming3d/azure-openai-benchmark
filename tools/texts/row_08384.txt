The Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it approved a nerve-stimulating headband as the first medical device to prevent migraine headaches. Agency officials said the device, priced at $249.99 at Costco, provides a new option for patients who cannot tolerate migraine medications. The Cefaly device is a battery-powered plastic band worn across the forehead. A headband delivering electrical nerve stimulation can prevent onset of migraine headache . The device is battery-powered and worn around the head, with the actual TENS stimulator centered on the forehead just above the eye . Using an adhesive electrode, the band emits a low electrical current to stimulate nerves associated with migraine pain. Users may feel a tingling sensation on the skin where the electrode is applied. The device is designed to be used no more than 20 minutes a day by patients 18 years and older. A 67-person study reviewed by the FDA showed patients using the device experienced fewer migraines per month than patients using a placebo device. The Cefaly headband did not completely eliminate migraine headaches or reduce the intensity of migraines that occurred. According to the FDA a migraine is defined as 'intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head, accompanied by nausea or vomiting and sensitivity to light or sound.' About 53 percent of 2,313 patients in a separate study said they were satisfied with the device and were willing to purchase it for future use. No serious adverse events were connected with the device. The most common complaint was not wanting to use the device because users 'didn't like the feeling.' Some people reported feeling sleepy during the treatment and some had a headache after. Cephaly is manufactured by Cephaly Technology of Belgium.

chatgpt: A new device is offering migraine sufferers a potentially effective treatment option. The Cefaly device is a battery-powered plastic band that is worn across the forehead, and is now available at Costco for $249.99. The device works by emitting a low electrical current through an adhesive electrode that is placed on the skin. The current stimulates the nerves that are associated with migraine pain, with users generally feeling a tingling sensation where the electrode is attached. Migraines affect millions of people around the world, and can have a significant impact on quality of life. Symptoms can include severe head pain, nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and noise, among others. While there are currently a range of treatments available, including medication and lifestyle modifications, they are not always effective for all sufferers. The Cefaly device was created as an alternative treatment option for migraine sufferers, and has been shown to be effective in clinical trials. According to a study published in the journal Headache, nearly half of study participants reported a significant reduction in the frequency of their migraines after using the device for 20 minutes each day for three months. While the device does not work for everyone, many people have found relief from their migraine symptoms through its use. Additionally, unlike many migraine medications, it does not have significant side effects and does not require regular dosing. The availability of the Cefaly device at Costco provides an affordable and accessible treatment option for migraine sufferers. While it is always recommended that sufferers speak with their doctor about any potential new treatments, the device may offer an effective solution for those who have not found relief through other means. It is important to note that the Cefaly device is not a cure for migraines, but rather an additional treatment option. Sufferers should continue to work with their healthcare providers to find the best treatment approach for their individual needs. However, for many people, the Cefaly device offers a promising new avenue for easing the burden of chronic migraine pain.
