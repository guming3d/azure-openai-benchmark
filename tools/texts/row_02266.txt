article: On trial: Jessica Cruz, pictured upon her arrest aged 19, is charged with murdering her newborn son . A woman accused of murdering her newborn son has admitted to wrapping the baby in a plastic bag and dumping him in a trash can. Jessica Cruz, of Streamwood, Illinois, is pleading not guilty to the murder of her baby boy in a Salvation Army store in 2011. Cruz, who was 19 at the time, told police she panicked after giving birth in the shop's bathroom because her mother, from whom she had been hiding her pregnancy, was waiting outside. Employees at the Salvation Army store in Streamwood found the 6lbs 11oz baby dead in the trash, wrapped in a plastic bag. A videotape where Cruz admits killing the baby was played to the jury in Cook County's Rolling Meadows branch court on Wednesday. During the hour-long interview filmed shortly after her 2011 arrest, Cruz repeatedly mentions the fear of her mother finding out about the pregnancy. When a policeman asks Cruz if the baby was still alive when it was born, she replies 'I think so'. When asked if she took the boy's life, she replies, 'Yes, but I don't remember tying him up like that.' Assistant Public Defender Dan Naranjo told the court earlier that the baby because it was stillborn, the Chicago Tribune reported. Cruz walked into the Salvation Army store around 10am on November 4, 2011, and asked to use the bathroom. Witnesses said they saw Cruz leaving the bathroom covered in blood about an hour after she walked in. The cause of death of the baby boy was ruled as homicide by strangulation. It is believed the boy suffered a neck haemorrhage. Cruz told police she had not told anyone she was pregnant except for the boy's father, even though she lived with her mother through the pregnancy.

chatgpt: A harrowing case of alleged infanticide came to court this week, as 29-year-old Jessica Cruz stood trial for the murder of her newborn baby boy in 2011. The allegations go that Cruz gave birth in a charity shop toilet, shortly after her nineteenth birthday, and proceeded to strangle the baby before disposing of him in a nearby bin. The charity shop staff discovered the baby's dead body wrapped in a plastic bag in the trash can outside the store, and contacted the police. The investigation quickly led to Cruz, who was arrested on suspicion of murder. She has maintained her innocence throughout the trial, and her plea is officially recorded as not guilty. The prosecution's case rests on various pieces of evidence that they claim demonstrate Cruz's guilt. These include the fact that she was the only person in the vicinity of the charity shop at the time the baby was killed, as well as DNA samples taken from the child that suggest he was Cruz's son. Additionally, the prosecution allege that Cruz was seen on CCTV leaving the shop shortly after the murder, and that she was in possession of a bag that they claim was used to transport the baby's body to the trash can. Cruz's defense, meanwhile, argue that the prosecution have failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Cruz was responsible for the baby's death. They pointed out that the DNA evidence does not conclusively prove that the baby was Cruz's, and that there is no direct evidence linking her to the crime. Furthermore, they claim that the CCTV footage is unclear and could in fact be of someone else entirely. The court has heard from witnesses on both sides, including the shop staff who discovered the baby's body and the police officers who conducted the investigation. It has also heard from medical experts who have given evidence on the circumstances surrounding the baby's death, including the likelihood of suffocation and the time frame in which it occurred. The trial has been a difficult and emotional process for all involved, with many people expressing their horror at the alleged crime. The judge has reminded the jury on multiple occasions that they must remain impartial and base their decision solely on the evidence presented to them. Whatever the outcome of the trial, it is clear that the case has highlighted the importance of supporting vulnerable young mothers and ensuring that they have access to the help that they need. The tragedy of this case is a stark reminder of what can happen when support and resources are not available to those who need them most.
