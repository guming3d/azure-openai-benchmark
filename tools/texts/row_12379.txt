article: (CNN)The world's richest club Real Madrid has come out fighting over football's world governing body's investigation into the club's youth transfer policy. Barcelona has already been hit with a transfer ban after breaching regulations when signing young players, but rival Real insists it has complied fully with FIFA's rules when conducting its own under-age deals. Real said it has shown "extraordinary diligence" during the transfer and registration of the 51 cases of foreign minors that are being investigated. The Spanish club issued a lengthy statement confirming the governing body's request for documents relating to the various deals taking place over the last five years, though it did not name any of the players. "Real Madrid defends the protection and the correct and healthy development of minors via its strict adherence, without exceptions, to the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, and is in complete agreement with such investigations being carried out to this end," the statement read. Article 19 of FIFA's regulations prohibits the transfer of players under the age of 18, unless they meet one of three qualifying criteria. Under-age players can move to a club in a different country if their parents move there for non-footballing reasons, if they are from another nation within the European Union or European Economic Area and aged between 16 and 18, or if they live within 100km of the club. Real provided explanations for each of the 51 cases, stating that the majority of players were exempt from regulations for various different reasons. Among the exemptions it provided were that 10 players were Spanish nationals, 23 foreign players had previously been registered with other Spanish clubs, six players were 18 or over at the time of their registration, two players had never belonged to Madrid and one player appeared twice on FIFA's list. Real also offered up further explanations for the remaining nine cases. "Real Madrid has responded diligently, supplying all the information required by the Committee within the established deadlines and in complete documentary detail," added the Real statement. "Both Real Madrid and the RFEF [Royal Spanish Football Federation], through which the informative investigation is being processed, have been left totally satisfied with the information supplied and have verified the strict adherence to the registration regulations in absolutely every case." Madrid director Emilio Butragueno had earlier confirmed Monday that FIFA is investigating the club, but is confident there is nothing to worry about. "We are in agreement with FIFA in this matter and we will continue collaborating with them in everything that is asked of us," he told reporters. "We are absolutely calm about how Real Madrid has proceeded." Madrid, who sit top of the Spanish La Liga, completed the signing last week of 16-year-old Norway international Martin Odegaard from Norwegian club Stromsgodset.

The Spanish soccer club has maintained that it has complied fully with the governing body’s rules and regulations. Madrid has given explanations to FIFA for each of the cases being investigated. The transfer of young players is always a sensitive issue, and FIFA has strict regulations to ensure that minors are not exploited in the transfer process. The governing body has been keeping a close eye on clubs and their transfer dealings, especially when it comes to young players. In recent years, FIFA has levied heavy fines and transfer bans on several clubs found guilty of contravening the rules concerning the transfer of minors. Madrid’s statement that it has complied fully with FIFA rules comes as a relief to the club, especially as several of its rivals have been severely punished for similar offences. Some of the biggest clubs in Europe have been hit with transfer bans and hefty fines that have disrupted their squad building plans. The investigations into Madrid’s transfer dealings are likely to be rigorous, and the club’s officials will have to provide detailed explanations and documentation to prove their innocence. The club is already working closely with FIFA to ensure that the investigations are carried out thoroughly and transparently. Any breaches of the rules could result in Madrid being banned from signing players for a set period. The club’s reputation is at stake, and Madrid is keen to stress that it has done nothing wrong. The case could have far-reaching implications for the club, including financial penalties and damage to its global brand. The club’s supporters will be watching the case closely, and will be hoping that the investigations do not derail the club’s progress. In recent years, Madrid has been one of the most successful clubs in Europe, winning several domestic and international titles. The club has also been known for bringing in some of the most talented young players from around the world. The club’s youth academy is also renowned for producing some of the best young players in Spain, and many of them have gone on to become world-class stars. Madrid’s management will be hoping that the investigations do not have a negative impact on the club’s youth academy or its reputation as a club that values the development of young talent. The club will be hoping that the investigations are concluded as quickly as possible so that it can continue to focus on building a strong squad that can compete at the highest level. In conclusion, Madrid’s statement that it has complied fully with FIFA rules regarding under-age transfers provides some relief for the club. The investigations into its transfer dealings are expected to be thorough, and the club’s officials will need to provide detailed explanations to prove their innocence.
