Iraqi police clear pedestrians off a street after a suicide bomber detonated explosives inside a restaurant in Baghdad al-Jadida, east of the capital .

The interior ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan said he did not believe the blasts were linked to the decision to lift the curfew.

chatgpt: A deadly wave of terrorist attacks hit the Iraqi capital city of Baghdad over the weekend, leaving at least 22 people dead and dozens more injured. On Saturday morning, a suicide bomber detonated himself on a crowded shop-lined street, killing twelve innocent civilians in the process. Shortly after the initial explosion, two more explosives went off at the nearby Shorja market, resulting in the deaths of ten more people. The bombings happened just hours before the end of the city's daily curfew period, which is intended to restrict the movement of individuals during times of heightened security risks. No one has taken responsibility for the attacks, which left a further 55 people injured. Witnesses at the scene reported hearing a deafening blast and seeing plumes of smoke rising from the site of the first explosion. Those injured in the attack were taken to nearby hospitals for immediate medical care. Speaking after the incident, a senior police officer noted that the bombings appeared to be the work of individuals affiliated with extremist groups operating in the country. He confirmed that investigations were ongoing but appealed for witnesses to come forward with any information that may be helpful in identifying the perpetrators. The latest surge of violence in Iraq serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing security challenges which continue to plague the country. While ISIS has been defeated militarily, the group continues to carry out sporadic acts of violence and terrorism in urban areas such as Baghdad. The government has embarked on a comprehensive security strategy aimed at thwarting such attacks, but critics point out that the underlying security situation remains precarious. The international community has condemned the attacks and called on the Iraqi government to intensify efforts aimed at ensuring the safety and security of its citizens. President of Iraq Barham Salih has stated that the country must continue to combat extremist forces that threaten social stability and development, adding that the government must remain committed to protecting all Iraqis. The citizens of Iraq deserve a future that is free of violence, and it is up to the international community to support the country in its efforts to achieve peace and stability.
