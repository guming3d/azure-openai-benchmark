The video has sparked a lot of conversation online, with many condemning the actions of the two individuals. Subway riders have expressed their concerns about the safety risks of pulling a stunt like this in a public place, not only for the stunt performers themselves but also for the safety of other commuters.  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which oversees the city's subway system, has released a statement condemning the incident and warning others against copying such dangerous things. The statement said, "We strongly discourage anyone from attempting anything like this. Not only is it illegal, but it is also extremely dangerous and can cause major disruption to the subway service." It's unclear from the video whether the individuals were arrested for their actions, but the MTA has said that they are investigating the incident. Since the video was posted, several other copycat videos have emerged, prompting a reminder from the subway officials to the public to not attempt such dangerous stunts on subway tracks. The MTA has released a statement urging subway riders to enforce safety rules and report any suspicious activity on the subway. Other subway riders have been advised to keep an eye out for anything suspicious and report their concerns to the authorities immediately.
