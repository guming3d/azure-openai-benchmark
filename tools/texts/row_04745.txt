chatgpt: Lupo, a service dog with the Vancouver Police Canine Unit, has been credited with the capture of escaped prisoner Adam Harlock. Harlock was on the run after being sentenced to three and a half years in prison for drug-related offenses in Calgary.  According to reports, Lupo was part of a team of officers who searched a house in East Vancouver where Harlock was believed to be hiding. Using his highly-trained sense of smell, Lupo led officers to a couch in the living room of the house.  After searching the couch, officers removed the base fabric and found Harlock hidden in a cavity. He was immediately arrested and is now being returned to Alberta to serve his prison sentence.  The Vancouver Police Department has praised Lupo for his crucial role in Harlock's capture. "Our police dogs are highly trained and play a vital role in assisting our officers with their work," said a spokesperson. "Lupo is a valued member of our team and we are proud of his efforts in this case." Harlock's escape had been a cause for concern for law enforcement officials, who had been keeping a close eye on his whereabouts. However, with the help of Lupo, he was quickly located and apprehended. This is not the first time that Lupo has been involved in a successful operation. He has previously helped to locate drugs, weapons and explosives, and has been involved in missing persons searches. The Vancouver Police Department has emphasized the importance of service dogs like Lupo in fighting crime and maintaining public safety. "Our canine units are an essential part of our police force and we are grateful for their service," said a spokesperson. "They truly are man's best friend."
