article: An Afghan man employed by the U.S. government opened fire inside a CIA office in Kabul, killing an American and injuring a second. In the second major breach of embassy security in Kabul, Afghanistan, in two weeks, the attacker was himself shot dead and the injured U.S. citizen was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. It was unclear if the U.S. citizens were victims of a rogue employee acting for insurgents or the escalation of an argument between the three. Security breach: A U.S. citizen was killed and another injured after an Afghan employee in a CIA office in Kabul opened fire last night . U.S. embassy spokesman Gavin Sundwall said: 'There was a shooting incident at an annex of the U.S. embassy in Kabul last night involving an Afghan employee who was killed. 'The motivation for the attack is still under investigation at this time.' He added that the Afghan employee was not authorised to carry a weapon and it was unknown how he had been able to get a gun into the secured compound. The shooting happened at the Ariana hotel, just a few blocks away from the Presidential Palace and the U.S. embassy, and used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a Kabul base. Kabul police chief Ayub Salangi said there had been an exchange of fire at the hotel, which he described as an 'office' for the CIA. High alert: Afghan policemen fire at a building taken over by insurgents in Kabul earlier this month. The U.S. government blamed the Haqqani network for the attack, which saw rockets fired at the U.S. embassy . The hotel has been closed off and heavily guarded since the fall of the Taliban government in late 2001. Perhaps because of its proximity to the Presidential Palace, it was used by ruling regimes for years before that. The attack comes in the same month insurgents took over an unfinished high-rise building near the city's heavily guarded military, political and diplomatic heart and showered rockets down on the U.S. embassy and NATO headquarters. That attack lasted 20 hours, and the U.S. has blamed it on the Haqqani network of militants, who were long based in Pakistan's lawless frontier regions. Washington accused Pakistan's spy service the ISI of offering them support. But senior Pakistani officials have hit back at the allegations, accusing the U.S. of trying to make Pakistan a scapegoat for its troubled war in Afghanistan. The U.S. has given Pakistan billions of dollars in military and economic aid, but the relationship has been riven by mistrust.

chatgpt: The security breach at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, continues to raise concerns after another fatal attack took place inside the secure compound. This is the second breach in security in just two weeks, and authorities are still investigating how an Afghan employee was able to bring a weapon inside the compound. Details about the attack are still scarce, but sources indicate that the employee opened fire, killing one U.S. citizen and injuring another before being killed by embassy security. The victims' identities have not been released, and the motive for the attack remains unknown. This is the second deadly attack at the embassy in just two weeks, prompting embassy officials to review their security protocols and procedures. The first attack occurred on September 6th, when a rocket struck the compound's perimeter, causing minor damage and injuring several individuals. While embassy officials have not commented publicly on the security situation, sources report that they are taking steps to ensure the safety of embassy personnel and visitors. Embassy staff has been advised to stay inside the compound, and the embassy's social media accounts have been silent since the attack. The security breach has raised concerns about the safety of U.S. citizens and embassy staff in Afghanistan, where security remains a primary concern. Afghanistan is still facing security challenges, including Taliban attacks, an insurgency in the country's east, and ongoing violence between different ethnic groups. The recent attacks at the U.S. Embassy have highlighted the difficulties of providing security in an environment where the U.S. is increasingly withdrawing its military and diplomatic personnel. The Embassy had already experienced a partial evacuation of staff following the Taliban's capture of the city of Kunduz in 2015. Despite ongoing security challenges, the U.S. government remains committed to its diplomatic mission in Afghanistan. In a statement released following the most recent attack, the embassy reiterated its commitment to "continue to work with the government and people of Afghanistan to build a more peaceful and prosperous future for all." The latest security breach at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, has once again highlighted the challenges and risks facing U.S. personnel in the region. The U.S. government has vowed to continue its work in Afghanistan but must also take steps to ensure the safety of its citizens and embassy staff in the face of ongoing security threats.
