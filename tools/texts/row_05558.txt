article: (CNN) -- Here is a look at what you need to know about the solstice. Summer solstice will take place on June 21, 2013. Summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs on June 20, 21, or 22, when the sun reaches its most northerly point, directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer (23 degrees 27 minutes north latitude). The summer solstice is the longest day of the year and marks the beginning of summer. Winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs on December 21 or 22, when the sun appears at its most southerly position,directly overhead at the Tropic of Capricorn (23 degrees 27 minutes south latitude). The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year and marks the beginning of winter. It is the exact opposite in the Southern Hemisphere. A solstice is different from an equinox, the two times each year when the sun is directly above the Earth's equator and day and night are of equal length. Equinoxes mark the beginning of spring (March) and fall (September). Solstice loosely translated in Latin is "sun stands still". For several days before and after each solstice the sun appears to stand still in the sky, i.e., its noontime elevation does not seem to change from day to day. Historically, the solstice has been celebrated by numerous cultures around the world. Thousands of people annually celebrate the summer solstice at Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England. At sunrise at Stonehenge on the longest day of the year, the rising sun appears behind one of the main stones, creating the illusion that the sun is balancing on the stone. The site was closed for 16 years after rioting broke out between police and revelers for several years at solstice gatherings. Stonehenge was re-opened to the public on Solstice in 2000.

chatgpt: The earth is constantly moving, revolving around the sun and rotating on its axis. These movements bring about significant astronomical events, and one of them is the solstice. The solstice occurs twice every year when the earth's tilt on its axis is either leaning towards or away from the sun, resulting in the longest and shortest days of the year. On June 21, 2013, at precisely 5:04 am UT, the Northern Hemisphere will experience its summer solstice. During this solstice, the sun will reach its highest point in the sky, resulting in the longest day and shortest night of the year. It is a time of celebration and jubilation as people mark the beginning of summer and enjoy the long hours of daylight. However, it is not just the Northern Hemisphere that experiences solstice. Come December 21, 2013, at exactly 5:11 pm UT, the Northern Hemisphere will experience its winter solstice. During this solstice, the earth's tilt on its axis will be leaning away from the sun, resulting in the shortest day and longest night of the year. For many, it is a time for reflection and being indoors. Both solstices mark significant events in the astronomical calendar, and people around the world celebrate them in different ways. In many cultures, the summer solstice is marked with bonfires, dancing, and feasting. Some even have a tradition of staying up all night to welcome the sunrise. On the other hand, the winter solstice is observed with quiet introspection, lighting candles, and being with loved ones. As the solstice marks significant astronomical events, scientists and astronomers also take note of the solstices, studying them and using the data gathered to understand the earth's movements better. It is a time of wonder and discovery as people are reminded of the marvels of our universe. As we approach the two solstices in 2013, let us take time to appreciate the changes that they bring and the celebrations that come with them. Whether we are welcoming the warmth of summer or seeking the coziness of winter, the solstice is a humbling reminder of how our earth is constantly in motion, and we are just a small part of it.
