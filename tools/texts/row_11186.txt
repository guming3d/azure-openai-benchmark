An Oxford University rugby club is to be disciplined after an invite for a party told players to pick a 'fresher of their choice' and spike their drinks. The crude claim was made in an email sent by a committee member from Pembroke College Rugby team announcing a ‘Crew Date’ with a female society. Club secretary Woo Kim encouraged players to choose a female student as their date and then spike their wine with a 'substance' of their choice.

The fifty recipients of the vulgar invitation were told the 'substance' could be 'anything you like' and also urged members to 'bring a positive pregnancy test'. The players were also asked to bring two bottles of wine with them, one for themselves and one for their 'guests'. The evening was due to take place on Thursday but it was cancelled after angry protests.

Dr Clive Siviour, Dean of Pembroke College, said: 'The content of this e-mail is completely unacceptable, and I am taking the appropriate action on behalf of the College authorities. 'These actions of a small number of students have been met with universal condemnation from their peers.' Mr Kim, a second-year history and economics student, has been forced to step down from the club’s committee. The shamed team have also been made to sit through a sexual consent discussion forum with college chiefs.

'They represent an ugly, corrosive form of misogyny that simply shouldn’t be tolerated in any level of society, and that can’t just be dismissed as yet another supposedly harmless juvenile ‘joke’.' Oxford feminist campaigner Lottie Sykes said: 'This email is another example of the sinister misogyny that encourages targeting younger female students through college crew dates.' The controversial email came after the Pembroke rugby club declined an invitation to a Good Lad campaign workshop run by Oxford University Rugby Club to promote 'positive masculinity.' A spokesman for Pembroke rugby club said: 'We accept that the emails circulated earlier this week about our proposed Crew Date were entirely misguided and represent a serious case of poor judgement. 'We would like to clarify that the “challenge” proposed in advance of the intended Crew Date was intended to be a harmless drinking game joke, and was in no way intended to mean that the team member should lace their dates’ drinks with anything illegal and/or to engage in any sexual abuse.'

chatgpt: A team from Pembroke College at the University of Cambridge is under investigation after sending a crude email to fifty players. The email was sent as part of a 'Crew Date' event with another female society. Along with the invitation, players were asked to bring a positive pregnancy test and two bottles of wine. The offensive email has caused outrage, with many condemning the behaviour of the Pembroke College team. The Dean of the college has released a statement, describing the behaviour as "unacceptable" and stating that an investigation is underway. The incident has also brought attention to the issue of sexism in university cultures, particularly in male-dominated sports teams. The 'Crew Date' event was intended to be a social gathering between two college sports teams. However, the inclusion of the offensive request has overshadowed the event and drawn criticism from both students and staff members at Pembroke College. The inclusion of the request for a positive pregnancy test has been seen as particularly offensive, as it trivializes a serious issue. The incident highlights the ongoing problem of sexism in university cultures, particularly those within male-dominated sports teams. Such teams are often criticized for fostering a culture of sexism and misogyny. This has prompted some universities to take action, such as creating codes of conduct for sports teams and conducting workshops on sexual harassment and consent. However, there is still a long way to go in combating sexism in university cultures. The incident at Pembroke College is just one example of this wider problem. It also highlights the need for greater accountability and consequences for those who engage in such behaviour. The Dean of Pembroke College has stated that the investigation will be thorough and that appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that such behavior does not happen again. This is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to create a culture where such behavior is not acceptable in the first place. The incident has also sparked a wider discussion about the role of universities in promoting equality and combatting discrimination. Many argue that universities have a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive environment for all students, and that they should be held accountable when this responsibility is not met. In recent years, there has been growing awareness of the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses. This has led to calls for stronger policies and measures to prevent and respond to such incidents. The incident at Pembroke College is just the latest example of the need for greater action on this issue. In conclusion, the incident at Pembroke College has drawn attention to the ongoing problem of sexism in university cultures. The offensive email sent by the sports team highlights the need for greater accountability and consequences for those who engage in such behavior. It also highlights the wider role that universities have in promoting equality and combatting discrimination. As the investigation continues, it is hoped that the incident will lead to positive change and a renewed commitment to creating safe and inclusive environments for all students.
