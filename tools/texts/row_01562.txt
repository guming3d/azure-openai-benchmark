Prized: Gangs will seek out England fans, because they believe they will be carrying the most money on them, as well as expensive items such as smartphones and cameras . Sao Paulo, where the team will play its opening match against Uruguay on June 19, is already one of the most dangerous cities on the planet. More than 100 violent murders are carried out every month, and this September alone there were nearly 11,000 armed robberies. More than 60,000 street robberies have taken place in the city, which has a population of 27million people, this year, and more than 360 people have been killed during hold-ups.

The boss of one gang, operating out of a shack just yards from opening ceremony venue the Corinthians Arena, said he expected to make around 100,000 reals, worth roughly Â£25,000, during the tournament. 'Every England fan who can afford to travel to Brazil is rich, in my view. I'm poor, so they'll all be richer than me,' he told the newspaper, brandishing a .38 calibre pistol. 'They'll be naive and easy to rob, much easier than people from Sao Paulo, who are used to having a gun pointing at them.' Crime: Brazilian police make arrests during a search for gang members . The man, who called himself Joao, said the tourists would also carry valuable items, such as cameras and phones, with them - unlike locals. He said that all criminals would need to do to find their victims is to look for those wearing England replica shirts, and that although fans would be safe once inside the stadium, they would have to use public transport or taxis to get there. 'I'm not interested in targeting the footballers, and we don't do kidnappings. But there are other groups who are planning these things,' said the 35-year-old from the Vida Loka gang. He added that there were criminals operating in the city who would 'do anything' to get money.

chatgpt: As the 2019 International Football Tournament kicks off, concerns are being raised about the safety of England supporters traveling to Brazil. Reports suggest that thugs are planning to specifically target England supporters, as they are seen as easy targets, with many likely to be carrying large sums of money. Sao Paulo, the city where England play their opening match, is known as one of the world's most dangerous cities, with more than 100 murders carried out each month. This worrying statistic has raised fears among football fans, with many concerned about their safety during the tournament. With an estimated 600,000 tourists expected to visit the city during the month-long tournament, authorities have been working tirelessly to ensure the safety of visitors. Security measures have been ramped up, with regular patrols of the city and increased monitoring of suspicious activity. Police have also issued warnings to visitors, urging them to be vigilant and to take extra precautions when out and about in the city. Advice includes carrying minimal cash, avoiding carrying valuables, and keeping a close eye on personal possessions. While it is hoped that these measures will be enough to prevent any major incidents, concerns remain high. The fact that Sao Paulo is a known hub for criminal activity, with gangs often seeking out tourists and foreigners as potential victims, only heightens these fears. Unfortunately, England supporters are seen as easy targets, as many are likely to be carrying cash, and their presence will be highly visible during the tournament. This has led many to urge visitors to stay in groups, to avoid venturing out alone, and to remain vigilant at all times. Despite these concerns, many England supporters remain determined to attend the tournament and show their support for their team. With Brazil known for its vibrant football culture, and with some of the world's best teams competing, for many, the tournament is the experience of a lifetime. While authorities are doing their utmost to ensure the safety of visitors, it is important that football fans take heed of the advice provided and remain vigilant at all times. With so much at stake, the last thing anyone wants is for the tournament to be marred by acts of crime and violence. As the countdown to the first match continues, all eyes will be on Sao Paulo, as football fans from around the world descend on the city in search of football glory. Let's hope that the authorities' efforts will be enough to ensure a safe and enjoyable tournament for all.
