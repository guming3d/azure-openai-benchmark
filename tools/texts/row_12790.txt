article: (CNN) -- AT&T has announced a plan that could see high-speed fiber Internet networks rolled out in as many as 100 cities in 21 metro regions throughout the United States. It's a move that puts the telecommunications company in a head-to-head battle with Google, which has begun its own charge to dramatically Increase internet speeds in various cities. The network, called AT&T U-verse With GigaPower, is able to deliver broadband at up to 1 gigabit per second. That's roughly 100 times faster than current speeds in many parts of the nation. The company plans to enter discussions with local leaders in areas it has identified as having suitable existing networks and likely high demand for the service. "This initiative continues AT&T's ongoing commitment to economic development in these communities, bringing jobs, advanced technologies and infrastructure," the company said in a news release. The metropolitan areas being considered are: Atlanta; Augusta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago; Cleveland; Fort Worth, Texas; Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Greensboro, North Carolina; Houston; Jacksonville, Florida; Kansas City, Kansas; Los Angeles; Miami; Nashville; Oakland, California; Orlando, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; San Diego; St. Louis; San Francisco, and San Jose. AT&T had already announced plans to install the high-speed network in Austin and Dallas, Texas, and says it is in "advanced discussions" with Raleigh-Durham and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It's worth emphasizing that none of this is a guarantee yet. More likely, it's AT&T publicly pointing out locations it thinks are good candidates for network upgrades. Google, meanwhile, first launched Google Fiber in 2012. That service also promises speeds of 1 gigabit per second, which the company says could allow someone at full capacity to download an entire feature-length movie in 38 seconds. Google has already brought the service to Kansas City, Kansas; and Provo, Utah and plans to roll out in Austin, Texas, by the end of this year. Google connects fiberoptic cables directly to a home or office in order to give users broadband Internet and television service. In Kansas City and Provo, Google's ultra-fast Internet service costs $70 a month for Internet, or $120 if you add streaming video. In February, Google said it's exploring plans to lay down the special cables in nine more metro areas: Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, San Antonio and San Jose. That includes 34 cities in those regions.

chatgpt: AT&T, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the US, has announced its plan to bring high-speed Internet to 21 major metropolitan areas. The company's new service, AT&T U-Verse with GigaPower, will offer speeds of up to one gigabit per second. These speeds are similar to Google Fiber, a competitor in the high-speed Internet arena. This announcement comes amid increasing demand for faster and more reliable Internet services, as more and more people and businesses rely on the Internet for their daily activities. AT&T's new service will provide customers with not only access to high-speed Internet, but also TV and phone services. The company plans to roll out the service gradually, starting with Dallas and Fort Worth, and expanding to 21 markets in the coming months.  “The cities announced today are among the largest metropolitan areas where we plan to bring faster Internet speeds over a fiber network”, said Lori Lee, senior executive vice president, AT&T Home Solutions. “We expect to launch in additional cities and to reach more than 14 million residential and commercial locations overall.” AT&T has been investing heavily in fiber-optic infrastructure, which enables faster download and upload speeds compared to traditional copper wires. The company's U-Verse with GigaPower service has already been deployed in a few select cities, including Austin and Kansas City. The service has received positive feedback from customers, most of whom have experienced a significant improvement in their Internet speed and reliability. With the rollout of its high-speed Internet service to major metropolitan areas, AT&T is poised to compete head-to-head with Google Fiber, which currently offers Internet speeds of up to one gigabit per second in several cities across the US. Google Fiber's service has been popular, but has rollout challenges. While its availability is limited, and the company has faced challenges in terms of permitting, deployment and significant cost of implementation. Despite the challenges, AT&T's plans to bring high-speed Internet to more than 14 million locations is a clear indication of the company's dedication to expanding its services and competing in the market. With the increasing demand for faster and more reliable Internet services, the competition between AT&T and Google Fiber is likely to intensify in the coming years. As the rollout of AT&T's U-Verse with GigaPower service continues, many customers will eagerly await the opportunity to experience faster and more reliable Internet speeds, especially at a time when remote work and online communication is now the norm. The company’s commitment to fiber-optic infrastructure is a significant move forward in expanding high-speed internet access and may spur much-needed competition in the Internet service provider industry.
