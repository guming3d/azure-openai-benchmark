As the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries, and shipwrecks off its shores are common. Many of the migrants are from African nations, while others have fled war-torn Syria. More than 300 African migrants died in October after their ship sank off the island's shores. Days later, another 34 people died when their boat capsized. Tens of thousands of people are rescued each year from the Mediterranean, according to the European Union border agency, Frontex.

chatgpt: The Greek Coast Guard and the Italian Navy launched separate operations on Sunday to rescue more than 300 migrants trying to cross from Africa in overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean. In the first operation, the Greek Coast Guard rescued 85 migrants who were sailing on two separate boats off the coast of the island of Lesbos.  According to a statement from the Greek Coast Guard, the migrants were all in good health and were taken to a nearby port for processing. They are believed to have been attempting to reach Europe from Turkey.  In a separate operation, the Italian Navy rescued 233 migrants from a dangerously overcrowded boat in high seas. The navy said that the migrants were mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa and were found crammed into a single fishing boat. The navy also confirmed that some of the migrants were suffering from dehydration and hypothermia.  The migrants were then taken to a port on the Italian island of Sicily, where they will be processed and have their status assessed. The Italian authorities have recently stepped up their efforts to stop illegal migration, with the navy increasing its fleet of ships patrolling the waters around Sicily.  The Mediterranean remains a popular route for migrants from North Africa and the Middle East who are looking to reach Europe in search of a better life. Despite the dangers of the journey, tens of thousands continue to make the crossing each year, often paying large sums of money to smugglers to arrange their passage.  The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has reported that more than 1,500 migrants have died or disappeared while attempting to cross the Mediterranean in 2021 alone. The vast majority of the deaths have occurred on the more dangerous central Mediterranean route, which runs between Libya and Italy.  The UNHCR has called on European governments to increase their efforts to prevent further deaths, by improving search-and-rescue operations and providing safe and legal routes for migrants to reach Europe. However, some European governments have taken a hardline stance on migration, arguing that it encourages people to make the dangerous journey and fuels support for far-right political parties.  Despite the political divisions, charities and aid groups continue to provide vital support to migrants in transit, often braving hazardous conditions to reach those in need. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has estimated that more than 103,000 migrants have made the journey across the central Mediterranean in 2021, a significant increase over the same period in 2020.  As the migration crisis continues, the plight of those seeking refuge in Europe remains a pressing humanitarian concern. With no clear end in sight, many are calling for an urgent and coordinated international response to address the root causes of forced migration and provide safe and legal channels for those who need protection to reach a place of safety.
