Recovery: Tap dance champ Stephanie Still has bounced back from a devastating malignant brain tumour . A dancer who was told she may never walk again after being diagnosed with a rare malignant brain tumour, is now planning to strap on her tap dancing shoes. Stephanie Still, 21, has made remarkable progress, after undergoing a gruelling 10-hour operation and is now planning to dance at a charity fundraising event. Ms Still reached the semi-finals of Sky’s Got To Dance with her dance group Tap Attack last February. But she was diagnosed with a rare malignant brain tumour last May. A grade three ependymoma, it measured four and a half centimetres across and was removed in a 10 and a half hour operation days later. Ms Still, a dance and theatre performance student at Bird College in Sidcup, Kent, said: 'It was very big. 'They needed to get it out as soon as they could. If they didn’t, it would not have been long before it did something drastic.' Captain of the England team that finished second at the World Tap Championships in 2010, she said: . 'I was told I would probably never be able to dance again. That was like the end of my life.' Ms Still was diagnosed after suffering shooting pains in her neck and back for more than a year, which was dismissed by doctors as muscular and the result of strenuous dance routines. She said: 'It was uncomfortable, but the pain went so I carried on. But then it started to get so bad it made me cry, and I don’t cry easily.

Ms Still was referred to a neurologist, and the tumour was revealed in an MRI scan. She said: 'I was in shock. I didn’t have any neurological symptoms.' Following the operation to remove the tumour, Ms Still endured six weeks of intensive radiotherapy.

chatgpt: Stephanie Still, a contemporary dancer, earned a coveted spot in the semi-finals of the popular television show, Sky's 'Got To Dance', before discovering she had a rare malignant brain tumour. The 27-year-old underwent a challenging 10 and a half hour operation to have the tumour removed, but thankfully she has now recovered. Stephanie's journey towards the semi-finals of 'Got To Dance' was a brave one, as she had a foot injury throughout the auditions. Despite the circumstances, her skill as a contemporary dancer shone through, and the judges were quick to praise her. However, Stephanie's life took a drastic turn after she was diagnosed with a rare malignant brain tumour just two weeks after appearing in the television show. She described the diagnosis as "surreal," and revealed that at the time, she had no idea what this meant for her future. Stephanie's surgery was a gruelling process. She underwent a lengthy 10 and a half hour operation, where surgeons successfully removed the tumour from her brain. The procedure was not only physically challenging for Stephanie, but emotionally too, as she was forced to confront her own mortality. Despite the challenges she faced, Stephanie was determined to overcome this obstacle and began her recovery process. After just a few months, she returned to doing what she loves most - dancing. Stephanie recently shared her story on social media, revealing the difficulties of her journey and the strength she found within herself. "Going through something as scary as a brain tumour is one of the toughest and life-changing things you could ever go through. Doctors had to operate and remove the tumour, which meant I had to have a craniotomy done. The recovery process was hard, but my love for dancing helped me to push forward every day," she said. Stephanie's perseverance during her recovery process is nothing short of inspiring. She recently hosted a contemporary dance workshop, with all proceeds donated to the Brain Tumour Charity, an organisation close to her heart. Her story also highlights the importance of early detection and the need for continued funding into research for a cure. According to the Brain Tumour Charity, brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer, and yet just 1% of the national spend on cancer research is allocated to this disease. Stephanie's strength and grace both on and off the stage continue to inspire many. Her journey is a testament to the power of perseverance, and serves as a reminder to us all to never give up on our dreams.
