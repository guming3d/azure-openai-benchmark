article: If Boris bikes aren't enough exercise, a London design firm has proposed a new way for London commuters to get to work - by swimming. The 'Lidoline' would create a special commuter lane in Regent's Canal, which spans London. The idea, developed by design firm Y/N, has already won second prize in a prestigious contest organised by the Mayor of London, and the firm now hopes to attract funding to make the project a reality. The lidoline, created by design firm Y/N, would allow commuters to swim to work across London. During the winter a thin membrane would be placed along the route, allowing it to freeze easily and making it safe to ice skate one. 'We thought that another new open space was a little redundant - the . problem is those spaces are underused,' said David Lomax of Y/N Studios, . which developed the idea. 'We would create a network to link those areas together. 'The obvious thing was the Regents Canal - it runs through London, but is sporadically used, and is rarely used in its entirety. 'Creating a commuting network would allow people to reuse the canal, and they could be taken to work while highlighting underused places of London.' The idea came second to a scheme to  transform the disused . 'Mail Rail' tunnel under Oxford Street in London into an urban mushroom . garden lit at street level by sculptural glass-fibre mushrooms in a recent Landscape Institute/Mayor of . London/Garden Museum competition. The route would stretch from Little Venice to Limehouse Basin . Stations along the route could also be used as open air cinemas in the evening, the team behind the lidoline claim. The judging panel, which included Joshua David and Robert Hammond, . co-founders of New Yorkâ€™s High Line, Dr Penelope Curtis, Director of . Tate Britain, Mark Brearley, Head of Design for London, and leading . landscape architects Kim Wilkie and Jo Gibbons also selected a runner-up . and three highly commended designs from the 170 entries. However, the team behind the Lidoline said they are hopeful it could still happen. 'We would love to take it further if we can find the energy and the funding. 'It's sensibly ambitious, there are plans for a floating pool in US, and it would be great if we could even realise a short stretch of it.' Larger pools could also be created along the route to boost swimming across London. Grandstands and viewing areas could be built for swimming contests and cinema showings.

chatgpt: Residents and visitors of London might soon have a new way to enjoy the city's historic Regent's Canal, thanks to a proposed new project called Lidoline. If approved, this concept would allow people to travel along the canal, taking in the sights and sounds of the area from a unique perspective. The project is the brainchild of a group of architects, designers, and artists who want to make better use of the canal as a public space. They envision a series of small, box-like structures, or "stations," that would be placed along the canal at regular intervals. During the day, these stations would function as simple rest areas or picnic spots, offering shade and seating for visitors. However, in the evenings, the stations would be transformed into open-air cinemas. People could gather to watch films, live performances, or other cultural events, taking advantage of the canal's peaceful setting and pleasant atmosphere. The Lidoline project would require significant renovations to the canal itself, including the installation of new access points and pathways for visitors. However, the designers believe that the finished product would be well worth the effort. One potential benefit of the Lidoline project is that it would help to revitalize the canal and surrounding areas. In recent years, the Regent's Canal has struggled somewhat as a public space, with many sections becoming neglected or underutilized. By creating new attractions and points of interest along the canal, the Lidoline project could help to draw more people to the area, boosting business for local shops and restaurants. Moreover, the Lidoline project has the potential to be a year-round attraction, rather than just a summer pastime. During the winter months, the stations could be transformed into ice skating rinks or other winter sports venues, allowing people to enjoy the canal even in cold weather. Of course, there are still many hurdles that the Lidoline project must overcome before it becomes a reality. There are questions around funding, planning permission, and logistical challenges that must be addressed before the first station can be built. However, the project's designers hope that they can work with local authorities and community groups to turn their vision into a reality. Overall, the Lidoline project is an exciting and innovative concept that has the potential to bring new life and vibrancy to one of London's most historic and beloved public spaces. If all goes well, the canal might soon become a hub of activity for both locals and tourists alike.
