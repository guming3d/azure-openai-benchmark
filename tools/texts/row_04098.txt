chatgpt: Residents in Albion Towers, a tower block in Southampton, are dealing with a strange and unpleasant problem. They are baffled by a yellowish liquid that is seeping into their building, and that has a distinct smell of urine. According to locals, the problem has been going on for quite some time, and the council has been slow to deal with it. Some residents have resorted to leaving out buckets to catch the liquid, which they say smells like a zoo. They are concerned not only about the smell, but also about the potential health hazards of the liquid. They fear it could carry diseases or cause mold to grow in their homes. The council, however, has claimed that it is doing everything it can to rectify the problem. In a statement, a spokesperson for the council said: "We are aware of the issue at Albion Towers and are working to resolve it as quickly as possible. We have been investigating the cause of the problem and have identified some issues with the plumbing that we are working to fix. We understand the frustration of the residents and are doing everything in our power to ensure that the problem is rectified." Despite these assurances, some residents remain skeptical. They say that the council has been slow to respond to their complaints, and that they feel neglected and ignored. Some have even suggested that the council is not taking the problem seriously, and that they are more concerned with saving money than with the wellbeing of the residents. It is not clear how long it will take for the council to fix the problem, or whether the residents will be satisfied with the outcome. For now, they continue to deal with the unpleasant smell and the potential health hazards of the mysterious yellow liquid. They are hoping that the council will take their concerns seriously and work to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
