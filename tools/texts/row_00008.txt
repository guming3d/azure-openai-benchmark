She said: ‘Sometimes in life you’ll have some things, at other times you will have other things. 'You don’t need it all at once, it’s not good for you. ‘Motherhood is a full-time job.

'I never wanted to do this as I find motherhood profoundly enjoyable.’ The star who recently played Mary Poppins creator P.L. Travers in Saving Mr Banks, also described her husband Greg Wise as ‘a great aesthetic pleasure’. She said: ‘He is the only luxury I can’t imagine ever being able to give up. 'Because he can cook, wash up, clean, entertain children, understand maths homework, put up shelves, take them down and put them up elsewhere and repair the little holes left behind, garden with a purpose, drive sensibly but very fast on motorways and let me get on with my life.

chatgpt: Celebrity parent, Rachel Weisz has opened up about the challenges she has faced when it comes to balancing motherhood and her successful acting career. The award-winning actor who has a 14-year-old daughter named Gaia and a 26-year-old adopted son named Tindyebwa Agaba, spoke candidly about her struggles as a working mother in a recent interview. Weisz, who is known for her roles in major blockbusters such as The Mummy and The Constant Gardener, revealed that it has not always been easy for her to find a balance between her professional life and her responsibilities as a parent. The star admitted that there were moments when she had to make tough decisions and even turn down work opportunities because she wanted to ensure that she was there for her children. "I don't think I've juggled anything. It's about the choices you make," Weisz said. "I've made some films and turned down some films. It's about the decisions you make in your life, which is a balance." Weisz's daughter, Gaia, was born in 2006, and so far, the actor has managed to keep her family out of the spotlight, a feat that is not often achieved by other high-profile celebrities. The actor, however, revealed that she has intentionally kept her family out of the media, citing the need for privacy and space. The actor further admitted that the entertainment industry can be unforgiving to working parents, especially mothers, who might be seen as less dedicated to their careers. Weisz confessed that she had to take a break from acting to dedicate her time to parenting before returning to the industry with renewed energy. Despite the challenges, Weisz appears to have found a balance between her professional and personal life, while also raising her children to be successful in their chosen paths. Her adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba is a Harvard graduate and a human rights activist, while her daughter Gaia is pursuing her interests in art and design. In conclusion, Rachel Weisz's story is a testament to the challenges that working mothers face, particularly when in the public eye, and how just like any parent, they must make difficult choices, but with the right balance, they can achieve success both in their professional and personal lives.
