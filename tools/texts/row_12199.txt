article: EXCLUSIVE By . Wills Robinson . Planes are involved in potential safety breaches in UK airspace every three days, new figures have revealed. Since 2010, 438 commerical and private flights over Britain have been flagged up to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) because they have flown too close together. The worrying statistics come after it was revealed that 361 RAF planes have been involved in near misses in the last 16 years. Ministry of Defence officials had pledged to install new safety equipment in 1998, but never did. Since 2010, 438 commerical and private flights over Britain have prompted safety investigations because they have flown too close together . If there is a reduction in the space between aircraft during a flight, the incident is required to be reported to the CAA under the Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme. If a pilot or air traffic controller feel that safety may have been compromised at any time, the authorities are also  alerted. These conflicts are referred to as Airprox and are investigated by a specialist team that analyses  data such as recorded radar and voice communications. A serious breach in safety occurred last year when two jumbo jets with around 1,000 people on board were just 100ft from crashing over Scotland, because pilots confused their flight instructions. The two Boeing 747s were 30 miles north of Glasgow and preparing to cross the Atlantic when an air traffic controller spotted they were moving closer together. Last month an airliner that was coming in to land had a near miss in mid-air with a motorised parachutist at 2,000ft about the ground. When air space is reduced between two aircraft over UK airspace, it is reported to the Civil Aviation Authority . The . Airbus A319 missed the flying-machine by only 150ft, causing the pilot . to see the parachute canopy flash by the cockpit of the plane. In 1948, 39 passengers died when two planes crashed mid-air over Northwood near London. A CAA spokesperson said: 'An Airprox is a situation in which, in the opinion of a pilot or a controller, the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed have been such that the safety of the aircraft involved may have been compromised. 'The majority of airproxes do not involve airliners and serious airprox incidents involving airliners are extremely rare. 'For example, there have only been two "category A" incidents - where there is a serious risk of collision – since 2005. 'Nevertheless, any incidents that do occur are thoroughly assessed by independent investigators and a panel of safety experts. 'Any lessons that can be learnt are acted on and shared across the aviation industry.'

chatgpt: In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the safety of commercial and private air travel. In response, authorities have been closely monitoring and investigating hundreds of flights. Since 2010, a total of 438 commercial and private journeys have been probed by authorities. These investigations include examining the flight plans, monitoring the movements of the aircraft, and analyzing data related to altitude, speed, and other factors. Aircraft are subjected to a set of lateral and vertical arrangements that have been approved and established by Airprox, an independent panel of aviation experts. These arrangements aim to ensure safe and efficient air travel by maintaining a safe distance between aircraft. If these set arrangements are compromised, they are reported to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for further investigation. This helps to identify potential safety issues and take necessary measures to prevent them from happening in the future. The majority of the investigations have been carried out on commercial flights, but private flights have also been closely monitored. Both types of flights are held to the same safety standards, and authorities take any issues very seriously. The investigations are conducted with the aim of improving safety standards and reducing the risk of accidents. The data and findings from these investigations are used to inform and strengthen safety regulations and procedures. Despite the large number of investigations over the past decade, the vast majority of flights have been found to be in compliance with the safety arrangements established by Airprox. This is a testament to the commitment of the aviation industry to safety and the effectiveness of the safety protocols in place. Nonetheless, the investigations have highlighted areas where further improvements can be made. For example, some flights have been found to not fully adhere to the approved lateral and vertical arrangements, demonstrating the need for continued vigilance and monitoring. In conclusion, safety is a top priority in the aviation industry, and authorities are taking a proactive approach to ensure that commercial and private flights are as safe as possible for passengers and crew. The ongoing investigations and monitoring are critical to identifying potential safety issues and improving safety protocols across the industry. With continued efforts and cooperation, air travel can remain safe and reliable for all.
