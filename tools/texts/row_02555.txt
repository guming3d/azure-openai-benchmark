article: Jerusalem (CNN) -- Yitzhak Shamir, a political hard-liner who served two terms as Israeli prime minster, died Saturday, the prime minister's office said. Shamir, 96, served as premier from 1983 to 1984, and from 1986 to 1992. He also was Israel's foreign minister from 1980 to 1986. Born in Poland, Shamir moved to Palestine and fought for Israeli independence. He joined the Likud movement, serving as a member of Israel's parliament, and also worked for the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service. Shamir succeeded Menachem Begin as prime minister in 1983. "Yitzhak Shamir belonged to the generation of giants who established the State of Israel and fought for the freedom of the Jewish people on their land," said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a fellow Likud member. It was during Shamir's second term as prime minister that the Gulf War broke out, leaving him with the question of how to respond to Iraqi Scud missiles falling on Israeli soil. Israeli government and military officials pressed him to retaliate and the United States urged him not to, and Shamir ultimately assured Washington he would not strike back. Shamir also presided over negotiations with Egypt on the post-treaty normalization process, and started diplomatic relations with several African countries that had severed relations with Israel after the Yom Kippur War, according to a biography of Shamir on the prime minister's website. Shamir ordered Operation Solomon, the airlift rescue of thousands of Ethiopian Jews following a regime change in 1991. During the operation, which took less than 48 hours, 14,000 Jews boarded Israeli planes to emigrate to Israel, according to the Israeli government. In September 1991, Shamir represented Israel at the International Peace Conference in Madrid. Israeli President Shimon Peres called Shamir a "brave warrior." "He fought with courage against the British mandate in the days of the underground and his incredible contribution to the State of Israel during his time in the Mossad will remain forever enshrined in the tales of bravery of our nation," Peres said in a statement. Shamir was a leader of the Jewish Zionist underground group that fought the mandate in the 1940s. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Shamir dedicated his life to Israel. "From his days working for Israel's independence to his service as prime minister, he strengthened Israel's security and advanced the partnership between the United States and Israel," she said in a statement. CNN's Guy Azriel contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Former Israeli president Shimon Peres has hailed former prime minister Yitzhak Shamir as a "brave warrior" who stood firm in the face of danger. Shamir, who led Israel twice in the 1980s and 1990s, died on Saturday at the age of 96. Peres, a former political rival, said he had many disagreements with Shamir, but that he respected his leadership and dedication to the country. Shamir was involved in many key foreign policy initiatives during his time in office. He was a staunch advocate of a hard-line approach to peace talks with the Palestinians, and opposed the Oslo Accords signed by his successor, Yitzhak Rabin. Despite his tough stance on security, Shamir was viewed by many as a steady hand during some of Israel's most difficult moments. He led the country during the first Gulf War, when Iraqi missiles fell on Israel, and was widely praised for his handling of the crisis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Shamir is part of a generation of giants that established the state of Israel. "He was a man of principles and a leader who served his country with honor and distinction," Netanyahu said in a statement. "He was a true patriot and a true son of Israel, and we will always remember him as a brave warrior who never wavered in his defense of our nation and our people." Shamir entered politics in the Likud party and served as a member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament. He was appointed foreign minister in 1980 and succeeded Menachem Begin as prime minister in 1983. After losing an election in 1984, he returned to power in 1986 and served as prime minister until 1992. Despite his reputation as a tough-minded leader, Shamir was also known for his love of literature and poetry. He authored several books, including a memoir, "Summing Up," which was published in 1994. Shamir's death has prompted an outpouring of tributes from across the political spectrum in Israel. President Reuven Rivlin called him a "fierce defender of the land" who never stopped fighting for his beliefs. "With his passing, we are reminded of the generation that fought for our independence and built our country," Rivlin said in a statement. "We will always be grateful for his many years of service and his unwavering commitment to the State of Israel."
