article: Don't pass the ball to Kobe. Nineteen years into his illustrious career, Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant finally entered the record books last night in the worst way possible when he broke the NBA record for most missed shots by a player. This as the Lakers fell to the Memphis Grizzles 107 - 102. Scroll down for video . One for the record books: Kobe Bryant (above) entered the record books for all the wrong reasons last night when he became the most missing shooter in NBA history . These were probably banked: Bryant has now missed 13,418 shots in his career . And while it was a bad night for Kobe, it was a very, very good night for former Boston Celtics forward John Havlicek who is now only the second worst shooter in the history of the game. To be fair, a look at the players who top the record board for this infamous honor includes the greats of the game, with Michael Jordan sixth on the list, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar fifth and Karl Malone fourth. Among the active players who could perhaps surpass Bryant are Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitzki, who are all right outside the top ten. Bryant needed 13 misses heading in to last night's game to claim the record, and lucky number 13 came in the fourth quarter, pushing his lifetime total to 13,418 botched ball throws. Only the second worst: Bryant broke the record set by Boston Celtics forward John Havlicek (above) Airballs: Among active players, Kevin Garnett (left) and Vince Carter (right) have the best shot at being the worst shots and taking the record away from Kobe . On a much more positive note, Bryant  still remains the youngest player in league history to notch 30,000 career points, is the all time leading scoring in Lakers history, one of the game's most storied franchise, and has won the All-Star MVP a record four times. He also has two gold medals and has won the NBA championships five times with the Lakers. Off the court, Bryant is notoriously private and press shy, especially following accusations in 2003 that he raped a hotel employee at a Colorado spa. So in love: Bryant and his wife Vanessa, mother of his two children, Natalia and Gianna . The case was eventually dropped and a civil suit settled out of court. Bryant has been married to his wife Vanessa for 13 years, who scored a very nice and very expensive diamond apology ring following the aforementioned accusations said to be worth $4million, and the couple have two daughters, Natalia and Gianna.
highlights: Kobe Bryant set a record for the most missed shots in the history of the NBA last night when he banked the ball for the 13,418th time . The Los Angeles Lakers star surpassed the number set by Boston Celtics forward John Havlicek . Among active players, Kevin Garnett and Vince Carter have the best chance at beating Bryant's record .

chatgpt: Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant set a new NBA record last night, albeit not the kind he would have liked. Bryant missed his 13,418th shot, surpassing the previous record held by Boston Celtics forward John Havlicek. It was a bittersweet moment for Bryant, who is known for his scoring prowess and has won five NBA championships over his storied career. However, the record serves as a testament to his longevity and durability as a player, having played 20 seasons in the NBA. Despite the missed shots, Bryant's name remains synonymous with greatness on the court. He was an 18-time All-Star, won two Olympic gold medals, and was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 2008. The record-setting shot occurred in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies, in which Bryant finished with 28 points on 10-for-26 shooting. The Lakers ultimately lost the game 107-102, dropping their record to 16-60 on the season. Looking ahead to the future, two active players have the best chance at surpassing Bryant's record. Kevin Garnett, who has missed 12,165 shots in his career, ranks second among active players. Vince Carter is close behind with 12,132 missed shots. Both Garnett and Carter have had long and successful careers, with Garnett having won the NBA championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008, and Carter being named to eight All-Star teams over his career. However, it remains to be seen if either of them can catch up to Bryant's mark. Despite the missed shots, Bryant's impact on the game of basketball extends far beyond the statistics. He is widely regarded as one of the best players of all time and has inspired countless young athletes to pick up a basketball and pursue their dreams. As his 20-year career comes to a close at the end of this season, Bryant's legacy has already been cemented in the annals of NBA history. Even with the missed shots, his record-setting performance serves as a reminder of his remarkable career, and the impact he has had on the game of basketball.
