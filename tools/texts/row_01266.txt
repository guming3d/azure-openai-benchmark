article: (CNN) -- Rio Ferdinand has been found guilty of improper conduct and fined £45,000 ($70,000) by the English Football Association (FA) for comments posted on Twitter relating to his England teammate and Chelsea star, Ashley Cole. Announcing its decision on Friday, the FA's Regulatory Commission concluded that Ferdinand's comment, which described Cole as a "choc ice," brought the game into disrepute by referencing a person's ethnic origin, color or race. The Manchester United and England defender was charged in July after he responded to a tweet describing Cole as a "choc ice," re-tweeting: "I hear you fella! Choc ice is a classic! Hahahahahaha!!" The FA heard evidence from Herman Ouseley, a former chair of the UK's Commission for Racial Equality who explained that "choc ice" was "an offensive and insulting term ... used to question a person's identity, based on the notion that they have a dark outer skin but inside they act as a white person ... It means the person is fake." Ferdinand's comment was posted on July 14, the day after John Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand's younger brother Anton during a Premier League match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers in October 2011. Cole had been called as a character witness for his Chelsea teammate during the hearing held at Westminster Magistrates Court in London. Although upholding the charge and fining Ferdinand, the FA stressed that it did not believe Ferdinand to be a racist, describing him as someone who has "a track record in fronting anti-racism campaigns in football." Ferdinand, who is one of football's most high profile "Twitterers" with over three million followers, has declined to appeal the decision. Greg Stobart, a football correspondent for Goal.com told CNN: "The fine is perhaps a little bit harsh. The thing I would say is that it was a foolish thing to do, but we know Rio was emotional because his brother was involved in the case." He's not the first to fall foul of the FA for comments on Twitter, Stobart says, with Arsenal's Emmanuel Frimpong recently being fined £6,000 ($9,500) after admitting a charge of improper conduct. "Players need to be more careful," Stobart said. "(Twitter) is a public forum ... you've got to be responsible." Despite being cleared by the court, John Terry has also been charged with improper conduct by the FA for his alleged comments to Anton Ferdinand during the match last October.

chatgpt: Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has been found guilty of improper conduct and fined £45,000 by the English Football Association (FA). The charges relate to Ferdinand's comments on Twitter, in which he referred to Chelsea player Ashley Cole as a "choc ice". The incident occurred in July of this year, when Ferdinand responded to a tweet that referred to Cole as a "choc ice". The term is widely regarded as a racial slur, meaning that someone is black on the outside but white on the inside. Cole had recently given evidence in a court hearing where he supported his teammate, John Terry, who was accused of racially abusing Ferdinand's brother, Anton. Terry was subsequently cleared of any criminal charges in court but is still awaiting the outcome of the FA's own investigation into the matter. The FA's investigation was put on hold until after the court case had concluded, and it could have serious consequences for Terry if he is found guilty of improper conduct. Ferdinand's comments on Twitter were seen as inflammatory and potentially damaging to the ongoing investigation, as they were widely reported in the media. The FA charged him with improper conduct in August, and he pleaded guilty to the charges at a hearing on 5 October. The FA's independent regulatory commission, which heard the case, praised Ferdinand for his public apology and his cooperation with the investigation. However, it also emphasized that his comments were unacceptable and had the potential to undermine the FA's efforts to tackle racism in football. The commission noted that Ferdinand had not intended to be racist, and that he had apologized unreservedly for his comments. However, it concluded that his conduct had been improper and that he had brought the game into disrepute. Ferdinand has accepted the commission's decision and apologized again for his comments. He described the incident as a "big lesson" and said that he was determined to learn from it. The incident has once again put the issue of racism in football under the spotlight. The FA has been criticized in the past for its handling of such cases, and this latest incident has highlighted the need for more robust measures to tackle the problem. Football itself is often seen as a microcosm of society, reflecting wider issues of discrimination and inequality. The sport has the power to bring people together and to promote values of respect and tolerance. However, incidents like this serve as a reminder that there is still much work to be done to achieve these goals. It is the responsibility of everyone involved in the game to ensure that football remains a force for good in the world.
