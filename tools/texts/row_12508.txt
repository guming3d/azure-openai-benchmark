article: (CNN) -- Vincenzo Nibali became only the sixth man in history to win all three of cycling's major tours as he sealed victory in this year's Tour de France on the Champs Elysees Sunday. Nibali stayed out of trouble on the 137.5km stage from Evry, which was won by German sprinter Marcel Kittel of the Giant-Shimano team. It left the 29-year-old Italian a commanding seven minutes 52 seconds ahead of runner-up Jean Christophe-Peraud with another Frenchman, Thibaut Pinot, in third. Astana's Nibali joins illustrious company by adding to his earlier triumphs in the Giro d'Italia and Tour of Spain. Legends Eddy Merckx of Belgium, France duo Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault, Nibali's fellow Italian Felipe Gimondi and Alberto Contador of Spain are the only others to achieve the feat. Contador was one of the favorites for this year's race, but crashed out, as did reigning champion Chris Froome of Britain. It left the way clear for Nibali, who served notice of his intentions with an audacious break to win the second stage in Sheffield in England and gained more time on the cobbled fifth stage where Froome exited. Nibali continued to dominate as the race went over the Alps and Pyrenees, winning three more stages to be a deserved winner after three grueling weeks. Crossing the line with his teammates, he went straight to his wife and baby daughter to celebrate with his family. "It's the most important and the best moment, I never imagined it could feel this good because when you find yourself on this podium on the Champs Elysees, it's unique," said Nibali. "Now that I'm here it's even better than I imagined. I fought for this every day, I started building from a long way out with a winter preparation with the team because we had decided this was our objective." Kittel, the star of the early stages of the Tour, used his raw sprinting power to match Nibali's four wins this year, edging out Norway's Alexander Kristoff with Ramunas Navardauskas of Lithuania third. Peter Sagan of Slovakia finished ninth, but had already wrapped up the green jersey for points leader despite failing to win a stage on the 2014 Tour. Kittel hinted he would be targeting green himself in future races. "My goals won't change in the future, especially at the Tour de France,"he told the official Tour de France website. "I'll go again for stage wins but I'm not a man of records. I've said in the past and I repeat that the green jersey can become an option in the future." The 24-year-old Pinot, one of the great hopes of French cycling, took the white jersey for best young rider, with Rafal Majka of Poland winning the King of the Mountains classification.

chatgpt: Vincenzo Nibali of Italy secured his first-ever Tour de France victory in Paris on Sunday, becoming only the sixth cyclist in history to win all three Grand Tours. The 29-year-old Astana rider did not take any risks during the 21st and final stage, as he had already established a lead of over seven minutes from closest rival Jean-Christophe Peraud of France. The 137.5km stage, which started and finished on the Champs-Elysées, was won by Marcel Kittel of Germany, who was part of a breakaway group that moved clear of the main peloton early on. Kittel, who secured his fourth stage win of this year's Tour, comfortably outpaced Norweigan Alexander Kristoff and Frenchman Arnaud Demare in the sprint finish. But the day belonged to Nibali, who lifted the coveted Yellow Jersey in front of thousands of spectators gathered along the iconic Parisian boulevard. The Italian finished the race with a final overall time of 89 hours, 59 minutes, and six seconds, ahead of Peraud and Thibaut Pinot, also of France. Speaking after crossing the finish line, Nibali said, "It's been an amazing Tour for me and the team. We've worked really hard over the past three weeks and this is a very special moment for us. To win in Paris is always something to remember." Nibali's success means that he now joins an elite group of cyclists who have won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, and Vuelta a España - collectively known as the three Grand Tours. The others are Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, and Alberto Contador. Nibali's victory is also a welcome boost to Italian cycling, which has been mired in controversy following a string of doping scandals. The Astana rider becomes the first Italian to win the Tour de France since Marco Pantani in 1998 and the fourth in history. While Nibali celebrated his triumph, there were also emotional scenes on the podium as retiring American rider Christian Vande Velde bid farewell to the sport. The 38-year-old Garmin-Sharp rider, who was wearing a special edition pink, white, and blue jersey, received a standing ovation from the crowd as he thanked his family, teammates, and fans. There were also plaudits for the race organizers, who successfully navigated a host of challenging obstacles, including protests from disgruntled farmers, bad weather, and the specter of doping. The Tour de France remains one of the most grueling and prestigious races in the world, attracting millions of viewers and spectators each year. For Nibali, however, the focus will now shift to his next challenge, as he seeks to defend his Giro d'Italia title next year. But for now, the Italian can bask in the glory of his historic Tour de France victory, safe in the knowledge that he has cemented his place among the sport's all-time greats.
