chatgpt: The start of the new Premier League season is less than a month away and fans all over the world are excited to see their favorite teams battle it out for the coveted trophy. The season kicks off on August 16, and there are a number of interesting storylines to follow. One of the most intriguing storylines is how Liverpool will fare without Luis Suarez. The controversial striker was sold to Barcelona over the summer, but Liverpool fans can take solace in the fact that their team has lost just one of their last 10 games without him. Manager Brendan Rodgers will be hoping that his new signings can fill the void left by Suarez and help guide Liverpool to a successful campaign. Another interesting story is the lack of playing time that Jack Rodwell has received over the last three seasons. The Manchester City midfielder has only played 1,531 minutes over that span, which is a meager amount given his talent. It remains to be seen whether Rodwell can break into the City starting XI this season, or whether he will have to seek a move to a new club for more playing time. Leighton Baines is another player to watch this season, especially when it comes to penalties. The Everton left-back has a perfect 100 per cent penalty record, having scored all 15 of his spot-kicks in his career. Baines is known for his excellent delivery from set-pieces, and his penalty-taking ability will be a valuable asset for Everton this season. Finally, one cannot talk about the Premier League without mentioning Robin van Persie. The Dutch striker is the only player to have scored 35 or more goals with both feet, and he will be looking to add to that total this season. Van Persie was hampered by injuries last season, but he still managed to score 18 goals in 28 league appearances. If he can stay fit this season, van Persie could be a key player in Manchester United's quest for the title. As the start of the new season draws closer, fans will be eagerly anticipating the first matches of the campaign. Liverpool will be hoping to prove that they can still compete without Suarez, Jack Rodwell will be looking to make an impact for Manchester City, and Leighton Baines and Robin van Persie will be looking to continue their impressive form from last season. All of this adds up to what promises to be an exciting and unpredictable season in the Premier League.
