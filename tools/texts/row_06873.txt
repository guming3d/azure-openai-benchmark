An Illinois high school has started random testing of drugs and alcohol in its students in a bid to stop students from taking the substances. The private St Viator High School in Arlington Heights, Chicago, will start testing its students this week by taking hair samples. Samples from 10 to 20 students will be chosen through random student ID selection by a third-party company each week, according to CBS Chicago. New protocol: Students at the private St Viator High School in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights are now subject to weekly random drug and alcohol testing . No more boozing: The tests will show whether the students have had a beer or other type of alcohol in the past 90 days . No hiding: The tests will show if a student has smoked marijuana, left, in the past 90 days by taking a sample of their hair, right . School administrators say the tests will reveal if a student has had alcohol or used drugs like ecstasy, cocaine or marijuana in the past 90 days. However, the test can't detect small amounts of alcohol, like sips of communion wine, according to The Daily Herald. The results take about five days to come back, and if a student is found to be positive, the school plans to either discipline them or provide counselling. Parents were informed of the new policy over the summer, with mixed reactions to the school's move. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is not particularly enthused either, saying it should be parents who have the responsibility of watching their children’s habits when they are not at school. ‘We have a mechanism for controlling the behavior of young people outside school — they're called parents,’ ACLU Illinois spokesman Ed Yohnka told the Tribune in August. Opponents: St. Viator Principal Reverend Corey Brost, left, says the students welcomed the test because it gives them an excuse to turn down drugs and alcohol. American Civil Liberties Union spokesman Ed Yohnka, right, says he doesn't think there is a 'need for schools to be acting as uber-parents' ‘I don't think we need for schools to be acting as uber-parents.’ However, St Viator is free to conduct the tests since they're a private institution. St. Viator Principal Reverend Corey Brost says students welcome the tests because it gives them an excuse to turn down drugs and alcohol if it is offered to them. ‘We want to give kids a good reason to say, "No, I can't drink, St. Viator tests for alcohol",’ Brost told the Herald. The school has randomly tested students for drugs since 2007, but the random tests for alcohol are new this year.

chatgpt: The St Viator High School in Arlington Heights, Chicago, is set to begin testing its students for drug and alcohol consumption this week by taking hair samples. This controversial move has sparked debate in the community, with some parents applauding the school's efforts to keep their children safe, while others argue that it is an invasion of privacy. The school has stated that they will randomly choose between 10 and 20 students through random student ID selection for the hair sample testing. The tests will be conducted by a third-party company that specializes in drug testing. The results will reveal if a student has consumed drugs like ecstasy, cocaine, or marijuana in the past 90 days. While the school and some parents see this as a necessary measure to ensure the safety of the students, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) strongly opposes it. The ACLU argues that schools should not be acting as "uber-parents," and that it is not the school's responsibility to regulate the private lives of students outside of school hours. The school, however, believes that drug and alcohol abuse can have a significant impact on a student's academic performance and overall wellbeing. By conducting these tests, they hope to identify students who need help and provide them with the resources and support necessary to overcome their struggles. The school has assured parents and students that the results of the tests will be kept confidential and will only be shared with the student, their parents, and designated school officials. However, concerns remain that this information could be used against students in the future, such as during college admissions processes or job applications. Despite the controversy and concerns raised by the ACLU, some students and parents feel that the testing is a small price to pay for keeping the school community safe. "I trust the school to make the right decision, and if that means testing students for drugs and alcohol, then so be it," said one St Viator High School parent. It is worth noting that while drug testing in schools is a controversial topic, it is not uncommon. Many schools across the country have implemented drug testing programs in an effort to combat drug and alcohol abuse among students. In conclusion, St Viator High School's decision to test their students for drug and alcohol consumption through hair samples has divided the community. While some parents believe it is necessary to ensure the safety of their children, the ACLU argues that it is an invasion of privacy and not the school's responsibility to regulate the private lives of students. Regardless of where one stands on this contentious issue, it is clear that drug and alcohol abuse among students is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.
