article: (Mashable) -- As the mainstream tablet war rages, a similar device battle is heating up in the restaurant industry. Tablets that take orders, entertain guests and accept check payments are coming to a table near you. One company that is selling those tablets, E la Carte, announced on Tuesday that it has raised more than $1 million in funding from prominent investors like Y Combinator, Dave McClure and SV Angel. The company will soon be launching tablets in 20 restaurants on the West coast. It also has a partnership with a large restaurant chain in the pipeline that hasn't been announced yet -- but the fact that Applebee's executives participated in the funding round might provide a hint. Why the interest in providing every table with their own touch-screen tablet? For starters, people buy more food when they can do so instantly, without waiting for service. In the six restaurants that ran a pilot scheme, according to CEO Rajat Suri, customers at E la Carte tables spent 10% to 12% more than those at other tables. E la Carte tablets allow customers to browse a full menu and communicate their orders directly to the kitchen. They come loaded with social games and a calculator for check splits and tips. They also allow customers to email themselves a receipt or instantly sign up for a loyalty club. In high-end restaurants, the tablet can suggest an appropriate wine pairing for a meal. Eventually, E la Carte might offer restaurants the option to compile data about their customers' preferences as they use the device. Some restaurants have attempted similar functionality by loading their menus onto iPads or asking customers to download an app onto their own devices. The iPad's problem in this situation: its minimum $499 price tag. Restaurants that can afford menus that expensive aren't casual restaurants, like Applebee's, where a digital ordering system seems more appropriate. Asking users to download an app like Storific poses the problem that not everybody carries a smartphone. Even those who do might not want to pause and download an app as they sit down to lunch. A dedicated device, which E la Carte plans to install for a price that is "significantly lower" than the iPad, seems to be a more promising way for the tech world to break into the $6 billion U.S. restaurant industry. Other companies are already in this game. Tabletop Media makes a similar tabletop product that it began to deploy in 2008. The company has established customers with chains like Chili's Uno's Chicago Grill, and California Pizza Kitchen and will be in 250 stores by the end of the summer. Both E la Carte and Tabletop Media charge the restaurants a monthly fee to use a network of devices. "It's propelling the restaurant industry into the Internet age," Suri says. Â© 2010 MASHABLE.com.

chatgpt: E la Carte, the company behind the popular tablet ordering system used in restaurants across the country, is set to launch its latest product in 20 West coast restaurants. The innovative tablets give customers a unique interactive experience, allowing them complete control over their dining experience. The E la Carte tablets are designed to give diners more control over their meals. With the tap of a finger, customers can view a full menu and place their orders without any help from a waiter. This not only streamlines the process but also ensures that orders are accurate and free from human errors. The new version of the E la Carte tablet also comes loaded with social games, providing customers with a fun and engaging way to pass the time while waiting for their food. From classic arcade games to brain teasers, there's something for everyone. But that's not all. The tablets also feature a calculator that allows customers to easily split the check and calculate tips. No more awkward discussions around the table about who owes what - the tablet does it all for you. However, the most innovative feature of the E la Carte tablet is its ability to connect customers directly with the kitchen. If a customer has a question about a particular dish or wants to request a special modification, they can do so through the tablet. This communication not only enhances the customer experience but also allows the kitchen to better understand the needs and preferences of their patrons. The launch of the E la Carte tablet in 20 West coast restaurants has generated a lot of excitement among foodies and tech enthusiasts alike. Many are eager to experience the technology firsthand and see how it improves their dining experience. The company is confident that these new tablets will help revolutionize the restaurant industry. "We're thrilled to be launching our latest product in 20 West coast restaurants," said Rajat Suri, founder, and CEO of E la Carte. "Our tablets give customers unparalleled control over their dining experience, and we're confident that they will soon become a staple in restaurants across the country." The feedback from those who have already used the E la Carte tablet has been overwhelmingly positive. Customers appreciate the convenience and efficiency of ordering through the tablet, while the social games provide a unique and entertaining experience. The calculator function has also been a hit, with many customers saying it eliminates the stress of splitting checks. Restaurants that have already implemented the E la Carte tablet have seen an increase in average spend per customer, with some reporting a 10-15% increase in revenue. This not only benefits the restaurant but also the customer, who can enjoy a wider variety of menu options and a more streamlined experience. The E la Carte tablet is set to revolutionize the restaurant industry, allowing customers to take control of their dining experience and providing restaurants with valuable insights into customer preferences. With the launch of the new tablets in 20 West coast restaurants, the future certainly looks bright for this innovative technology.
