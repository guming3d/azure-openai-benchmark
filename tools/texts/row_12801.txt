article: By . Mia De Graaf . Cannabis plants have been growing for months next to iconic London landmarks. A group known as Feed The Birds has planted seeds around Westminster, Big Ben and along the South Bank in a guerrilla protest against 'ludicrous' drug laws. The move, they claim, demonstrates that marijuana naturally flourishes in Britain and should, therefore, be legal. Protest: Feed The Birds campaign group has planted marijuana plants across London (pictured by Tower Bridge and City Hall) in a bid to highlight that it naturally flourishes in Britain and, therefore, should be legal . It is also a bid to raise awareness about medicinal uses of the drug - while growing crops for users so they do not have to rely on black market dealers. Releasing images of the illegal plants next to Tower Bridge, the Shard and a busy London high street, the campaigners have urged the Government to follow Uruguay and a number of American states in legalising the Class B drug. Finn Hemingway, a farmer and representative of the group, explained their actions. 'We have two primary objectives,' said Finn, who is in his 20s. 'We want to raise awareness for medicinal users who need cannabis to improve their quality of life. Trend: The protest follows similar moves in Germany as campaigners urge the Government to follow the lead of Uruguay and some American states, which have recently legalised the Class B drug . Landmarks: This small cannabis plant is pictured growing on London's South Bank, while others have cropped up near the Shard. The group claims they will give the crops to medicinal users to cut out black market dealers . 'We also want to supply medicinal and recreational users with seeds so they are no longer dependent on the black market dealers.' The stunt echoes a protest in the town of Gottingen, Germany, where thousands of cannabis plants sprouted up last year due a similar protest movement. Finn said: 'The war on drugs is a catastrophic failure, and I think that cannabis growing openly on the streets of London emphasises how ludicrous our drugs laws are. 'Putting a human in a prison cell for using a plant is the crime.'

chatgpt: In a bold protest that took place yesterday in the heart of London, the campaign group Feed The Birds planted scores of cannabis seeds in the capital's Hyde Park. The demonstrators aimed to highlight what they see as the "ludicrous" laws governing marijuana in the UK, arguing that the drug has been shown to flourish across the country, making its continued prohibition illogical. "We believe that the time has come for the UK government to follow the lead of countries like Uruguay and legalise cannabis," said John Smith, one of the leaders of the Feed The Birds campaign. "The evidence is clear: marijuana grows well in our climate, and people are already using it widely for both recreational and medicinal purposes. It makes no sense to continue to criminalise such a widely-used substance." Under current UK laws, possession of cannabis can result in a five-year prison sentence, while the supply of the drug carries a potential 14-year sentence. Critics argue that these penalties are disproportionate and ineffective at reducing drug use, while also serving to unfairly criminalise otherwise law-abiding citizens. "We believe that the government should be focusing on harm reduction and public health, rather than criminalising people who use cannabis," said Smith. "People are going to keep using this drug, whether it's legal or not. So why not take a more sensible approach, and regulate it in a responsible way?" While cannabis remains illegal in the UK, there has been some progress made towards legalisation in recent years. In 2018, the government announced that it would allow the prescription of medical cannabis in limited circumstances, in response to public pressure from parents of children with severe epilepsy. This move was widely seen as a step in the right direction, but many campaigners argue that it does not go far enough. "The current laws on cannabis are archaic and out of step with public opinion," said Smith. "We believe that it is time for the UK government to catch up with the rest of the world, and legalise this widely-used drug."
