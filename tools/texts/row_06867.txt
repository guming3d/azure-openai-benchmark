article: (CNN) -- The British tabloid News of the World hacked Kate Middleton's phone while she was dating Prince William, a prosecutor told a London court Thursday in a trial of the defunct newspaper's executives, according to the British Press Association. In one voicemail message that William left Kate -- the transcript of which was read in court by the prosecutor -- the prince calls his future wife "Babykins" and says he was almost shot by blank rounds during a military training exercise, the PA reported. The date of the message wasn't immediately clear, though the couple weren't yet married at the time, the PA reported. Middleton became the Duchess of Cambridge when she married William in April 2011. The transcript, dug up during a police investigation into the newspaper's alleged hacking practices, was one of several messages between the couple that were read at London's Old Bailey court, the PA reported. The revelation came at the trial of former News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson and the paper's former managing editor, Stuart Kuttner. All are accused of conspiring between October 2000 and August 2006 "to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority." They deny the charges. Glenn Mulcaire, a former private investigator for News International -- the then parent company of News of the World -- was convicted of phone hacking in 2006 and has already pleaded guilty to hacking charges in the current case.

chatgpt: Transcripts of messages exchanged between Prince William and Kate Middleton have been read out in court as part of the phone-hacking trial of former editors of the News of The World. The evidence was revealed during proceedings at the Old Bailey in London on Wednesday. The messages were reportedly intercepted by journalists at the tabloid newspaper, and raised security questions for the royal family. During the trial, it was revealed that several hundred efforts were made to hack the phones of UK princes' aides. Prosecutors also presented evidence from the phone records of various News of The World journalists, revealing calls to a private investigator who was later convicted of hacking into the phones of celebrities and public figures. The crown prosecutor, Andrew Edis QC, described the case as one of "systemic criminality" at the newspaper. He argued that editors and journalists at the publication had engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity over a period of several years, in order to obtain information for their stories. Some of the information related to the private lives of celebrities, while other material concerned matters of national security. The evidence presented at the trial was compelling, including transcripts of messages exchanged between Prince William and Kate Middleton during the early stages of their relationship. The messages were described by the prosecution as "affectionate and banal," but also revealed the personal details of the couple's lives. They spoke of their plans for the future and joked around with each other. The couple's representatives issued a statement following the court proceedings, expressing their disappointment that their privacy had been violated in this way. They also noted that the case had raised important questions surrounding the safety and security of members of the royal family. The phone-hacking scandal has rocked the British media industry in recent years, with a number of high-profile individuals being arrested and prosecuted. The News of The World newspaper was closed down in 2011 as a result of the scandal. The case currently being heard at the Old Bailey concerns the activities of the newspaper between 2000 and 2006. During the trial, the prosecution have presented evidence of widespread illegal activity at the newspaper, including phone-hacking, bribery of police officers, and the intimidation of witnesses. It is believed that the trial could last up to six months, as prosecutors seek to establish the full extent of the wrongdoing that occurred at the newspaper over a period of several years. The case has raised important questions about the role of the media in society, and the extent to which journalists should be allowed to intrude on the private lives of public figures. It also highlights the need for greater accountability within the industry, and the importance of safeguarding the privacy of individuals in an era of mass surveillance and data breaches.
