article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:31 EST, 19 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:53 EST, 19 November 2013 . A six-year-old Massachusetts cheerleader is refusing to let cancer get in the way of helping her squad raise thousands of dollars for charity. Riley Fessenden, who had a rare form of nasal cancer diagnosed in May, has continued taking part in practices and competitions with her squad. And, when her team heard about a fundraiser to take part in a New England Patriots game, she helped them raise more than $2,500 in one weekend. Determined: Six-year-old Riley and her cheerleading squad have been raising money for cancer research . 'She is tougher than any guy I know,' Todd Fessenden said of his daughter Riley, who wears a headband emblazoned with the slogan 'Fights like a girl'. Since finding out she has a type of cancer called Esthesioneuroblastoma, Riley has had to have radiation treatments, but she was always ready for cheerleading practice. 'We practice three, four . times a week ... they are little girls. They get tired,' assistant coach Jennifer Burnett said. 'A lot of times [Riley comes] straight from radiation . treatment,' Ms Burnett said, telling 7 News that she 'never has a single complaint'. Head coach Relli Roesener added that Riley was the 'hardest working girl on the team'. When she is too ill to make it to practice, her sister Meghan who is also on the team, keeps her updated. Riley's family had already been raising funds through the Riley Rocks website, where they sell wrist bands and advertize events, such as a carnival they held, to help cover the cost of her treatment. 'The hospital bills, even with insurance, are already thousands of dollars, and they have only just begun,' Riley's aunt, Sally, told the Benicia Herald. Energetic: Despite being on a course of radiation treatment Riley rarely misses cheerleading practice . But when the little girl's Beverly Titans' squad heard about a nationwide cheerleading contest to raise funds for cancer, they jumped at the chance to raise money for a wider cause. As part of the state-wide Cheer for Dana-Farber, Riley and her squad have been holding a dance and bake sale to raise the minimum $1,000 needed to be entered into a draw to cheer at a Patriots game. They more than exceeded their goal, raising $5,000 before the main fundraiser, and bringing in $2,500 in just one weekend. Every $1,000 brought in is another chance to have the squad's name added into the draw. 'It is very overwhelming. There is a lot . of people over here. Way more than we originally expected,' Riley's mother, Kamie Huston, said. Assistant coach Ms Burnett added: 'We . would never have been able to do something like this without so many . people helping us. But it's been really amazing. I didn't expect this at . all.' Riley and the Titans find out at the beginning of December if they have won the chance to perform at the December 29 game.
