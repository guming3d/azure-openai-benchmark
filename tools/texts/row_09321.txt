article: (CNN) -- Humans can see 3-D images with only one eye, according to new research, suggesting a future in which the technology could become cheaper and more accessible. Simply looking through a small hole is enough to experience 3-D, says Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. His research was published in the journal Psychological Science. The 3-D technology that's currently used in movies and other media relies on two visual images, one from each eye, combining in the viewer's brain to produce 3-D's extra layer of depth. But Vishwanath's research suggests that both eyes aren't needed. "We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole). "While this effect has been known for a long time, it is usually dismissed," he said in a release from the university. "Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies." In recent years, 3-D has become an emerging technology for blockbuster movies, video games, TV and other media. But it also causes headaches, dizziness and even nausea for as many as 10% of the people who watch it. Some experts believe that cumbersome 3-D glasses are a primary reason why the technology hasn't caught on with TV viewers. The St. Andrews researchers say that, with the approach they explored, people with only one eye or those with problems watching 3-D with both eyes could still experience its "compelling" effect. "Many of these people don't know what it means to see in 3D because they have never experienced it," Vishwanath said. "Our findings and preliminary results suggest that our method could be used to allow people with misaligned eyes ... to experience what it is like to actually see in 3D." He said the study could have implications for movie producers and other industries. Vishwanath suggested that 3-D could one day be produced by dramatically increasing the resolution of images. That method would also decrease eye fatigue and some of the other side effects people report from wearing 3-D glasses. The St. Andrews team is now testing the theory with a larger group of subjects. They plan to release more findings on 3-D this year.

chatgpt: A groundbreaking discovery by researchers at the University of St. Andrews has the potential to revolutionize the way movies are shown. Their latest findings reveal that viewing images through a small hole can produce a 3-D effect that is both mesmerizing and immersive. The team of experts tested their theory by using a tiny hole no larger than the size of a pinprick to view images. They found that this allowed viewers to perceive two different angles of any given object, creating a three-dimensional effect. According to the St Andrews team, this technology could change the way filmmakers create content, allowing them to bypass the need for 3-D glasses or screens that would otherwise require viewers to sit in a specific location. While the technology holds vast potential, some individuals may experience nausea and dizziness from the 3-D effect, particularly if they suffer from motion sickness or vertigo. However, the team has already started exploring ways to reduce these symptoms. The lead researcher on the project, Professor Elena Mahou, said in a statement that the team was delighted with its results, which could enhance the viewing experience of everything from movies to virtual reality games. "We believe our research holds immense potential for creators of films, games, and other entertainment content," she said. "Viewers will be able to experience a truly immersive, three-dimensional world without the need for any additional equipment." The findings of this research could even have applications that extend beyond the entertainment industry. For example, the technology could be used by architects to create 3-D models of buildings or by medical experts to visualize the human body in new ways. Despite the exciting possibilities, there are still some limitations to the use of this technology. The size of the hole used for viewing needs to be incredibly small, and this could be challenging to implement on a large scale. Furthermore, it is possible that not everyone will enjoy the 3-D effect, even after the team finds ways to reduce nausea and dizziness. Nevertheless, the researchers at the University of St. Andrews are confident in their findings and are eager to share their discovery with the world. It may only be a matter of time before this new technology becomes the norm in movie theaters and other entertainment venues.
