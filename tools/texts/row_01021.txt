The Elkhart County Prosecutor's office stated that they will not be providing any additional information at this time, including whether there will be any additional charges brought against Wilson. Northwood High School issued a statement in response to the allegations, saying that the safety and well-being of students is their highest priority. The school has cooperated fully with law enforcement throughout the investigation. The school district also reminded its staff of the importance of maintaining professional boundaries with students, and the consequences of inappropriate behavior.
