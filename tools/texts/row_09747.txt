article: The mother of a boy who was seen banging his head against a window for days at his North Brisbane home has been charged with child cruelty. Speaking at the Brisbane Magistrates Court today, crown prosecutor Gretchen McKinley said the two boys who were living in complete squalor were both  autistic and would suffer emotional and psychological scars as a result of their abuse. The boys were found naked in the filthy house in Keperra on a cold May morning. The smell of urine and faeces made the police officers physically gag as they rescued the boys. The mother of a boy who was seen banging his head against a window at his North Brisbane home has been charged with child cruelty . A neighbour saw the two-year-old boy 'screaming, crying and headbutting' the window for up to two days at his home from May 3 to May 4. Ms McKinley said the two-year-old boy was autistic while his older brother, who was aged four at the time of the abuse, may also be autistic. The court heard evidence from the two-year-old boy's foster mother and sister, who claim the little boy is often seen curled up in the foetal position  and is easily frightened. There was previous evidence of neglect at the house that was known to the Department of Child Safety but the woman was only standing trial for the abuse in early May. The boys were found naked in the filthy house in Keperra on a cold May morning. The smell of urine and faeces made the police officers physically gag as they rescued the boys . While the mother's layer Lewis Shillito admitted that there was evidence of a 'lack of care' in the house, it was not possible to determine whether the boys would suffer mentally because of the abuse. However, judge Judith Daley said it would be the jury's decision what harm the neglect has had on the two boys. A date for the woman's trial has not yet been set.

chatgpt: A mother in Brisbane will face trial for child cruelty charges after two boys were allegedly found living in squalor. The two-year-old boy was observed repeatedly banging his head against the window, according to reports from neighbors. Both boys are believed to be autistic, and were found naked in the house on a cold May morning. Upon further investigation, police officers were appalled by the conditions in the house. They reportedly gagged at the smell of urine and feces that was present, with the boys living in conditions that can only be described as squalid. It is not clear how long the children had been living in the house or what led to the charges against the mother. However, it is clear that the children were not receiving the care and attention that they needed. The mother has been ordered to appear in court at an undisclosed date. Child cruelty is a serious offense, and it is essential that all parents provide a safe and healthy environment for their children. The long-term effects of neglect and abuse can be devastating, and it is imperative that such cases are dealt with strong and firm measures.  There is no doubt that this case will be closely watched by the public and advocates for children's rights. It is essential that all children receive the care that they deserve, and that parents take their responsibilities seriously. It is only through strong enforcement of the law that such cases can be prevented in the future. This case is a reminder of the importance of reporting cases of neglect or abuse, and the role that neighbors and the community play in ensuring the safety and well-being of children. As the case progresses in court, we can only hope that justice will be served and that the children will receive the support and care that they need to thrive.
