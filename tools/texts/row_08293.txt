article: (CNN) -- Russian singer Evgeny Nikitin has pulled out of one of the world's best-known opera events, the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, because he has a Nazi tattoo, organizers said Sunday. Nikitin was in a heavy metal band as a young man, and got the swastika tattoo then, said festival spokesman Gunther Philipowski. "That is a problem in Bayreuth," Philipowski said. "Bayreuth has a bad history with the Nazis. It's clear that Bayreuth has to be careful about this terrible part of history and has to take a position against it." The festival is dedicated to the works of Richard Wagner, one of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's favorite composers. Hitler attended the Bayreuth Festival regularly, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia, which describes Wagner as "an artist long associated with anti-Semitism" and the racist-nationalist volkisch tradition "from which the Nazis drew much of their ideology." Nikitin, 38, a bass-baritone, has "painted over" his Nazi tattoo, and it would not have been visible during his performance in "The Flying Dutchman," Philipowski said. But there are videos of him online where the tattoo is visible, he said. "I had the tattoos made when I was young. It was a big mistake in my life and I wish I had never done it," Nikitin said in a statement released by the festival. Nikitin canceled his appearance after discussions with Bayreuth management, the spokesman said. He had already been in Germany rehearsing for his premiere on Wednesday, Philipowski said. Nikitin's agent did not immediately respond to CNN questions about the cancellation. His website still lists him as appearing in "The Flying Dutchman" at the festival this summer. The festival website does not list him in the cast.

chatgpt: Russian baritone Evgeny Nikitin has withdrawn from performing at the Bayreuth Festival this week after controversy erupted over a past tattoo. The festival, which performs the works of composer Richard Wagner, a favorite of Adolf Hitler, said Nikitin had a Nazi swastika tattoo from his youth when he was in a heavy metal band. The Bayreuth Festival is one of the world's most prestigious classical music events and has been running since 1876. It is dedicated to the music of Richard Wagner and is held every summer in Bayreuth, Germany. The festival has a strict code of conduct for its artists and Nikitin's tattoo was deemed inappropriate for a performer at the event. According to the festival officials, Nikitin has apologized and explained that he had since removed the tattoo, which was done when he was young and not thinking. Artists' pasts have come under scrutiny in recent years, as people question whether they should be held accountable for things they did when they were younger. In this case, Nikitin's tattoo was deemed too offensive for him to perform at the festival. Nikitin is not the first artist to pull out of the Bayreuth Festival due to controversy. In 2012, conductor Philippe Jordan withdrew from the event after it was revealed that he had made comments about French people being lazy. The festival is known for its strict adherence to tradition and its conservatism. It is seen by some as promoting a nationalistic and elitist agenda, and has been criticized for its portrayal of women and minorities in its productions. The controversy surrounding Nikitin's tattoo comes at a time when the festival is already under scrutiny for its past associations with the Nazi regime. Wagner himself was known for his anti-Semitic views and his music was embraced by Hitler and the Nazi party. Despite this controversy, the Bayreuth Festival remains a popular and respected event for classical music fans around the world.
