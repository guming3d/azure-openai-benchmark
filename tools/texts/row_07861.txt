Diane Edwards, 57, who lives in the house with Keiron, her grandson, was visibly shaken by the incident. She was out visiting her son at the time of the crash, but travelled home immediately after her daughter phoned to tell her what had happened. Ms Edwards, who has lived in the property for 35 years, said: 'Every Sunday I go up to my son’s for dinner. My daughter phoned me and said there was either a car in the garden or in the house. 'We both came straight home. It is lucky it didn’t go in far.' Firefighters, ambulance crews and police attended the scene shortly after 8.20pm. A spokeswoman for South Wales Police confirmed two men from Swansea had been arrested in connection with the incident. A 22-year-old was arrested on suspicion of driving with excess alcohol, and a 24-year-old was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop and report a collision. Penderry councillor Terry Hennegan lives close to where the incident happened and said it was the first incident of its kind in four or five years. It is not known if speed was a factor in the collision, but he said cars being driven too fast had been a problem in the past. Mr Hennegan said: 'There was a time when there was a lot of it going on up here, but police and the community came together and that was stamped out. 'It is sad that something like this has happened, but it is an isolated incident.' Mr Hennegan said he knew the family who lived in the house and praised them for their work in the community. A spokesman for Swansea Council, which owns the property, said: 'We initially responded to the incident on Sunday evening. 'The property was checked for structural damage and considered safe. 'Housing officers have since visited the tenant to offer appropriate advice. 'Arrangements have been made for a further inspection of the property and any necessary repairs will be undertaken as soon as possible.'
