article: (CNN) -- Atlanta police have launched an internal investigation into filmmaker Tyler Perry's claim he was racially profiled by two white officers who pulled his car over, the police department said. Perry, one of America's most successful film and television producers, put a post on Facebook on Sunday describing a tense encounter with police, which he suggested "could have turned for the worse." "It was so hostile," wrote Perry, who is African-American. "I was so confused. It was happening so fast that I could easily see how this situation could get out of hand very quickly. I didn't feel safe at all." The Atlanta Police Department gave a statement to CNN on Wednesday confirming that two officers recently "encountered Mr. Tyler Perry during a traffic stop." "Mr. Perry's concerns, as recently expressed by him publicly, will be the basis for referral of the matter to the department's Office of Professional Standards," the statement said. "OPS has opened an investigation to determine if Mr. Perry's claims can be substantiated, and whether any departmental policies or procedures were violated during the stop." The investigation began Tuesday, and no action has been taken against the officers involved, a police spokesman said. Perry acknowledged that he made a left turn from a right lane, which a police officer told him was illegal and the reason for stopping him. It was a practice recommended by his security team in case he was being followed, Perry said. The misunderstanding and tension described by Perry suggests that the two white officers did not recognize him as one of Atlanta's richest and best-known citizens. It happened a few days before Perry hosted President Obama at his studio on March 17, he said. The tension was defused after another police cruiser pulled up to the scene, Perry wrote. "This officer was a black guy," Perry wrote. "He took one look at me and had that 'Oh No' look on his face." The black officer spoke "in a hushed tone" to the two white officers, he said. "After that, one of the officers stayed near his car while one came back, very apologetic," Perry wrote. Perry did not identify the officers or specify which police department in the Atlanta metropolitan area they were from. Perry posed a question to his readers: "Do you see how quickly this could have turned for the worse?" Perry's posting, which has drawn more than 101,000 "likes" and 18,426 comments, told what happened when two white police officers stopped him even though he has directed and acted in at least 16 feature films. But his movies are most popular among African-American audiences, and Perry is often dressed in drag as his "Madea" character. The traffic stop happened near Perry's southwest Atlanta movie studio last month, according to the posting. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Last month, Atlanta police officers stopped the car of prominent filmmaker Tyler Perry in what may have been a case of racial profiling. The Office of Professional Standards is currently looking into the matter to determine whether Perry was unfairly targeted due to his race. Perry, who is well-known for his work in television and film, took to social media to share his experience with his fans. In a Facebook post on Sunday, Perry described the encounter as "so hostile," saying that he was surprised and disappointed by the way he was treated by the officers involved. According to Perry, the tension began to dissipate when a black officer arrived on the scene and explained who he was. It was at this point that the officers seemed to realize their mistake and apologized to Perry for the way they had treated him. The incident has sparked outrage among many members of the community, who are calling for an investigation into the officers' actions. Some are questioning whether racism played a role in the decision to stop Perry's car, given that he is a successful black man who is well-known throughout Atlanta and beyond. The Office of Professional Standards has promised a thorough investigation into the matter, noting that racial profiling is not condoned by the department. If it is found that the officers involved did indeed unfairly target Perry due to his race, they could face disciplinary action or even be terminated from their positions. The incident also highlights the ongoing problem of racial profiling in law enforcement across the country. While some argue that it is a necessary tool in fighting crime, others note that it can lead to unjust treatment of innocent people based solely on their appearance. Perry's case is just one of many examples of racial profiling in recent years. Many have pointed to the need for police departments to do more to prevent and address these types of incidents, including better training for officers and greater accountability within police departments. For his part, Perry has said that he hopes the incident can be used as a learning opportunity for both the police department and the community at large. He has urged his fans and followers to continue speaking out against racism and discrimination, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and just society.
