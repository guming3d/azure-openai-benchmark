Here’s one answer to a strike by petrol-tanker drivers – a vehicle that does a whopping 584mpg. Called the Lamina – it was built by a team of engineers from the California Polytechnic State University for this year’s Shell Eco-Marathon held in Houston, Texas. The downside, however, is that there’s only room for the driver. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Efficient: The Cal Poly car achieved 584mpg in the Shell Eco-marathon . The Lamina was entered in the event’s prototype class. It’s powered by a modified Honda generator and can hit 25mph flat out. Its low fuel consumption is partly achieved by coasting. In posts to National Geographic's ‘The Great Energy Challenge’ blog, driver Ann Peters reported that, with the Lamina ‘we aimed to combine sleek aerodynamic shapes with ergonomic design in order to minimize weight’. Slow and steady: Lamina will get you far - but can only reach 25mph . The power plant: Lamina's engine is a modified Honda generator . Wheel-y clever: The Lamina demonstrates that gas-guzzling is strictly necessary . The vehicle's name is Latin for ‘thin layer,' she noted. ‘We felt it described the vehicle's bladelike lines and sharp styling. ‘The design begins with a 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model using SolidWorks software. Then comes extensive design reviews. Finally, the whole project ends with the complete manufacturing of the vehicles done entirely on the Cal Poly campus by students.’ Cal Poly joined more than 1,000 high school and university students from throughout North and South America who designed and built 113 vehicles to compete in one or both of the event's two types of vehicle classes: Prototype and UrbanConcept. The teams can use either internal combustion or e-mobility energy sources, which include diesel, petrol, ethanol, FAME, solar, hydrogen and battery electric technologies .

chatgpt: A new electric bicycle has been introduced by a popular brand. The bike offers a unique combination of speed and power, as it is powered by a modified Honda generator and can hit 25mph. This impressive speed is thanks to the bike's electric motor that produces an outstanding amount of torque. The bike is designed for both city and off-road riding. It is equipped with high-performance suspension and wide tires that provide excellent grip and stability on all kinds of terrain. It also has a robust frame that is built to withstand the demands of intense off-road riding. The bike's electric motor is powered by a Honda generator that has been modified to provide more power. This modification allows the bike to reach its impressive top speed and also enhances its acceleration. The generator's battery has a capacity of 2000Wh, which provides enough power for the bike to travel up to 100 miles on a single charge. Not only is the bike fast and powerful, but it is also environmentally friendly. It produces zero emissions and does not require any gasoline or oil to operate. This makes it an excellent choice for those who are concerned about the environment and want to reduce their carbon footprint. The bike's design is sleek and modern, with clean lines and an overall minimalist aesthetic. It is available in several colors, including black, white, and silver. The bike also features a range of modern technology and features, including an LCD display that shows speed, battery life, and other important metrics. Overall, this new electric bike is a remarkable achievement in modern transportation. It combines speed, power, and environmental consciousness in a sleek and modern design. Its unique combination of features makes it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-performance electric bike that can handle both city and off-road riding.
