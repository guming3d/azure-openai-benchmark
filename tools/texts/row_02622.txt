A Florida mother has been charged in the death of her 11-month-old son whom authorities say she left inside her hot car making her third related arrest only months after social workers deemed her children to be 'safe.' Catalina Marista Bruno, 30, was charged with aggravated manslaughter in Miami-Dade County on Saturday after her son’s unconscious body was pulled from her car with a temperature of 109-degrees on Thursday. Police say Bruno left her son, Bryan Miguel Osceola, in the vehicle around noon and forgot about him. Charged: Catalina Marista Bruno, 30, is charged with aggravated manslaughter after police say she forgot her 11-month-old son inside her car . After an undetermined amount of time passed, the boy's father told police that he asked Bruno where the child was. The mother recalled leaving him in the vehicle. That's when the child's father, Amos Osceola, ran outside and pulled his son's body out of the car. A beer can and the mother's purse were also found inside the vehicle, the Miami Herald reports. This week's arrest marks Bruno's third on similar charges. In November Bruno was arrested for child neglect and driving under the influence after she was found passed out behind her steering wheel with her infant son unstrapped in the front seat. Police say she hit several walls before passing out, leaving the car in drive. Behind bars: On Saturday a judge set Bruno's bail at $250,000 and took away her custody of her two surviving children and her right to unsupervised contact with minors if she posts . In July she was also found drinking by police who were called to her home over a report of domestic violence. Her husband was arrested in that incident for beating her in front of their three young children. But despite her arrests, Bruno never underwent alcohol treatment, parenting classes or any other services. The Department of Children & Families said Bruno's children were at 'moderate' risk following July's domestic attack but otherwise deemed 'safe,' the Herald reports. Bruno's attorney told NBC Miami that he doesn't believe her latest arrest shows substantial connection to her previous incidents with the DCF. 'With that underlying case there's a presumption of innocence. She has not been found guilty of that particular case. I don't think there's any allegation that there was any alcohol involved in this particular case. So, I don't think that case bears anything with respect to this case,' Frank Gaviria said. Bruno's bond is set at $250,000 for her latest arrest. A judge has ordered that if she is posts bond she not have any unsupervised contact with minors, custody of her two surviving children, be allowed to operate a vehicle and she would have to wear a GPS monitoring device while on house arrest.

chatgpt: Catalina Marista Bruno, a thirty-year-old woman, is facing charges for aggravated manslaughter after the death of her eleven-month-old son. The tragic incident happened back in November of last year, when Bruno was arrested by authorities for child neglect and driving under the influence while her baby was seated in the front seat. Despite authorities’ intervention, Bruno's children were deemed safe by the Department of Children & Families, and they were allowed to stay under her care. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for her youngest child. According to police reports, Bruno was driving erratically with her baby in the car seat next to her. She was allegedly under the influence, which led her to lose control of the vehicle and hit a concrete barrier. The impact was so severe that Bruno's son suffered serious injuries that caused his untimely death.  The Florida Department of Children & Families said that they had a history with Bruno and her family. However, despite their concerns, they did not remove the children from her home, stating that there was no evidence of abuse or neglect. The department did, however, offer assistance, providing her with services to help her care for her children better. In light of the tragic incident, the community has been left in shock and questioning whether enough was done to protect the children in Bruno's care. Critics have accused the Department of Children & Families of neglecting their duty of care, allowing Bruno and her children to slip through the cracks. The Department of Children & Families acknowledged that there were issues with their previous handling of Bruno's case. The agency stated that they have reviewed their procedures and identified areas for improvement. They have also launched an investigation into the matter, and they have promised to make necessary changes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Bruno has been charged by the authorities with aggravated manslaughter and is currently being held in prison. The case has not yet gone to trial, and it remains to be seen what will happen next. The community is standing in solidarity with the family, and they are expressing their condolences to the loved ones left behind. The death of an innocent child under such circumstances is undoubtedly unsettling, and it has left many questioning whether there needs to be a more stringent procedure in place for protecting vulnerable children. The case has also highlighted the need for the Department of Children & Families to conduct thorough investigations and take appropriate measures to ensure that children in similar circumstances are safeguarded adequately. The tragic incident involving Bruno and her son is a devastating reminder that child protection is everyone's responsibility, and it is essential to take these matters seriously. It is hoped that the case will be resolved soon, and justice can be served for the victim and his family.
