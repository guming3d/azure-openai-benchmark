They say he survives on a wing and a prayer, but daredevil Espen Fadnes needed a little more skill than faith as he took on his latest breathtaking challenge. In this amazing footage Fadnes uses a wingsuit to pass underneath the arm of the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio, along with fellow adrenaline junkie Ludo Woerth. The pair flew up to 6,500ft on trikes - motorised hang gliders used to give tourists aerial views of the city - before leaping off. Scroll down for video . Breathtaking: Fadnes uses a camera fitted to his chest to film the moment he passed under the statue's arm, plummeting from more than 6,500ft . All clear: Christ the Redeemer can be seen over Fadnes' right shoulder after he passes underneath its left arm. The statue stands almost 100ft tall and has an arm span of 92ft . In his sights: Fadnes said the stunt was nearly called off due to wind, and that after making the decision to go ahead he was nervous and scared . The duo were supposed to be accompanied by Jokke Sommer, but only two trikes were available on the day so he had to be left on the ground. The jump was nearly abandoned in its entirety because of wind conditions around the statue, which could have blown the jumpers off course and caused a fatal accident. However, Fandes remained determined. He said: 'We did not come to Rio to not fly past the Jesus statue. When we made that decision I felt my heartbeat pounding and I became really scared and nervous.' After assessing the weather conditions and deciding they could make the leap, Fadnes and Woerth set off in the early hours to get the cleanest run possible. The best view in Rio: Fellow sportsman Ludo Woerth, from France, filmed the stunt by flying above Fadnes and using a camera on his chest . The dangerous stunt was completed using one of these specially designed wingsuits which slow down the wearer's free-fall speed allowing them more control in the air . A third man, Jokke Sommer (pictured) was also supposed to jump, but was unable to because of a lack of trikes - motorised hang gliders the athletes used to get into position . On the jump itself Fadnes was nominated to fly underneath the arm himself, as he was most comfortable in the suit, while Woerth flew above him and used a camera strapped to his chest in order to film the stunt. Luckily, the dangerous manouvre passed off without a hitch. The wingsuit fliers landed at a Rio roundabout in the early hours, before heading back to their hotel for a celebratory breakfast beer.
