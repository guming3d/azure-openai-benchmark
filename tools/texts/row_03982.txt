Mr Sarkozy, 57, is said to have personally accepted brown envelopes full of cash from the multi-millionaire’s family. They were paid to help fund Mr Sarkozy’s 2007 election campaign, in return for massive tax breaks when he came to office, it is alleged. Fraud squad officers have already raided the Paris home Mr Sarkozy shares with his former supermodel wife, Carla Bruni. This happened just two weeks after the conservative Mr Sarkozy lost his immunity from prosecution after being defeated in the May presidential election by Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate. It was the first time that a former president’s home was subjected to a police raid, with Socialist interior minister Manuel Valls saying that Mr Sarkozy ‘is answerable to the law like anyone else.’ A number of former employees of Mrs Bettencourt have the told the judge that Mr Sarkozy discreetly turned up at her mansion in the Paris suburb of Neuilly to pick up money.

Judge Gentil has already cited two withdrawals of 400,000 euros each by Mrs Bettencourt which are said to have been handed over in person to Mr Sarkozy and his former treasurer, Eric Woerth. Mr Woerth later became employment minister but resigned in 2010 over the growing funding scandal, over which he has now been charged. French law limits individual donations to political parties to 7,500 euros (£6,000) per person per year and 4,600 euros (£3,700) during political campaigns. Only 150 euros (£120) may be given in cash. Mr Sarkozy was due to appear before the Bordeaux judge on Friday, but the appearance was moved back to this week, reported Paris radio station Europe 1. Last December Mr Sarkozy’s predecessor as president and mentor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty of embezzlement in a Paris court and given a suspended prison sentence. Mr Sarkozy can be questioned as a ‘witness’ or a ‘suspect’ or placed under formal investigation – one step short of a charge - for breaking electoral law. If prosecuted and found guilty, Mr Sarkozy would also face jail. Mr Sarkozy, who has been unemployed since May, denies any wrong-doing. He is facing a number of other corruption enquiries, including claims that he accepted millions from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy has previously claimed that the Gaddafi accusations are 'grotesque'.

chatgpt: Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is set to face further grilling over his alleged relationship with L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt. The 57-year-old is said to have personally accepted brown envelopes filled with cash from the multi-millionaire’s family. It is alleged that these funds were used to help finance Mr. Sarkozy’s 2007 election campaign in return for favourable tax breaks when he took office. Mr. Sarkozy has faced mounting speculation surrounding his connections with Bettencourt, who is now deceased. This is not the first time that he has been questioned over his links to the L’Oreal family, and the latest revelations are expected to intensify pressure on the former President. The case has been ongoing since 2010 when French investigative website Mediapart broke the story about the alleged payments with a recorded conversation. Since then, multiple witnesses have been interviewed, and documents concerning the case have been seized. Investigations have shown that Bettencourt provided financial support to Sarkozy’s political party, the UMP, during the 2007 presidential election campaign, which led to Sarkozy being elected as President. The evidence allegedly implicates Sarkozy himself, and not merely members of his campaign team, raising serious concerns about the former President’s conduct. The case has become one of the most significant political scandals in France, portraying the complex relationship between politicians and wealthy benefactors. It has also highlighted the issue of unethical conduct in politics, and the power of money in shaping government policies. The allegations against Sarkozy include accepting envelopes filled with cash ranging from €100,000 to €1 million. According to Le Monde, Sarkozy even communicated with Bettencourt through her lawyer, Patrice de Maistre, who is also accused in the case. Despite these allegations, Sarkozy has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the accusations as “smear tactics.” His defense team has challenged the legal basis of the investigation and claimed that the trial is politically motivated. However, the investigation continued, and Mr. Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation in 2018, where he was questioned for 26 hours. The former President also faced charges in the case of illegal campaign financing, although this was dropped in 2019 due to lack of evidence. Sarkozy is due back in court on October 22nd, where he is expected to face continued questioning over his connection with Bettencourt. The case has cast a long shadow over the former President's political career and may further damage his reputation if he is found guilty. The L’Oreal scandal and Sarkozy’s connection with Bettencourt demonstrate the need for transparency and ethical conduct in politics. With many voters increasingly disillusioned with corrupt politicians and their ties to wealthy donors, this case has become a focal point for much-needed change in the French political system. Until then, the ongoing investigation serves as a warning against corruption and an affirmation that no one is above the law.
