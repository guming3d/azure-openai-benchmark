Ms Bacon said: 'We knew she only had 12 months or less to live but she fought on. 'She went into Leicester Royal Infirmary on February 21 as she was coughing up blood. She was in a lot of pain. 'I was with her on February 27 and left at about 9.30pm. I think the hospital could have kept me better informed of her condition.' Hospital bosses say nurses are trained to deliver bad news in different ways and sometimes hide the truth on the phone so it can be delivered face to face when the family arrive. This is in case someone is so distraught they crash their car on the way to hospital, for example.

Policy: Leicester Royal Infirmary has said that nurses are advised to deliver bad news face to face where possible . Carole Ribbins, director of nursing at Leicester's Hospitals said: 'We take every opportunity to be as open and honest as possible when delivering bad news, with an ultimate aim to be as sensitive to the care needs and emotions of not only the patient, but also their relatives. 'As part of national training, nurses are advised to deliver bad news face-to-face where possible. However, we continue to review this and offer advanced three-day communications training to our nurses with Loros, specifically around end-of-life care. 'We would like to send condolences to Cheryl and her family for the loss of Karen and welcome the opportunity to discuss her mother's care in person.'
