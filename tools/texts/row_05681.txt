These stunning pictures show the incredible moment a killer whale flips a dolphin through the air. The unique pictures show the killer whale, leaping out of the sea, like the famous scene from the film Free Willy. An unfortunate dolphin finds itself in the whale's way and is sent somersaulting through the air by its giant fin. Catapulted: The dolphin is sent flying into the air as the killer whale breaches the surface . The series of incredible pictures, showing the strange ways of the animal kingdom, were taken by Jodi Frediani. The 65-year-old environmental consultant and photographer lives in Santa Cruz, California, where these spectacular shots were taken. Mr Frediani said: 'The photos of the killer whale tossing the dolphin was taken about three miles from shore. Impact: The huge killer whale had mistimed its strike, colliding with the dolphin and sending it skywards instead of sinking its teeth into the hapless creature . Hunter Vs. Hunted: The deadly battle between predator and prey took place miles from the shore off Santa Cruz, California . Back with a splash: The killer whale and dolphin come smashing back to the water after being launched in the air . 'I watched as the whales torpedoed through the water, but could not tell what they were hunting.' The action was fast, the whale did a major tail throw, attempting to bat the unfortunate dolphin and moments later, she came up from below flinging the dolphin through the air. 'As I watched through my lens, focused on the female killer whale, I saw the dolphin flying through the air like a bowling pin. Trapped: Stuck between two killer whales, the dolphin, centre, frantically tries to beat a hasty retreat from the predators . Shock: Wildlife photographer Jodi Frediani took the astonishing photo of the killer whale doing a tail throw in an attempt to bat the unfortunate dolphin unconscious . 'The vision took my breath away, according to the time stamp on my images, the toss took only one second. 'When travelling at speed like that, it is easiest for a killer whale to simply ram the dolphin with its head to kill it. 'Sometimes, the impact is so great and the trajectory just so, the prey flies through the air.'

chatgpt: Wildlife photographer Jodi Frediani was on a routine expedition off the coast of Santa Cruz, California, when she witnessed a rare and stunning scene of nature. Frediani's keen eye and quick reflexes allowed her to capture the moment Killer Whales were hunting dolphins on camera. As she was shooting the still waters of the Pacific Ocean, the peace and quiet of the afternoon were shattered by the sudden appearance of a group of about 10 killer whales. Within a few seconds, the hunt began, and the predator pods honed in on the dolphins. The hunter whales launched themselves towards their prey with such force that Frediani's camera caught the moment one of the dolphins was catapulted into the air. The environmentalist, who has been photographing wildlife for decades, has never witnessed such a display of power. "I saw the dolphin flying through the air like a bowling pin," said Frediani, 65. "It was an incredible sight to see. I have seen orcas hunting before, but I have never seen anything like this." The scene that Frediani witnessed was one of nature's most potent ways of showing the sheer force that killer whales can bring to bear during a hunt. Orcas rely on their intelligence and teamwork to take down their prey, and their success rate is one of the highest among all marine mammals. Frediani's footage of the hunt has garnered significant attention from wildlife enthusiasts around the world, and it has sparked renewed interest in the complex relationships that exist between these intelligent marine animals. Killer whales are renowned for their dramatic hunting strategies, which can include beaching themselves to capture their prey. But the method employed by the whale pods off the coast of Santa Cruz on this occasion was no less impressive. The hunt was short, lasting only a few minutes, but it was a stark reminder of the raw power that exists in nature. The sight of the killer whales launching an attack with such force that a dolphin was thrown into the air is sure to remain with those who witnessed it for some time. And for those who did not have the chance to see the images, Frediani's pictures capture the essence of the hunt in a way that words could never capture.
