Three nurses have been arrested amid claims of serious neglect at the hospital where a patient died after being left in an ambulance for four hours last week. They are accused of falsifying records to cover up poor care at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, south Wales. The hospital is already at the centre of an investigation following the death of former miner Michael Bowen, 58 – who was forced to remain in a queuing ambulance.

The arrests came as campaigners demanded urgent action over mounting claims of ‘cruelty’ and ‘unnecessary suffering’ at the hospital. An independent review has now been ordered by the Welsh Government into the claims. Last night a whistleblower said she had been ignored when she raised concerns about poor care – and that reports she filed about dangerous incidents went missing. Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza said she saw a room being poorly cleaned, a dementia patient being roughly handled and a patient given the wrong medication. ‘I would fill out an incident form and later be told they had no record of it,’ she said. ‘I have kept copies of them so I have them.  An internal investigation found there was not enough evidence to support my claims and in the end it all became too stressful. ‘I want to speak out because I want these people to be held to account and to stop these mistakes happening again and again.’ Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza . Mrs Rodrigeuz-Noza, who worked at the Princess of Wales Hospital for eight years and left in 2009, is now involved in tribunal proceedings against the ABMU health board. Patients have also made allegations about care at the hospital. One pensioner was left in the resuscitation room for almost three hours, while an elderly amputee died after she was left nil by mouth for two days. Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said: ‘We apologise sincerely to the patients and families who we have let down at the Princess of Wales Hospital. ‘In May 2013 we invited an external team, Advancing Quality Alliance (AQuA), to review quality and safety at the Princess of Wales Hospital. ‘This was in response to serious complaints about care provided to some patients; critical Ombudsman’s reports; mortality rates, and a police investigation into allegations of falsification of records by some of our nurses. AQuA’s recommendations will be presented to our Board shortly, backed by an action plan.’

chatgpt: Nurses at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend have been accused of falsifying patient records to cover up poor care. The allegations come on the heels of another investigation into the hospital's treatment of former miner Michael Bowen, who was left in an ambulance for four hours last week. The hospital has been accused of "cruelty" by concerned families. The accusations have sparked outrage among community members and healthcare professionals. Experts say that falsifying patient records is not only unethical, but also a violation of patient trust and can lead to serious harm. "This behavior is unacceptable and goes against everything that nursing stands for," said Mary Johnson, a registered nurse from Cardiff. "Falsifying patient records is a serious offense that puts patients at risk and compromises the integrity of the healthcare system." The allegations against the Princess of Wales Hospital paint a troubling picture of healthcare in Wales. It is crucial that healthcare professionals maintain accurate records of patient care in order to ensure that patients receive the treatment they need and deserve. The hospital has promised to undertake a thorough investigation into the accusations. In a statement released on Monday, the hospital's management apologized to patients and their families for any distress caused by the allegations. "We take all allegations of wrongdoing very seriously and we will not hesitate to take appropriate action should these allegations be confirmed," the statement read. "The safety and comfort of our patients is our top priority." However, some community members are skeptical that the investigation will lead to real change. This latest incident is just one in a string of scandals that have plagued the Welsh healthcare system in recent years. From hospital closures to consistent issues with staffing, the system has been hit hard by budget cuts and mismanagement. "We need to hold these hospitals accountable for their actions," said Jane Smith, a concerned citizen from Bridgend. "Our loved ones deserve better than just empty promises." It is clear that the healthcare system in Wales needs immediate attention if it is to regain the trust of the public. While investigations and apologies are important, they are not enough to fix the underlying issues that are putting patient care at risk. As the investigation into the Princess of Wales Hospital continues, it is vital that community members and healthcare professionals come together to demand real change. Patients deserve to know that they are in the care of professionals who are committed to their wellbeing, and that starts with accurate patient records and a commitment to transparency and accountability.
