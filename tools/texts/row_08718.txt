Heartwarming: Mary, who lives at the Busch Gardens wildlife park in Tampa, Florida, gave birth to a little girl on February 6 at 8:30pm . A video also sees her protectively carrying the infant around as it clutches the fur on her stomach. Jeff Andrews, vice president of zoological operations for Busch Gardens, explained that the first month will be the critical period as Mary and the infant begin to integrate into the current gorilla troop. A dedicated  animal care team will monitor their progress closely to ensure they settle in well. Mother gorillas spend a lot of time tending to their newborns, which are tiny compared to powerful adults and weigh just four pounds. The babies cling to their mother’s fur to keep warm and ride on their backs from the age of four months. They do this for almost three years when they are considerably larger. Stay back, I'm armed: Images of the 27-year-old new mother capture her feeding her one-week-old daughter and admiringly looking at her in her arms . The new baby gorilla at Busch Gardens is yet to be named. Her arrival marks the third successful gorilla birth at the zoo. Bolingo, the suspected sire, was the park’s first gorilla birth in 2005. The mother, Mary, came to Busch Gardens in February 2010 from Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, with her first daughter Pele, who just gave birth this past December to baby Enzi. There are now seven gorillas in Busch Gardens' troop. Guests will be able to see the recently expanded clan on the Myombe Reserve habitat over the coming days. The new addition is part of Busch Gardens’ participation in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP). Caught on camera: The new baby gorilla at Busch Gardens is yet to be named . The mission of the SSP is to cooperatively manage specific, and typically threatened or endangered, species populations such as lowland gorillas. The size of the wild gorilla’s population is unknown, but the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) believes that the Western lowland gorilla’s numbers have declined by more than 60 per cent over the last 20 to 25 years, leaving them critically endangered. As well as being threatened by human behaviour such as illegal hunting for their skins and meat and deforestation, female Western lowland gorillas do not produce many offspring. This is because they do not reach sexual maturity until the age of eight or nine and look after their dependent young for up to five years.

The happy event was announced by park officials, who revealed that both mother and baby are healthy and doing well. Images of Mary and her one-week-old daughter have been making the rounds on social media, capturing the hearts of people worldwide.

She has a special place in the hearts of both the staff and visitors at Busch Gardens, having lived in the park since 1983.

It has also been involved in numerous conservation projects, including the protection of cheetahs in Africa and the rehabilitation of manatees in Florida.
