article: Home captain Steve Smith's career-best 192 was the highlight of day two between Australia and India in Melbourne, but the tourists will be pleased with how they dug in when their time came to bat. Having witnessed the Baggy Green run up 530 from their overnight 295 for five, India - 2-0 down in the series - may have been expected to be worse off than they were at the close. They ended the day at the MCG on 108 for one, thanks to Murali Vijay's unbeaten 50, and although work remains to be done, they can take heart from their defiance. Steve Smith acknowledges the crowd after being dismissed on 192 runs against India in Melbourne . Smith was eight runs short of a double century as Australia took control on the second day of the third Test . Their resolve will have been severely tested by Smith and the Australian lower-order, though. Smith, shining as captain in place of the injured Michael Clarke, recorded his third straight hundred after resuming on 72, and had Brad Haddin with him for company, with the veteran keeper making 55. Smith's seventh test hundred came in 191 balls but he was not to stop there, even when Haddin left him as the only remaining recognised batsman, bottom-edging Mohammed Shami behind. That brought Mitchell Johnson to the middle and he put up an entertaining 28, going after 37 balls when R Ashwin tempted him down the pitch and he was stumped by MS Dhoni.

Ryan Harris was next in and the gnarled paceman offered some genuine surprise, going to a Test best 74 from 88 balls. Harris clubbed eight fours and a six while out in the middle, providing real frustration for the visiting attack who, at that stage, would have been hoping to keep Australia to around 450. Ashwin eventually did for Harris, getting him playing across the line, and when Nathan Lyon went to Shami for 11 all that remained was the question of whether Smith would get to a double hundred.

The answer was no, the skipper cleaned up by Umesh Yadav before heading off to a standing ovation after his 305-ball vigil. He quickly had to switch to tactical mode as India started their reply, and it was he who pouched the only wicket of the innings, scooping up Shikhar Dhawan for 28 off Harris. After that Vijay (55no) and Cheteshwar Pujara (25no) got to the close, although the latter was fortunate to see Haddin put him down - albeit off a difficult chance off Josh Hazlewood- when on 12.

chatgpt: Australia's Steve Smith put on a batting masterclass on the second day of the Bengaluru Test against India, scoring an impressive 192 before being bowled by Umesh Yadav. Smith's innings was defined by pure grit, patience, and a bit of luck. He was dropped twice by India, once on 23 and again on 153. Smith's innings was crucial for Australia, who are already 2-0 up in the four Test series. This being the third Test of the series, India were looking for some form of redemption to avoid a clean sweep. After a disappointing first day, where they were bowled out for 189, India came out determined to restrict Australia to as low a score as possible. But Smith had other plans, and he made sure that the Indian bowlers knew that he meant business. He played each ball on its merit, showing great skills in reading the pitch and adapting to the Indian spinners. His innings was filled with attacking shots and masterful defense, as he held the innings together for his team. Unfortunately for Smith, his stay at the crease came to an end when he was bowled by Umesh Yadav. But it was a remarkable innings from the Australian captain, which put his team in a strong position heading into day three. In response, India started off well, with Murali Vijay and KL Rahul putting on a 91-run stand for the first wicket. The Indian openers showed great composure and played each ball on its merit, not taking any undue risks. However, Rahul was unfortunate to get out for 90, caught by Mitchell Starc off Nathan Lyon's bowling. It was a good delivery from Lyon, which pitched on the rough and turned away sharply, taking the edge of Rahul's bat to hand Starc a simple catch. Following Rahul's dismissal, Vijay held the fort for India, reaching his half-century and remaining unbeaten at stumps on day two. Alongside Cheteshwar Pujara, he ensured that India ended the day on 108 for one, still trailing Australia by 81 runs. India will be hoping to continue their good work with the bat on day three, and put up a strong total to challenge Australia's lead. However, they will need to be wary of Australia's potent bowling attack, led by the likes of Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon. With just two more Tests left in the series, India will be desperate to avoid a whitewash, while Australia are keen to maintain their stronghold over the hosts. The Bengaluru Test is turning out to be an intriguing affair, which promises to go down to the wire.
