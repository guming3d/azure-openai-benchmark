He’s the property tycoon and fixer for oligarchs who went bankrupt, claiming he had lost his £2 billion fortune. She is the wife who insists he has hidden it to avoid paying her a divorce settlement. Now, while Scot Young, 49, and his estranged wife Michelle prepare for the next bitter battle at the High Court over their £400 million divorce, their younger daughter, Sasha, is putting pen to paper to record her feelings on the break-up that has destroyed her once luxurious family life. Sasha, 17, no longer at school because her father hasn’t paid the fees — she left £14,400–a-year girls’ day school Francis Holland in the summer — is looking for a publisher for what she describes as a ‘self-help children’s novel’. ‘I wouldn’t want anyone to go through what my sister and I have been through,’ says Sasha, who has eight GCSEs and would ideally be studying for her  A-levels now. ‘I am still hoping something good will happen out of the  next hearing and that I can go back to studying. ‘I know my situation is not the norm, but I still think I have something to say to help others.’ Former model Michelle, 47 — who in happier days was given £1 million worth of Graff jewellery for her 40th birthday by Scot — believes the court hearing on January 16 will be crucial. She insists she has hard evidence — retrieved from two laptops given to her daughters by her husband — that Scot has salted away his fortune in overseas bank accounts. She tells me: ‘I am proud of  my daughters. Scarlet has had to leave school, too, and she is working as a model. Sasha’s book is brilliant.’ Sasha adds: ‘I have learned a lot. I think I can help others. I am aiming the book at eight to 13-year-olds. ‘I don’t want to write a boring book of bullet points on how to deal with your parents’ marriage break-up and divorce. I don’t think anyone would read that. ‘So I am writing it in the form of a children’s novel with two main characters, who will be the children in a story based on all my real-life experiences.’ Battle: Tycoon Scot Young is going head-to-head with estranged wife Michelle .

chatgpt: Scot and Michelle Young are gearing up for their next High Court battle over their £400 million divorce. The couple has been embroiled in a bitter and high-profile separation since 2006, with both sides making allegations of financial impropriety against the other. In the latest development, it has emerged that their daughter, Sasha, is no longer attending school due to her father's failure to pay her school fees. This revelation has added a new layer of complexity to an already contentious situation. Sasha, who is now 23, is said to be preparing to put pen to paper and write about her experiences of her parents' break-up. It is unclear whether her account will be published or used as evidence in the upcoming court case. The Youngs' divorce has been one of the most acrimonious in recent memory, with both sides accusing the other of hiding assets and engaging in fraudulent activities. Scot has claimed that he has been left penniless by Michelle, while she alleges that he is hiding millions of pounds in offshore accounts. The case has been ongoing for over a decade, and has involved multiple court battles in jurisdictions around the world. In 2013, Scot was declared bankrupt after losing a court case in which he was ordered to pay Michelle £28.5 million. Since then, the legal dispute has centered around the question of whether Scot has hidden assets from the court, and if so, how much he owes Michelle in spousal support. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and has accused Michelle of fabricating evidence against him. The next High Court hearing is set to take place later this year, and is expected to last for several weeks. It is likely to be closely watched by divorce lawyers and legal experts, as it could set a precedent for future cases involving high net worth individuals. In the meantime, Sasha's decision to speak out about her parents' break-up has added a new dimension to the case. It remains to be seen what impact her account will have on the proceedings, but it is a reminder that divorce can have far-reaching consequences, both in the short and long term.
