chatgpt: A Pennsylvania father is facing criminal charges in connection with the tragic deaths of his two young daughters. David Beatty, 28, is being held responsible for the deaths of Brooklyn, 2, and Ryeley, 3, after a dresser fell on them in July. Prosecutors allege that Beatty heard a loud bang but did not check on the girls for 15 minutes, leading to their untimely deaths. The incident took place in the family's home in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. According to authorities, the girls were playing in their bedroom when the dresser fell over onto them. The dresser was reportedly unstable and was not properly secured to the wall. Beatty has been charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection with their deaths. It is unclear why Beatty did not check on his daughters immediately after hearing the loud noise. However, prosecutors say that his inaction played a role in their deaths. "If he had acted differently, those kids would be alive," said Assistant District Attorney Brittany Smith. Beatty's wife, Jennifer Beatty, 28, is also facing criminal charges in connection with the incident. She has been charged with two counts of child endangerment for allegedly keeping the children in "deplorable" conditions. According to court documents, the home was littered with garbage and dirty dishes, and the children were reportedly living in filth. The Beattys have two other children who were not harmed in the incident. They have been removed from the home and placed in the custody of a family member. The couple is scheduled to appear in court in October. News of the tragedy has deeply saddened the Aliquippa community. "It's just really heartbreaking," said one neighbor. "Those poor girls didn't deserve this. It's just unthinkable." The incident has also prompted renewed concern about child safety in the home. Authorities are urging parents to take extra precautions to ensure that furniture and other household items are properly secured. "These types of accidents are entirely preventable," said Smith. "We urge parents to take steps to protect their children from these kinds of hazards." As the Beattys prepare for their day in court, the community is mourning the loss of two young lives. The tragedy serves as a reminder of the importance of taking every possible measure to ensure the safety of children.
