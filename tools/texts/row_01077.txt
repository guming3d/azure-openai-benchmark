The work of photographer Adam Opris, 31, each of the real-life water babies poses with an item that reveals an element of their personality, whether a love of gymnastics or an ambition to become a mermaid.

For one sporty boy, only a baseball will do, while one cheeky youngster shows off his sartorial know-how in a pair of red sunglasses. Another betrays ambitions to become a musician and risks his much-prized saxophone to get the perfect underwater shot. Speaking about the series, Mr Opris said the point was to capture a wonderful childhood memory - and to have some fun at the same time. 'My photography is all about capturing memories. It's about catching the moments and bringing them back to life,' he explained. A girl is transformed into the little mermaid as she dives down on her mother's back .

'I love to see my models having fun - I just want them to feel natural,' he continued. 'I want my clients to look back on these photos and remember the time they spent, instead of just looking at a beautiful photo.' Mr Opris, of Miami, takes pictures of his clients' children playing around underwater as part of a set of photos which he then presents to the family. 'I started taking underwater pictures of pregnant women two years ago and it all just went from there,' he added. 'Now I take pictures of wedding couples, pregnant women and children underwater.'

chatgpt: Miami-based photographer Adam Opris has come up with an innovative photo project that aims to capture the essence of children's personalities. In his new photo series, children are seen posing with items that give a sense of who they are as people. From sports equipment to musical instruments, the photos are a window into each child's world. One particularly striking photo in the series shows a young boy braving an underwater shoot while wearing full knightly armor. In the photo, the boy is seen submerged in crystal-clear water, his armor glistening in the light. The image is a testament to both the boy's bravery and his imaginative spirit. Opris, who is known for his underwater photography and wedding photography, came up with the idea for the project after noticing that there was a lack of personalization in most children's photo shoots. He wanted to create something that would capture the unique personalities of each child, rather than just taking the usual posed shots. The project has been a hit with parents and children alike, with many families booking sessions with Opris to create their own personalized photos. The photos make for great family keepsakes, and also provide a creative outlet for children to express themselves. Opris believes that the project is particularly important in today's world, where children are often pressured to conform to certain societal norms. By encouraging children to embrace their individuality and express themselves through their photos, Opris hopes to promote a culture of acceptance and self-love. In addition to the knightly armor photo, the series includes a range of other striking images. One child is seen posing with a basketball, while another is holding a violin. Each photo tells a different story about the child, and together they form a compelling and insightful visual narrative. For Opris, the project is more than just a photography experiment. It's a way for him to connect with children and to help them express themselves in a unique and creative way. And judging by the success of the project so far, it seems that parents and children alike are benefiting from the experience.
