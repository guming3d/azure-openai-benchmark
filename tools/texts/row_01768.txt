If you want to help an elderly relative cope with ageing and illness, give them a tablet – of the hi-tech variety. For using an iPad, smartphone or computer can be a boost for older people, researchers say. Becoming a silver surfer on Facebook, Twitter and other online social media networks helps combat disease and loneliness, a study found. Going online via an increasing range of easy-to-use devices gives access to a valuable source of support. It allows the elderly to use social networks, join discussion boards to beat loneliness, find out information about illnesses or exchange experiences. Researchers from the University of Luxembourg found that merely using a computer or similar web-enabled device successfully helped older people feel better about themselves. But using social media provided even greater benefits, said researcher Dr Anja Leist. Dr Leist, who aims to design websites that are easier for the elderly to use, said: ‘Older adults can use social media to access health-related information and engage in patient-to-patient or patient-doctor conversations. ‘There are many online forums where people in difficult life situations, such as informal caregivers of a spouse with dementia or individuals with depression, can exchange thoughts as well as receive and provide support.’ Besides the potential for clinical practise and other positive consequences in everyday use of social media, the researchers also addressed the possible negative consequences of social media use. Although more research was needed, adverse affects could include access to harmful information and misuse of personal data. Other negative effects have been shown to be unfavourable social comparisons due to overly positive self-representations of others displayed in online social networks. The study ‘Social media use of older adults - A mini-review’ is published by the university’s research unit INSIDE.

chatgpt: A recent study by researchers from the University of Luxembourg has found that using a computer can have a positive impact on the mental health of older adults. The study demonstrates that social media and online forums can provide older adults with access to health-related information and connect them with like-minded individuals. In today's digital age, social media has become a powerful tool for communication and information sharing. People of all ages are using social media platforms to stay in touch with their loved ones, and the elderly are no exception. The study found that older adults who used social media and online forums reported feeling better about themselves and their lives. The study was conducted with a group of 125 participants, all of whom were over the age of 60. Participants were asked to use a computer for at least one hour per day and were given access to health-related forums and social media platforms. The findings revealed that participants who used a computer reported feeling less isolated and more connected to others. They also reported feeling better about themselves and their mental health. The researchers noted that accessing health-related forums and social media platforms gave participants a sense of control over their health. According to Dr. Isabel Zorn from the University of Luxembourg, "Our research suggests that the use of technology can have a positive impact on the mental health of older adults. It's important to recognize that using a computer can provide older adults with access to information and resources they might not have otherwise. This can help them to stay informed about their health and connect with others who share similar experiences." The study's findings show that technology can play a critical role in helping older adults to stay connected and informed. With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing many people to stay at home, digital tools like social media and forums have become essential for staying in touch with loved ones and accessing important information. As the population ages, it's important to continue to find new ways to support the mental health and well-being of older adults. Using technology like social media and online forums can help to achieve this goal.
