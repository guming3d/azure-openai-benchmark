Alfred stood on the busy station concourse with a sign advertising his skills after failing to find a graduate position despite applying for 300 roles . Alfred, from south London, started in a marketing role at recruitment agency the Asoria Group yesterday and now works just yards from the spot where he once stood looking for a job. He said: 'The director walked past me when he saw me that morning, but later got in contact through [the website] Linked In. 'The company said they were looking for someone with out of the box ideas and so they were keen to get me in.' In recognition of the fame his stunt brought him, Alfred's new colleagues made special T-shirts with his photo on them to welcome him on his first day. He added: 'The job is one I wouldn't have got if I hadn't gone to the station that morning, so I advise anyone out there who is in the same position I was to think of more direct ways to speak to employers.'

Thousands of commuters pass through Waterloo Station every day on their way to jobs in the City of London . Statistics show that almost half of recent graduates are now in 'non-graduate' or 'stepping stone' roles, such as bar-tending, and are struggling to get the positions they had hoped for. Alfred had always wanted to work in advertising, but after three years studying for his degree in the subject, was losing hope of ever joining the industry. In a last-ditch attempt to speak to potential employers, he went to Waterloo Station with an armful of CVs and was later inundated with offers. After months spent struggling to get an interview, he suddenly had a flood of offers and found himself able to choose his career path. He said: 'I knew this was somewhere I wanted to come and am really looking forward to the opportunity.'
