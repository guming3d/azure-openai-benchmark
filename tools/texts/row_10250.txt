article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- I can't even remember the last time I thumbed a message on its itty-bitty qwerty keyboard. And yet, I stubbornly keep my BlackBerry in my bag and on my desk, fully charged. As with my Palm Vx of yesterday, breaking up with a beloved gadget is hard to do, especially when you have history. My BlackBerry and I go back over 10 years. We met at a telecom conference in Hong Kong. I will never forget the wonder of our first wireless e-mail. Look, I'm no softie when it comes to loving and leaving my electronics. I've thrown out old Macs. I've recycled expired Sony Ericsson handsets. I've even trashed now-antique digital cameras. But this is the longest and saddest gadget breakup I've ever gone through. I can no longer accept its limits: A disappointing apps portfolio, clunky interface, and frankly lame camera. Over the years, we grew apart. I started to dabble in social media and mobile photography. The tools on offer from other devices were far better in functionality, speed and resolution. I wanted my BlackBerry to change, and yet it never managed to deliver. And suddenly, I felt like it just wasn't there for me. I have stopped using the beloved device. But like the other 50 million BlackBerry users still out there, I just can't pull the plug. Read more: BlackBerry's dwindling users ponder uncertain future . As with others suffering relationship issues in the digital age, I turned to social media for advice. "Make it quick. Drop it in the tub. Better for both of you," advised Beijing blogger Bill Bishop. Michael Sommer tweeted, "If it's not wounded or sick, no mercy killing. Put it into a vitrine." After looking up the word "vitrine," I realized that putting an expired gadget in a glass box is like taxidermy for a deceased pet. Sorry. Just can't go there. But not everyone was as keen to ditch the BlackBerry. My ever-compassionate colleague John Vause said, "Don't do it... it will get better... I promise." On Monday, BlackBerry announced that it was being taken private -- a headline that raised hopes among loyalists that change is sure to come. Meanwhile, my pal Eunice Yoon implored me to keep hope alive with the reminder, "the typing is so much easier!" But the doubt has already settled in, and I'm already starting to see my BlackBerry in the past tense. "Just for fun, I fire up my circa 2005 Treo 750 sometimes," reminisced J. L. Gatewood. That's one beautiful ode to throwback gadgetry. BlackBerry, I'm not quite ready to throw you out. You remain fully charged. Opinion: Why I'll never ditch my Blackberry .

chatgpt: After years of struggling to keep up in the smartphone market, BlackBerry Limited has announced their intentions to become a private company. The move comes as the company continues to face challenges in the ever-competitive smartphone industry. As part of the plan, BlackBerry CEO John Chen plans to put the company's focus on expanding their growing software segment, and providing high-security offerings in the enterprise market. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout, known for her attachment to her beloved BlackBerry device, had mixed feelings on the announcement. While she refused to let go of her BlackBerry, she did acknowledge that many other smartphones offer better apps and functionality. BlackBerry has been facing decline in market share for years, with many consumers opting for flagship devices that come equipped with top-tier applications not available on BlackBerry devices. However, BlackBerry's focus on security has continued to hold value in the enterprise market. The company hopes to capitalize on this with the expansion of its software segment, which has been gaining momentum as a growing source of revenue. Although BlackBerry devices were once the standard for business professionals, the company has failed to keep up with its competitors in terms of consumer appeal. BlackBerry's most notable feature has always been its physical keyboard, which many users preferred over touchscreen devices. However, they were slow to make the transition to touchscreen devices, losing out to competitors like Apple and Samsung who had already perfected their interfaces. As user habits and preferences continue to shift towards touchscreen devices, BlackBerry has struggled to find their place in the market. The company's recent foray into Android devices with their Priv and KEYone models were seen as a last-ditch effort to regain relevance but only received lukewarm responses. The move to become a private company comes after BlackBerry attempted to turn their fortunes around with a series of acquisitions and strategic partnerships. These efforts included a partnership with Chinese search giant Baidu to develop autonomous vehicle technology, and the acquisition of cybersecurity firm Cylance in November of 2018. While the decision to go private will take the company off the stock market and away from the scrutiny of public shareholders, it is not without risk. By going private, BlackBerry will have to rely on private investors to provide the necessary capital for growth and development. However, Chen is confident that the move is the right one for the company, citing the benefits of being able to focus on long-term strategy without the distractions that come with being a public company. BlackBerry's decision to become a private company represents a significant shift in strategy for the once-prominent smartphone manufacturer. While the move will allow the company to focus on its growing software segment and high-security offerings, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to revive the company's fortunes in the highly competitive smartphone market.
