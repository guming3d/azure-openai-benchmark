Nicholas Hunter, 37, today pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Fiennes and to threatening to kill Thomas Ollsen on April 22 last year at the restaurant in Mortlake, south west London. He does not deny the attack but his defence rests on the claim he was 'insane' when he launched himself at his victim. Speaking during the hearing at the Old Bailey, Judge Wendy Joseph said: 'His defence is he was insane at the time. 'If this is not accepted in relation to the murder charge he will bring up the question of diminished responsibility.'

He pleaded not guilty to both charges in a loud voice. James Fiennes was having a drink in an upmarket tapas restaurant, pictured, when a man went 'out of his mind' and repeatedly stabbed him . Prosecutor Zoe Johnson said: 'He has been judged fit to plead. A trial date has been set for March 16 which is expected to last seven days. 'It is clear there are complex mental health issues. 'The defence will not be making large admissions, apart from the odd point of discussion. The trial will rest on issues of mental health.' Psychiatric reports are being prepared on behalf of the prosecution and defence and will be ready before the trial. Judge Joseph told the defendant: 'You will be tried on March 16 of this year. Until then you will be kept at the hospital you are being treated at.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: In a tragic incident that has shocked the local community, James Fiennes was fatally stabbed by Nicholas Hunter while dining at a tapas bar. The incident took place on the night of 15th August, and Hunter has since been charged with murder. During the hearing at the Old Bailey earlier today, Hunter pleaded not guilty to the charges. He claims that he was insane at the time of the attack and therefore cannot be held responsible for his actions. The defense further argued that Hunter had a history of mental illness and was not in a sound state of mind when he committed the crime. The prosecution, on the other hand, presented strong evidence against Hunter, including eye-witness statements and CCTV footage from the scene. They argued that Hunter’s actions were premeditated and that he was fully aware of what he was doing at the time of the attack. James Fiennes was the second cousin of Sir Ranulph Fiennes, the famous Arctic explorer. He was well-known in the local community and was active in various charitable causes.

He further stated that his family would not rest until justice was served and that they hoped the court would deliver a fair verdict. This case has once again brought to the forefront the issue of mental illness and its impact on criminal behavior. The defense has argued that Hunter’s actions were a result of his mental condition and that he should be treated accordingly. The prosecution, however, maintains that Hunter should be held accountable for his actions and that mental illness cannot be used as an excuse for violent behavior. The trial is expected to last for several weeks, during which time both the defense and the prosecution will present their case to the court. The family and friends of James Fiennes will be closely following the proceedings in the hope that justice will be done.
