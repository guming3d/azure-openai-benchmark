Humans living 40,000 years ago in the area around Beijing were already genetically distinct from the ancestors of modern Europeans, DNA analysis has found. An international team of researchers sequenced DNA that had been extracted from the leg of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave near to the Chinese capital. Analyses showed that the Tianyuan human shared a common origin with the ancestors of many present-day Asians and Native Americans - but had already diverged genetically from ancient Europeans. The leg of the early modern human from Tianyuan Cave that was used for the genetic analysis: DNA sequencing showed a genetic profile already distinct from that of the ancestors of Europeans . The researchers also found that the proportion of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in the early modern human was no higher than in the present day population of this region. Researchers with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, took nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from a 40,000 year old leg bone unearthed at the Tianyuan Cave in 2003. They used newly developed techniques to enable them to identify ancient genetic material from an archaeological find even when large quantities of DNA from soil bacteria are present. The researchers then reconstructed a genetic profile of the leg's owner. Study leader Svante Pääbo said: 'This individual lived during an important evolutionary transition when early modern humans, who shared certain features with earlier forms such as Neanderthals, were replacing Neanderthals and Denisovans.' The genetic profile revealed that this early modern human was related to the ancestors of many present-day Asians and Native Americans but had already diverged genetically from the ancestors of present-day Europeans. In addition, the Tianyuan individual did not carry a larger proportion of Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA than present-day people in the region.

'More analyses of additional early modern humans across Eurasia will further refine our understanding of when and how modern humans spread across Europe and Asia,' said Professor Pääbo. Parts of the work were carried out in a new laboratory jointly run by the Max Planck Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. The study's findings have been published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

chatgpt: Researchers have sequenced the DNA of a leg bone found in a cave near Beijing and have made a fascinating discovery. The genetic analysis showed the bone had a common origin with modern Asians and Native Americans, despite being around 40,000 years old. However, while the bone’s DNA had some similarities to that of Europeans, there was evidence of genetic divergence from them. The cave in which the bone was found is called Tianyuan, and has previously been credited with having been inhabited by some of the earliest modern humans in China. The bone in question was found there in 2003, and has been the subject of much research since.  The new study into the bone’s DNA, published in the journal Current Biology, has shown that it belonged to a male who lived around the time when modern humans were spreading into Asia. Interestingly, the DNA also showed that this man had inherited about 25% of his DNA from a population that once lived in the region where modern day Europeans live. The research is significant in that it provides new insights into the genetic history of human migrations. The discovery that the bone’s DNA showed similarities between Asians and Native Americans demonstrates a close relationship between the two populations, and supports the theory that people migrated from Asia to the Americas during the last Ice Age. However, the fact that the man’s DNA had genetic divergence from that of Europeans is interesting. The researchers believe that this divergence may have been influenced by interbreeding with other early human groups in the Asian region. The study was led by Qiaomei Fu, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who said that the Tianyuan cave site is an important one for understanding the genetic history of China. “Several important specimens have been recovered from there and have contributed substantially to our understanding of human evolution in this region,” said Fu. The leg bone’s genetic data was compared with data from other early humans around the world, and the researchers discovered that the oldest modern humans in China shared more genetic similarities with the Tianyuan individual than with any other ancient human population, including ones from Europe or Siberia. In conclusion, the discovery of the leg bone’s DNA provides new insights into the genetic history of human migration, and shows a close relationship between Asians and Native Americans. While there is evidence of genetic divergence from Europeans, this can be explained by interbreeding with other early human groups in the Asian region. The study highlights the importance of the Tianyuan cave site in understanding human evolution in China.
