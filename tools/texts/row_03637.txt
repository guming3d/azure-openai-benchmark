article: Jailed: Vanessa Marie Yanez, 24, struck cycling postal worker Jesse Dotson Jr. while driving along El Segundo Boulevard, California, on June 26 last year . The daughter of a LAPD sergeant who attempted to cover up a fatal hit-and run by reporting the car stolen has been jailed for two years. Vanessa Marie Yanez, 24, struck postal worker Jesse Dotson Jr. while driving along El Segundo Boulevard, near Vermont Avenue, in Gardena, California, on the night of June 26 last year. Mr Dotson, 60, who had been riding his bicycle, was taken to hospital but died of his injuries three days later. Yanez, who admitted she had been drinking before the collision, failed to stop and told Huntington Park Police Department the next morning that her vehicle had been stolen. But a police officer had seen news reports of the collision and notified Gardena police about Yanez’s possible connection, the Los Angeles Times reports. Yanez’s car was found with its windshield shattered at her family home less than a mile from the crash site and is said to have surrendered to police when they went to her address. In August, she pleaded no contest to two felony counts - leaving the scene of a crash and perjury. She later pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter. Yanez is the daughter of LAPD Sergeant Arturo Yanez - and the veteran police officer is currently the subject of an internal investigation into whether he had any role in his daughter's attempt to cover up the crime. LAPD said the investigation in ongoing, NBC reports. Addressing Yanez in court, Mr Dotson's sister, Annette Dotson Woodard, said: 'You left my brother for dead. All along you knew you hit a human being. Annette Dotson Woodard (left) angrily asked Yanez why she left her brother Jesse Dotson Jr (right) to die . Yanez stares straight ahead in court as she is sentenced to two years behind bars for vehicular manslaughter . 'All you had to do was stop. This could have been avoided had you stopped. Just a few seconds may have meant my brother's life.' The hit-and-run victim's wife, Lorna Dotson, added: 'We loved him. It's really despicable that that's a child of law enforcement. Somebody that should have taught their child to do the right thing.' The family believe that Yanez’s two-year sentence was far too lenient, but with no criminal history prosecutors claimed the maximum six year term was always unlikely.

chatgpt: Vanessa Marie Yanez, 24, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for a deadly hit-and-run in 2013 that left a 60-year-old postal worker dead. Yanez, the daughter of an LAPD veteran, struck Jesse Dotson Jr. while he was riding his bicycle. Yanez did not stop after hitting Dotson and instead reported her car stolen the next day. During the trial, Dotson's family shared their emotional victim impact statements. Dotson's sister tearfully addressed Yanez, saying, "All you had to do was stop...just a few seconds may have meant my brother's life." Dotson succumbed to his injuries and died three days after the incident. Yanez was charged with vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, hit-and-run causing injury or death, and insurance fraud. She pleaded guilty to all charges in October 2019. According to reports, Yanez was driving her father's Mercedes-Benz when she struck Dotson. She initially denied any involvement in the collision and claimed that her car had been stolen. However, evidence from the scene of the accident led detectives to Yanez. In court, Yanez expressed remorse for her actions and apologized to Dotson's family. "I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused," Yanez said. "I wish I could take it back, but I can't. All I can do is learn and grow from it and make a positive impact in society." The judge in the case acknowledged Yanez's apology but also noted the severity of her crimes. "You took a man's life and then tried to cover it up," Judge Steven Van Sicklen said. "Your actions have consequences and you must be held accountable for them." Dotson's death is a tragic reminder of the importance of following traffic laws and being aware of other people on the road. Hit-and-runs are a serious crime that can result in severe consequences not only for the victim but also for the perpetrator. Yanez's case is a testament to this fact. Yanez's sentence serves as a warning to others who may be tempted to flee the scene of an accident. It also brings some closure to Dotson's family who have been grappling with their loss for almost eight years. As the community mourns Dotson's passing, it is important to remember the message that Yanez's sentence sends: hit-and-run incidents are unacceptable on our streets, and those responsible will be held accountable.
