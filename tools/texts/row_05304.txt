article: A captain involved in a Hong Kong ferry disaster which left 39 partygoers dead - including a British child - has been convicted of manslaughter. Lai Sai-ming was found guilty of 39 counts of manslaughter, and also found guilty of endangering the safety of others at sea after a 60 day trial. The accident was Hong Kong's worst maritime disaster for more than four decades. Sunk: The pleasure cruiser, carrying 124 people, including three members of staff, went down shortly after 8pm on October 1, 2012 . Trail: A 60 day trial saw Chow Chi-wai, left, skipper of the pleasure cruiser, and ferry captain Lai Sai-ming, right, point the blame at each other . Lai was captain of the Kowloon Ferry's Sea Smooth, which collided with the pleasure cruiser Lamma IV near the island of Lamma, around two miles south west of Hong Kong island, in October 2012. The Lamma IV - which had 124 people on board, including three staff members - was taking a group out to watch the fireworks. The fireworks were part of a celebration for China's national day. But the two boats collided, and the pleasure cruiser sank shortly after the ferry collided with it at about 8pm, leaving 39 dead, including eight children, and more than 100 needing hospital treatment. At the time, it was reported a British child was among the dead. The high-speed ferry managed to make it back to shore. The Lamma IV's skipper, Chow Chi-wai, had also been accused of manslaughter, but was cleared by the same jury after 35 hours of deliberation, the South China Morning Post reported. But he was found guilty of endangering lives of others at sea. Devastating: The sinking was the worst maritime disaster to take place in Hong Kong waters since 1971 . Death toll: A total of 39 people died, including eight children. At the time, it was widely reported one of the children was a Brit . Both men had pleaded not guilty to all charges, and had pointed the finger of blame at each other during the trial. Chow's lawyer refused to comment after the hearing, while Lai's lawyer confirmed his client was due to be sentenced on Monday. It was Hong Kong's worst maritime disaster since 1971, but several other incidents since -- including two high-speed ferry accidents which injured scores of passengers and the grounding of a large container ship -- have worried those who cross Hong Kong's waters.

chatgpt: After a long-running trial, the captain of a ferry that collided with a pleasure cruiser off the coast of Hong Kong has been convicted of manslaughter. Lai Sai-ming was found guilty of causing the death of 39 people, including eight children, when his boat collided with the cruiser in October 2012. The incident, which occurred in the waters near Lamma Island, was one of Hong Kong's worst maritime disasters in recent years. During the trial, which lasted 60 days, prosecutors argued that Lai had failed to take sufficient care when navigating the ferry. They claimed that he had been distracted by his mobile phone and had failed to keep watch for other vessels in the area. In addition to manslaughter, Lai was also found guilty of endangering lives at sea. The pleasure cruiser was carrying 121 partygoers and three staff members at the time of the collision. Shortly after the crash, the vessel sank, leaving many passengers trapped below the waterline. Despite the best efforts of rescue teams, 39 people lost their lives in the incident. The tragedy sent shockwaves through Hong Kong's industry and prompted calls for tougher safety regulations. At the time, it was reported that one of the victims was a British citizen, although their identity has not been publicly confirmed. The UK Foreign Office offered support to the family of the deceased and condemned the incident as a "terrible tragedy." Throughout the trial, Lai maintained his innocence, insisting that he had done everything in his power to avoid a collision. He claimed that his vessel had been hit by a sudden gust of wind and that he had been unable to steer clear of the cruiser. However, the jury was not convinced, and Lai has now been sentenced to a term of imprisonment that has not yet been disclosed. The verdict in the case has been widely welcomed by members of the public, who had been following the trial closely. There had been concerns that Lai might receive a lenient sentence, given his status as a veteran mariner. However, the judge in the case took a tough stance, describing Lai's actions as "reckless" and "negligent." The incident has prompted calls for greater safety regulations to be put in place for the maritime industry. Critics have argued that lax safety standards and a lack of enforcement have contributed to a number of accidents in the waters around Hong Kong. In the wake of the tragedy, authorities have promised to tighten up safety procedures and increase inspections of vessels. In conclusion, the conviction of Lai Sai-ming marks the end of a lengthy and emotional trial. While it will not bring back the victims of the disaster, it sends a clear message that those responsible for maritime accidents will be held accountable for their actions. The tragedy has highlighted the importance of safety in the industry and serves as a reminder that more must be done to ensure the well-being of passengers and crew.
