article: A man has been forced to sell his Subaru Brumby ute by his wife because she's pregnant and there's no room for a baby seat. But Stuart Watt, 32, managed to pen a hilarious but gloomy ad for the quirky offroader which has clocked 280,000km since it was first registered back in 1992. The dramatic Gumtree ad hails from the Northern Territory, where Mr Watt is advertising the vehicle under the orders of his wife Zelina Carr. Watt has listed the 1992 Subaru Brumby for $2,500 - but he says finding a buyer has been problematic because everyone thinks the advertisement is just a 'joke'. Stuart Hall has posted a dramatic ad on gumtree offering his 1992 Subaru Brumby . The hilarious advert is filled with melodramatic language, but Mr Watt said the message rings true . And that's perhaps no surprise, given the ad is filled with dramatic language. 'Perhaps rather ironically, the cruelness of fatherhood is now set to callously deprive me of another 50-60 years of driving pleasure in this mighty beast,' he writes. Mr Watt describes how he has owned a string of other vehicles since then- a Hilux, Getz, CRV, Pajero, Pajero Junio - but that only his beloved Brumby has 'faithfully and stoically remained by my side'. He said his wife Zelina was expecting their second child at the time. 'With only days before childbirth is due,' the ad reads, 'my wife is getting a little frantic about irrelevant things. Namely: 'why haven't you sold the brumby yet??' He even accuses her heart of 'icing over' and claims she no longer understands the notion of sentimentality. Stuart Watt says his wife Zelina (pictured) is insisting they sell their car since it cannot offer a baby seat for their second child . Mr Watt said he has been approached by people on social media suggesting he 'keep the car and ditch the wife' After listing the cars extensive usage-which includes 280,000km and a broken speedometer-Stuart wrote 'yes she's old and has some inevitable wear and tear, but is super reliable and clearly super cool.' Mr Hall told Daily Mail Australia the ad has some sparked interest on social media. 'Some people have approached us on Facebook. They suggested I keep the car and ditch the wife. She naturally wasn't too happy about that.' He said since the ute can't fit a baby seat in it, and since his wife has just given birth to their second child, the Brumby is now obsolete as a family vehicle. 'There hasn't been a whole lot of prospective buyers for the car. Maybe people think it's a joke? It's a bit of a gag but the message rings true. The car needs to be sold.'

chatgpt: A man from Brisbane, Australia, has listed his 1992 Subaru Brumby for $2500, citing his wife’s request to sell the ute after the couple announced the pregnancy of their second child. Stuart Watt, a 32-year-old electrician, has been trying to offload the vehicle with little success. Although the car runs well, it has received little interest due to the exaggerated and dramatized language used in the ad, which has caused many to believe it is a joke. Watt’s ad on Gumtree, an online marketplace, has attracted considerable media attention, with headlines proclaiming it as “hilarious” and “the funniest car ad ever.” Watt says he did not expect the ad to go viral, but admits to being happy with the attention it has garnered. In the ad, he describes the car as a “beast” and claims it has saved his life in a zombie apocalypse. He also mentions that it possesses “all the bells and whistles,” such as a “f*cking loud” car stereo and a “gearstick that goes into reverse.” Watt’s humor shines through as he jokingly offers to throw in a complimentary copy of his “mixtape,” a collection of songs he’s recorded himself. Despite the ad's comedic tone, Watt is adamant that the car is in good condition and would be perfect for someone in need of a ute. He notes that he has used the car mainly for work purposes and that the interior is clean and well maintained. Watt reiterates his desire to sell the car due to his wife’s wishes and now, with the birth of their second child, he is even more determined to find a buyer. The Brumby, which was produced from 1978 to 1994, was marketed as a versatile and practical vehicle for those in need of a lightweight and efficient ute. It is known for its reliable engine and robust drivetrain, capable of handling tough terrain and heavy loads. Despite its many features, the Brumby has struggled to find buyers in recent years, with many car enthusiasts opting for newer and more advanced models. Watt’s ad has brought attention to this somewhat overlooked model, highlighting its many attributes and unique design. Car enthusiasts are impressed with the Brumby’s performance capabilities, and some have even offered to buy the vehicle for its parts alone. Watt jokes that he may need to sell the car for “scrap metal” if he doesn’t find a buyer soon. Despite the setbacks, Watt remains positive and determined to sell the car, vowing to continue his search until he finds the perfect buyer. He has received numerous messages of support from fans of the ad and encourages anyone interested in the car to contact him. With its humorous language and unique appeal, the Brumby is sure to find a new home soon.
