article: Pope Francis has urged people to put away their iPhones and start talking  as he warned his new cardinals to avoid lavish parties which stun 'worse than grappa on an empty stomach'. He said a great challenge facing people today is learning how to talk to one another again, rather than simply generating and consuming information on social media sites. In his annual message for the church's World Day of Communications, Francis said media can  help family members keep in touch, but also enable others to avoid one another.

'The great challenge facing us today is to learn once again how to talk to one another, not simply how to generate and consume information,' he said. The Pope said children first learn to communicate in the family and work out how to get along with people of different ages and experience. As a result, he said, families are the model for all communications as it is in the family where children first learn to forgive. 'A perfect family does not exist,' he said. 'We should not be fearful of imperfections, weaknesses or even conflict, but rather learn how to deal with them constructively.'

Francis also warned the new cardinals to avoid ostentatious festivities that 'stun worse than grappa on an empty stomach' In a letter written to the 20 new princes of the church he also told them to avoid ostentatious festivities that 'stun worse than grappa on an empty stomach' after they are formally elevated. Traditionally new cardinals are thrown lavish parties in Rome, often funded by  parishioners, after the Vatican ceremony where they receive their red hats -  expected to take place next month. Francis, known for his personal simplicity, said it would be fine to celebrate but urged his new cardinals to accept a party 'with humility' and keep their egos in check. 'Maintaining humility in service isn't easy if you consider being a cardinal as a prize, as the culmination of a career or a superior power,' he said in the letter published in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano. He has frequently spoken out against careerism in the church.

chatgpt: In a address to his new cardinals on Wednesday, Pope Francis talked about the importance of communicating with one another and cautioned against the use of technology during important social interactions. The Pope addressed the audience in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, urging them to put away their iPhones and Twitter feeds, and learn to talk to each other. He stressed the need for genuine and sincere communication, especially in the face of the growing prevalence of technology in our daily lives. "It is time to recover the importance of authentic communication in the face of the multiplication of digital devices," he said. While acknowledging the usefulness of technology in modern society, the Pope emphasized the importance of speaking to one another in person, rather than relying on technology to do so. "The richness of human interaction can never be replaced by technology," he added. The Pope also warned his new cardinals against indulging in lavish parties after their ceremony, noting that such festivities can "stun worse than grappa on an empty stomach." He urged them to be humble in their celebrations and to remember the importance of their positions as spiritual leaders of the Church. "Let us be careful not to fall into the temptation of the grandeur that does not belong to the Gospel," he said. The Pope's comments come at a time when the use of technology has become a common feature of social interactions. With the rise of social media and other digital devices, personal communication has declined in favor of virtual communication. Francis believes that this trend is not only harmful to personal relationships, but also damaging to society as a whole. "The richness of interpersonal relationships is a treasure to be preserved and nurtured," he said. His comments are likely to be welcomed by many who see the increasing use of technology as a major factor in the breakdown of traditional personal relationships. The Pope's message is clear: we must learn to talk to one another, rather than relying on technology, if we are to build a better world for future generations.
