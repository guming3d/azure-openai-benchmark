article: Hippos are not usually known for their subtlety but this hulking beast appears to be using stealth techniques while he sets his sights on his prey. The large mammal submerged itself before seemingly gliding gracefully head first out of the water. For a moment, its large head appeared camouflaged in the brown water and even looked more like a stalking crocodile than a cumbersome hippo. Making a wake: The hippo glides through the water, its head just above the surface, as a small wake forms on either side of it at the Chobe National Park in Botswana . Coming up: The surface of the water begins to bubble-up as the hippo spots a boat full of tourists and decides to take a closer look . In the event, its 'prey' was a nearby boat full of sight-seers which quickly made off when the skipper finally spotted the creature from the deep. Tourist Deena Sveinsson, a commercial airline pilot, had her camera at hand and managed to capture the moment which happened on the Chobe River in the Chobe National Park in Botswana. Deena, from Colorado, said there was about 30 hippos around in the water about 7am and all but one were busy either playing with each other or sleeping. Ms Sveinsson said: 'Although we were not very close this particular hippo felt we were and began chasing our boat. Eerily close: The hippo's ears can be seen just above the water line as it proceeds towards the boat while about 30 other hippos amuse themselves nearby . Breaking mad: The hippo appears out of the water, but not before the tourist boat driver guided his vessel and his passengers well out of harms way . 'Sensing this our driver drove the boat away as fast as he could as death by hippo is the number one cause of death in the African Wild. 'Nobody else on the boat caught on that we were being chased and I happened to turn around quickly to see it and snapped these photos.' When she looked over the pictures Ms Sveinsson said she was surprised at how graceful the hippo looked. She said: 'I realised that the one of him looking very graceful in the water was very special as it showed hippos in a different way, one that was not yawning or spitting.'

chatgpt: A group of about 30 hippos were enjoying a peaceful morning on the Chobe River in Botswana. Having a good time, they played with each other and took a lazy nap in the sun. However, their tranquil morning was interrupted by the arrival of a tourist boat. As soon as one of the hippos spotted the vessel, it went into stealth-mode. The massive mammal appeared above the water's surface, its eyes focused on the incoming tourist boat. The tourist, who was on board, said that the hippo looked like a crocodile as it stealthily swam closer and closer. Despite the boat's skipper trying to keep a safe distance from the hippo, it chased after the vessel gracefully. The tourist remarked that the hippo was "scary, but at the same time amazing". Even though hippos are quite large creatures, they are deceptively fast and are more than capable of outrunning boats. Eventually, the skipper managed to speed the boat away to safety, and the hippo stopped its pursuit. The tourist expressed their relief at having survived the intense encounter. Hippos are known to be one of the most aggressive animals in Africa and are responsible for killing more people in the continent than any other animal, besides the mosquito. These large, semi-aquatic mammals are generally peaceful, but when threatened or provoked, they can become fiercely territorial. Tourists are often warned to give these creatures a wide berth when they are spotted in the wild, as they can be unpredictable and very dangerous. Encounters like these are rare but serve as a reminder of the respect that should be given to the wilderness and the creatures that live there. It is important for tourists to follow the advice and guidance of experienced guides and tour operators when exploring the African wilderness. Overall, the incident was a thrilling experience for the tourists, who were able to witness the majestic beauty and raw power of these incredible animals. The lesson learned was that, while hippos may appear peaceful, they should be approached with caution.
