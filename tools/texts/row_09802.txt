Facebook's botched Initial Public Offering has drawn yet another lawsuit as angry investors are claiming Mark Zuckerberg knew his company's stock price would tank and sold out $1.1 billion-worth before shares slumped. The class-action says Zuckerberg, along with other Facebook executives and the banks behind the IPO, had inside information that the social media giant was over-valued, but didn't tell the public. This allowed the stock to open at more than $38 a share. The price immediately dropped precipitously in the days after the May 18 IPO.Â  By Monday afternoon, it had fallen 30 percent, to less than $27 a share. 'Zucked': Mark Zuckerberg has aroused so much anger about Facebook's IPO that he has inspired two lawsuits and a new word of disgust -- 'zucked' Analyst firm Bernstein projected Facebook had to fall another $2, to $25, before the company would reach its true value. Such is the anger over Facebook's IPO, the most anticipated in decades, that some critics are claiming it was a 'pump-and-dump' operation -- where the owners of a stock deliberately inflate the value based on false information and then cash out before the price collapses. Others have coined a new word to describe their financial state after Zuckerberg's social media giant went public -- 'zucked.' TMZ reports the new lawsuit, the second in two weeks, names Zuckerberg, along with Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. As evidence of Zuckerberg's knowledge, the plaintiffs cite the Facebook founder's disclosure filings that lists 30.2 million shares of the company he sold right after the stock went public. Initial public flop: Shares of Facebook have fallen 30 percent since Zuckerberg proudly announced the $38 IPO of his social media giant . The sale, at $38 a share, netted him $1.13 billion. If he sold the shares today, they would be worth $800 million. Other big-time Facebook investors, who got in on the company before the IPO, raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from dumping off their stock at $38 a share. The new lawsuit is similar to ones filed within days of the IPO, alleging that top executives knew their stock was going to tank after initial trading. Those suits say Facebook warned the banks behind its IPO that the company would fall short of its expected revenue for the second quarter. The banks knew this information, even as Facebook was selling its $16 billion stock offering to the public, the plaintiffs allege. Instead of coming clean with the damaging news, according to the lawsuits banks like Morgan Stanley shared it only with big investors -- allowing them to stay away from the stock until the price dropped to reflect the lower earnings. Facebook has previously strongly denied the allegations. Morgan Stanley has said it did nothing during the Facebook IPO that it wouldn't have done for any other company's stock offering.

chatgpt: Shares of Facebook, one of the world's largest social media platforms, have plummeted by an unprecedented 30 percent, a phenomenon that is causing significant concern among investors and analysts alike. The social media giant has struggled in recent years with a series of scandals and controversies, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal and several data breaches. The latest drop in share prices has been linked to several ongoing lawsuits against Facebook, which are alleging that the company misrepresented its financial health and performance to investors.  One of the most prominent lawsuits has been brought by a group of investors who allege that Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, deliberately misled them about the company's fortunes. The lawsuit claims that the notice which Zuckerberg issued to investors just before the IPO, announcing his decision to dump 30.2 million of his own shares, is proof that the company was in poor financial shape. The investors assert that Zuckerberg's decision to sell his shares was based on insider knowledge that Facebook's revenues would fall short of expectations.  This latest lawsuit is just one of several that have been filed against Facebook by investors and regulators. A previous lawsuit alleged that several banks, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, knew that Facebook's revenues would fall short of expectations but only disclosed this information to a select group of major investors. According to the lawsuit, the banks failed to inform the broader market about these concerns, depriving many investors of the opportunity to make informed decisions about buying or selling shares in the company.  Facebook has dismissed these allegations as baseless and without merit. The company has argued that it provided investors with all the relevant information about its financial performance and outlook before the IPO. Facebook has also stated that Zuckerberg's decision to sell his shares was based on a desire to diversify his portfolio and had nothing to do with concerns about the company's financial health.  Despite these protests, the drop in Facebook's share prices has been swift and significant. The company's current share price is now below $27, down from a peak of over $40, which it achieved shortly after the IPO. This represents a loss of billions of dollars in market value for Facebook and its investors.  The situation has led to concerns about the future of Facebook and its long-term prospects. Many investors and analysts are questioning whether the social media giant can recover from these setbacks and continue to grow and evolve in a rapidly changing market. Some are even calling for Zuckerberg to step down as CEO and for the company to implement significant structural changes that will address some of the underlying issues that have contributed to its recent problems.  The lawsuits against Facebook are likely to continue for some time, with both sides presenting their arguments and evidence in court. In the meantime, the company will need to work hard to restore investor confidence and demonstrate that it has a viable long-term strategy for growth and development. Whether Facebook can rise to this challenge and emerge from its current difficulties as a stronger and more resilient company remains to be seen.
