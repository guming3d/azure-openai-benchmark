article: Bread has become the latest household to be slashed in cost in the supermarket price wars which have reduced milk to cheaper than bottled water. Branded loaves have now been reduced to as little as 75p and own-label bread can be bought for 55p in some stores, according to new research. Sainsbury's has led the battle by reducing the cost of a Hovis loaf to 75p - the lowest since prices of bread plummeted to similar levels in 2011. The price of loaves of bread has been slashed by supermarkets and has reached lows of 75p for branded loaves and 55p for supermarket own brands in the latest price wars, which last month cut the price of milk . The supermarket dropped 800g Hovis white and wholemeal loaves and 750g Best of Both from £1 and cut nine of its 800g own-label loaves from 75p to 55p. Trade magazine The Grocer said the price cuts come at a particularly bad time for bakers when the supply of wheat with the right levels of protein needed for baking have been tight and prices are expected to remain high until at least August. Sales of branded and own label breads have also fallen 4.5 per cent year on year - making business a struggle for bakers. A milling industry insider told The Grocer: 'With this pressure on margin, bakers won't be particularly happy about what is happening with retail pricing.' According to analysts BrandView.com, the bread price cuts mean that Sainsbury's currently has the lowest base price for a large branded and standard own-label loaf of the big four supermarket chains. The drop matches the promotional price of Hovis in Waitrose which has been selling the loaves at two-for-£1.50 since mid-January. The Grocer said the last time the base price of branded loaves was this low was in 2011 when Kingsmill was 75p. Sainsbury's has led the cuts, dropping the price of white and wholemeal Hovis loaves from £1 to 75p . After Sainsbury's, Morrison's is the next cheapest with own-label 800g loaves priced at 59p each. Last month supermarket price wars were having a devastating impact on dairy farmers, as the cost of a pint of milk was reduced to just 22p. Farmers criticised Asda for putting their livelihoods at risk after it reduced the cost of a four-pint bottle of milk to 89p. Waitrose and Sainsbury's followed close behind with a £1 price tag. The reductions mean milk is now cheaper than bottled water in some circumstances.

chatgpt: Supermarket giants have engaged in a fierce price war, compelling manufacturers to slash prices on essential household items. The latest price cut on bread is the most recent development in this struggle, with prices of some loaves now costing just 55p. Hovis loaves, which once sat on the shelves at a premium, have also had their prices reduced to a mere 75p. The news is, of course, welcomed by consumers, but experts warn of the wider industry impact. The price cut is a reflection of the high wheat prices that have haunted the industry for several years. As a result, retailers are slashing prices to keep consumers coming back. But, as experts point out, the ripple effect of low-priced products will ultimately cause harm to the industry. For instance, manufacturers and suppliers will have to compromise on quality, resulting in a never-ending cycle of mediocre products that fail to hit the market's expectations. The price war among retailers is not unprecedented, and it has reached its climactic stage. The history of price wars can be traced back to the 1930s when the Great Depression forced companies to compete on price. Over the years, however, the phenomenon has become more complex and even more brutal. The price cut on bread is only the latest in a series of price wars. In the past, price wars have affected other household essentials, such as milk, which hit a low of 22p per pint in 2015. The retailers' objective is to outdo their rivals and dominate the market by offering lower prices to consumers. The current competition in the bread section shows that the trend is ongoing and unlikely to end anytime soon. The shift towards cheap, own-brand alternatives is also a reflection of the changing consumer behaviour. Shoppers are becoming increasingly cost-conscious and willing to compromise on quality. This has a knock-on effect on food manufacturers and suppliers, who will have to adapt or be left behind. The price cut, however, remains a double-edged sword, with winners and losers on both sides. While consumers are benefiting from the lower prices, suppliers and manufacturers are bearing the brunt of the competition. Many have said it is about time regulators stepped in to ensure retailers offer a “fair”, rather than a “cut-throat” business environment. In conclusion, the bread price cut has been the latest development in a long-running price war among the UK's supermarkets. While consumers reap the benefits of lower prices, there will be long-term implications for the industry. The current strategy of compromising on quality in favour of low prices will likely result in a reduced market value and losses for suppliers and manufacturers. Therefore, a significant change in strategy is crucial to help remedy the situation before it is too late.
