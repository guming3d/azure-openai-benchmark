article: (CNN) -- Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia are seen as the most corrupt nations in the world, according to Transparency International's latest survey, released Tuesday. More than two thirds of the 177 countries included in the 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index scored below 50, where 0 indicates the country's public sector is seen as highly corrupt and 100 as very clean. Denmark and New Zealand performed best with scores of 91. Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia tied last with 8 points each. "All countries still face the threat of corruption at all levels of government, from the issuing of local permits to the enforcement of laws and regulations," said Huguette Labelle, Transparency International's Chair in a statement. In Syria, where 100,000 have died in a conflict which began in 2011 and has now exploded into war, people regard its public sector as increasingly corrupt. The stricken nation dropped 9 points from 144th place to 168th. Libya, Yemen, Spain, Australia, Guatemala and Madagascar were among the other countries whose scores declined significantly. Myanmar saw the biggest improvement, rising from 5th last position in 2012 to 19 places from the bottom this year. The change reflects the benefits of introducing more open and democratic rules after years of military rule, according to Transparency International's Asia Pacific Director, Srirak Plipat. Myanmar also ratified an international treaty against corruption in December 2012 and the parliament approved an anti-corruption law in July, although this is yet to come into force. While Greece's score rose four points this year to 40, but remained the lowest ranking country in the European Union in 80th place. Brunei, Laos, Senegal, Nepal, Estonia, Lesotho and Latvia also improved. The UK jumped from 17th to 14th place with a score of 76, two points up from last year. The U.S. did not change from last year, ranking 19th with a score of 73. China's rank did not change. Australia dropped two places to 9th position with a score of 81. The Corruption Perceptions Index is based on perceptions of corruption in public institutions like political parties, police and justice systems according to experts and business people. Strong access to information systems and rules governing the behavior of public officials can help a country improve, while a lack of accountability and weak public institutions damages these perceptions, Transparency International said. The organization called on public institutions and officials to be more open, adding that corruption remains notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute.

chatgpt: According to a recent corruption index report published by Transparency International, Afghanistan, North Korea, and Somalia are the most corrupt nations in the world. On the other hand, Denmark and New Zealand are seen as the least corrupt nations. The report analyzed data from more than 177 countries, revealing that over two-thirds scored badly for corruption. The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) ranks countries based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). The report showed that both Afghanistan and North Korea had a score of just 12 out of 100, making them the worst-performing nations. Somalia, with a score of 16, was only slightly better. Denmark and New Zealand, however, scored 88 and 89, respectively, making them the highest-performing nations. Other countries near the top of the list include Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland, all of which consistently score highly for their low levels of corruption. Despite the high number of countries that scored badly, there were some improvements. Greece, for example, improved its score from 36 to 46 out of 100, suggesting that efforts to tackle corruption had paid off. However, other countries have seen their scores decline. Turkey, for example, received a score of 40, down from 47 the previous year. This indicates that corruption may be a growing concern in some countries. The report also highlights the link between corruption and economic stability. Countries with high levels of corruption typically have lower GDPs and higher unemployment rates. This is because corruption often leads to inefficient use of government resources, which can stifle economic growth. Transparency International notes that corruption remains a major issue globally, with politicians and public officials often failing to uphold ethical standards. However, the report suggests that there are some reasons for optimism. For example, there are a growing number of anti-corruption initiatives both in developed and developing nations. These initiatives are aimed at improving transparency, reducing bureaucratic red tape, and promoting good governance. Overall, the report highlights the importance of transparency in government and the need for a concerted effort to tackle corruption worldwide. With the right policies and initiatives, it may be possible to reduce corruption and promote economic growth in countries around the world.
