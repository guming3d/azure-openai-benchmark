Britain's Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said the Government had not addressed the need to encourage marriage . Stay-at-home mothers have been let down by David Cameron, Britain’s Chief Rabbi said last night. Lord Sacks said in a parting message to ministers that the Government had not addressed the need to encourage marriage and needed to give ‘more support’ to full-time mothers. George Osborne angered traditional Conservatives earlier this month by suggesting that choosing to stay at home to look after children was a ‘lifestyle choice’. The Chief Rabbi is to step down next month after 22 years in the role. He told The Times: ‘I think the Government has not done enough. ‘Although I don’t take a party political stance . . . I don’t think the Government has done enough at all. The State has an interest in marriage because the cost of family breakdown and non-marriage, the last time I looked at it, was estimated at £9billion a year. ‘[The Government] should certainly recognise marriage in the tax system, it should certainly give more support to mothers who stay at home, or for childcare provision. ‘I don’t believe in getting involved in the details, but the principle is pretty clear.’ Lord Sacks’s comments come after it emerged that mothers who look after their children at home will miss out on vouchers worth up to £1,200 per year to help working parents fund childcare costs. The £1billion scheme is available to families in which both parents work and earn up to £300,000 a year. Households in which one parent stays at home, which includes more than one million families, will be excluded from receiving the childcare vouchers. In further comments, he said allowing ethnic groups to keep to themselves had led to ‘segregation and inward-looking communities’. Chancellor George Osborne angered traditional Conservatives earlier this month by suggesting that choosing to stay at home to look after children was a 'lifestyle choice' He said multiculturalism was like a hotel where ‘nobody is at home’. ‘It doesn’t belong to anyone, we’ve each got our room and so long as we don’t disturb the neighbours we can do whatever we like.’Despite this, he said he understood the difficulties that British Muslim communities faced when trying to integrate. ‘We’ve had 26 centuries of experience, which most Muslims haven’t,’ he said. ‘The norm was for Muslims to live under a Muslim jurisdiction and the norm, since the destruction of the first temple, was for Jews to live under a non-Jewish jurisdiction.’

chatgpt: Lord Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, has called upon the government to do more to support full-time mothers. In a statement released on Wednesday, Lord Sacks criticized the government for failing to address the need for greater support for mothers who choose to stay at home to raise their children. Speaking to reporters, Lord Sacks said: "We need to create a society that values and supports the work of full-time mothers. They provide a vital role in nurturing the next generation, and we should give them all the support they need to do their job well." Lord Sacks also criticized the government for not doing enough to encourage marriage, which he claimed was essential for the well-being of society. He said that policies such as tax breaks for married couples could help to strengthen the institution of marriage and promote stable family units. The Chief Rabbi's comments come as he prepares to step down from his position next month after 22 years in the role. During his tenure, Lord Sacks has been a vocal advocate for traditional family values and has spoken out against social trends that he believes threaten the fabric of society. Many supporters of Lord Sacks have praised his long-standing commitment to promoting traditional family values, saying that his messages have resonated with many people across the country. Despite these accolades, the Chief Rabbi's position has also been a subject of controversy. In recent years, he has faced criticism for his conservative views on issues such as same-sex marriage and the role of women in religious life. Despite the challenges he has faced, however, Lord Sacks has remained steadfast in his commitment to promoting his message of values and morality. As he prepares to step down from his position, many are speculating about who will take his place as the next Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth. Some have suggested that the search for a successor may be difficult, given the high bar set by Lord Sacks during his tenure. Overall, Lord Sacks' comments about the need for greater support for full-time mothers and stronger support for marriage are likely to resonate with many people across the country. As the government continues to grapple with issues related to family values and social cohesion, it will be important to consider the views of leaders like Lord Sacks as policymakers work to shape the future direction of the country.
