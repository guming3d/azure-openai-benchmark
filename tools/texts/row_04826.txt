article: The United States Coast Guard is sending one of the largest ships in its fleet to rescue an Australian fishing boat that is trapped in Antarctic ice. The Coast Guard dispatched icebreaker Cutter Polar Star to the Antarctic Chieftain's location approximately 900 miles northeast of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The 399-foot Polar Star, which has 150 crew members and its home port in Seattle, Washington, was given the exact coordinates by Rescue Coordination Center New Zealand last night. Scroll down for video . Cutter Polar Star (pictured) was sent to the rescue by Rescue Coordination Center New Zealand last night . The 399-foot Polar Star is one of the most powerful non-nuclear ships in the world. It will battle 35 mph winds, heavy snowfall and break through miles of ice to rescue the Antarctic Chieftain . Antarctic Chieftain (pictured) called for help after it suffered damage to three of its four propeller blades . The 207-foot fishing vessel called for help after it suffered damage to three of its four propeller blades. The Chieftain has lost its ability to maneuver and is completely stuck in the ice. There are 27 crew members aboard the trapped vessel. US Coast Guard Vice Adm. Charles Ray said: 'The seas of Antarctica are treacherous and unforgiving. 'This incident is a sobering reminder of the importance of the US icebreaker fleet as we see increased human activity in the polar regions.' The Polar Star will open a channel through several miles of nine-foot thick (above) ice to reach its destination . The heavy icebreaker had just completed Operation Deep Freeze when it was sent to rescue the Chieftain . Polar Star Capt. Matthew Walker said he is 'confident' in his ship's ability to reach the Antarctic Chieftain . The  cutter will travel more than 330 miles to reach the Chieftain and is scheduled to reach the boat at approximately 10pm tonight. To get there on time, the Polar Star will have to battle 35 mph winds, heavy snowfall and break through multiple miles of nine-foot thick ice. Once the boat is free, a fishing vessel from New Zealand and will escort the Chieftain to the nearest safe harbor. Capt. Matthew Walker, the Polar Star's commanding officer, said: 'The considerable geographic distances and extreme environmental conditions make this a complex rescue mission. 'However, we're confident in our ability to reach the Antarctic Chieftain and committed to ensuring the safety of life at sea no matter the challenges.' The heavy icebreaker had just finished its annual mission, Operation Deep Freeze, to break a channel through the sea ice of McMurdo Sound to resupply and refuel the US Antarctic Program's station on Ross Island. Commissioned in 1976, the Polar Star is one of the largest ships the Coast Guard has and one of the most powerful non-nuclear vessels in the world, according to the Coast Guard's website. This is what it looks like from the Polar Star when the cutter is breaking a channel through Antarctic ice .

chatgpt: Last night, the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star was dispatched to rescue the Antarctic Chieftain, a fishing vessel trapped in ice approximately 900 miles from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The vessel had suffered damage to three of its four propeller blades, leaving it unable to move through the thick ice. The Polar Star, one of the most powerful non-nuclear icebreakers in the world, will have to navigate tough conditions including 35 mph winds, heavy snowfall, and nine-foot thick ice. The vessel is equipped with a reinforced hull and an array of powerful engines allowing it to break through the thickest ice. The Antarctic Chieftain, a large fishing vessel measuring over 200 feet, was carrying a full crew when it became stuck in the treacherous ice. The crew members were reported to be in good health and were awaiting rescue by the time the Polar Star arrived on the scene. The Coast Guard has stated that their first priority is the safety of the crew of the Antarctic Chieftain and all efforts will be made to ensure their successful rescue. The Polar Star has been an essential component of the United States' icebreaking fleet since she was launched in 1976. In addition to missions such as the current rescue operation, the Polar Star is instrumental in maintaining a U.S. presence in the Antarctic region. The vessel is usually deployed to Antarctica during the Southern Hemisphere's summer months to provide an escort for supply ships and to aid scientific research expeditions. Icebreakers like the Polar Star are essential tools in helping maintain global commerce, particularly in regions like the Arctic and Antarctic where ice formations can be particularly treacherous. While the ships themselves are exorbitantly expensive to build and maintain, their impact on maintaining the safety and economic stability of the regions they operate in cannot be overstated. The rescue of the Antarctic Chieftain highlights the incredible value of the Coast Guard's icebreaking fleet. Their ability to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies in some of the world's harshest environments is a testament to the bravery and skill of their crews, as well as the quality of the vessels they operate. As the Polar Star battles through the thick ice and unforgiving weather to rescue the stranded crew, the United States Coast Guard's icebreaking fleet remains an essential component of keeping our seas open and safe for commerce, research, and exploration. Their heroic efforts serve as a testament to the courage and dedication of the Coast Guard's sailors and the strength and resilience of the vessels in their fleet.
