article: By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . A new study has cracked the code on how children develop an understanding for language and vocabulary. The research by the University of Western Sydney discovered that children aged three to six start to use the same strategies as adults when identifying new facts and objects. This follows previous studies which uncovered baby talk to infants was a pivotal part of their learning, where adults naturally start to use a more sophisticated form of speech once the child reaches their first birthday. A new university study has found that adults should be clearer in messages to pre-schoolers . The recent study found that children aged three to six, like adults, were able to use a process of elimination to arrive at an answer. But their understanding of how new words and expressions are linked to objects can be different from adults. Co-researcher Karen Mattock says when children hit this age group, adults should be using 'child directed speech'. 'This means we should be clearer and give short, simple and repeated instructions to better convey the message,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'When you are teaching your child the names of items or giving information about them, keep in mind that their knowledge about language is different, so make sure they are attending to you as well as to the item you are talking about and encourage your child to ask questions. 'These quality interactions go a long way to helping your childâ€™s vocabulary and knowledge grow.' The research was done by Karen Mattock (right) and Marina Kalashnikova, from the University of Western Sydney . That's not to say that baby talk should be eliminated. 'At a young age this is very important for an infant's learning,' Ms Mattock said. 'The melody of baby talk maintains the infant's interest and allows them to capture emotions which facilitates bonding. 'Also the sing song nature of it and the exaggerated, hyper articulation of stretching out vowels also helps with their development.' The research is part of a wider three year study into children and language. 'Young children are amazing at the way they quickly gain language skills,' Ms Mattock said. 'What we wanted to do is find out more about the way children learn words so we can give parents the best strategies to teach new words to their children.'

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by the University of Western Sydney has found that adults should be more clear and precise in their messages to pre-schoolers. However, researchers have also emphasized the importance of 'baby talk' in early childhood development, stating that it should not be eliminated completely. Lead researcher Karen Mattock explained that "adults naturally develop a more sophisticated way of speaking to children aged one and above," meaning that language should be adapted to match the child's developmental level. However, the study found that many adults struggle to communicate effectively with young children by using complex language, speaking too fast or using unfamiliar words. Professor Virginia Yip, co-author of the study, suggests that this could lead to children's language development being hindered rather than supported. Baby talk, on the other hand, plays a crucial role in infant development. The sing-song tone, exaggerated pitch and simplified language used in baby talk are thought to help infants learn language by emphasizing the most important aspects of speech. It also helps establish a strong emotional bond between child and caregiver, which is essential for healthy development. However, it is important for adults to strike a balance between using baby talk and adopting a more sophisticated approach. According to the study, the most effective way of communicating with pre-schoolers is to use a mix of both styles of speech. This involves using simple language, short sentences and repetition, while also introducing more complex vocabulary and sentence structures as appropriate. The study provides practical advice for parents, caregivers and educators on how to improve communication skills with young children. Mattock suggests taking the time to slow down, reduce the amount of information provided and use gestures to support verbal messages. The benefits of effective communication with young children are significant. Research has shown that children who have developed strong language skills at an early age tend to perform better academically, have better mental health and social skills, and are generally more successful in later life. In conclusion, the study by the University of Western Sydney highlights the importance of language development in early childhood and emphasizes the need for parents and caregivers to communicate effectively with pre-schoolers. While baby talk is an important part of language development, it should be balanced with a more sophisticated approach as children grow and develop.
