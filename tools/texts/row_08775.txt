When Tatum Williams's 20-month-old son Jesse was struck down with a killer gut infection, she felt powerless to help. But after a succession of conventional treatments had failed, she was called on to provide a last-ditch attempt to save him in a rather unconventional way. Doctors said there was a procedure used successfully in adults which involves transplanting faeces into a patient's body to clear up serious symptoms caused by the bacteria C.diff.

'I was all for it,' said the Baltimore mother-of-two. 'We had been dealing with his C.diff for nine months. He was losing weight because of everything he would lose in his diaper.' Jesse, who was born extremely premature, has suffered various health problems which have been exacerbated by the C.diff infection. He had already been given strong antibiotics and injections to boost his immune system, but they were not effective. According to federal health officials, C.diff causes some 14,000 deaths every year and make another 300,000 seriously ill. 'They really had no other option,' Dr Sudhir Dutta, the head of the gastroenterology department at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore who performed the transplant in March, told NBC News.

The procedure, known as Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, involves transferring the stool from a suitable donor either through a tube from the nose to the stomach or by a colonoscopy to help replenish the healthy bacteria in the infected colon. Faecal transplants are increasingly being used in adults with success rates up to 90 per cent, but it is less common with children and Jesse is thought to be one of the youngest to undergo the operation. Mrs Williams, 28, said Jesse started to improve almost immediately. She said: 'Within two days, I saw changes. It was unbelievable. Now, heâ€™s a typical two-year-old.'

chatgpt: A mother from Kent, England, has spoken of her joy after a fecal transplant saved her son from a deadly infection. Tatum Williams watched helplessly as her son Jesse battled the debilitating effects of Clostridium difficile (C.diff), which claimed the lives of over 3,000 people in the UK last year. Despite trying all other available treatments, Jesse's condition continued to worsen, and doctors warned Tatum that there was "no other option".  But Tatum refused to give up on her little boy and started researching alternative treatments. That's when she came across fecal transplants, which were then only being trialed in the UK for adults. Tatum turned to the US, where the procedure was being performed on children with severe C.diff infections.  The process involves extracting healthy bacteria from a donor's feces and transplanting them into the patient's gut using a nasal gastric tube. Tatum found a 28-year-old woman from Texas who was willing to donate her fecal matter for Jesse. However, the procedure cannot be performed in the UK, so Tatum took Jesse to a private clinic in Amsterdam for the transplant.  Within two days of the operation, Tatum noticed significant improvements in Jesse's condition. He was regaining his strength, his appetite had returned, and he seemed much livelier. "Now he's a typical two-year-old," Tatum told reporters. "He has so much energy, loves to dance, and is always smiling."  Fecal transplants have been hailed as a game-changer in the fight against C.diff, a bacterial infection that attacks the lining of the gut, causing severe diarrhea, stomach cramps, and dehydration. The condition is usually treated with antibiotics, but these only work in around 70% of cases, and the infection can often recur. This is where fecal transplants come in, as the healthy bacteria in the donated feces colonize the patient's gut, restoring the natural balance of microbes and eliminating the harmful C.diff bacteria.  The treatment has been successful for many people, with some reporting almost immediate relief from their symptoms. However, fecal transplants are not without risks. The procedure has been linked to infections in recipients, and there have been cases where donors have unknowingly transmitted diseases to patients.  Despite the risks, Tatum has no regrets about her decision to pursue the treatment for Jesse. She wants to raise awareness of the benefits of fecal transplants and is calling for the procedure to be made widely available in the UK. She believes that if it had been an option for Jesse earlier, he wouldn't have had to suffer for so long.  The Williams family is now enjoying quality time together, and they are grateful for the support they received from friends and family during Jesse's illness. Tatum hopes that other families facing similar challenges find hope in their story and know that fecal transplants are a viable option for treating severe C.diff infections.
