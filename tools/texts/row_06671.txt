article: Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing thousands of nearby residents to flee. Indonesian media reported that 15 people were killed, including some journalists who were staying in a guesthouse to get close to the volcano. CNN could not independently verify those reports. Mount Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. The volcano has a summit elevation of nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Christian Awui, a rescuer at the scene, told CNN that the first thing that residents heard were sirens from an early warning system announcing the coming eruptions. "There was panic," he said. "You could hear the rumbles of the volcano." People ran to a refugee camp about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away. Because it was still dark, it was hard to tell how the eruptions compared with previous ones, Awui said. Some nongovernmental relief agencies were poised to offer immediate help. One of them was World Vision Indonesia, a Christian relief and development agency. "Right now, our biggest concern is the children," said Fadli Usman, World Vision Indonesia's rapid assessment team leader. "Children are always forgotten in the early moments of a disaster like this. My first task will be to assess the needs of the children and their families in the evacuation centers so our team can begin to help them." Usman said about 1,500 people -- mostly women and children -- had found refuge at a four-building shelter about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from the volcano. The evacuees, he said, are worried about the men who stayed behind to guard their homes and fields on the mountain. A dusting of ash covered motorbikes and cars at the shelter parking lot, the relief worker said. The heavy ash fallout also obscured any view of the mountain from his location, he said. Usman had reported earlier that traffic was heavy as people left the region near the mountain. The traffic was not chaotic, he said, and the road was open and under control. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Mount Merapi, one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, erupted on Saturday, July 10, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents living in the densely populated area near the city of Yogyakarta. About 1,500 people were receiving aid at a shelter, according to a relief worker. The eruption began around 1:20 a.m. local time, spewing ash and smoke for several hours. Ashfall was reported in several nearby areas, and local authorities urged residents to stay indoors and wear masks to avoid inhaling the volcanic ash, which can cause respiratory problems. Evacuation orders were issued for residents living within a 5-kilometer radius of the volcano, and officials set up several shelters to accommodate those who were forced to flee their homes. Relief efforts were focused on providing assistance to children, according to a nongovernmental agency. The Indonesian government said it had dispatched teams to assess the damage caused by the eruption and evaluate the needs of affected residents. The country's disaster agency said it had deployed personnel to distribute aid, including masks and food supplies. Mount Merapi is located on the island of Java, which is home to more than 140 million people, making it the most populous island in the world. The volcano has erupted regularly over the past decade, with significant eruptions occurring in 2006, 2010, and 2018. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location on the "Ring of Fire," a horseshoe-shaped area around the Pacific Ocean where many of the world's earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. The country has experienced several devastating natural disasters in recent years, including a tsunami in 2018 that killed more than 2,000 people. The eruption of Mount Merapi is a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by Indonesia's volatile geology, and the need for continued vigilance and preparedness in the face of natural disasters. As relief efforts continue, officials are urging residents to remain calm and to follow safety guidelines to protect themselves and their families.
