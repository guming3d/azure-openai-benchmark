article: (CNN) -- A dreaded curse that has nagged Chicago's Wrigley Field for decades may have triggered a grotesque prank Wednesday, when an unidentified man in an unmarked truck dropped off a package containing a severed goat's head at the stadium. The gruesome parcel was addressed to the club's owner, Tom Ricketts, CNN affiliate WBBM reported. While the delivery -- confirmed by the Cubs and caught on surveillance footage -- was certainly offensive, it's nothing new. Local media have reported shenanigans with dead goats in the past. They may have been efforts to reverse the curse. Billy goats have struck mortal fear deep in the heart of an inveterate Cubs fan since 1945, after Chicago tavern owner Bill "Billy Goat" Sianis pronounced a curse on the club on October 6 of that year -- just a month after the end of World War II. Sianis went to Wrigley Field to support the Cubs as they battled the Detroit Tigers in the World Series, according to his tavern's website, which dedicates a page to the legend of the Billy Goat curse. For Game 4, he purchased a ticket for himself and one for his goat "Murphy," who he thought would bring the Cubs good luck. But ushers stopped Sianis from entering the stadium with Murphy, according to the Billy Goat Tavern. Sianis appealed directly to then club owner P.K. Wrigley, asking him why he couldn't take his beloved pet and personal mascot to the game. "Because the goat stinks," Wrigley is said to have replied. So Sianis placed a curse on the team. "The Cubs ain't gonna win no more!" he cried. So goes the legend. When the team lost the game that day, Sianis sent a telegram, the website says, to Wrigley proclaiming: "Who stinks now?" The team's record hasn't been the same since. And it has garnered the nickname "the Lovable Losers." Fans have made many attempts over the years to put an end to the curse, according to the Cubs' website. A Chicago charity, Reverse The Curse, was founded in 2011 and donates goats to impoverished communities around the world in the name of stopping it. Last May, a group of five Cubs fans took a goat named "Wrigley" on a trek across the country in an attempt to lift the curse. It didn't work. The Chicago team finished the 2012 season with 61 wins and 101 losses. CNN's Joseph S. Miller contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Chicago Cubs fans were baffled early this morning at Wrigley Field after an unknown man in an unmarked van delivered a severed goat head to the baseball stadium, potentially in an effort to reverse a decades-old curse on the team. As the story goes, in 1945, Greek immigrant and Cubs fan, Bill "Billy Goat" Sianis brought his pet goat, Murphy, to the stadium for a World Series game against the Detroit Tigers. However, stadium officials, unhappy with the animal's presence, asked Sianis to leave. As he and Murphy were escorted out, Sianis cursed the team, saying they would never win a World Series again. Since then, the "Curse of the Billy Goat" has played a significant role in the Cubs playoff history. Despite having several talented teams over the years, the Cubs went 71 years without winning a World Series. It wasn't until 2016 that they finally broke the curse and won the championship. While the man who delivered the goat head remains unidentified, his motive is thought to be an attempt to reverse the curse once again. However, fans remain skeptical that such a strange and macabre gesture could have any real effect. One fan, Steve Simmons, commented, "I mean, I get that people are superstitious about sports, but this just seems like a bizarre way to try and help the team." Others speculated that the delivery could be a prank or a publicity stunt. Despite fans' doubts, team officials have taken the incident seriously. A statement released by the Cubs organization said, "We take this matter very seriously and are working closely with the Chicago Police Department to investigate the incident." This is not the first time that strange occurrences have been linked to the Cubs and their curse. In 2007, a group of fans attempted to exorcise the curse by holding a symbolic goat sacrifice outside of Wrigley Field. The stunt was widely criticized and ultimately did not result in any significant shift in the team's fortunes. As Cubs fans continue to watch the team's success in the playoffs, many will be wondering if a goat head delivered to the stadium really can reverse the curse. For now, the team's management is focused on ensuring the safety and security of the stadium and its fans, while the investigation into the goat head delivery continues.
