When firefighters got a call asking them to pump 20,000 litres of water at an art gallery, they may have expected to find a serious case of flooding when they arrived. But the crews were actually needed to help create a work of art which, unusually, required the water to be pumped into the first floor of the building. Now the only way to get about the room at Bristol's Arnolfini arts centre is to walk on pieces of a 150-year-old tree, arranged in the water like stepping stones. Scroll down for video .

Andy Jane, of the Forestry Commission, told the BBC at the time: 'As with all trees that have to be removed as part of the management of Westonbirt's tree collection, this historic Douglas fir won't be wasted. 'Westonbirt's trees go on to become a multitude of things, from woodcraft, tables and flooring to woodchip for the arboretum's paths, but this is the first time we have linked with a major art exhibition. 'We are all excited to see how the installation will look.' Visitors will get the chance to see how the installation looks when the display opens on Saturday. It is due to run until January 6.

chatgpt: Bristol's Arnolfini arts centre has become the home to an unusual and immersive installation. Titled "Ghost Log," the exhibition features 20,000 litres of water that visitors can explore by walking on a series of logs derived from a 150-year-old Douglas fir tree. The concept behind the installation is the brainchild of German artist Matti Braun. The idea behind the Ghost Log is to recreate a natural environment within the Arnolfini. The logs, crafted from the Douglas fir tree, are placed in water, evoking the serene and placid forests where these trees can be found. Braun explains that the installation is not just about the logs. The ripples created by the visitors as they walk on the logs are as much a part of the experience as the logs themselves, capturing the ever-changing nature of water. The Ghost Log installation at the Arnolfini is part of a wider fascination with exploring the intersection of art and nature. In a world where technology has become ubiquitous, installations like Ghost Log offer a welcome reprieve from the constantly connected world.  For visitors to the Arnolfini, Ghost Log offers an opportunity to indulge in a moment of contemplation within the busy city of Bristol. The visitor's exploration of the logs, the sound of the water and the sights of the installation offer a unique and calming experience. The Arnolifni's decision to host the Gost Log exhibition by Matti Braun was made with this kind of experiential art in mind. Emma Bowen, the director of the Arnolfini, describes the exhibition as "magical and meditative." Bowen believes that the installation will resonate with visitors, citing the combinational power of nature and art as a particularly potent emotional draw. For Matti Braun, the installation is part of a broader fascination with East Asian art and aesthetics. His art is heavily influenced by Japanese culture, particularly the traditional tea ceremony, where the aim is to produce a meditative state of mind, and pottery.  The Ghost Log installation is not just an opportunity for visitors to the Arnolfini to explore an immersive installation. It is also a statement about the need for space within our world. As cities become more crowded, and technology consumes more of our time, it is essential to have opportunities to immerse ourselves in the natural world. The Ghost Log installation is also symbolic of the optimistic future of art in a post-lockdown world. The Arnolfini, like other galleries and museums around the world, has faced significant challenges over the last 18 months. The installation symbolizes the power of art to emerge triumphant from lockdown. In conclusion, the Ghost Log installation at Bristol's Arnolfini arts centre is an example of an immersive art experience that captures the essential relationship between art and nature. For visitors to the Arnolfini, it offers a welcome opportunity to escape the busy city and immerse themselves in something magical and meditative. Matti Braun's installation is a testament to the power of art to transport and transform, even in the most challenging of times.
