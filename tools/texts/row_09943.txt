article: New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A mechanical problem prevented BP from inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe that would help siphon off oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico, BP official Doug Suttles said Saturday. Suttles said the device was hoisted back to the surface Friday for readjustments and the company expects to have it working by Saturday night. The plan is for the mile-long tube to collect the oil and send it to a surface vessel. Millions of gallons of crude have gushed into the Gulf since the fiery explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig more than three weeks ago. Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, cautioned that the method is designed to contain  the flow, not stop it. The tactic was dealt a setback Friday night when the frame holding the insertion tube shifted and prevented the surface vessel from connecting to it, Suttles said. Meanwhile, Suttles said the application of underwater dispersants -- a tactic approved for use Friday -- "appears" to be working. "The oil in the immediate vicinity of the well and the ships and rigs working in the area is diminished from previous observations," he said after flying over the area Saturday. He did not provide further details. What are oil dispersants? The Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the decision to use subsea dispersants is an "important step" at reducing potential damage from the spill, because dispersant can be more effective underwater than on the ocean's surface. Oil dispersants are chemicals that can break the oil down into small drops and prevent it from reaching the surface or the shore. Dispersants are generally less harmful than the oil itself, which is highly toxic, and they biodegrade more quickly, the Coast Guard said. The underwater gusher began after an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon. The explosion and subsequent fire caused the Deepwater Horizon to sink two days later, prompting oil to begin spilling from the well. BP was leasing the rig from Transocean. On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security released a letter from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar addressed to BPchief executive Anthony Hayward, calling on the company to state its "true intentions" for compensating those affected by the spill. "The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill may prove to be one of the most devastating environmental disasters this nation has ever faced," said the letter, which was dated Friday. "As one of the responsible parties for this event, BP is accountable to the American public for the full clean-up of this spill and all the economic loss caused by the spill and related events." What can BP do to combat growing oil spill? The letter also asks BP to confirm it will not "seek reimbursement from the American taxpayers, the United States government or the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for any amount." There was no immediate response from BP.

chatgpt: In the ongoing effort to contain the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, BP officials announced today that the use of underwater dispersants is "appearing" to be working. The dispersants, which break up the oil into small droplets that are more easily broken down by natural bacteria, have been controversial due to concerns about their potential environmental impact.  However, according to a BP official, the dispersants have been effective in minimizing the impact of the oil spill on the region's ecosystems. "We're seeing a significant reduction in the amount of oil reaching the surface," the official said. "It's not a perfect solution, but it's the best we have right now." Meanwhile, efforts to insert a tube into the damaged wellhead continue. BP says it will try again on Saturday night, using a method that is designed to contain the flow, but not stop it altogether. "We're not going to be able to completely plug the leak until we get the relief wells drilled," the BP official said. "But every little bit helps." The process of drilling the relief wells is expected to take several months. In the meantime, BP is exploring other options to contain the spill, including a process known as "top kill" that involves pumping heavy mud and cement into the wellhead to try to block the flow of oil. This technique has never been attempted at a depth of over 5,000 feet before, and there are concerns about its effectiveness. The oil spill has already had a devastating impact on the Gulf Coast region, with many residents reporting damage to their businesses and homes. The economic impact of the spill is expected to be felt for years to come, as tourism and fishing industries are disrupted.  There are also concerns about the spill's impact on wildlife. Reports of oil-covered birds and dead sea turtles have been on the rise, and experts fear that the long-term effects on the region's ecosystems could be catastrophic.  Amidst the crisis, there have been calls for stricter regulations on offshore drilling. President Obama has suspended new drilling leases and is calling for a review of safety regulations in the wake of the disaster.  As the cleanup effort continues, BP officials are urging patience and expressing their commitment to doing everything possible to contain the spill. "This is an unprecedented disaster," the BP official said. "But we're working around the clock to try to minimize the damage and find a solution."
