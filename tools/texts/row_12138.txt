article: Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Clashes over a disputed area along the Thai-Cambodian border erupted for a fourth consecutive day Monday, resulting in the death of a Thai soldier, a military official said. Four other Thai soldiers have been killed since the fighting started Friday, according to Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd. Authorities have evacuated thousands of people from nearby villages. Each side blames the other for the violence, which first broke out last week near two temples in the Phanom Dong Rak district of Thailand's Surin province. Cambodia's government has said three of its troops have been killed. On Monday, Sansern accused Cambodians of trying to seize two ancient temples, Ta Kwai and Ta Muen Thom. The fighting on the ground has been coupled with a war of words in recent days. On Sunday, Sansern accused Cambodian troops of opening fire first and said Thai troops responded to protect their country's sovereignty. Cambodian officials could not be immediately reached for comment. A statement from the country's defense ministry Saturday described the clashes as an "assault by Thai infantry units," accusing Thailand of flying spy planes into Cambodia and attacking with heavy weapons. Thailand's foreign ministry issued statements Saturday accusing Cambodia of "firing heavy weapons at innocent Thai civilians." U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that the United States "remains deeply concerned about clashes between security forces along the Thailand-Cambodia border." The U.S. government is speaking directly to Thai and Cambodian officials, and also supports efforts by Indonesia, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to work with both countries on a resolution, Clinton's statement said. In February, at least 10 people were killed when fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations, prompting the United Nations Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a cease-fire. Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. At the time, each nation accused the other of firing first. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Former US Secretary of State and Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has expressed deep concern for the recent violence that has erupted near two temples in India. The violence has left many injured and thousands of people have been evacuated from nearby villages. The incident has rocked the region and both sides are blaming one another for the violence. The violence erupted when two groups clashed near the temples. Details about the incident are still emerging, but initial reports suggest that the violence was sparked by a dispute over a piece of land. In a statement released on Twitter, Clinton said that the United States is deeply concerned about the situation and urged both sides to exercise restraint. She further expressed her hope that the Indian government would take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of its citizens. The Indian government has responded to the situation by deploying additional security forces in the area. A curfew has been imposed in the region to prevent further violence. The government has also promised to take strict action against those responsible for the violence. Meanwhile, thousands of people have been evacuated from nearby villages, which have been declared as sensitive zones. The evacuation process has been carried out smoothly and the government is providing all necessary assistance to those who have been displaced. Relief workers are providing food and shelter to those who have been evacuated. The incident has attracted widespread condemnation from across the world. The United Nations has urged both sides to exercise restraint and to work towards resolving their differences through peaceful means. The incident has also raised concerns about the religious tensions that are simmering in the region. India has a long history of religious conflict, with tensions between Hindus and Muslims often leading to violence. The government has been criticized for not doing enough to address these tensions and for failing to protect minority communities. The latest incident is a stark reminder of the need for greater efforts to promote religious harmony and to address the root causes of conflict. It is also a testament to the power of diplomacy and dialogue in resolving disputes and preventing violence. The Indian government must take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of its citizens and to promote peace and stability in the region.
