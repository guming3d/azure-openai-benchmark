Every restauranteur knows that good or bad reviews can have a major impact on their business. In the past these were most likely to be written by expert food critics and printed in newspapers, with the eateries concerned often given a right to reply to less than flattering write-ups. But in the age of the internet anyone can post anonymous complaints or compliments online before a wide audience - and new research has shown how crucial these reviews are to a restaurant's future. Ratings: The research found a strong link between good online reviews and increased restaurant bookings (stock picture) Two economists at the University of California, Professor Michael Anderson and Professor Jeremy Magruder, have published their findings on the issue in this month's edition of the Economic Journal. Their work focused on the impact of positive online ratings on 328 restaurants in the San Francisco area - and collated this information into a star rating system on Yelp.com, a ratings website. Restaurants were given a rating on the site between one and five stars. The study found that eateries with an improved rating of just half a star sold out their 7pm bookings on up to half of the days they were open, reports The Observer. This increase was found to happen without any changes in prices or food quality - suggesting a strong link to the online reviews. The economists admitted that establishing a cause and effect between the reviews and a restaurant's success was difficult because those that got good write-ups were likely to be popular anyway.

The impact of online reviews was found to be even more pronounced when there was little other easily available information about the restaurants concerned. The results of the study suggests that other popular rating websites, such as TripAdvisor, could have a similar impact on restaurant bookings.

chatgpt: A recent study has confirmed what many restaurant owners have long suspected: good online reviews can make or break a business. In fact, researchers found that even a small increase in Yelp.com "star ratings" can have a big impact on an eatery's popularity. The study, conducted by the Harvard Business School, analyzed the browsing patterns and booking habits of more than 39,000 diners in Seattle. Researchers found that when a restaurant's average Yelp rating went from 3.5 to 4 stars, the odds of the place being booked increased by 19 percent. For those that may be dismissed as a negligible increase, the researchers calculated that a one-star increase in a Yelp rating can lead to a 5 to 9 percent increase in revenue. When it comes to restaurants with a high number of reviews (think 200 or more), that increase can jump to as much as 19 percent. "Even just an improvement of the rating from 3.5 to 4 stars can lead to a significant increase in the number of people making reservations at a restaurant," said study co-author Michael Luca, Assistant Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. "This is good news for restaurateurs - it shows that investing in online reputation is a smart move for businesses of all sizes." The study also found that restaurants with higher numbers of reviews tended to receive higher overall ratings. This is likely due to several factors, including the fact that more reviews provide a better overall picture of a restaurant's quality and service, and that a higher number of positive reviews can drown out any negative ones. In today's era of online reviews, the findings from this study should serve as a wake-up call for restaurant owners. With more and more consumers turning to sites like Yelp to decide where to eat, it's important for businesses to take their online reputations seriously. While it's not possible to control every review that's posted, there are steps that can be taken to improve a restaurant's online rating. For example, engaging with customers on review sites and responding to negative reviews in a professional and constructive manner can help mitigate the impact of negative reviews. Overall, the study's findings show that online reputation is a crucial factor in a restaurant's success. By investing in their online presence and managing their online reviews, restaurateurs can increase bookings and ultimately boost revenue.
