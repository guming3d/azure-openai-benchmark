article: (CNN) -- Tommy Chong, one-half of the marijuana-loving "Cheech and Chong" comedy duo, is battling prostate cancer, he announced Saturday on CNN. Having first noticed symptoms about eight years ago while incarcerated for selling drug paraphernalia, Chong said he was diagnosed "about a month ago." He revealed his condition in an interview about his support for decriminalizing marijuana use and sales. "I've got prostate cancer, and I'm treating it with hemp oil, with cannabis," he told CNN's Don Lemon. "So (legalizing marijuana) means a lot more to me than just being able to smoke a joint without being arrested." Chong described the cancer "as a slow stage one (that I've) had for a long time." He said that he was drug free for about three years, during which time he began having prostate-related problems. "So I know it had nothing to do with cannabis," he said. "Cannabis is a cure." He and his on-screen partner Cheech Marin recorded a series of hot-selling comedy albums in the early 1970s, before hitting the big screen in 1978 with "Up in Smoke." It was the first of several "Cheech and Chong" films chronicling the adventures and misadventures of the stoner pair. The two continue to tour as a comedic act, with shows scheduled for later this month and the fall, according to their official website. Besides the "Cheech and Chong" films, Chong has appeared in several TV series, such as "That 70's Show." He's authored several books including "The I Chong: Meditations from the Joint" about his "family business" specializing in handmade bongs, arrest and nine months in federal prison, according to his and Marin's website. Chong, 74, explained to CNN that he doesn't smoke marijuana, which he said he'd quit about a year ago "for health reasons," to treat his prostate cancer. Rather, he said the ingests the hemp oil "at night, so I won't be woozy all day." "I'm taking it as a medicine," he said.

chatgpt: Tommy Chong, one half of the iconic "Cheech and Chong" comedy duo, has revealed that he has been diagnosed with "slow stage one" prostate cancer. The 82-year-old comedian-turned-activist stated that the diagnosis has only made his fight to legalize marijuana more personal. Chong has been a vocal advocate for the legalization of marijuana for decades, and with his cancer diagnosis, he is now calling for further research into the medicinal properties of cannabis. In a recent interview, Chong spoke about the treatment he is receiving for his cancer, stating that he is ingesting hemp oil "as a medicine" to help combat the disease. Hemp oil is derived from cannabis plants and is seen by some as a potential cancer-fighting agent. However, there is limited research to support its effectiveness. Chong's diagnosis has reignited the debate surrounding the legalization of marijuana and its potential medical benefits. While the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes has been legalized in several states, it is still classed as a Schedule 1 drug under federal law. This classification makes it illegal to use, possess, or distribute marijuana for any purpose, including medical use. Chong believes that marijuana should be legalized and regulated like alcohol and tobacco, pointing out that the war on drugs has failed to prevent drug-related crime and has unfairly targeted minorities. He says that the legalization of marijuana would not only benefit those who use it for medicinal purposes but would also create new jobs and generate tax revenue for the government. Chong's cancer diagnosis has also highlighted the importance of regular health check-ups and the need for awareness regarding prostate cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men after skin cancer, and one in nine men will be diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime. In conclusion, while Tommy Chong's cancer diagnosis is undoubtedly a personal battle, it has also reignited the debate surrounding the legalization of marijuana and its potential medical benefits. Chong's advocacy for the plant and its potential to treat cancer may lead to further research into the medicinal properties of cannabis, providing hope for those fighting the disease.
