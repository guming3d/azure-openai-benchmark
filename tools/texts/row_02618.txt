'Today I felt like I handled myself pretty well and yesterday I did not,' Reed said. 'Yesterday I made a stupid error, that's for sure. (I'm) sorry for definitely the words that I said and everything that went on on number one, which was my 10th hole. (It) never should have happened. Golf is a gentleman's game.

I live and die through every shot. I love the game so much and I expect perfection, but no one is ever going to be perfect in this game. It's just one of those things that I have to learn how to deal with and know how to handle and when I do a good job on it, I definitely play better. It got the best of me this week. 'The passion I have for the game is never going to change. It's just if I'm ever going to get upset at myself, especially after a Ryder Cup and at the level of golf I'm playing nowadays, you can't have outbursts. Unfortunately I did and happened to be on camera and it just happened.' Reed was often seen reacting to the crowds at Gleneagles while playing in the Ryder Cup in October . Masters champion Bubba Watson revealed Reed had shown him the incident and noticed how clearly the outburst had been picked up on television. 'I said, "Well, we always learn something out of everything situation. So we obviously learned the microphones are pretty good over here,''' Watson joked.

chatgpt: American golfer Patrick Reed is facing a hefty fine after being caught on camera using inappropriate language during a recent tournament. Reed was heard on television cursing and using derogatory language towards his own play, saying "Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t" after missing a putt during the WGC-HSBC Champions event in China. The 24-year-old took to Twitter to issue an apology for his behaviour. "I'm sorry for using inappropriate language today in China. It was unacceptable and I'm embarrassed by it. I regret it and apologize to anyone who was offended by it," he wrote. Reed's comments drew criticism from fans and fellow players alike. English golfer Paul Casey responded to the incident by stating that "We all have moments of frustration on the course but professional athletes need to remember that they are role models and have a responsibility to act accordingly." Reed, who has played in the Ryder Cup for the United States in the past, has vowed to learn from his mistake. In a statement released after the incident, he said, "I realize I have to be more careful with my words and actions on the course. I'm committed to being a better role model moving forward and am grateful for the support of my fans and fellow players during this time." The incident highlights the importance of sportsmanship and behaviour on the professional golf circuit. Golf has long been known as a game of honour and integrity, and players are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful and sportsmanlike manner at all times. Reed has been no stranger to controversy in his career. In 2015, he was accused of cheating by fellow players at the Hero World Challenge. He was also involved in a public spat with Jordan Spieth during the 2018 Ryder Cup, leading to criticism from fans and commentators. Despite these incidents, Reed remains a talented player with a bright future in the game. He won the 2018 Masters Tournament, one of golf's most prestigious events, and has eight professional wins to his name. While his recent behavior has drawn criticism from many, Reed's apology and commitment to improve his conduct shows that he recognizes the importance of maintaining a positive image both on and off the course. It remains to be seen what action, if any, the PGA Tour will take in response to the incident. For now, Patrick Reed will have to focus on his game and his conduct going forward. As a role model to young golfers and professional athletes, his behaviour on the course will continue to be closely watched and scrutinized.
