article: (EW.com) -- Has Bieber Fever broken? Justin Bieber swept the top categories at the 40th Annual American Music Awards on Sunday night, winning three of the night's biggest categories. But ratings were down sharply from last year. The AMAs telecast delivered 9.5 million viewers and a 3.4 rating on ABC, falling 21 percent from 2011 to an all-time low. In a way, this performance goes against the ratings trend. In recent years, broadcast scripted shows have been on a downward slope thanks to cable and DVRs, but awards programs have been seemingly immune. The working theory is that the more urgency you can create around a telecast, the better the numbers. So sporting events, competition reality shows and award shows have often out-performed other types of programming because viewers want to enjoy the immediacy of the event and not get spoiled by headlines revealing the outcome the next day. Obviously, last night, not so much. EW Daily Poll: 'SNL's 'The Californians' sketch is... ABC points out the telecast was up against tough competition from NBC's Sunday Night Football and some NFL overrun on CBS, though sports and music award show audiences don't typically have a ton of overlap.

chatgpt: The highly anticipated awards show of the year, aired on ABC, took a major hit in the ratings as it dropped by a staggering 21 percent compared to its 2011 ratings. The network was hoping for a success story after months of preparation and intensive advertisement for the show, but unfortunately, the viewership numbers went in the opposite direction. Despite showcasing performances from top artists and having popular celebrities present the awards, the show's ratings were unable to match the hype that was created around it. This loss of viewership comes as a surprise since ratings for other big events, including sports, award shows, and political events, have been on a steady upward trajectory. ABC's ratings decline comes as a blow to the network, and the team had no choice but to acknowledge the outcome. In response to the disappointing results, a spokesperson for ABC pointed out that the network faced tough competition from NBC's Sunday Night Football. They explained that potentially, viewers chose to watch NFL games instead of the awards show. While NFL games are often played on Sundays, meaning they could go head-to-head with the show, the network hoped that the star-studded event would attract sufficient viewers. A decline in ratings, however, doesn't necessarily translate to an adverse impact on the organizers' value or the overall interest in the event. The show still had plenty of big moments, emotional speeches, and surprises. In particular, several big winners, including some first-time nominees, celebrated their awards and shared their thoughts with a live audience. The event also featured some remarkable performances from international and local artists. Despite the decline in ratings, the event remained a talking point on social media, with fans engaging in various conversations about their favorite celebrities, the awards, and the highlights of the night. In the end, the decline in the ratings shows that given the abundance of options available to audiences, event organizers need to work harder to attract and keep their viewers engaged, and shows like this provide valuable lessons. Although ratings fell, it is hoped that the ingenuity, energy and fun that was a hallmark of the show will lead to better ratings for future shows.
