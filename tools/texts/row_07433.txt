A back garden inventor has published details on how an old-style big screen television can be converted into a solar-powered death ray that burns at 2,000F. Grant Thompson, the self-styled King of Random, has made two YouTube videos which show how the screens of old rear-projection TVs can be used to condense sunlight into point capable of melting coins. The incredible films show him using such a screen mounted on to a wooden frame to burns holes through concrete, boil water in seconds and incinerate planks of wood. Solar powered death ray: This image shows how coins can easily be melted with a lens harvested from an old television and used to focus the Sun's rays . Hot: The beam of concentrated solar power is so strong it can not only boil water in seconds but also burn its way through the glass bottle in which the liquid is contained . Mr Thompson scoured the 'free' section of local classified ads to find an old rear-projection television with the right kind of screen to hack out for his project. Prior to the roll out of large LED and plasma displays, cathode ray tube rear-projection TVs were the first to exceed 40in screen size. They used three CRTs - one red, one green and one blue - aligned so the colours mix correctly on to a screen incorporating a Fresnel lens - the same type of lens used in lighthouses. Although they once commanded retail . prices of many thousands of pounds, such ageing television sets are now . easy to get hold of because they cost more to fix than they can be sold . for.

'The particular screen I found was a crystal clear acrylic lens that focused to a point. 'It may have been luck that I found it . on my first try, because 3 TV's after that all had lesser grade lenses, . but still produced enough heat to melt zinc.' In his YouTube films, Mr Thompson shows how the lens is powerful to melt or burn a range of different objects, including U.S. pennies, glass beer bottles and even concrete. Sounding a note of caution, he added: 'This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in serious injury or death. 'Heat generated from a Fresnel lens can exceed 2000ÂºF and cause serious damage to persons or property.'

chatgpt: Inventor Publishes Video Demonstrating Incredible Solar-Powered Contraption  A YouTube video has gone viral that demonstrates an incredible contraption built by an inventor using only the power of the sun. The inventor, who has decided to remain anonymous, has published a series of videos detailing the construction and operation of the machine. The contraption makes use of a lens from a rear-projection TV to focus the sun's rays into a concentrated beam of intense heat. This beam is then used to burn through various objects including coins, bottles, and even wood. The inventor claims that the machine can reach temperatures of up to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. In the first video, the inventor gives a detailed overview of how the machine works and some of the materials and tools that are required to build it. He stresses that the machine is not something that should be attempted by inexperienced individuals and that great care should be taken when constructing and operating it. Following this, the inventor proceeds to demonstrate the power of the contraption by burning through a sheet of paper, a piece of wood, and even a brick. The beam is so intense that it is able to melt a penny in seconds and burn a hole through a glass bottle. The video has generated a lot of interest and speculation online, with some viewers speculating that the machine could have military applications. Others have pointed out that the machine could be used for cooking, heating, and other everyday applications. Despite the interest generated by the video, there are concerns about the safety of the contraption. The intense heat generated by the machine could pose a serious risk to individuals who are not familiar with its operation. The inventor stresses that great care should be taken when constructing and operating the machine and that it should only be used by experienced individuals. Despite the concerns about safety, the video has opened up a new world of possibilities for individuals interested in harnessing the power of the sun. The device could potentially be used to generate electricity, heat water, or even power an entire home. For now, the inventor has decided to keep his identity a secret and has promised to continue publishing videos demonstrating the capabilities of the machine. It remains to be seen what other uses the machine can be put to, but one thing is clear: the power of the sun is an incredible force that can be harnessed and put to use in many different ways.
