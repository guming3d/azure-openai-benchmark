'Likeable and genuine' Grant Weston, 24, from Pembroke, died early this morning after falling from a balcony in San Antonio, Ibiza . A young footballer has died after falling more than 50ft from a balcony during a holiday with friends in Ibiza. Grant Weston, 24, from Pembroke, had been on a night out with friends in San Antonio on the western side of the party island when he fell to his death. Mr Weston, a popular member of the Pembrokeshire Football League, had been enjoying a holiday with more than a dozen friends when he died in the early hours of this morning. Police on the island are now questioning his friends but say Mr Weston's death is not suspicious. Mark Powell, manager of the village team of Hundleton in Pembrokeshire, said: 'He was a genuine lad. 'He had everything to live for and it's so cruel that he has been taken away from us.  He had a brilliant sense of humour and I have known him for the past eight years. 'It's a shock, I feel for his family and he will be a great loss to our football club.' Mr Weston lived with his parents Kim, 58, Sheila, 55, and brother Robert, 22, but they were too upset to comment. His football team today said they were pulling out of tonight's match in a local tournament in Mr Weston's honour. Hundleton team committee member Paul Jones said: 'He was a lovely lad. Quiet, but very likeable, and he was an excellent footballer. 'We are devastated by this tragic event and he will be sadly missed. Our hearts reach out his family at this extremely sad time.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national, Grant Weston, in Ibiza on August 14th. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' The tragic death of a young British tourist is the second in the resort in two weeks.  Last week Briton Christopher Briggs, 25, died after falling and hitting his head following a night out with friends in San Antonio. Mr Briggs, from Blackburn, Lancashire, had been due to spend a week on the holiday island, staying at the two-star Hostal Apolo.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck the resort of San Antonio on the western side of the island of Ibiza earlier today when 24-year-old Grant Weston from Pembroke lost his life. Weston had been enjoying a night out with friends when the incident occurred. According to eyewitness accounts, Weston was with his friends at a local bar when he suddenly collapsed. His friends quickly called for an ambulance, but by the time it arrived, Weston had already passed away. Weston, a keen footballer, was staying in San Antonio on holiday. His family has been left devastated by his sudden and unexpected death. Speaking to reporters, his parents described him as a loving son and an active young man who had a bright future ahead of him. This tragic incident marks the second time in just two weeks that a British tourist has lost their life in San Antonio. Earlier this month, 21-year-old Conor Lee from Manchester died after falling from a balcony at a nearby hotel. The news of Weston's death has shocked both locals and tourists alike. For many, the loss of two young Britons in such a short space of time is indicative of a wider problem with binge drinking culture and the irresponsible behavior of some holidaymakers when abroad. The local authorities have responded to this crisis by stepping up their efforts to promote responsible drinking among tourists. They have also pledged to crack down on the sale of cheap alcohol and to increase their presence on the streets and in bars and clubs. Despite these efforts, some have criticized the authorities for not doing more to prevent such tragedies from occurring. Ibiza has long been known as a destination for partygoers and is famous for its vibrant nightlife. However, some feel that the island's reputation has come at a cost, with too many young people losing their lives or being seriously injured each year. As the investigation into Weston's death gets underway, his family and friends will be left to mourn his loss and try to make sense of what has happened. For now, they can only hope that something positive might come out of this tragedy, and that steps will be taken to prevent further loss of life in the future.
