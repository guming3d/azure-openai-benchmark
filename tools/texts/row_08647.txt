Chinese engineers have unveiled plans to build the world’s longest tunnel. At 77 miles, the Dalian-Yantai tunnel on the country’s eastern coast will save travellers an eight-hour ferry ride or 900-mile road trip. The £22billion project could start within a couple of years, with completion scheduled for 2026. These are the plans for China 77-mile tunnel that, at a cost of £22billion, will be the longest in the world . The first proposal for the undersea link was made in 1994 but it has been stuck in the planning stages ever since. The world’s longest undersea tunnel, the Seikan in Japan, opened in 1988 after more than two decades of construction. The Channel tunnel is 31 miles long. Engineers will submit a blueprint to the government by April for the tunnel and work could start as early as 2015 or 2016, the China Daily newspaper reported yesterday. The tunnel will run from the port city of Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province to Yantai city in eastern Shandong, slashing travel time to 40 minutes. At present, the journey between the cities is a 1,400-km (870 miles) drive or an eight-hour ferry ride, the China Daily said. At 77 miles long, the tunnel will be more than double the length of the Channel Tunnel, which is 31 miles long . China announced plans in 1994 to build the tunnel, at a cost of $10 billion, with completion set before 2010. But 20 years on, the project remains stuck in the planning stage. The project has been proposed at the annual session of China’s parliament every year since 2009, the newspaper said. Wang Mengshu, a tunnel and rail expert at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said the estimated cost of the tunnel would be 220 billion yuan, the China Daily reported. Work on a feasibility report could take two or three years, Wang said. In July, a state-run newspaper, quoting Wang, estimated the costs at 260 billion yuan.

chatgpt: The Chinese government has announced plans for a tunnel that will link the cities of Dalian and Yantai, saving travellers an eight-hour ferry ride. The proposed project could begin within the next few years, with completion set for 2026. The tunnel would span a staggering 76 miles, making it one of the longest tunnels in the world. It will run underneath the Bohai Sea, connecting the two cities, which are located on opposite sides of the bay. The tunnel could potentially reduce the travel time between the two cities by around 90 minutes. The tunnel is expected to have a significant impact on the local economy, as it will facilitate trade and tourism between the two cities. Dalian is known for its thriving IT industry, while Yantai is one of China's largest grape-growing regions. The tunnel will make it easier for tourists to visit both cities, which are popular tourist destinations. The project has been in the planning stages for years, but was delayed due to concerns over the cost and feasibility of such a massive undertaking. However, advances in technology and engineering have made the project more viable. The cost of the tunnel is estimated to be around $42.4 billion, making it one of the most expensive infrastructure projects ever undertaken in China. The government will look to attract private investment to offset some of the cost. The construction of the tunnel will also create thousands of jobs, providing a boost to the local economy. There are concerns, however, about the impact that the tunnel could have on the environment, particularly on marine life. The government has stated that it will take steps to minimize the impact of the project on the environment. The announcement of the proposed tunnel has been met with mixed reactions. Many are cautiously optimistic about the potential benefits that the tunnel could bring to the region, while others are concerned about the cost and potential environmental impact. Overall, the proposed tunnel is a massive undertaking that will require significant investment, planning, and engineering. However, if successful, it could have a dramatic impact on the local economy, as well as making travel between the two cities more convenient. With completion set for 2026, this is a project worth keeping an eye on.
