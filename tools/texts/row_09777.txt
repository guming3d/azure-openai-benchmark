chatgpt: Joran van der Sloot, the Dutch national who has been the chief suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American 18-year-old Natalee Holloway, will marry his 24-year-old girlfriend Leidy Figueroa on Friday at the Piedras Gordas penitentiary in Peru. This news has been confirmed by van der Sloot's lawyer, Maximo Altez. The disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba in May 2005 has been one of the most high-profile missing person cases in recent years. Holloway was on a high school trip to Aruba when she was last seen with Van der Sloot and another man. Despite years of searching, her body has never been found. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance but was never charged due to lack of evidence. However, in 2010, he was arrested for the murder of 21-year-old Peruvian student Stephany Flores, whose body was found in a hotel room in Lima. Van der Sloot confessed to the murder and was sentenced to 28 years in prison. It was in prison where Van der Sloot met his current fiancée, Leidy Figueroa. Figueroa works as a vendor, selling candies and cigarettes to inmates. The couple got engaged last year on the anniversary of their first meeting. The wedding ceremony will take place in the prison's chapel, and will be a small, private affair with only a few guests allowed. Van der Sloot's mother and Altez will be present, along with Figueroa's mother and a few of her friends. This will not be the first time that Van der Sloot has tied the knot while incarcerated. In 2014, he married a Peruvian woman while he was being held at the Challapalca prison in southern Peru, however, the marriage was reportedly annulled by his bride after discovering he had been unfaithful. The upcoming nuptials have stirred up controversy, with some people arguing that Van der Sloot should not be allowed to marry while serving time for murder. Critics have also pointed out that prison officials may be breaking the law by allowing the wedding to take place, as it is not permitted under Peruvian law. In conclusion, Joran van der Sloot's upcoming wedding to Leidy Figueroa has caused a stir, given his notorious criminal history. While some may argue that he does not deserve the privilege of getting married while serving time for murder, others may see it as a ray of hope for rehabilitation and change in the convicted killer.
