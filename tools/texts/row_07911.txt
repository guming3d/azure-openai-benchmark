article: New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Caste and religion are potential headings on matrimonial columns of Sunday newspapers. At times, matchmaking classifieds profile mystical birth-chart defects of the candidates. In India, marriages are solemnized as a well-guarded union. But the country has now moved to at least unshackle divorce. Officials Friday announced measures to stem delays in seeking an early end to failed alliances. India's federal cabinet approved "irretrievable breakdown of marriage" as a ground for couples to part ways, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni told reporters. Under original Hindu marriage laws, both estranged partners have to appear at court proceedings for settlement of their lawsuit for divorce by consent. But it's not uncommon for a petitioner to skip tribunal dates deliberately in order to keep the case dragging in India's notoriously sluggish legal system, authorities acknowledge. "This has been causing considerable hardship to the party in dire need of divorce," Soni said. Officials believe the new legislation, now due for clearance by parliament, will eliminate harassment of either party in the case and abuse of the existing law on dissolving marriages. There was no official data on divorces immediately available, but matchmakers say four in 100 marriages fail in India. With the country transforming into a modern economic powerhouse, divorce is increasingly seen as an acceptable way out of unsatisfying relationships. "Divorce doesn't seem to be biased any more. It's uniform among all castes, cities and income groups," said Vivek Pahwa, the head of SecondShaadi.com, a marriage bureau for second-timers. Pahwa's portal aims at India's internet-using divorcees, widows and widowers. More than one-fourth of his clients, he says, are women, especially in jobs. "It's reflection of financial independence," he said. He was referring to a growing number of Indian women joining the workforce who he says refuse to remain trapped in unwanted marriages. Indian laws allow limited one-sided separation. Cruelty and desertion can serve as a premise for seeking divorce without consent. Separately, the country has harsh laws to protect women, such as in cases of physical torture over dowries. But data shows a surge in crimes against women. Police across India registered 195,856 crimes against women in 2008, up from 140,601 in 2003, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

chatgpt: The Indian government has recently taken steps to speed up the often lengthy and convoluted process of divorce in the country. The new law, which was passed by the Indian parliament last week, significantly expands the grounds on which divorce can be granted. Until now, divorces in India could only be granted by mutual consent of both parties, or in cases where there was evidence of cruelty or desertion. However, the new law adds an additional ground for divorce, that of "irretrievable breakdown" of the marriage. This latest development is being seen as a major step forward in addressing the long-standing problem of delayed and protracted divorce proceedings in India, which can often have a devastating impact on the lives of couples and their families. According to the Indian government, the new law will help reduce the backlog of divorce cases in the country's overburdened court system, where it is not uncommon for cases to drag on for years. It is hoped that the added flexibility in the grounds for divorce will make the process quicker and more efficient, as it will allow courts to grant divorces even if one party does not consent. Critics, however, argue that the new law may be open to abuse by unscrupulous partners seeking to manipulate the divorce process for their own gain. They fear that the broader definition of "irretrievable breakdown" may encourage more cases of unilateral divorce, where one spouse seeks to end the marriage without the other's agreement. The new law has also been criticised for not going far enough in addressing some of the underlying social and cultural issues that contribute to the high frequency of divorce in India. Many experts argue that, unless these root causes are addressed, simply expanding the grounds for divorce will do little to improve the situation. Despite these concerns, the Indian government remains confident that the new law will have a positive impact on divorce proceedings in the country. Officials have noted that the law strikes a balance between protecting the rights of individuals to end unhappy marriages, while also safeguarding the institution of marriage as an important social structure. Overall, it is clear that the issue of divorce remains a contentious and complex one in India, and the passage of the new law is likely to only be the first step in addressing the issue. But the hope is that, over time, it will help to create a more efficient and fair system that benefits all parties involved.
