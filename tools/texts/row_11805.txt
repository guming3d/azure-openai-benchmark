article: (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight and comedian Micah "Katt" Williams were arrested Wednesday, accused of stealing a photographer's camera last month. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said each man was charged with one count of robbery. The alleged incident, involving a female photographer of celebrities, took place September 5 outside a studio in Beverly Hills. Knight, 49, faces up to 30 years in prison because he has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. Williams, who was arrested when he showed up at court for a different assault case, faces a maximum of seven years. Knight was arrested in Las Vegas. Prosecutors said they will ask for Knight's bail to be set at $1 million and for a $75,000 bail for Williams, 43. Beverly Hills Police are still investigating the case, authorities said. CNN reached out to representatives for both men Wednesday night without immediate success. Knight founded the successful Death Row Records in 1991, signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.

Television appearances on the BET network led to more success. His 2006 HBO special "Katt Williams: Pimp Chronicles Pt.1" raised his profile even higher. He has acted in several movies, including Eddie Murphy's "Norbit," and his voice is featured in several popular cartoons, including "The Boondocks."

chatgpt: Former rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight could be facing up to 30 years in prison after an alleged incident on September 5th. Authorities say that Knight, who is already serving a 28-year sentence for a deadly hit-and-run, was involved in a scuffle with comedian Katt Williams while they were both in custody in Los Angeles. According to reports, Williams was on his way to court for another case when he got into a physical altercation with Knight. Police were called to break up the fight and both men were taken into custody. While Williams has since been released, Knight is being held without bail as he awaits trial. If convicted, he could be facing a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Knight has a long history of legal troubles, including multiple arrests for assault and battery. He was famously at the wheel of a truck that struck and killed a man in a hit-and-run incident in 2015. He pleaded no contest to manslaughter charges in that case and was sentenced to 28 years in prison. Williams, on the other hand, has had his fair share of run-ins with the law in recent years. He was arrested last year and charged with assault after allegedly attacking a driver who had taken him and his friends on a trip to a Georgia recording studio. Knight and Williams have had a contentious relationship in the past, with Knight once famously slapping Williams during a nightclub altercation. However, it is unclear what led to the scuffle between the two men this time around. The incident has once again brought attention to the ongoing issue of violence among celebrities and the legal consequences that come with it. With Knight facing the possibility of spending the rest of his life behind bars, it serves as a stark reminder of how quickly things can spiral out of control. Whether or not he will be able to avoid more legal trouble in the future remains to be seen.
