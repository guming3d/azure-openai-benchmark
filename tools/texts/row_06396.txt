article: Beijing (CNN) -- She ate her favorite food all day long and rarely exercised. She had a few brief failed relationships but mostly stayed single and never gave birth. Defying conventional wisdom on a healthy lifestyle, she somehow found the secret to longevity. When she died of kidney failure on May 7 in southern China, some local media called Ming Ming, 34, the world's oldest giant panda, generating global headlines. Wild pandas live 15 years on average, while those in captivity can live much longer thanks to improved nutrition and medical care, according to WWF, the nature conservation organization whose logo famously features a giant panda. CNN anchor's surprising views on pandas . At least two pandas had lived longer than Ming Ming, state media has reported. Tao Tao died in 2008 at the age of 36 and Chang Chang passed away in 2002 at the age of 35. "The longevity of those pandas doesn't have too much to do with our conservation effort," said Professor Fan Zhiyong, head of the species program at WWF's Beijing office. "In captivity pandas don't have to worry about food sources, infectious diseases and competition from other species -- all of which remain challenges to their survival in the wild." While both Tao Tao and Chang Chang spent most of their lives in a zoo in eastern China, Ming Ming's life journey spanned half the globe. Her longevity had surpassed most people's expectations. She was rescued in 1979 in the mountains of Sichuan province, a rare sanctuary for one of the world's most endangered species. Some 300 pandas live in captivity in China, mostly in breeding programs aimed at boosting the low population caused by disappearing natural habitats and low fertility rate. Fewer than a dozen zoos outside China have pandas. "Ming Ming had always been weak ever since she was rescued," said Huang Zhi, one of her caretakers at China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, also in Sichuan, where she grew up. "She was quite timid and not very close to people," he added. Despite the personality, Ming Ming played the panda ambassador when the Chinese government dispatched her to the London Zoo in 1991. Fighting instead of mating with a male panda from Berlin, Ming Ming failed her most important duty and returned home three years later. She moved one last time in 1998 to a safari park in the southern Guangdong province, where old age eventually caused multiple health problems. Huang, Ming Ming's longtime caretaker, last visited her in April. "Her eyesight was deteriorating -- and she moved very slowly and ate very little," he recalled. "I felt she was very old."

chatgpt: Ming Ming, one of the oldest pandas in captivity, passed away on May 7 at the Xiangjiang Wild Animal World in Guangdong, southern China. The 34-year-old panda died of kidney failure, marking the end of a life that spanned over four decades. Ming Ming was born in the wild in Sichuan in 1987 but was captured the same year and brought to the Guangdong Safari Park, where she was kept in captivity since 1979. She lived through China's turbulent eras, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which saw widespread destruction of the country's wildlife and natural habitats. Despite spending most of her life in captivity, Ming Ming captured the hearts of many people around the world with her playful antics and gentle nature. Her longevity and resilience made her a symbol of hope for the survival of pandas, which were once on the brink of extinction due to habitat loss, poaching, and human encroachment. Ming Ming's death was a significant loss for the Xiangjiang Wild Animal World, which had been caring for her since 2002. The park had been monitoring her health closely in recent years and had provided specialized care to manage her kidney disease. However, despite the best efforts of the park's veterinarians, her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she passed away peacefully surrounded by her caretakers. Ming Ming's passing has also drawn attention to the plight of pandas in captivity, many of whom face numerous health problems due to inadequate living conditions and lack of proper care. While China has made significant strides in protecting these endangered animals in recent years, with the number of pandas in the wild increasing to approximately 1,800 individuals, the challenges faced by pandas in captivity continue to be a cause for concern. Ming Ming's death comes as a reminder of the fragility of the world's ecosystems and the need to protect wildlife and their habitats from human impacts. As one of the most beloved and recognizable animals on the planet, pandas are an essential part of the natural heritage of China and the world, and their survival is critical to maintaining the balance of our planet's biodiversity. While Ming Ming's passing is undoubtedly a significant loss for the world, her memory will live on as a testament to the resilience and tenacity of pandas, and the dedicated efforts of wildlife conservationists working to ensure their survival. As the world continues to confront the challenges of environmental degradation, climate change, and biodiversity loss, we must renew our commitment to preserving the wonders of the natural world and the creatures that call it home.
