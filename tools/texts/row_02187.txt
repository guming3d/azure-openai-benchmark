article: The name "Gloria Steinem" has long been synonymous with feminism. As a leading figure of the women's liberation movement, since the 1960s Steinem has fought tirelessly for female emancipation through her writing and activism. As she celebrates her 80th birthday, CNN takes a closer look at how Steinem became a true symbol of gender equality. 1. Undercover agent . In 1960, a young Steinem relocated to the Big Apple to start her journalism career. Three years later, she was making a name for herself as a journalist when she showed just how far she was willing to go for a story. Dressed as a scantily clad "bunny," she went undercover at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Club in New York. She then used the experience to shed light on the poor pay and working conditions women faced at the venue in her 1963 expose "I was a Playboy Bunny." 2. Actions over words . A decade later, Steinem had become one of the most outspoken female voices in America and was often seen as a spokesperson for gender equality. Joining forces with other notable female leaders of the day, including Betty Friedan and Bella Abzug, Steinem pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment after testifying before U.S. congress in 1970. Just two years later, the amendment was passed. In 1971, Steinem not only co-founded Ms., the first female-led magazine, but she also started up the National Women's Political Caucus -- with the mission of increasing the number of women in politics. 3. It's in her blood . Today she's seen as a feminist icon, but she's not the first woman in her family to stand up for gender equality. In 1908, Steinem's paternal grandmother spent four years as president of the Ohio Women's Suffrage Association. 4. Activist . Giving women a platform to speak and be heard wasn't Steinem's only mission. She also lent her voice to a number of other political causes. Most notably, in 1968, she took a public stance against the Vietnam War when she vowed to stop paying tax. Later in 1984, she was arrested alongside several other civil rights activists for disorderly conduct outside the South African embassy in Washington while protesting against apartheid. 5. The 'f' word . Though Steinem is credited as helping women find a voice in a traditionally male dominated society, she also redefined what it meant to be a "feminist." She taught us that feminism isn't just for women when she said: "A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men."

chatgpt: Gloria Steinem, feminist, activist and editor, turns 80 years old today. Steinem has long been a leading figure of the women's movement and has helped transform society's perspective on gender equality. She has helped rewrite the rules for women and has been a strong advocate for women's rights throughout her career. Steinem was born in Toledo, Ohio in 1934. Her father's work as a traveling antique dealer played a major role in shaping her worldview, as she experienced different cultures and perspectives at an early age. She went on to study at Smith College, where she became actively involved in student politics and wrote for the school's newspaper. In the 1960s, Steinem's role as a feminist activist began to take shape. She began to write about women's issues, and her investigative journalism helped shed light on women's experiences of discrimination and harassment. She went undercover as a Playboy bunny to expose the sexist treatment of women who worked at the club. In 1972, Steinem co-founded Ms. Magazine, the first U.S. female-led magazine. Through Ms., Steinem provided a platform for women's voices and helped to raise awareness of women's issues across the country. The magazine tackled topics such as reproductive rights, domestic violence and workplace discrimination. Steinem's activism has extended beyond the pages of Ms. Magazine. She has been a vocal advocate for women's rights around the world, from fighting against female genital mutilation to pushing for equal representation in politics. Steinem has also been involved in various social justice causes, including civil rights and environmentalism. Throughout her career, Steinem has been recognized for her groundbreaking work. In 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama, who praised her as "a leader in the women's movement, an advocate for equality, and a fierce defender of reproductive rights." As she turns 80, Steinem's legacy as a pioneer and champion of women's rights is more significant than ever. Her work has inspired countless women to speak out and stand up for their rights. And while there is still much work to be done in the fight for gender equality, Steinem's contributions have paved the way for progress and set an example for future generations. Happy Birthday, Gloria Steinem!
