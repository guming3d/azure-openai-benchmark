chatgpt: Hangzhou, the capital of China’s Zhejiang province, has been buzzing with the news of an unusual vending machine that has recently been installed on one of the busy streets in the city. The machine, located on Longwu Road, sells chilled live crabs, which can be purchased by anyone with a few coins in their pocket. What sets this vending machine apart from the rest is the fact that it sells crabs that are still alive, albeit chilled. The vending machine has been specifically designed to keep the crustaceans at a low temperature, so that they remain in a state of hibernation without dying. This enables the crabs to stay fresh and healthy for a longer period of time, hence allowing customers to have a better experience with the product. The vending machine contains crabs of various sizes, which are sold for prices ranging between 20 and 60 yuan, which is roughly around £2 and £6.20. The machine is easy to use and customers can make their selection by simply pressing the button corresponding to the size of the crab they want to purchase. According to reports, the vending machine has received a lot of attention since it was installed on the busy street. Crowds of curious onlookers have been gathering around the machine, watching in amazement as the crabs are dispensed alive and kicking, but still in a state of hibernation. Some have even been brave enough to purchase the crabs and take them home, where they can be cooked and eaten. For those who are unfamiliar with the process of cooking live crabs, it’s important to note that these animals must be killed humanely before they are cooked. This involves humanely severing their nerve system or placing them in boiling water. However, it remains to be seen how many people will be comfortable with the idea of purchasing live crabs from a vending machine. Despite the hype surrounding the unusual vending machine, some critics have voiced concerns over the welfare of the crabs. Animal rights activists have argued that the vending machine could cause unnecessary stress and suffering to the crustaceans, and have called for the machine to be removed. However, the company behind the vending machine has assured the public that the crabs are well taken care of and that the machine is only a way to provide fresh seafood to customers who are eager to try something new. The company has also promised to keep a close eye on the welfare of the crabs and to monitor their condition regularly. Overall, the vending machine has caused quite a stir in Hangzhou and will undoubtedly continue to attract attention from both locals and tourists alike. Whether or not the concept will catch on in other parts of China and beyond remains to be seen.
