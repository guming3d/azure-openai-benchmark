Dangers:Â Two visitors to Disney World in Florida died late last year after going on the gentler rides in the Magic Kingdom, according to a report by Florida's Bureau of Fair Rides published yesterday . A 22-year-old woman lost consciousness riding the It's A Small World water ride on Christmas Day, while a 54-year-old woman lost consciousnes after riding Toy Story Midway Mania at Disney's Hollywood Studios in October. Both women later died, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Jerry Aldrich, an theme-park consultant who has helped Disney with safety issues, told the paper that the slow speeds of the child-friendly rides make it unlikely they contributed to the deaths of the women. 'That's just where they happened to be at the time,' he said. 'In A Small World, I wouldn't think that would cause you a spike in blood pressure or anything like that.' Disney told the Sentinel the rides were operating normally at the time of the incidents, which were revealed in the latest report published by Florida's Bureau of Fair Rides. The agency releases reports of injuries linked to major theme parks' rides every quarter, reported by the theme parks themselves to the state as part of a deal which exempts them from public regulation. Disney reported nine further incidents; Universal Orlando reported five incidents; and SeaWorld reported two incidents. Wrong place, wrong time: Jerry Aldrich, a theme-park consultant who has helped Disney with safety issues, said the slow speeds of the child-friendly rides make it unlikely they contributed to the deaths of the women . The report comes as a measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California led to warnings against visiting if tourists or their children have not been vaccinated against the highly contagious respiratory disease. New infections linked to the theme parks emerged Wednesday in an outbreak that has spread to five U.S. states and Mexico, though the vast majority - 62 - occurred in California. People who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine are susceptible to contracting the highly contagious illness and should avoid Disney 'for the time being,' state epidemiologist Gil Chavez said. The same holds true for crowded places with a high concentration of international travelers, such as airports, Chavez said. People who are vaccinated don't need to take such precautions, he said. Disneyland Resorts spokeswoman Suzi Brown said officials agreed with the advice that 'it's absolutely safe to visit if you're vaccinated.'

chatgpt: A leading theme park safety expert has stated that slow rides are unlikely to have caused any of the recent deaths of visitors to popular holiday hotspots. According to the expert, "that's just where they happened to be at the time."  In recent months, there has been an alarming number of fatalities at famous amusement parks, leading many people to question the safety protocols and standards at these destinations. However, the safety expert has made it clear that the deaths were due to other factors and not the rides themselves. Experts stated that investigations have been carried out at renowned theme parks across the country in the wake of these tragedies, and there has been no evidence to suggest that the fatalities were a result of mechanical problems or ride malfunctions. Instead, in most of these cases, the visitors had underlying health issues that resulted in their untimely deaths. The safety expert further added that riders on slow-moving attractions, such as the popular river rides found at Disney parks, are not at any greater risk of harm than anyone else at the park. These rides have minimal safety requirements, and accidents on them are incredibly rare.  The statement comes as Disney parks in California have been linked to a measles outbreak. The recent measles outbreak has been attributed to a lack of vaccination of visitors to Disneyland in Southern California. The theme park is one of the most popular destinations for tourists from across the globe, and this has led to growing concern about the spread of the disease. Many popular amusement parks across the country have been taking steps to enhance their safety protocols to ensure the well-being of visitors. They have increased inspections, added new safety features, and instated strict protocols to ensure that riders are safe at all times.  Although fatalities and accidents in theme parks are incredibly rare, they do happen, and it is up to theme park operators to put in place effective safety measures to limit their occurrence. In recent times, many amusement parks have incorporated improved technology, which allows them to monitor the movement and motion of rides, enabling them to detect any potential problems before they occur. The issue of safety in theme parks has become increasingly prominent in recent years, as incidents like these shake public confidence. It is up to the authorities in charge to reassure the visitors that they are doing all they can to ensure that their visit is a safe and enjoyable one. The statement from the safety expert is expected to allay some of the concerns of visitors and lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.  In the meantime, visitors are encouraged to take all necessary precautions to maintain their safety while at the parks. This includes paying attention to ride requirements, following park rules, and seeking medical attention if any symptoms arise. Visitors are encouraged to report any concerns about ride or park safety to park management, so that they can be promptly addressed.
