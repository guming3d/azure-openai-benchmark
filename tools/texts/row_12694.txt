'It took me a lap to come back even because our team car couldn't assist me immediately because it was on the front. 'At that point I wasn't planning to sprint either, it was painful. But after a couple of laps we decided to just try anyway, but sprint seated because I was in pain. 'I still got third, but it's a shame because I really wanted to try and win in front of the British public. 'But accidents like this are a part of cycling and it's just a matter of bad luck. I really hope that the luck turns in the next days.' Next up for the riders is a 200 kilometre race from Knowsley to Llandudno before stages in South Wales, south west England and into London.
