article: Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Rescuers have found the bodies of 28 workers buried in a coal mine, authorities said Thursday, dimming hopes for two more missing days after an explosion rocked the facility in northern Turkey. The miners were trapped Monday after a mysterious explosion rocked the sprawling state-owned coal mine near the Black Sea port of Zonguldak. Hundreds of rescue workers scrambled to cut through fallen rubble to reach the victims trapped in a shaft 540 meters underground. Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said crews were still searching for the two remaining victims. "We believe they died from carbon monoxide poisoning when the accident happened, but we are not sure yet," Yildiz said in a live appearance on Turkish television. Relatives of the victims have been holding a vigil in a tent near the entrance to the coal mine. Turkish President Abdullah Gul issued a statement on his web site Wednesday calling for an investigation into the cause of the explosion. "Our president instructed the State Inspection Council to start research and investigation into the accidents that happened in te mining sector during the recent period that caused casualties and injuries, and deeply affected the public," the statement said. The accident devastated a community that relied on nearly minimum-wage mining jobs to make ends meet. "This is a mining town with a mining tradition," Taci Alkaya, the head of the mine worker's union in Zonguldak, told CNN by phone. "Families always have more than one miner in a household. Often the jobs pass from father to son." Alkaya said the mine in question worked 24 hours a day, with three to four alternating shifts. He added that the 28 miners likely earned between 800 Turkish lira ($550) and 1000 Turkish lira ($684) a month. Though the facility is state-owned, the miners killed were working for a private company contracted to fulfill a specific job in the mine. Turkish labor unions have denounced the practice of hiring private contractors, questioning their safety standards. "The practice of contracting jobs to private companies in state-owned mines should be stopped immediately," said a statement from the secretary general of DISK, one of Turkey's largest federations of labor unions, in the wake of the Zonguldak disaster. This is the third major accident to shake Turkey's mining industry in 6 months. Nineteen miners died in a methane gas explosion in the western province of Bursa in December. In February, 13 miners died after a similar explosion hit a mine in Balikesir.

chatgpt: Turkish Energy Minister, Fatih Donmez, has confirmed that rescue crews are still searching for two miners who remain trapped underground following a devastating explosion in the Zonguldak coal mine. The mine is located near the Black Sea port and the tragic incident marks the third major accident to rock Turkey's beleaguered mining industry. Donmez spoke about the rescue operation on Wednesday, "Our rescue teams are working tirelessly, but conditions underground remain extremely challenging. We are doing everything we can to find the two miners still missing." The explosion occurred on Tuesday, and immediately triggered a huge rescue effort, as families and emergency teams alike scrambled to locate survivors from the collapsed mine. So far, rescue crews have recovered the bodies of six miners. While two others are still missing, the remainder of the team have been brought to safety. Since the blast, Turkey's President, Abdullah Gul, has called for a full investigation into the incident, promising that those responsible will be held accountable for any negligence or wrongdoing that may have occurred. Gul also sent his condolences to the families and loved ones of those affected by the tragedy. This latest disaster is a grim reminder of previous mining accidents in Turkey. Back in 2014, 300 miners were killed in a similar explosion in the Soma coal mine. Since then, the Turkish government has been criticized for failing to take action that would effectively safeguard the lives of thousands of miners working in the country's notoriously dangerous coal mines. Mining has long been a vital industry in Turkey, with the country enjoying significant natural resources including minerals, metals, and coal. Yet despite their abundance, working conditions for miners have been notoriously unsafe, with miners often forced to work long hours in hazardous conditions. Critics argue that Turkey's failure to regulate the industry effectively has contributed to the ongoing issues that regularly plague the nation's mining sector. While accidents can occur anywhere, Turkey's poorly-regulated industry has made it especially vulnerable, with the Zonguldak disaster marking the third such incident in recent years. It is hoped that the government's pledge to investigate the latest catastrophe will bring some answers, and ultimately drive the introduction of tighter regulations and greater protection for communities across Turkey. However, for the families of those who have lost loved ones and the two miners who remain missing, the disaster will be felt for years to come.
