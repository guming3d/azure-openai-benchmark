article: The BBC has defended the latest episode of Doctor Who after viewers complained it was too disturbing. Saturday night’s edition of the show - the first of a two-part climax to the series - saw the Doctor and sidekick Clara Oswald caught up a plot dealing with the afterlife, which then led into an invasion of Earth by the Cybermen. It said the storyline, which saw Clara’s boyfriend Danny apparently killed in a car crash, was ‘appropriate’. Too scary? Some say the adventures of the Doctor and sidekick Clara (right) aren't appropriate for children . The children’s drama, which was watched by 5.3 million viewers, saw dead bodies transformed into an army of Cybermen. At one point it is suggested the bodies of the dead could feel the pain of being cremated, and the Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi, is told: ‘All the graves on Earth are about to give birth.’ The BBC received 118 complaints about the fact the children’s drama dealt with the afterlife. Another nine complained to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, which said it is assessing whether to launch an investigation.

Some people expressed disappointment on Twitter that the BBC did not warn viewers of the program's morbid content. 'Sad. Doctor Who should have had a warning, recently bereaved - terminally ill,' said @joh2710. They continued: 'The idea that dead people feel cremation is appalling especially for terminally ill people.' The episode goes to air at 8:00pm - an hour before the 9:00pm watershed after which adult content is allowed to be broadcast. 'Scary': Some on social media said dealing with cremation and the afterlife was too much . However, the BBC defended the episode’s dark themes and actor Peter Capaldi has stated previously that he wanted Doctor Who to take on a darker edge. 'I was keen he be a little darker,' the actor told the BBC in August. 'He's struggling with himself and who he is.' A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Doctor Who is a family drama with a long tradition of tackling some of the more fundamental questions about life and death. ‘We were mindful of the themes explored in Dark Water and are confident that they are appropriate in the context of the heightened sci-fi world of the show. ‘The scene in which a character reveals [an] unconventional theory about the afterlife was preceded by the same character warning the Doctor and Clara several times that what they were about to hear could be distressing. ‘When the Doctor does hear these claims, he immediately pours scorn on them, dismissing them out of hand as a “con” and a “racket”. It transpires that he is correct, and the entire concept is revealed to be a scam perpetrated by Missy.’ The current series reaches its conclusion on Saturday.

chatgpt: Doctor Who, the beloved British children's show, has sparked controversy with its latest episode titled 'Dark Water'. The episode, which aired before the watershed, showed bodies being transformed into an army of Cybermen, and has been met with criticism for its handling of the afterlife. According to a report by Ofcom, the UK's broadcasting regulator, the episode received 118 complaints from viewers who felt that the show was inappropriate for its target audience. Ofcom is now considering investigating the matter further. Despite the backlash, the BBC has stood by the show and its exploration of darker themes. "Doctor Who has always been a family show, but that doesn't mean it can't have a darker edge," said a spokesperson for the broadcaster. "We believe that children can handle challenging and thought-provoking storylines, and 'Dark Water' is no exception." The episode is the first in a two-part finale that will climax this Saturday, and it has already generated significant buzz on social media. However, not all the chatter has been positive. Many fans have taken to Twitter to voice their disapproval at the episode's portrayal of the afterlife. One Twitter user wrote: "The idea that dead people feel cremation is appalling! Doctor Who used to be a fun adventure show, now it's just depressing and morbid." The show's lead actor, Peter Capaldi, has previously stated that he wanted the Doctor to be a "darker" character, and it seems that 'Dark Water' has achieved that goal. However, some fans are questioning whether the show is now too dark for its audience. The debate over the episode's content has also led to wider discussions about the appropriateness of children's shows exploring more mature themes. While Doctor Who has always had elements of horror and suspense, some viewers feel that 'Dark Water' went too far. The controversy surrounding 'Dark Water' serves as a reminder of the challenges that creators face when trying to balance entertainment with more serious subject matter. As audiences become more sophisticated, the line between what is appropriate for children and what is not becomes increasingly blurry. Despite the criticism, Doctor Who remains one of the UK's most beloved television shows, and the controversy surrounding 'Dark Water' is unlikely to dent its popularity. However, it does highlight the importance of considering the impact that television shows can have on younger viewers. It remains to be seen whether Ofcom will launch a formal investigation into the episode, but regardless of the outcome, Doctor Who will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible on children's television. While some viewers may be uncomfortable with the show's darker themes, it is clear that there is still a significant appetite for thought-provoking storytelling.
