chatgpt: A historic Woollahra terrace once owned by renowned writer Sir Horne is set to go under the hammer on November 18. The property has been on the market for several months, with real estate agents touting it as a “rare and exceptional opportunity” to own a piece of Sydney’s rich cultural history. The terrace, which was last bought by Sir Horne in 1966 for a modest sum of £7,700, is now expected to fetch at least $1.75 million at auction. Despite its age, the home has been well-preserved over the years, with many of its original Victorian features still intact. Among the property’s key attractions are its classical architectural elements such as the original marble fireplaces and pressed ceilings. The terrace's interior gives off an aura of grandeur that is befitting of its historic significance. From the sweeping staircase in the foyer, to the ornate cornices and ceiling roses, and the polished timber floors, this home is a true testament to an era gone by. On the second floor of the terrace, there is a study that has floor-to-ceiling bookcases. It is believed that this room was used by Sir Horne for penning down the many novels that he wrote over the years. The study is a favourite of many visitors to the property, who are in awe of the authentic Victorian atmosphere that it exudes. This room reminds us of a bygone era when our literary greats were inspired to produce some of the greatest pieces of literature in Australian history. Sir Horne, who passed away in 1989, was a celebrated writer of his time. He won numerous literary awards over the years and was recognised for his contributions to Australian literature. Sir Horne's works dealt with various themes such as masculinity, national identity, and colonialism. His legacy lives on through this property, which served as his sanctuary and where he wrote many of his works. Potential buyers of the Woollahra terrace can expect to be transported back in time when they step inside its walls. This property has remained largely untouched, save for a few necessary modernisations to ensure that it remains functional to this day. The magnificent features of the home are a testament to the craftsmanship of its time, and show that these features can continue to stand the test of time. The Woollahra terrace has been a landmark of the Sydney cityscape for over a century, and it continues to be a prized possession for those who appreciate its historical significance. The upcoming auction of this iconic property is expected to generate a lot of interest from investors and history enthusiasts alike. As we approach the date of the auction, we can only wait to see who the lucky person will be that gets to own this piece of Australian history. One thing is for sure, though, that whoever does acquire this property will not only have a beautiful home, but will also become the custodian of a piece of Australian literary history.
