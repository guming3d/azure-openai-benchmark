The U.S. Embassy in Norway's capital was evacuated today after a suspected bomb was spotted on one of its official vehicles, just a year after the Breivik massacre. But the discovery – which sparked a full-scale security alert - was actually a training device mistakenly left attached to the car after a U.S. security exercise in Oslo. It triggered a security alert which led to the special forces being deployed and a 550 yard cordon around the embassy, which was evacuated along with other buildings. The evacuation covered buildings within a 500-metre radius of the U.S Embassy, pictured, and included the Royal Palace, though no one from the royal family was there . Police also shut underground rail lines and brought in heavily armed special forces after the fake bomb was spotted during a routine check. It comes just one year after police were criticised for reacting too slowly when gunman Anders Behring Breivik bombed Government buildings in Oslo, before going on a killing rampage. Last month a ten-week trial into the killings concluded, during which Breivik admitted killing 77 people and injuring 242 on July 22 last year, but denied charges of terrorism and premeditated murder. The court heard from the 33-year-old who said he 'acted to stop a Muslim invasion' to 'defend the indigenous Norwegian people'. Th prosecution has asked that he be deemed insane. A decision is expected next month. The 32-year-old Norwegian confessed to setting off the car bomb that killed eight people in downtown Oslo, before gunning down scores of youth from the left-leaning Labour Party . at their annual retreat on an island north-west of the capital.

chatgpt: The United States embassy in Rome, Italy was evacuated on Wednesday after a suspicious package was found on the premises. Rail lines near the embassy were also shut down as a precautionary measure. However, authorities soon realized that the "bomb" was actually a forgotten training device. The scare began when an embassy employee discovered the package early in the afternoon. Following established protocol, the building was immediately evacuated and Italian police were called to the scene. The bomb squad was also summoned. As a result of the evacuation, nearby rail lines were shut down from the Termini station to Tiburtina station, causing inconvenience for commuters. The police also cordoned off several streets around the embassy. Fears were quelled after a few tense hours when it was determined that the package was not a threat. Officials confirmed that the device was actually a training device that had been forgotten in the embassy's mail room. The investigation revealed that the package, which was sent from the United States, had been used in training exercises for embassy staff. It contained a replica of a mortar shell, wires, and a timer, which are commonly used to simulate explosive devices. Embassy officials apologized for the inconvenience caused by the evacuation and the shut down of the rail lines. They praised the rapid response of the local law enforcement authorities and expressed their gratitude for their assistance. The incident raised concerns about the security measures in place at the embassy. The fact that a training device, which was not supposed to leave the embassy, made its way to a foreign country, and caused such a stir, has raised questions about the effectiveness of the embassy's security policies. Embassies are considered high-risk locations for terrorist activities and security measures at these facilities are usually stringent. Nevertheless, this incident has shown that even the best security measures can be circumvented due to human error. This incident serves as a reminder that all agencies involved in security, including embassy staff, law enforcement, and transportation authorities, must remain vigilant at all times. False alarms like this one can cause disruption and lead to unnecessary panic. However, it is the responsibility of all involved to ensure that proper protocols are followed to minimize the risks associated with these types of situations. The incident also highlights the importance of training exercises in preparing staff for emergency situations. In this case, the evacuated embassy staff handled the situation as per protocol and remained calm throughout the process. This goes to show that regular training pays off in ensuring the safety of embassy staff and the general public. In conclusion, the false alarm at the United States embassy in Rome was a reminder of the importance of maintaining high levels of security at all times, even during training exercises. The incident may have caused some inconvenience, but it ultimately demonstrated the efficiency of local law enforcement in handling such situations. It is now up to the embassy and its staff to review and refine their security protocols to avoid similar incidents in the future.
