article: (CNN) -- FBI agents are traveling to Peru to study a laptop belonging to Joran Van der Sloot -- who was arrested twice in connection with the Natalee Holloway case, but was not charged -- according to a Lima court document. The Alabama teen disappeared during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005. Van der Sloot was the last person to be seen with Holloway. A source close to the case told InSession the FBI will be searching for any clues that can help solve the Holloway case. Van der Sloot also faces federal wire fraud and extortion charges in the United States, where prosecutors say he demanded more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body. The Lima court document says the unnamed FBI agents will meet March 14 with two agents of the Peruvian National Police High Technology Crime Division at the Peruvian National Police Headquarters in Lima. During the meeting they will have access to the computer's hard drive and will be able to conduct forensic examinations on it. Van der Sloot, a Dutch national, faces charges in another case. He is accused of first-degree murder and robbery in the case of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. Authorities found Flores' body in a Lima hotel room registered to him in June last year. Van der Sloot's attorney and a representative for the Flores family are expected to be present March 14. The lawyer for Van der Sloot said Monday he has asked the court to charge his client with the lesser offense of manslaughter in Flores' death. "In his statement to the police, Joran admitted that he committed the crime, but it was not in the way that the police said it happened," said attorney Maximo Altez. "We have submitted a motion to show that he shouldn't be charged with aggravated murder, but with violent emotion murder." "Violent emotion murder" is the equivalent of manslaughter in the United States.

chatgpt: The FBI has requested to study the laptop of Joran Van der Sloot, the last person who was seen with Natalee Holloway before her disappearance in Aruba in 2005. Van der Sloot, who is currently imprisoned in Lima, Peru, is accused of killing Stephany Flores last year. The laptop, which is currently in the possession of Peruvian authorities, reportedly contains information that is relevant to the investigation into Holloway's disappearance. According to sources, the FBI believes that there may be evidence on the laptop that could lead to a breakthrough in the case. It is not yet clear what information Peruvian authorities have found on the laptop, or whether they will grant the FBI's request to study it. However, if the FBI is given access to the laptop, it could be a significant development in the case.  Holloway's disappearance has remained a mystery for more than 15 years, and has garnered international attention. Van der Sloot was long considered the prime suspect in the investigation, but he was never charged in connection with her disappearance. Instead, he has faced a number of other legal troubles.  In addition to being accused of killing Flores in Peru, Van der Sloot has also been indicted in the United States on charges related to extortion and wire fraud. He is currently serving a 28-year sentence in Peru for Flores' murder, and is expected to be extradited to the United States to face those charges once his sentence is complete. While it is unclear whether the FBI will be granted access to the laptop, the agency has been involved in the investigation into Holloway's disappearance since it began. The case has been a high-profile one for the agency, and it has offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to a resolution in the case. For now, the investigation into Holloway's disappearance remains ongoing, and it remains to be seen whether the FBI's request to study the laptop will yield any significant findings. However, if there is information on the laptop that sheds light on what happened to Holloway more than a decade ago, it could bring closure to her family and friends, and provide justice for those involved in the case.
