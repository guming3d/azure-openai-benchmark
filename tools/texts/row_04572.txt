article: Online delivery services have a checkered history at best. But Uber, the app-oriented car service, is giving it another go. The company, which lets app users hook up with nearby drivers for hire, has announced Uber Rush, which promises to let "your packages travel like a VIP." Being tested only in Manhattan, it's a lot like a typical courier service. First, users summon up a vehicular courier (the company's reportedly adding bike and foot messengers to its fleet). Next, the app quotes them a price. And then the courier hauls an item or items from Point A to Point B. The service doesn't allow users to order items, such as lunch, and have them delivered. It's just for transporting items already in their possession. Rush is now an option on the existing Uber app in areas where it is available. During the initial dotcom boom of the late '90s and early 2000s, several online delivery services tried, and failed, to catch on. Kozmo.com is a classic story from the dotcom bubble burst. The website, which promised to deliver items such as DVDs, food and Starbucks coffee within one hour, raised $250 million in capital, launched in 1998 and was out of business by 2001. Webvan, an online grocery-delivery service, went bottom-up the same year, in what some have called the biggest dotcom flop in history. But the emergence of mobile technology has some Web players reconsidering the quick-delivery model. Ebay Now promises delivery of good from local stores in less than two hours for a $5 fee. The Postmates app similarly offers food and other goods delivered for prices starting at $5. Prices for Uber Rush appear to be higher ($20-$25), more in line with what New York City couriers typically charge. Uber's model is to take 20% of whatever price their drivers charge. Uber uses drivers who have applied to participate and who have passed background checks and other vetting to ensure they are properly licensed and insured. They must be at least 23. The company says it will expand Rush to other areas of New York if it succeeds in its initial test phase.

chatgpt: Uber, the popular ride-hailing company, recently announced the launch of its new delivery service called "Rush." This new service aims to provide customers in Manhattan with fast and efficient delivery options for their packages. Currently, Rush is only available in Manhattan, a densely populated area that is home to millions of people. As of now, people within this region will now have easy and instant access to a new level of delivery service, aimed at simplification and convenience. Online delivery services have had a checkered track record, with numerous reports of late deliveries, damaged packages, and even theft. However, Rush plans to change this trend by ensuring that customer satisfaction is a top priority. With Rush, Uber’s idea is to compete with other popular delivery services like Postmates and Instacart, who offer similar services in major metropolitan areas. Rush distinguishes itself as a service provider by offering fast, reliable delivery options that are guaranteed to meet customers' expectations. The new service from Uber intends to target busy urban professionals who need a quick and efficient way to send and receive packages. Rush has ensured that pickups and deliveries are completed in under an hour, even during peak hours with a focus on speed and time. Rush is part of Uber’s announcement to focus more on their products beyond ride-sharing. To make this a reality, Uber has invested heavily in state-of-the-art mobile and web applications that will make package delivery as seamless as possible for customers. In summary, Rush provides a seamless and reliable delivery service to people in Manhattan. This new delivery option is a great option for people who have a busy schedule, high expectations, and need fast delivery options. As Uber continues to meet the demands of its customers, Rush is just one of the innovative ways that Uber will continue to expand beyond ride-sharing to meet the everyday needs of people in big cities, with plans to expand this service to other cities.
