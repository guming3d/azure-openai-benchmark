article: A resolution passed in the most populous city in Vermont could lead to a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. Burlington's City Council members voted 10-3 in favor of the resolution. City Councilor Norm Blais, a Democrat, said he was moved to sponsor the proposal after hearing what he called President Barack Obama's pleas to have a discussion about weapons in our country after the deadly Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in December. Next, the resolution has to be presented in public hearings, voted on by the public and be approved by the state legislature before it becomes city law.

Blais said his city wasn't nearly as safe as people thought, saying that "if somebody was not a convicted felon and was walking through our thoroughfare and had an AK-47 slung over his shoulder, there's nothing we could do about that. Most people are surprised to hear that." But most people at Monday's city council meeting spoke out against the resolution, calling it too broad and unwarranted, according to CNN affiliate WPTZ. Burlington Police Chief Michael Schirling said most gun crime in the city involves handguns, not assault weapons, WPTZ reported. Vermont is one of the most lenient states when it comes to gun laws, allowing concealed or openly carried firearms without permits anywhere except school property and courthouses. CNN affiliate WCAX reported that meeting attendee Matt Storer encouraged the city council to not pass the amendment based on emotions because of recent events.  "I think it's a dangerous course to let emotions get into the driver's seat when writing legislation that could potentially infringe on constitutional rights." Blais told CNN he had intentionally drafted the proposal broadly so that he could encompass details from officials and those in the community who support gun rights to ensure a fairly written amendment. He said he was not looking to keep sportsmen from hunting and people from being able to defend themselves but rather wants to make sure what happened in Newtown did not happen in his city.

chatgpt: The Burlington City Council has passed a resolution banning assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. The move comes in the wake of the tragic school shooting in Connecticut and was prompted by a sponsoring City Councilor. The resolution has been met with both support and opposition from members of the community. The sponsoring City Councilor felt compelled to act in the aftermath of the Connecticut school shooting, in which 26 people were killed by a lone gunman. The resolution passed by the Burlington City Council bans assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, and any other device that can be used to increase the rate of fire of a firearm. Many attendees at the meeting expressed their opposition to the resolution, calling it too broad and unwarranted. Some argued that law-abiding citizens who own these firearms should not be punished for the actions of a few individuals. Despite these objections, the city council went ahead with the resolution, stating that it was necessary to take action to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in Burlington. The ban has been met with support from gun control advocates, who see it as a step in the right direction towards making communities safer. Those who opposed the resolution argued that it would not actually prevent gun violence, and could even make it worse by pushing people towards the black market to obtain these banned firearms. They also expressed concern about the impact on local businesses that sell these types of firearms. City officials remain confident that the resolution is necessary to protect the community from gun violence. They argue that assault rifles and high-capacity magazines are not necessary for hunting or self-defense, and that there are other options available to citizens who want to protect themselves. The debate over gun control is an ongoing one, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. However, the Burlington City Council's decision to ban assault rifles and high-capacity magazines is a clear indication of where they stand on the issue. It remains to be seen how this ban will impact the community, and whether other cities across the country will follow suit.
