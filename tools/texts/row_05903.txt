article: The Department of Defense has spent about $1.2 million on impotence medications since they first went on its insurance plan's formulary, including more than a half-million dollars last year alone. Federal government contract records, filed under the category 'troop support,' show just how reliant America's fighting men have become on the little blue pill that can add between-the-sheets pushups back into their regular fitness regimen. Tapayers began footing the bill for erectile dynfunction medicine in 1998, when the military's TRICARE medical plan added Viagra and covered up to six pills per month. Records for those early years are hard to come by because Pentagon physicians were required to special-order the medication for each patient. By 2008, however, the government began issuing regular contracts to stock the pills in its pharmacies. GREEN FATGUES, BLUE PILLS: The Pentagon has paid for countless doses of Viagra for men in the field and stateside . NOW WITH EXTRA TAXPAYER DOLLARS: The US military has ramped up its purchases of Viagra for servicemen, spending more than $504,000 last year alone . The Washington Free Beacon uncovered some of those records. A broader survey of contracts shows $1,199,785 in purchases in the last seven years, of which 89 per cent were for Viagra. Other brands including Cialis and Levitra reeived narrower distribution to military men. TRICARE provides 'medically necessary' and 'appropriate' remedies for erectile dysfunction, and it doesn't stop with pills. 'External vacuum appliances' – a polite euphemism for penis pumps – are covered, as are penile implants, testicular prostheses and hormone injections . The Department of Defense's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee decides what does and doesn't make the cut. Most of the Viagra orders have been 30-pill bottles of 100mg tablets, delivered by a single pharmaceutical vendor in Dublin, Ohio. TRICARE forms filled out by prescribing physicians require a diagnosis for men under 50 that shows they suffer from 'organic impotence' – a condition that reduces blood fllow to the sex organs or causes nerve damage. About $1.2 million in taxpayer funds has paid for erectile dysfunction pills used by military men . IT'S NOT A HOOVER: The Pentagon's TRICARE medical insurance plan now covers 'external vacuum devices' – penis pumps – to treat erectile dysfunction, along with a range of miracle pills . Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines over 50 don't need to qualify – if the doctor says they need it, the taxpayers foot the bill. But Pentagon physicians are not permitted to provide the drugs to men whose impotence is entirely due to psychological factors. There are no records online that indicate the Department of Veterans Affairs is purchasing impotence drugs for its patients, which suggests that men who leave the armed services must use private insurance to cover the cost – or pay out-of-pocket.

chatgpt: The Department of Defense (DoD) has been providing erectile dysfunction medication to its employees since 1998, according to recent reports. However, contract records only cover purchases made since 2008, making it difficult to determine the exact amount spent on these drugs. Despite this, it has been discovered that the DoD has spent over $1 million on Viagra alone. In addition to Viagra, the DoD has also purchased Levitra and Cialis for its military personnel using taxpayer dollars. These purchases are listed under the category of 'troop support,' highlighting the DoD's commitment to ensuring that its employees have access to the health care they need. One reason for the DoD's decision to offer these medications is the fact that its health insurance plan covers a wide range of treatments for erectile dysfunction, including penis pumps, penile implants, and hormone shots. The inclusion of Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis in this list of covered treatments ensures that employees have a choice when it comes to managing their condition. While some may question the use of taxpayer dollars to fund these purchases, it is important to remember that erectile dysfunction can be a serious medical condition that affects many men. Left untreated, it can have significant and long-lasting impacts on a person's quality of life. By providing these medications to its employees, the DoD is ensuring that they have access to the treatment they need to maintain their health and wellbeing. Moreover, it is not uncommon for employers to cover the cost of prescription medications for their employees. In many cases, this is seen as a benefit of employment and is offered as part of a comprehensive benefits package. When it comes to the DoD, it is clear that the organization sees the health of its employees as a top priority and is willing to invest in treatments that can help them maintain their overall health and wellness. Of course, there are still questions to be asked about the use of taxpayer dollars to fund these purchases. Some may argue that the DoD should focus its resources on other areas, such as improving working conditions or increasing salaries. However, it is important to remember that providing access to health care is an essential component of any employee benefits package. Overall, the DoD's decision to offer Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis to its employees is a testament to its commitment to supporting the health and wellbeing of its workforce. While some may question the use of taxpayer dollars to fund these purchases, it is important to remember that access to quality health care is a key component of any job. By providing its employees with access to these treatments, the DoD is ensuring that they have the tools they need to maintain their health and longevity.
