Hundreds of Goldman Sachs bankers are expected to be handed a new type of pay deal to prevent their bonuses being cut. The Wall Street giant has drawn up plans that will help it side-step laws designed to curb excessive City payouts. EU rules which came into force on January 1 are supposed to stop the casino-style behaviour that led to the financial crisis. They state that annual bonuses can be no higher than base salary. Ruse: Workers at Goldman Sachs are expected to be handed 'role-based allowances', separate from pay . But bosses at Goldman Sachs have devised a way to get around the rules and let them continue to lavish vast rewards on their staff. As well as their basic pay – which at Goldman is already an average of £367,000 a year – hundreds of top bankers at the firm will receive ‘role-based allowances’. Although details are yet to be confirmed, these could be paid several times a year – possibly monthly – and are likely to be in shares. Giant: The firm's London headquarters . Unlike bonuses, they will not be conditional on performance and will not count towards the calculations of the bonus cap. Goldman joins Barclays and HSBC, which are already planning to hand staff extra shares to get around the Brussels edict. Once the scheme comes into force, the added pay will be back-dated to the start of the year. Goldman employs around 5,000 in London and it is thought hundreds of staff will be included in the new pay scheme. It is understood the plan is yet to be signed off by the regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, which could still block it. The Bank of England, which runs the PRA, said it would not discuss individual firms. When the EU was drawing up the rules, critics said it would only lead to banks hiking the pay of their staff. Unlike bonuses, fixed pay cannot be clawed back from reckless staff. Barclays and HSBC are already planning to hand out multi-million shares in a bid to avoid the cap. They were accused of ‘concocting elaborate schemes’ to dodge the rules. City workers saw their pay rise by a third last year. The top 2,700 London bankers took home an average £1.6million each, making Britain’s financial elite the highest paid in Europe. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby previously said foreign-owned banks in the City of London were ‘in denial’ about their role in the financial crisis. Luke Hildyard, director at the High Pay Centre, said: ‘Goldman Sachs clearly think they can continue to throw around obscene and unmerited pay packages for their top bankers, while wages for ordinary UK workers remain lower than they were ten years ago. ‘This doesn’t seem to be within the letter or the spirit of the new bonus cap rules.’ Goldman Sachs refused to comment.

chatgpt: As the new year rolled in, so did new European Union (EU) laws aimed at reigning in the risky business practices of the banking industry. These "casino-style" dealings were blamed for the financial crash of 2008, and the EU wants to prevent a repeat of similar events. However, one banking giant has found a way to reward its employees without relying on these practices. Barclays has come up with a solution to provide additional benefits to their staff without relying on bonuses. The bank will now offer "role-based allowances" to around 15% of its workers starting from January. These payments are separate from any other benefits that the staff may receive. This move has come in response to the introduction of the EU's Banking Reform Act. This legislation is aimed at diminishing the risk of banking collapses happening again. Lenders are prohibited from paying bonuses that are larger than double an employee's salary. The new legislation also "caps" payouts at 100% of the bankers' fixed pay, and it also forces banks to defer bonuses for at least five years, meaning that they will be forfeited if a bank gets into financial distress. Barclays has found an innovative approach to counterbalance these restrictions. The allowances they will issue will be assigned to roles rather than individuals. It is estimated that around 700 out of 4,500 UK-based staff in Barclays' investment banking unit will be eligible for these allowances. These allowances will typically be higher than what the staff normally would receive as a bonus, which has driven some banks to bypass the EU bonus cap rule altogether. These role-based allowances are not linked to employee performance but are based on their job title and responsibilities. The move allows banks to adjust salaries without classifying it as performance-related compensation. A spokesperson for the bank stated that Barclays is confident that their approach is viable and ensures that compensation remains competitive in the industry. The allowances will be paid out from the revenues Barclays generates, reducing their need to rely on bonuses to retain talent. However, not everyone is feeling optimistic about Barclays' new approach. Some view the move as merely finding a loophole in the EU's Banking Reform Act to continue paying its workers excessively. Brussels-based bankers' lobby, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, warns that small and medium-sized firms could struggle to retain their top talent as they might not have the budget to match the allowances. Although the new act is predominantly aimed at larger banks, smaller banks could also be affected by the consequences. Despite these concerns, the allowances will be welcomed by the employees of Barclays' investment banking unit, particularly given the current challenging business environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Summing up, EU laws aimed at curbing risky banking practices led Barclays to create role-based allowances, which will be paid on top of regular salaries, and will hopefully satisfy employees' compensation expectations, reduce reliance on bonuses, and sidestep any bonuses-related regulations while providing adequate revenue to retain top talent.
