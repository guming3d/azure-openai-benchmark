article: (CNN) -- The global H1N1 pandemic is over, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization said Tuesday. "We are moving out of the pandemic into the post-pandemic period," said Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO. Chan said that while several countries -- including India and New Zealand -- are still experiencing significant H1N1 flu transmission, out-of-season flu outbreaks are no longer being reported in the northern or southern hemispheres. "This pandemic has turned out to have been much more fortunate than what we feared a little over a year ago," Chan told reporters in a news conference Tuesday. She attributed the end of the pandemic to several factors: that the virus did not mutate to a more lethal form, the H1N1 flu vaccine proved to be a good match and widespread resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu did not develop. "This time around, we have been aided by pure good luck," Chan said. The WHO announced the global H1N1 pandemic June 11, 2009. A pandemic is a sudden outbreak of a disease that is spread by human transmission, which quickly becomes widespread and affects a large region or several countries. The CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, said the U.S. Public Health emergency for H1N1 ended on June 23 of this year. H1N1 is no longer the dominating flu strain. Chan said health officials are now seeing a mixed virus pattern: In addition to the H1N1 strain, an H3N2 flu strain and Influenza B virus also are circulating. All three strains are included in the upcoming seasonal flu vaccine. So H1N1 is not gone, but as the WHO explains, the flu activity health officials are now seeing is typical seasonal flu activity. The CDC statement came after an emergency committee of the WHO said Tuesday the public health emergency triggered by the emergence of the H1N1 virus "should be considered over." The committee advised Chan "that the world was no longer experiencing an influenza pandemic," the organization said in a statement. CNN"s Miriam Falco contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a recent announcement, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared that the H1N1 pandemic has come to a close. This virus had caused global panic when it spread across the world in 2009, leading the WHO to declare a global public health emergency. Speaking to reporters, the WHO chief said, "The H1N1 pandemic is over. We can declare that now." He added that flu outbreaks out of the typical flu season are not being reported in either hemisphere anymore. Despite the declaration, several countries, including India and New Zealand, are still experiencing significant H1N1 flu transmission. WHO further confirmed that other flu viruses are circulating, leading to a "typical" flu season. However, WHO did not mention any potential risk of these viruses causing a pandemic. The H1N1 virus caused a significant scare when it was first discovered in Mexico in 2009. It rapidly spread across the globe, affecting people of all ages and led the WHO to declare a global public health emergency. Governments across the world took measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including mandatory vaccinations. Since then, significant strides have been made in the global fight against the H1N1 virus. However, countries are still keeping a close eye on the situation and ensuring that measures are in place to safeguard their citizens against the virus. In the current pandemic situation, Global initiatives have been put in place for vaccine distribution, with a focus on high-income countries. Wealthy nations have given away their extra doses to low-income countries under the initiative. These countries are also working on increasing the availability and affordability of flu vaccines in order to prevent future pandemics. In conclusion, while the H1N1 pandemic is over officially, countries cannot let their guard down entirely. The virus still poses a risk, and it is necessary to continue monitoring its spread to keep citizens safe. The world has come a long way in fighting against the pandemic, but there is still a long way to go to ensure that the next outbreak is prevented.
