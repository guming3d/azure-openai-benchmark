article: By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . A time-lapse video recording melting glaciers in Montana received an unexpected endorsement from one of the park's residents - when a furry marmot photobombed the camera. Greenpeace environmentalists left a GoPro camera in Glacier National Park in the US to raise awareness of global warming which is melting glaciers in the area. The video shows the curious critter scurrying towards the camera before giving it a good lick before dashing off. Grass warrior: Marmot emerges from the vegetation and scurries over to the Greenpeace camera which was set up in Glacier National Park in Montana, US, to record the effects of climate change . Activists had hoped to show how the alpine tundra - land where there is no vegetation because the ground is always frozen - is shrinking as more and more trees grow higher up the mountain. But instead, the marmot, who lives in the tundra, took actions into his own hands in a bid to protect his home. A Greenpeace spokesperson said: 'Though we didn’t capture the time-lapse video of Glacier National Park that we intended to, we captured something much cooler ... Marmot Love. 'This Marmot would like to give you a kiss for helping to save its home.' The video is part of the Greenpeace campaign 'Keep our coal in the ground' which brings attention to the fact that the agency charged to protect national parks  - the Department of the Interior - is auctioning off land for coal mining. Greenpeace has also launched a thermal airship at Glacier National Park to highlight with large banners reading 'Coal exports fuel climate change.' It flew over Decker Coal Mine in Montana where work is expanding at a rapid rate, prompting another two environmental groups to file a lawsuit in a bid to halt plans. Northern Plains Resource Council and the Western Organization of Resource Councils hope to block more mining. Greenpeace is calling on the government to consider the environment as they back the coal industry's export ambitions and stop selling off land for mining. 'Climate change is a major threat to national parks like Glacier, and more coal will only make it worse whether it is burned in Montana or Beijing,' said Greenpeace energy campaign director Kelly Mitchell. 'If interior secretary Sally Jewell is serious about protecting our national parks from the impacts of climate change, she should establish a moratorium on new coal leases and pursue comprehensive reform of the federal coal leasing program.'

chatgpt: A time-lapse camera that had been set up to record the effects of global warming has captured an unexpected visitor, a marmot who lives in land at risk in Montana, US. The footage shows the adorable rodent chewing on plants, interacting with other animals and enjoying the natural habitat. However, Greenpeace, a leading environmental group, is campaigning to halt coal mining in Montana, to protect the wildlife and the land. The camera, which had been monitoring the area for over a year, was completely set up to observe how the landscape and vegetation change as the climate warms up. The data would have provided invaluable insights into the effects of global warming on wildlife and could have been used to develop solutions to mitigate its impact. However, the marmot that was captured on the footage is a sobering reminder that the natural world is at risk. The land in Montana is a lands' end for numerous animal species and an incredible ecosystem. However, Greenpeace warns that it is also at risk from the coal industry, which is causing severe environmental damage. The organization claims that the mining operations destroy the habitats of numerous species, including the marmots, which rely on the mountains and forests of Montana for shelter and food. Greenpeace has launched a campaign to halt coal mining operations in the area, citing the devastating effects on the ecology and the health of the communities. Montana has amassed considerable attention following numerous natural disasters, including wildfires and flash flooding, that were evidently worsened by factors such as climate change. The state's focus must shift from coal mining, which accounts for a substantial portion of the state's economy, to the preservation of its natural heritage. Greenpeace recognizes that the policymakers must prioritize climate-friendly businesses such as wind and solar energy, which offer cleaner and greener alternatives to mining coal. Stopping coal mining in Montana would not only save the natural habitat but would also bring about a positive impact on public health. Coal mining exposes workers and their communities to dangerous levels of pollutants linked to respiratory diseases like asthma, lung cancer and more. In conclusion, the time-lapse camera set up to record the effects of global warming has not only captured the beauty of nature but also alerted us to the dangers that threaten the ecological balance of the land in Montana. Greenpeace's campaign to halt coal mining in the area should be met with widespread support from policymakers, corporations, and individuals who care about the environment, wildlife, and public health.
