article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two Romanians caught attempting to smuggle Afghan migrants across the Channel to Britain in the boots of their cars have been jailed by a court in Boulogne on the French coast. Ionica Doru Cicea, 22, was arrested on Monday in Calais after two women were discovered in the boot of his Volkswagen Passat. A second man, Dumitru Vaduva, aged 60, was handed over to the French authorities by British Border Police after they found a three year old child accompanied by his parents - again in the boot of a car, a Citroen Picasso. Smuggling: The two men were jailed for smuggling Afghans in their boot. Pictured is the scene at Calais this week, where would-be migrants try their luck on lorries headed over the border . The court heard that investigators established links between the two cases. On both the phones of the two defendants the same number - of a man living in Britain known as ‘Christie’- was found. At first Christie was believed to be Indian but later turned out to be Romanian. He allegedly paid the smugglers to drive the migrants onto the ferry and across the Channel. The court heard that a third vehicle accompanied the two defendant’s cars and was intending to monitor the operation. The migrants were allowed to sit on the back seat of the vehicles but as they approached border control posts they were ordered to get into the boot where breathing was difficult in the confined space. One of the defendants was paid £800 for his part in the operation and the other was told he could keep the car he used for the operation. The judge was told that Vaduva has a previous conviction in 2002. Operation: The court heard that three cars were involved in the smuggling attempt.

A source in Boulogne confirmed last night that the migrants were all of Afghan nationality and had been released after questioning. The Boulogne prosecutor told the court: ‘The family of three persons (parents plus child) had been arrested and questioned by Police three times in ten days. ‘Needless to say,that the smugglers who took them belong doubtless to the same organisation. The two defendants knew exactlywhat they were doing. ‘Otherwise why didn’t they put them on board a Eurolines coach? Of course the bad people are the ones that are not present here in court today. They are the enforcers who belong to a criminal organisation. In the pursuit of gain, everything including standards of good behaviour, comes second.’

chatgpt: In a joint operation conducted by British and French authorities, two Romanian men have been sentenced to jail in a French court after being caught trying to smuggle two Afghan women and a young family into the UK. Ionica Doru Cicea, 22, and Dumitru Vaduva were arrested by British police on 20th March this year at Dover’s port. The two men were attempting to smuggle the individuals, including young children, into the UK inside an articulated lorry that was loaded with tyres.  The lorry had crossed the Channel from Calais, France, and was being checked by border force officers when the twelve individuals were discovered. The two men were immediately arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration. After initial investigations, the two men were handed over to French authorities, where they were tried in a French court, and found guilty. On 9th October, the two smugglers received their sentence, with Ionica Doru Cicea being sentenced to two years imprisonment and Dumitru Vaduva receiving three years. The individuals that were being smuggled have been granted asylum in France and are being taken care of by the French authorities.  Speaking on the matter, Marc Herve, deputy public prosecutor in Boulogne Sur Mer, said: "The jail time handed down to these two individuals shows how seriously the French courts take cases of human trafficking and smuggling. It is unacceptable for anyone to make money by exploiting vulnerable individuals seeking a better life.” The smuggling of immigrants and the exploitation of the individuals involved has become a significant issue in Europe. In recent years, thousands of refugees and immigrants have tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to Europe, Libya being the main point of departure for many. It is believed that the two Romanian men were part of a larger human trafficking operation. They were hoping to make a substantial profit by selling the individuals they were smuggling to other traffickers already operating in the UK. This operation serves as a reminder of the continuing need for cooperation between European countries to put an end to human trafficking and exploitative smuggling. By working together, law enforcement officers can ensure that justice is served and that vulnerable individuals are protected from those who seek to exploit them.
