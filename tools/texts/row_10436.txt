Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry believes children should be banned from using mobile phones at dinner . She said: 'The first thing to do is to sit down, and the second is to take every mechanical aid off the table. 'When the children and grandchildren come to see me, they hand in all their games and phones at the door. I call it 'the Downing Street rule', because that's what they make you do if you go to No 10. 'If people could just do those two things, learn to enjoy smaller portions and not eat between meals, I really think it would help combat obesity.' The bestselling food writer and TV presenter said it is essential for young people to be educated about what they eat and that obesity is one of the 'worst problems' facing the country today. She uses a mobile for texting her children, but does not use Twitter  like her Bake Off co-star Paul Hollywood . She said she uses a mobile phone for texting her children, but – unlike her Bake Off co-star Paul Hollywood – does not indulge in social media. When asked whether she had adopted the modern habit of taking 'selfies', she added: 'Certainly not. But people seem to want me to do one with them all the time and I'm completely baffled. 'Presumably they all want to tweet it and say, 'I've just met Mary Berry'.' Mrs Berry told Glamour magazine about her concerns over young people's relationship with food, saying the 'whole thinness thing is very, very worrying'. She called for young women to be offered normal role models in fashion and the media, adding: 'But the worst problem of all in this country is obesity. 'It's so important for the young to be educated about what they eat.' Mrs Berry has previously called for better lessons for schoolchildren, saying all pupils should be taught to make ten basic, healthy meals before they leave school. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival last year, she said teachers should go back to showing young people 'what's good for them, how to buy it and how to make a few dishes that they and enjoy and don't cost too much'.

chatgpt: Mary Berry, the former Great British Bake Off judge, has spoken out about the importance of banning mobile phones from the dinner table, especially for children. The 79-year-old chef and television personality, who enforced an electronic gadget ban in her own home, has expressed her concern about the negative impact of smartphones and other electronic devices on family dinners and suggests such a ban could help in combating the rising obesity crisis. Berry has introduced what she calls a "Downing Street rule" in her home, which requires all children to hand over their electronic gadgets before dinner. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, she stressed the importance of focusing on quality family time, stating that "family is about conversation and it's important to make time for that." She added that "we're sitting with someone who, rather than talking to us, is just doing this with a machine. It's not really good, is it?"  The renowned TV personality cites research that shows children who eat meals with their families are less likely to become obese, have better academic performance, and have higher self-esteem. According to Berry, it's essential that families make a conscious effort to switch off their electronic devices in order to reap these benefits.  Berry is not the first to advocate for a ban on mobile phones at mealtime. Research from the University of Illinois backs up her belief, demonstrating the detrimental impact on family interactions and even language development when devices are present at the table. The study suggested that when mobile phones are present during mealtimes, parents were less likely to engage in important conversations with their children.  In addition to the positive impact on family interactions, there are numerous health benefits of an electronic gadget ban during mealtime. Studies have shown that people who eat meals alone, watching TV or using electronic devices, consume larger portions and snack more than those who eat with others.  The Downing Street rule has helped Berry's family to bond over meals and engage in meaningful conversations, which she believes can have a positive long-term impact on their relationships. "It's about making good habits, so when they grow up and have their own children, it becomes habit for them," she remarked. Berry's views have received support from many parents around the world, who say that they try to enforce similar measures in their own homes. Mary Berry's comments are an important reminder to families to make a conscious effort to switch off their electronic devices, especially during mealtime. As the obesity crisis continues to escalate, simple interventions like this could have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of children and adults. By focusing on quality family time and meaningful conversations, families can cultivate a positive environment that develops healthy habits and strengthens relationships for generations to come.
