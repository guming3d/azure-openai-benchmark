article: (CNN) -- American-born Edgar Valdez Villarreal, believed to be one of Mexico's most ruthless drug traffickers, was captured Monday, Mexican authorities said. Federal police made the capture, though the exact location and timing of it were not immediately known. The arrest, a high-profile win for Mexican authorities, followed "intelligence work" that began in June 2009, federal police said in a statement. His capture came after a shootout, according to Viviana Macias, a spokeswoman with the federal attorney general's office. Valdez, who is known as "La Barbie" because of his blue eyes and fair complexion, was a one-time top lieutenant of Mexico's most wanted man, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman. Valdez later joined the breakaway Beltran Leyva cartel, but the leader of that group, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in a shootout with Mexican officials late last year. Beltran's brother Carlos was arrested, leaving Valdez in a fight to fill a power vacuum in one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels. Lieutenants loyal to the cartel's co-founder deny Valdez is the group's leader, federal police have said. Valdez, thought to be the first U.S.-born cartel leader in Mexico, is accused in the United States of attempting to launder money and conspiring to import and distribute cocaine. He is believed to have played a key role in shipping roughly 100 kilograms of cocaine across the border at Laredo, Texas, every week for much of 2005, U.S. authorities have said. U.S. Justice Department officials offered in June a $2 million reward for information leading to the capture of the alleged cocaine kingpin. His arrest comes on the heels of another big blow against the drug cartels. Ignacio "Nacho" Coronel Villareal, a principle leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, was killed during a military raid in July. More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon intensified the government's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in December 2006, according to government figures. The president is under increasing pressure to show results.

chatgpt: Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known by the nickname "La Barbie" for his American-like appearance, was finally apprehended by Mexico's federal police on Monday. Valdez, considered to be one of the highest-ranking leaders in the Beltran Leyva drug cartel, had evaded capture for years before being caught in a joint operation between federal and state law enforcement agencies.  The 46-year-old Valdez was born in Laredo, Texas but raised in Mexico. He was a former football player and was a rare example of a top drug lord with an American background. La Barbie gained notoriety in the 2000s as a ruthless enforcer for the Sinaloa cartel and later rose to leadership positions in the Beltran Leyva organization.  Mexican authorities have long considered Valdez a top-tier target in their fight against drug traffickers. Valdez's capture is seen as a significant victory by officials and law enforcement agencies, who have been criticized for their inability to bring high-profile kingpins to justice. The Mexican government has been at war with drug cartels for more than a decade, with staggering levels of violence and corruption plaguing the country. Valdez's arrest comes at a time when Mexico is facing increased pressure from the United States to stem the flow of narcotics across the border. In recent years, the Mexican government has become more assertive in its efforts to uproot drug cartels, working more closely with US counterparts to identify and apprehend high-value targets. La Barbie is the latest in a series of high-ranking drug lords to be captured or killed. Valdez is expected to face a host of charges related to his role in the Beltran Leyva cartel, including drug trafficking, money laundering, and murder. Mexican authorities have praised the operation that led to Valdez's capture, and they hope it will send a message to other drug traffickers that they will be targeted and brought to justice. With La Barbie behind bars, Mexican law enforcement officials hope to turn the tide in the country's long-standing war against drug cartels. They have promised to continue their efforts to dismantle criminal organizations and stem the flow of narcotics into the United States.
