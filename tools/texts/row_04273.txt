chatgpt: ITV's Downton Abbey has long been a favorite of period drama fans, but the latest series has caused controversy with its adverts. Some fans have accused the adverts of ruining the show's atmosphere, with actors dressed in 1920s costumes reading Kindles. The advert in question features Lady Mary Crawley, played by Michelle Dockery, reading a Kindle, while seated in a stunning stateroom within the fictional country estate of Downton Abbey. According to fans, the presence of modern technology is simply not appropriate for a show set in the early 20th century. The advertisement has faced criticism from fans, who argue that such an anachronism undermines the authenticity and attention to historical detail that the show has long been known for. Many have taken to social media to voice their frustration, with one Twitter user accusing the show of having "sacrificed history for a marketing opportunity."  The controversy comes amid disappointing ratings for the fifth season's debut episode. The episode, which aired on Sunday, saw a significant drop in viewership compared to previous years, with 8.4 million viewers tuning in. This represents the show's lowest debut audience since 2010, when the first series premiered to 7.7 million viewers. Some have speculated that the backlash against the adverts may have played a role in the lower-than-expected ratings. Others have suggested that other factors, such as competition from other shows or a lack of excitement surrounding the new season, may be to blame. Regardless of the cause, the show's creators will undoubtedly be disappointed by the drop in viewership. Downton Abbey has been a critical and commercial success since it first premiered in 2010, dazzling audiences with its lavish sets and intricate stories of love, loss, and political upheaval in the early 20th century. While the show has faced criticism in the past for its occasional anachronisms, such as characters using words or phrases that would not have been common at the time, the use of modern technology in the adverts represents a departure from the show's usual attention to detail.  Despite the criticism, some fans have defended the show, arguing that the use of a Kindle is a minor detail that should not detract from the overall experience. They also note that the show has always aimed for a balance between historical accuracy and modern sensibilities, and that the use of a Kindle is consistent with this approach. Only time will tell whether the controversy over the adverts will have a lasting impact on the show's popularity. For now, fans will have to wait and see what the rest of the season has in store for Lady Mary and the residents of Downton Abbey.
