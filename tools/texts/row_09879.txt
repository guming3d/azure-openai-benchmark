article: (WIRED) -- Google's Maps team has made fantastic advances in surveying and mapping seemingly every square inch of navigable ground on the planet. But for mobile users, those maps have always stopped just short of indoor spaces -- until now. Google Maps 6.0 for Android launched Tuesday with a bold initiative: indoor mapping. Partnering at launch with a selection of businesses and public service structures, the new mobile Maps version allows users to see the entire layout of a mapped building, switch between floor plans if the structure has multiple levels, and locate indoor points of interest like retail stores, bathrooms and ATMs. Obviously, indoor mapping is only useful when the building you're navigating is big enough to warrant it. To this end, Google has partnered with more than 25 major businesses that handle large crowds on a regular basis -- major travel sites like San Francisco International and Chicago's O'Hare airports, as well as giant retailers like Macy's and Bloomingdale's. Considering the layers of thick concrete and steel holding up some of these buildings, it's been difficult for Google to get its location-aware technology up to snuff. "GPS is unreliable and doesn't work well indoors," said Maps project manager Steve Lee in an interview. "We used similar information to how we've implemented the navigation 'blue dot' feature in the past, and we've been able to improve the accuracy indoors, at an accuracy of about 5 to 10 meters." While half of the initiative begins in U.S. structures, Google is simultaneously launching in Japan, covering Tokyo's massive underground subway network and retail shopping centers (an area where new visitors definitely need a map). While version 6.0 isn't covering U.S. transit, Lee says the Japanese transit coverage "can give us a sense for what's in store for the future." While it's just a beginning, Google has also launched a beta tool that allows businesses to upload their own floor plans to the Maps database. Slowly but surely, Google hopes to entice more businesses and major indoor areas of interest -- both small and large -- to opt in for indoor mapping. Of course, these are private spaces, not freely accessible public roads, so it's an initiative for the long haul. The update is currently available in the Android Market for phones and tablets running Android version 2.1 and up. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

chatgpt: Google released a new version of its Maps app that features indoor mapping for Android users. The Maps 6.0 update was launched on Tuesday, enabling users to see the entire layout of a building when indoors. This is a significant move for Google Maps as it dominates the global navigation app market. The app update will allow users to zoom in on maps of shopping malls, airports, and stores and see the specific layout and interior of a building. This will enable users to navigate around large, indoor spaces more effectively. The technology recognizes which floor of the building a user is on, and dynamically updates the map so they can see precisely where they are located. Google has partnered with more than 25 major businesses, including IKEA and Macy's, to provide indoor floor plans for their stores. This move will enable shoppers to find products they are looking for with greater ease and convenience. For example, IKEA has uploaded its floor plans to help shoppers navigate through its labyrinthine stores. Google Maps' new feature is an important step forward for mobile mapping, particularly for those who use public transit or visit indoor spaces frequently. The improved experience is expected to lead to an increase in mobile map usage overall. Maps' new feature is also expected to have implications for retailers, as it allows them to provide users with customized promotions and notifications based on their indoor location. For example, a shopper could receive a push notification containing a personalized offer when they enter the store. Google's indoor mapping technology uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, and cell tower triangulation to determine the user's location within a building. While some of these technologies have existed for some time, Google Maps' integration of all of them into one package is new. Overall, Maps 6.0's indoor mapping feature is a significant leap forward for Google's mapping and navigation app. With the increased accuracy and convenience that it provides to users, we can expect to see a significant bump in mobile map usage in the coming months. This, in turn, could lead to new opportunities for businesses as they find ways to integrate the new feature into their marketing and outreach strategies.
