After tunnelling out of a prisoner of war camp, two British escapees are caught out by replying in English to a suspicious Gestapo official who wishes them ‘good luck’. But perhaps post office boss Amritpal Mehat had never seen the film – for a similar slip-up has landed him with a four-year jail sentence for stealing more than £400,000. Theft: Mehat stole more than £400,000 in cash from the Droylsden Post Office (pictured) while he was working there . After being arrested, Mehat, 26,  was . desperate to convince authorities he suffered from severe mental health . problems and should not be sent to prison. He pretended to have been ‘struck dumb by God’ and it was claimed that he had not uttered a word in more than a year. A judge referred Mehat to a mental hospital and he took part in a month of consultations – remaining mute throughout. But much like Flight Lieutenant Andy . MacDonald in the 1963 film, he slipped up when a psychiatrist wished him . ‘good luck’ in  Punjabi – and he blew his cover by replying ‘thank you’ in his native tongue. His mental health assessment was abandoned and he was jailed after being found guilty of theft and conspiracy to steal.

'Wicked deception': Judge Bernard Lever told the defendant his ruse had the Crown 'jumping through forensic hoops for two years' After hearing of his conversation with . the psychiatrist, a jury unanimously decided he was ‘mute by malice’ rather than ‘mute by visitation of God’. At his sentencing at Minshull Street . Crown Court in Manchester, Mehat, who lived in an £800,000 house with . his family in Sheffield, spoke again – this time to confirm his name and . his guilty plea.

chatgpt: In a shocking revelation, a businessman admitted that he had falsely claimed to be mute for over a year to avoid facing the consequences of his crime. His guilty conscience had led him to believe that he was not worthy of speaking up after he was caught stealing. His ruse was so convincing that a judge had sent him to a psychiatric hospital for assessment. The businessman in question, whose name has been withheld, was finally caught out when a doctor spoke to him in Punjabi and wished him luck. In a lapse of judgment, the man replied with a simple "thank you," revealing that he could indeed speak after all. The doctor was able to deduce that the man had been pretending to be mute all this time and reported the matter to the authorities. The businessman was initially arrested on suspicion of theft after CCTV footage caught him stealing from a local store. He had panicked and fled the scene but was identified and apprehended by the authorities soon afterward. Rather than face the consequences of his actions, he pretended to be mute, hoping to evade punishment. The man's ruse was so convincing that he had even managed to fool medical professionals. He was sent to a psychiatric hospital for assessment, where he continued to pretend to be mute. However, the doctors eventually became suspicious and began testing his hearing and speech abilities. After being caught out by the doctor, the businessman admitted to his deception and expressed his remorse for his actions. He revealed that the shame of being caught stealing had prompted him to believe that he was not worthy of speaking up. He apologized for wasting the time of medical professionals and the court system by leading them on with his false claims. The man's story has drawn widespread criticism from experts, who believe that such behavior is a result of deep-seated feelings of inadequacy and shame. The man's actions highlight the need for mental health support for those involved in criminal activity, particularly those who are genuinely remorseful and willing to seek help. In conclusion, the businessman's case serves as a cautionary tale for those who believe that they can evade the consequences of their actions by pretending to be someone else. The truth always catches up with those who try to deceive others, and the consequences can be severe. It is important to seek support if you find yourself struggling after making mistakes or committing a crime.
