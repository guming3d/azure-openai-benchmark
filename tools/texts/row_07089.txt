Doctors told police they also found bruising on the boy’s forehead and torso. Wright was charged with felony assault and acting in a manner injurious to a child, though it is likely that the charges will be upped to murder, a spokesman for the Kings County district attorney’s office told the New York Times.

Neighbours were devastated when they heard the news. ‘It broke my heart in pieces, a little boy suffering like that,’ neighbour Ivan Sanchez told the Post. ‘He’s evil,’ Mr Sanchez added. ‘I hope he gets what he deserves.’
