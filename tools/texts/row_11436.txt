article: (CNN) -- What has caused the Israelis to strike so hard inside Gaza? Israel's Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor told me Israel felt compelled to respond to what it sees as relentless Palestinian rocket attacks into Southern Israel which terrify civilians and force schools and business closures. But the view from Gaza is very different. Palestinians there say that what the Israeli military calls surgical strikes routinely kill civilians and they are cut off from the world with a total land, air and sea blockade. FAQ: What is Hamas? Is this a serious escalation of the Israel/Palestinian conflict or just another skirmish? This is the most serious Israeli offensive on Gaza since early 2009, when an Israeli military ground war killed up to 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. The question now is whether this will remain a contained incident or if this will turn into something bigger. Israel's military says preparations are being made for a ground offensive, should the need for one arise. The coming days will determine how serious this incident is. iReport: Photos and video from inside the protests in Israel .

chatgpt: In response to the rocket attacks carried out by Hamas militants, Israel launched an aggressive campaign in Gaza. This latest attack is considered to be the most significant offensive conducted by Israel since 2009. Retaliatory measures were taken by the Israeli military in Gaza as rockets were fired by Hamas militants, and Israel fired back with jets and attack helicopters.
 
According to the military spokesman, Jonathan Conricus, over 600 rockets were fired at southern Israel, with about 150 intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. At least four Israelis have been killed and dozens injured in the rocket attacks.  Israel announced that contingency plans for a possible ground attack in Gaza are in place. They also stated that the main objective of the operation is to target Hamas infrastructure, but not civilians.  This attack was expected to escalate tensions in the area, as for Palestinians, the timing of the Israeli strike, coming amid the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, was considered provocative. Hamas spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum, responded with a warning that Israel crossed a "red line" and that the group was ready to respond with strong intensity.  The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, cut short his trip to the US to deal with the escalating situation. He addressed the nation and expressed solidarity with those who have suffered, promising to continue the strikes against the militant group. However, the United Nations and other international organizations are calling for a de-escalation of the situation in Gaza. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, expressed his sympathy and support for the civilians affected, while also calling for restraint from all sides. The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, expressed her concern over the escalating situation, and called for a cessation of hostilities to protect civilians. The ongoing tensions come as Israel is preparing for its Independence Day celebrations, and the situation is expected to remain volatile in the coming days. UN officials are closely monitoring the situation, with the fear that any further escalation could have a devastating humanitarian impact on the already-stressed population.  In conclusion, the current volatile situation in Gaza is rapidly escalating, with Israel launching a serious offensive in response to Hamas rocket attacks. While the Israeli military promised that their targets are Hamas infrastructure, concerns are mounting about further violence and civilian casualties. The international community has called for de-escalation and a return to negotiations, yet the situation remains tense, and further violence could have serious consequences for the entire region.
