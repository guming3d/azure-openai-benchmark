article: Thirty per cent of online posts which are deemed inappropriate on China's equivalent of Twitter are deleted within half an hour, according to new research. Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach conducted the study on how quickly censorship on Sina Weibo can work. They found that some posts are deleted as quickly as five minutes after being put online. Censorship: Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach found that some posts are deleted after five minutes of being posted . Microblogging site Sina Weibo launched in 2010 but it now has 300 million users. About 100 million messages are sent daily. But the Chinese government seems to ask Chinese companies to censor posts. Support Syrian rebels . Lying of gov (Jixian) Beijing rainstorms . Judicial independence . Freedom of speech . One-Child policy abuse . Group sex . Corpse plants in Dalian . Human Rights news . The researchers said: 'We found that deletions happen most heavily in the first hour after a post has been submitted. 'Focusing on original posts, not reposts/retweets, we observed that nearly 30 per cent of the total deletion events occur within five to 30 minutes. 'Nearly 90 per cent of the deletions happen within the first 24 hours. 'Leveraging out data, we also consider a variety of hypotheses about the mechanisms used by Weibo for censorship, such as the extent to which they use retrospective keyword-based censorship, and how repost/retweet popularity interacts with censorship. 'We also perform a topical analysis of the deleted posts, overcoming the usage of neologisms, named entities, and informal language that typifies Chinese social media.' Crandall and Wallach spent 30 days tracking posts by 3,500 users on Sina Weibo. During that time, 300 of the accounts, or 12 percent of the total, were deleted. Accounts that got censored the most often also had posts censored the most quickly, showing that they might be the target of more scrutiny. Though they could not estimate the exact number of people dedicated to deleting posts on Sina Weibo, the two computer scientists said that the company would need to employ at least 4,000 censors every day if none of the process was automated. In December last year the ruling Communist arty, led Xi Jinping, announced moves to force internet users to fully identify themselves to service providers, raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the country. It's draconian internet censorship system has been dubbed the 'Great Firewall of China'. China already heavily restricts access to many foreign sites. It blocks Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and many other websites citing a need to maintain social stability.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by computer scientists Jed Crandell and Dan Wallach has revealed some startling facts about social media behaviour. According to their research, some social media posts are deleted as quickly as five minutes after being put online, with the majority of deletions taking place within the first half hour of posting. Crandell and Wallach, who are both experts in computer science and cybersecurity, conducted the study by analyzing social media platforms and observing how users interacted with their posts. They found that many users tend to delete their posts soon after publishing them, for a variety of reasons. Some users might delete their posts if they receive negative feedback or criticism from other users, while others might delete their posts if they realize they made an error or included incorrect information. Still others might delete their posts if they feel that they no longer represent their views or opinions. The research shows that there is a significant amount of activity occurring on social media platforms that is not being captured by traditional metrics such as likes or shares. While these metrics are important for measuring engagement and reach, they do not provide a complete picture of user behaviour on social media. Crandell and Wallach's study has broader implications beyond social media platforms. The findings suggest that there may be a considerable amount of online activity that is not being tracked or measured by traditional analytics tools. This could have implications for a range of industries, from marketing and advertising to politics and social research. For example, companies that rely on social media data to track consumer behaviour and sentiment may need to adjust their analysis methods to account for the high rate of deletions. Political campaigns that use social media as a way to reach voters may need to rethink their strategies if a significant portion of their posts are being deleted shortly after being published. The study also highlights the importance of user privacy on social media platforms. If users are deleting their posts soon after publication, it suggests that they may be concerned about the permanence of their online presence. Social media platforms need to take these concerns seriously and provide users with more control over their online activity. In conclusion, Crandell and Wallach's research sheds new light on social media behaviour and raises important questions about how we measure and track online activity. As social media continues to evolve and grow, it is essential that we explore these questions in more depth to gain a better understanding of how people interact on these platforms and what implications this has for society as a whole.
