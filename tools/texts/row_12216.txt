article: (CNN)A decades-old mystery that captivated Oklahoma has been solved after officials confirmed the identities of two groups of people -- some of them teens -- who went missing in 1969 and 1970. The first crack in the cold cases came when police in the tiny town of Sayre were testing sonar equipment in September 2013 in murky Foss Lake. They were stunned to discover a green 1952 Chevrolet and a blue 1969 Chevrolet Camaro. Human remains found in the Camaro matched the general descriptions of three teenagers -- Jimmy Allen Williams, 16, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Thomas Michael Rios, 18, all from Sayre, the state Medical Examiner's Office said. The other remains matched the genders and ages of three passengers in the green Chevrolet who went missing in 1969, the medical examiner said last year. John Alva Porter, then 69, was in that car with Cleburn Hammack, 42, and Nora Marie Duncan, 58. DNA test results this week prove that the bodies belonged to the missing, the state Medical Examiner's Office said, adding that they all died from drowning and their deaths were accidental. One night in 1970, another in 1969 . The three teenagers who disappeared went for a ride around their hometown in Williams' blue Camaro with a white top, according to the Doe Network, a volunteer organization that helps law enforcement solve cold cases. Only six days before the 16-year-old and his friends went missing, Williams had bought the used Camaro, a slick muscle car that teenage boys loved at that time, said Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record & Beckham County Democrat newspaper. Johnson was Native American and, Spitzer said, was related to legendary Indian chief Sitting Bull. Residents regarded Johnson as an Indian princess, she told CNN. Williams and his friends had planned to attend a football game the night they went missing, but they may have gone hunting instead, Spitzer said. Two rifles were found, rusted and corroded, in the Camaro. In the other car, Porter, Duncan and Hammack were last seen when their car was "given a push" to help get it started, according to a July 1969 newspaper article published in Oklahoma. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Michael Martinez and Ed Payne contributed to this report.

According to the latest DNA test results, the remains belong to three teenagers and three adults who disappeared in 1969 and 1970. Three of the remains are believed to belong to the teenagers who were last seen driving a 1969 Camaro. The car was later found abandoned, but the teens were never seen again. After decades of searching, their families now have closure as their remains have been identified. The other three individuals include two men and a woman who were found in a 1952 Chevrolet. The identities of these individuals have not yet been released, but authorities are working to locate their families. The discovery of these remains has brought new attention to these long-cold cases. Investigators are now trying to piece together what happened to these individuals and how they ended up in their final resting places. Many questions still remain unanswered. Were these individuals victims of foul play? Did they meet with a tragic accident? Why did it take over 50 years for their remains to be found and identified? The families of these individuals are grappling with the news of their loved ones' deaths. For many, this news has reopened old wounds and stirred up memories of a time long past. But for others, it brings a sense of closure and peace after so many years of uncertainty. Local authorities are promising to continue their investigation into these cases, hoping that new evidence will come to light that will shed light on what happened to these individuals. As this story continues to unfold, it serves as a reminder of the importance of never giving up on cold cases. The families of these six individuals now have some closure, and it's thanks to the tireless efforts of law enforcement and forensic scientists who worked diligently to find the answers they were seeking.
