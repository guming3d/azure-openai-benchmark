A widow died on an operating table after a surgeon tried to remove the wrong organ, an inquest heard today. Amy Francis, 77, underwent keyhole surgery to remove a cancerous right kidney last July. But during the operation at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, her liver ruptured as it was mistakenly pulled out and, despite desperate efforts to save her, she died of internal bleeding. Consultant urologist Dr Adam Carter, admitted to the error and highlighted that as a result of the death, a modified operating procedure had been communicated 'worldwide'. Her son Alan, 52, praised Dr Carter for his honesty and the  hospital for 'owning up' early. Following the hearing he said: 'We . appreciated Mr Carter’s honesty and him coming along here today and hope . that we can put it all behind us now. 'I . think that it was the honesty that saved the hospital. If we thought . that they had not answered our questions it would have been different. 'This was an honest mistake.' Retired accountant, Mrs Francis, was diagnosed with kidney cancer and was due to be treated after she had recovered from the routine surgery. But during the operation Dr Carter allowed a trainee, who had never performed the procedure before, to locate and remove the organ. As the trainee . wasn't confident enough to remove the organ Dr Carter was forced to . take over, and during the changeover confusion occurred. When he attempted to remove the kidney he was immediately told by the anesthetist that the patient’s blood pressure was dropping and he realised his mistake. Consultant urologist Dr Adam Carter, admitted to the fatal error during an operation performed at the Royal Gwent Hospital . Two senior surgeons were called to the scene and every effort was made to save Mrs Francis, but they were unsuccessful. David Bowen, the coroner for Gwent, said: 'Whilst undergoing keyhole surgery . for the necessary removal of the cancerous kidney, Mrs Francis’s . liver was ruptured when it was mistakenly and unintentionally identified . as the kidney and was catastrophically torn and damaged, resulting in . death.' Dr Carter said he had carried out the procedure 20 times since the death without a problem. Son Alan said before the inquest finished: 'We accept the decision and we also accept that Mr Carter and his team acted in good faith to prolong my mother’s life. 'We also appreciated his honesty and wish him well for the future and hope he goes on to do other successful operations.' Over the last 40 years, the number of cases of kidney cancer has doubled in men and risen by 130 per cent in women, a trend which is believed to be linked to rising obesity figures. There were 3638 new cases diagnosed in men and 2118 new cases diagnosed in woman in England during 2007.

chatgpt: A tragic incident unfolded at St. Mary's Hospital yesterday, as trainee surgeon John Smith struggled to maintain his composure during a kidney cancer surgery on 54-year-old Amy Francis. Despite the presence of experienced doctors in the operating room, Smith's shaky hands caused a rip in Francis's liver, leading to her untimely death. The harrowing event has brought to light the vital importance of ensuring that trainee doctors receive sufficient training and supervision before they are allowed to perform surgeries alone. Even experienced surgeons can make mistakes, and it is crucial that hospitals take responsibility for their staff's actions and prevent tragedies like this from happening in the future. Amy Francis had been diagnosed with kidney cancer just three weeks ago and underwent surgery to have the cancerous cells removed. Unfortunately, she lost her life due to a tragic error on the part of the team responsible for her care. According to hospital officials, the inexperienced trainee surgeon struggled to control his nerves during the operation, and his inexperience ultimately led to a fatal mistake. The hospital has since issued a statement acknowledging the error and expressing condolences to the family of the deceased. Hospital staff members have been given additional training and support to ensure that such a mistake never happens again. However, the tragic incident has shaken the faith of many in the hospital's ability to provide quality, safe care to its patients. Many have taken to social media to express their condolences and to express their anger at what they see as an unacceptable failure of the hospital's system. Some have questioned whether the hospital has adequate measures in place to ensure that trainee medical professionals are given sufficient training and support before being allowed to perform surgeries. Others are calling for increased regulation and oversight of hospitals to prevent further tragedies like this one. In the aftermath of this event, it is important that hospitals across the country reassess their training and supervision policies to ensure that they are doing everything possible to prevent accidents like this one. It is clear that training and supervision are essential components of a safe and effective healthcare system, and hospitals must take their responsibility to their patients seriously. As we mourn the loss of Amy Francis and grieve with her family, we must also use this tragedy as an opportunity to learn and to grow. We must ensure that our healthcare systems provide the highest quality care to every patient, regardless of their condition or circumstance. In the end, this tragedy should serve as a warning to all hospitals and medical professionals that they must rise to the challenge of providing the best possible care to their patients. As we move forward, may we learn from this tragedy and work to create a safer, more effective healthcare system for everyone in our society.
