article: Almost 70 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the concentration camp set up by the Germans to exterminate Jewish prisoners, there are still a handful of Nazis who continue to receive U.S. Social Security benefits. The House unanimously passed a bill -- dubbed the "No Social Security for Nazis Act" -- on Tuesday that would cut off those benefits. Texas Republican Rep. Sam Johnson, a decorated Air Force veteran who was a prisoner of war for seven years during the Vietnam War, was the lead sponsor of the legislation. "While the number of Nazis receiving Social Security is few, allowing payments to continue is an insult to those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis," Johnson said. Congress has considered various proposals designed to deny any benefits from Nazis. This latest bill was introduced last month after a recent Associated Press investigation reported that dozens of Nazis who were deported from the United States were still collecting millions of dollars in retirement benefits. Even though these people were stripped of their U.S. citizenship and forced to leave the country a loophole in the law allowed them to continue receiving Social Security checks. Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, who has been a key proponent in changing the law, told CNN that she has asked both the Justice Department and Social Security Administration to find out how much money was paid out and how many were still receiving any social security funds. She estimated there were roughly four individuals who were still eligible for the payments. "They are dying out, but anybody who gets it is too much. They came to this country under false pretenses," Maloney told CNN. Suspected Nazi war criminal dies hours before court approves extradition . There is a companion bill in the Senate and the sponsors of the House bill are confident that this is one item that both parties in the House and Senate can get to the President's desk before the lame duck session of wraps up this month. "If we can't agree on this, my goodness what can we agree on?" Maloney asked.

chatgpt: Congress has demonstrated that bipartisanship is still a possibility, as it rallied around a bill to prevent Nazis from receiving U.S. Social Security benefits. The bill has found support from both sides of the political aisle, signaling a rare moment of cooperation in Washington. The initiative was launched by Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, who estimates that only about four individuals are still eligible for such payments. However, she believes the principle behind the bill is important. "I don't think any American taxpayer should have to foot the bill for somebody who committed crimes against humanity," she stated. The bill has already secured the backing of several prominent Republicans, including Florida Rep. Gus Bilirakis and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt. Bilirakis called it a "commonsense" measure, while Blunt said it was important to ensure the government doesn't support those who committed heinous crimes. The bill is likely to enjoy broad support in Congress, given its moral clarity and straightforward nature. It simply states that no individual who was involved in Nazi activities, including persecution, extermination or enslavement, will be eligible for Social Security payments. While the bill may seem like a small one, its significance is not lost on those who have followed the growing trend of political polarization in the U.S. In a political climate where cooperation and compromise are often seen as signs of weakness, the fact that both Democrats and Republicans have come together to support this measure is a welcome development. The bill's progress comes at a time when many Americans are deeply divided over a wide range of issues, including immigration, gun control, and health care. Its passage would be a symbol of unity and a reminder that, despite our differences, we all share a common commitment to the principles of justice and fairness. Maloney's bill is also a reminder of the dark history that continues to haunt the world. The atrocities committed by the Nazis during World War II are well-documented and continue to shock and horrify people around the globe. In that context, a bill to prevent Nazis from receiving Social Security payments seems like a small but necessary step towards ensuring that the victims of these crimes are not forgotten. In conclusion, Congress has shown rare signs of bipartisanship in rallying around a bill to ban Nazis from receiving Social Security benefits. The bill has already garnered support from both Democrats and Republicans and is likely to enjoy a smooth passage through Congress. Its symbolic significance and importance in preserving historical memory cannot be overstated.
