Alonso is a very honest person with himself and with the Real Madrid,' said the Italian. 'He explained it well and said that he needed more motivation. Everyone here at the club respects him and it would have been very difficult to get him to change his mind. 'You can't say to a player like Xabi that he couldn't leave. I wish him luck and he has been a very important player for the team last season. 'It is possible that some people think that the team is under-strength but we have players that can perform in different positions. We have five strikers because Isco and James (Rodriguez) can play there. 'The squad is not closed because the market is still open. Maybe we will sign somebody but at the same time it is possible we won't.'

chatgpt: Real Madrid suffered a setback as Cristiano Ronaldo, one of their biggest names, is still struggling for fitness. The Portuguese international has been out of action since the beginning of the season due to an ankle injury. Despite intensive rehabilitation, the Real Madrid forward was unable to make a return for Real Madrid's outing last week. The news left Real Madrid fans and supporters apprehensive about Ronaldo's future in the team. To make matters worse, the departure of Angel Di Maria and Xabi Alonso this week came as a shock to millions of football enthusiasts around the world. The duo bid adieu to their Santiago Bernabeu days and left for Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, respectively. The move is likely to have an impact on Real Madrid's fortunes this season, with Di Maria and Alonso being vital cogs in the wheel. However, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has shown that he is not complacent with his squad and has selected James Rodriguez to play in Real's forward line in Ronaldo's absence. The Colombian superstar has been a revelation since joining Real Madrid and has shown that he is capable of delivering the goods when it matters most. Rodriguez's inclusion in the forward line will be a welcome addition for Real Madrid as the team faces critical matches in the upcoming weeks. Real Madrid is set to play against Levante in the La Liga, followed by a crucial UEFA Champions League match against Borussia Monchengladbach. Real Madrid's fan base is, understandably, worried about Ronaldo's fitness but reports suggest that the star's recovery is on track, and he is expected to make a return to the starting eleven soon. The team's medical staff is working round the clock to ensure that the forward makes a quick and complete recovery. Ancelotti, a former Real Madrid player himself, has been very vocal about his ambitions for the team this season. The coach has been working hard on the training ground, and Rodriguez's selection in the forward line is proof that the team is determined to achieve their goals. Real Madrid has always had a reputation for producing some of the best players in the world, and the current team is no exception. With the likes of Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale, and Toni Kroos in the squad, there is no shortage of talent in the team. In conclusion, the departure of Di Maria and Alonso has undoubtedly impacted Real Madrid's fortunes. Still, the inclusion of James Rodriguez in the forward line is a testament to the strength and depth of the squad. Real Madrid's fans and supporters will be eagerly waiting for Ronaldo's return, but the team's current form suggests that they can cope without him for the time being. The coming weeks will be critical for the team. Ancelotti will be hoping to make the most of his squad and secure vital victories in their upcoming fixtures to propel his team forward.
