article: Online dating without any 'physical contact' is grounds for divorce in  France, a judge has ruled. A 45-year-old woman was deemed as cheating on her husband for flirting  on the internet with men she had never met, a family court in the  southern city of Aix-en-Provence said. The couple named only as Nathalie and Bruno, 43, had three children before  separating in 2008 after 18 years together. Ruling: A 45-year-old woman was deemed as cheating on her husband for flirting on the internet with men she had never met (picture posed by model) A judge has now granted the husband's demand for a divorce, agreeing  that the break-up was the sole fault of the wife due to her online  infidelity and sharing of intimate photographs with a number of men. She used the Belgium-based social network Netlog to contact the men. In her defence, the wife claimed she was in contact with the men while she was suffering from depression.

The husband's lawyer Helene Poivey-Leclercq said after the hearing: 'Everyone agreed there had been no physical infidelity, but the judge  considered that the act of seeking an extra-marital relationship was  offensive behaviour towards the husband. 'French law states that spouses owe each other mutual respect, fidelity  and help. It was in this notion of respect that the wife had failed.' A survey last month revealed that a fifth of people aged 18-35 have secretly used dating websites behind their partner’s back while in a relationship. According to a new study, 21 per cent of coupled-up people in the UK between the ages of 18 and 35 have used dating apps or websites without their partner’s knowledge. Respondents were initially asked ‘Have you ever used dating websites?’ to which 58 per cent said that ‘yes’ they had, whilst the remaining respondents claimed not to have done so. They were then asked ‘Have you ever used a dating website or app whilst in a relationship?’ to which 21 per cent of all respondents said that ‘yes’, they had in the past. A further 14 per cent, one in seven, admitted that they had used a dating website or app while in their ‘current relationship’. The most commonly used dating websites amongst those in relationships were Plenty of Fish (43 per cent), followed by the dating app Tinder (37 per cent) while 29 per cent even paid to be members of Match.com.

chatgpt: In a recent court case that has gained a lot of attention, a woman named Nathalie was found guilty of cheating on her husband despite never physically meeting the men she had been sending intimate photos to online. According to sources, Nathalie had been communicating with several men through various online platforms for quite some time. The communication had escalated to the point where she was sending them explicit photos of herself, leading the men to believe that they were in a relationship. However, Nathalie's actions did not go unnoticed by her husband, who discovered the explicit photos on her phone. In response, he filed for divorce and took the matter to court. During the trial, Nathalie argued that she had never actually met any of the men in person and therefore had not cheated on her husband. However, the judge ruled that seeking an affair, regardless of whether or not it was physical, was still considered offensive behavior towards her husband. Many people have since weighed in on the case, with some questioning whether or not Nathalie's actions were truly cheating. Some argue that since she never actually physically met any of the men, it shouldn't technically count as infidelity. However, others argue that the emotional betrayal that Nathalie's husband felt was just as real as if she had actually been intimate with another person. It's a complex case that has sparked debate amongst many people. Regardless of how people feel about the case, one thing is clear - Nathalie's actions have had serious consequences. Not only has she ended her marriage, but she has also been labeled as a cheater in the eyes of the court and society at large. This case highlights the potential dangers of engaging in online relationships outside of a committed partnership. While it may be tempting to seek emotional or physical fulfillment elsewhere, it's ultimately not worth risking the trust and stability of a long-term relationship. In conclusion, the case of Nathalie has shed light on the complicated issue of infidelity in the digital age. While opinions may differ on whether or not her actions were truly cheating, it's clear that her decision to seek out intimacy with other men online has had serious consequences. It's a reminder to us all to be aware of the potential consequences of our online actions, and to always prioritize honesty and respect in our romantic relationships.
