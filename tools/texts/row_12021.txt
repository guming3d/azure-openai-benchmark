A teacher was killed after he suffered a fatal allergic reaction when he ate a piece of bread without realising it had nuts in it. Music teacher Andrew Turner, 38, went into sudden anaphylactic shock after he ate the bread with some soup while at a friend’s house in the Vale of Glamorgan. Today his family told of Mr Turner's death as they warned other allergy sufferers to take care when staying away from home over Christmas. Andrew Turner, 38, died from a fatal allergic reaction after eating a piece of bread that contained nuts . Speaking from the family home in St Donats, near Cardiff, Mr Turner's mother, Claudette, father, Ian, and brother Anthony, said he had always been 'very careful' to avoid nuts because even smelling them on people’s breath would make him ill. But he had no idea there were nuts in the wholegrain bread when he dipped the crust into the soup.  Mr Turner went into sudden anaphylactic shock and paramedics were unable to save him. Mrs Turner described her son's death on 26 November as a 'terrible tragedy'. She said: 'Andrew was always very careful after being diagnosed with the allergy at the age of three. 'We suspected a horse hair allergy and when he was tested they found one for nuts as well, but Andrew was always very sensible child and he took great care with what he ate. 'He could even smell nuts on people’s breath - and would feel unwell as a result.' Mr Turner, who had just accepted a new job teaching music, was always extremely careful with his allergy . She said her son had been so careful about his allergy that the question of carrying an epipen, used by those with allergies to administer a rapid dose of adrenalin, 'simply never arose'. Music teacher Andrew had been tutoring part time in Swansea but had recently accepted a new job in Cardiff. A spokeswoman for Anaphylaxis UK, a charity that raises awareness of the dangers of allergies, warned people to be especially vigilant over Christmas. She said: 'There are lots of factors that can contribute towards an individual’s sensitivity at any particular time. 'Surviving a severe reaction can depend on factors such as how soon they receive emergency medication and the first aid treatment following the reaction.'

chatgpt: A young man from St Donats, Vale of Glamorgan has tragically passed away after suffering from sudden anaphylactic shock, leaving his family and friends in deep shock and sadness. The incident occurred when Andrew Turner, 38, was at a get-together with friends. According to reports, despite the paramedics' best efforts, they were unable to save him. Mr. Turner's mother, Claudette, expressed her immense grief, saying that he had always been cautious due to his condition -- which he had been diagnosed with since he was just three years old. In light of this tragic event, the Turner family has urged other allergy sufferers to take extra precautions while away from home over the Christmas period. The festive season is often marked by eating out and socializing in large groups, which can be particularly challenging for allergy sufferers. The family's plea has struck a chord with many people across the country, with doctors and allergy specialists encouraging individuals to take their allergies seriously and be extra vigilant when eating outside their own homes. It is crucial to carry an adrenaline auto-injector at all times, particularly when dining out, to ensure prompt action is taken in case of anaphylactic shock. This lifesaving tool prolongs the time available for emergency services to arrive and provide treatment. Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially fatal condition that requires immediate medical attention. It is caused by an allergic reaction, and symptoms often include breathing difficulties, swollen tongue, and a sudden drop in blood pressure. It is crucial to seek medical help right away when someone is exhibiting these symptoms. Allergy UK, a leading charity for allergy sufferers, has also emphasized the importance of seeking medical advice and following medical professionals' guidance when it comes to managing allergies. People who have been diagnosed with allergies need to be aware of their triggers and how to avoid them, so they are less likely to develop an allergic reaction. The tragic loss of Andrew Turner serves as a solemn reminder of the importance of taking allergies seriously and the necessity of always being prepared for a potential allergic reaction. His family's warning to other allergy sufferers and their loved ones should not be taken lightly. We must all do our part to ensure that individuals with allergies can live their lives safely and comfortably.
