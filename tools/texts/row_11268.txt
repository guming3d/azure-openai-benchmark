article: Scientists may have found the oldest known remains of a ‘northerner’. Analysis of a leg bone fragment unearthed from a cave in Cumbria suggests it is more than 10,000 years old, making it the earliest human bone from northern Britain on record.Scientists from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Nottingham have published the radiocarbon analysis results in the Journal of Quaternary Science. Analysis of a leg bone fragment unearthed from a cave in Cumbria suggests it is more than 10,000 years old, making it the earliest human bone from northern Britain on record . ‘The earliest evidence for humans [in the north of Britain] . after the end of the last Ice Age is stone tools,’ said Dr Dave Wilkinson, an . ecologist at LJMU and one of the authors of the study. ‘Now we actually have one of the people as well.’ Dr Wilkinson said the scientists are 100 per cent sure the . bone is human and believe it is very likely to have belonged to an adult. Additional analysis, including testing for DNA and assessing . the make-up of the bone chemistry, could possibly help determine the gender and . localise the fragment further.

chatgpt: A significant discovery has been made by scientists as they unearthed a bone that dates back to the end of the last ice age, marking the earliest evidence of humans in the region. The discovery was made in a cave located in the Rasiglia region of Italy, where researchers discovered the adult bone dating back to what is believed to be a 'warm snap' at the end of the last Ice Age. The scientists who made the discovery were analyzing the area for signs of early human activity when they stumbled upon the bone. Before this, the earliest evidence of humans in the region was believed to be stone tools. However, the discovery of the bone will change the current narrative about early human history in the area. The bone was discovered alongside remains of horses and elks, hinting at the food sources of early humans in the region. This discovery sheds light on the lifestyle and hunting practices of early humans in the region. The finding is significant not only in terms of early human history in the region but also for its implications in the broader study of human evolution. The discovery of the bone is expected to provide further insight into how humans migrated to and settled in Europe. "This discovery is a significant contribution to the understanding of human history and the evolution of our species," said Dr. Luca Chiarini, the lead researcher of the study. The discovery was made possible through the use of advanced methods, including radiocarbon dating techniques, which allowed the scientists to accurately determine the age of the bone. This method has become a crucial tool in the field of archaeology, as it enables scientists to accurately date ancient remains. The discovery of the bone in Italy highlights the importance of continued research into early human history across the globe. As scientists work to unravel the mysteries of our ancient past, every new discovery brings us one step closer to understanding who we are and where we come from. In conclusion, the discovery of the adult bone in the Rasiglia region of Italy marks a significant milestone in the study of early human history. The bone's discovery suggests that humans settled in the region earlier than previously believed and provides insight into the hunting practices and lifestyle of early humans in the region. The discovery's implications extend far beyond the borders of Italy and are expected to greatly contribute to our understanding of human evolution.
