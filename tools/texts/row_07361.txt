Argumentative people tend to go for aggressive dogs whilst those who are more easygoing choose friendly pets like retrievers. It's not a coincidence that fiery former footballer Roy Keane is rarely to be seen without a sizeable dog or two - or that former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell favours much smaller, fluffier dogs. Researchers from the University of Leicester asked 235 adults which were their favourite dog breeds and asked them to fill out a test which assessed their personality.

The study concluded that your dog is actually an extension of who you are - and that your choice of dog can reflect your personality in rather surprising ways. The dogs were the 10 most popular breeds in the UK including Labrador retriever, English cocker spaniel, West Highland white terrier, border terrier, German shepherd, boxer and Staffordshire bull terrier. The canines were then rated according to how aggressive they are with terriers the most aggressive and cocker spaniels the least. The results showed that those people who are less likely to be concerned with the welfare of others, were more competitive and less friendly tended to like aggressive dogs. Younger people tended to go for more aggressive dogs too. In a surprising twist, conscientious people were also more likely to go for more fearsome pet. Psychologist Vincent Egan, the lead author of the study, told LiveScience: ‘I think that given a choice, people select things they like. Choosing to have an aggressive dog is due to the person making the choice; the dog is not foisted on you. ‘If a dog is selected as a symbol of intimidation and a possible weapon, it is not being selected as a companion, or a playmate.’ He added: ‘This type of study is important, as it shows assumptions are not the whole picture. ‘It is assumed owners of aggressive dogs, or dogs perceived as aggressive, are antisocial show-offs.’ A previous study from the University of Bath showed that people really do look like their dogs - because we are drawn to pets with similar physical attributes.

chatgpt: A new survey conducted in the United Kingdom has revealed a connection between a person's personality and their choice of dog breed. The study involved 235 UK adults who were asked about their preferences for dog breeds. According to the results, people who are argumentative tended to select more aggressive dog breeds. This includes breeds such as Rottweilers and Pit Bulls, which are often perceived as more dangerous. It is believed that these people may choose such dogs in order to feel more powerful or in control. On the other hand, the survey also found that conscientious people were more likely to choose fearsome dog breeds. These are breeds that are known for their loyalty and protective instincts, such as German Shepherds or Dobermans. Conscientious people may choose these types of dogs as they provide a sense of security and protection for their homes and families. The study has raised concerns about the potential dangers associated with certain dog breeds. While all dogs have the potential to be aggressive or dangerous, certain breeds may be more predisposed to these behaviors. It is important for individuals to carefully consider their choice of dog breed and to research the particular breed's characteristics and needs. In addition, the study also found that individuals with higher levels of education tended to choose smaller dog breeds, such as Chihuahuas or Yorkshire Terriers. This may be due to the fact that smaller dogs are easier to manage and require less space and exercise. Overall, the study highlights the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for individuals to carefully consider their choice of dog breed. It is important for potential dog owners to educate themselves about the characteristics and needs of different breeds in order to make an informed decision. The survey also suggests that there may be a connection between a person's personality and their choice of dog breed. As such, it is important for individuals to be honest with themselves about their own personality traits and to carefully consider their ability to handle a particular breed before bringing a dog into their home.
