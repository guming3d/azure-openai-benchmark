article: (Mashable) -- The world's largest professional social network just got a wider reach -- and it wants to be in front of your face for more of the day. LinkedIn launched its long-awaited iPad app late Wednesday, along with revamped versions of its iPhone and Android apps. Redesigned from the ground up, the tablet version looks nothing like the LinkedIn website; it's more akin to a social news aggregator. "This was a chance to go back to the drawing board," says Mario Sundar, LinkedIn's social media manager. "To design it for how people use the iPad: morning and night infotainment." The app's main screen is a clean, simple interface with just three options: updates, profile and inbox. The latter two are self-explanatory, although it's worth mentioning that the list of people who've looked at your profile -- a voyeuristic option hidden deep on the website -- is front and center here. It's "updates" where the app shines, and turns into a kind of socially-enhanced Flipboard. You see stories your friends have shared, beautifully laid out, alongside such nuggets of news as which of your friends have changed their jobs recently.(Download it in the app store here.) The app also pulls in details of the day ahead from your Google Calendar or Exchange calendar. LinkedIn expects you'll use it over breakfast, when you're torn between work and news, as well as take it to meetings. It's been a long time coming -- longer even than the much-delayed Facebook iPad app. LinkedIn has 150 million users, and the iPad is the fastest growing device on the network. More than 22% of LinkedIn traffic comes from mobile devices; a year ago, that figure was 8%. What do you make of the LinkedIn iPad app? Will you use it? Let us know in the comments.

chatgpt: LinkedIn has launched a completely new version of its tablet app, which boasts an entirely new design that sets it apart from the website it's based on. The app has been been created using a bottom-up approach, with the intention of delivering a better mobile experience.  One of the most interesting features is the way the app integrates with Google Calendar and Exchange Calendar. Users can integrate their calendars, and the app will pull through key details of their day ahead. This integration of different platforms should prove to be extremely useful for those looking to manage their professional lives more efficiently. The move to a new design is necessary, given that over 22% of LinkedIn's traffic now comes from mobile devices. This is an increase of more than double from a year ago, when just 8% of LinkedIn's traffic came from mobile sources. This change in user behavior demands, therefore, that LinkedIn must adapt its approach to remain relevant. The relaunch of the app is a sign that the company is taking mobile seriously, and positioning itself to meet future demand. This Is seen as another intelligent move by LinkedIn, given that the significance of mobile shows no signs of diminishing. As mobile usage continues to grow, businesses will have to move closer to their customers, and the most effective way of achieving this is through mobile apps. For LinkedIn, the tablet app is an opportunity to provide a mobile experience that is far more personalized than the one provided through the website. Early signs are encouraging, with the new design and integrated calendars already winning plaudits from users. In addition, the latest update addresses some of the main bugs that ravaged the app’s previous iteration. It is expected that such updates will become even more frequent, as LinkedIn seeks to keep its tablet app updated to meet the evolving needs of its users. Overall, the new tablet app from LinkedIn is a major move for the company. By embracing the most recent mobile developments, the relaunched app appears set to offer an even more engaging LinkedIn experience. Further updates can be expected over time, with LinkedIn likely to continue improving the app to meet the demands of today's mobile-first business world.
