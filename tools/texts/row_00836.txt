Fleeing the UK weather is nothing news - cavemen sat out the Ice Age on the shores of the Med, research shows. New DNA analysis has shown how humans sheltered from the Ice Age in warmer climates in Southern France and East Asia, where they remained until worst of the cold snap finally lifted 20,000 years ago. It had been known there were two safe havens for humans as the Ice Age reached its peak 26,000 years ago - the ‘Franco-Cantabrian’ area, roughly coinciding with northern Spain and southern France, and the ‘Periglacial province’ on the Ukrainian plains. Now researchers say another group sat out the ice age in East Asia in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. This helps explain mitochrondial DNA in modern Europeans from two lineages, J and T, which originated in the Middle East. Until recently it was thought these lines migrated to Europe in the Neolithic age, approximately 9,000 years ago. However, the new research suggests that humans belonging to the J and T haplogroups actually migrated to Europe 19,000 years ago - allowing them to repopulate Europe when the Ice Age drew to a close. Dr Maria Pala, of the University of Huddersfield, said: ‘The end of the Last Glacial Maximum (Ice Age) allowed people to recolonise the parts of Europe that had been deserted and this expansion allowed increase of human populations.’ The Mediterranean: New DNA analysis has shown how humans sheltered from the Ice Age in warmer climates in Southern France and East Asia, where they remained until worst of the cold snap finally lifted 20,000 years ago . She believes using archaeogenetics like those used in the study has important lessons to teach humanity, as everyone came from a common group. Writing for the American Journal of Human Genetics, she said: ‘It helps us to reevaluate the perception of our identity. ‘We are highly focussed on identifying ourselves as Italians, British or whatever, but by analysing DNA we discover that originally, not such a long time ago, we came from a common source.’

chatgpt: New genetic evidence suggests that humans may have taken shelter in southern Europe during the height of the last ice age approximately 20,000 years ago. According to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, DNA samples taken from fossils of human remains found in the southern region of Europe indicate that humans migrated to this part of the continent to avoid the harsh cold temperatures that were present during the last ice age. This migration to southern Europe allowed the species to survive and thrive in the region until the end of the ice age. The research team, which included scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany and the University of Vienna in Austria, analyzed DNA samples from two fossils of early humans that dated back to the last ice age. The DNA samples were compared to those of modern-day humans, as well as samples from other early human fossils found in Africa and Asia. The results of the study showed that the DNA of the two fossils found in southern Europe was more closely related to the DNA of modern-day humans than to other early human fossils found in Africa and Asia. This supports the theory that humans migrated to southern Europe to take shelter during the last ice age. The study also showed that the human populations in southern Europe during the last ice age were more diverse than previously thought. The DNA samples from the fossils showed that these humans interbred with Neanderthals, which were also present in the region at the time. This interbreeding is thought to have contributed to the genetic diversity of modern-day humans. The findings of this study shed new light on the history of human migration and adaptation during the last ice age. It suggests that humans were able to thrive and survive in challenging environments through migration and interbreeding with other species. This resilience and ability to adapt has been a hallmark of the human species throughout history. The study also has implications for understanding the genetic diversity of modern-day humans. The DNA samples from the fossils suggest that this diversity has been shaped by migration and interbreeding with other species throughout human history. Overall, this study provides new insights into the history of human migration and adaptation during the last ice age. It highlights the resilience and adaptability of the human species, and the importance of genetic diversity for survival and evolution.
