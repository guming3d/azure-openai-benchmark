The shares will be offered to the public on the New York Stock Exchange, with the club hoping to raise around $100 million. The team, which is owned by the American Glazer family, who also own the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has been struggling with debt ever since the Glazers led a leveraged buyout of the club in 2005. According to reports, Manchester United's debt currently stands at around $500 million, with interest payments alone costing the club around $40 million a year.

Ultimately, the success of the share offering will depend on how the funds raised are invested and whether the club can reduce its debt burden. If successful, Manchester United could have a brighter future both on and off the pitch.
