Prince Harry did it with his 'bad taste' Nazi costume, Princess Beatrice did it with her 'Pretzel hat' at William and Catherine's wedding. Now Prince Edward has become the latest royal to cause controversy with his choice of clothing after wearing a tie that 'symbolises the barbaric sport' of bullfighting - according to animal rights campaigners. The League Against Cruel Sports, which campaigns against violent sports such as bullfighting, shooting and fox hunting, said it was 'disappointed' to see the Earl of Wessex wearing the tie patterned with matadors when he opened Liverpool's new Central Library earlier this year. Faux pas: The matador tie worn by Prince Edward has caused offence among animal rights campaigners . Attention was drawn away from the £55million library - which had just been through a three-year  refurbishment - and to the item of clothing knotted about the neck of the eighth in line to the throne. The offending article was spotted by several people who turned up to see the event, several of whom were not impressed the Prince's choice of attire. One member of the public who was at the event said: 'It was very inappropriate for a member of the Royal family to wear a tie like that. 'I had to look closely, I couldn't believe he was wearing a tie with bullfighters on it.' Official blunder: The Earl of Wessex wore the tie when he opened Liverpool Central Library . Bullfighting is a traditional blood sport in many countries, including Spain, Portugal, the Philippines, some Hispanic countries and the south of France. Animal cruelty campaigners object to the suffering and killing of the bulls for entertainment purposes. Bullfighting has been banned in many places - most recently in Catalonia, where a bill forbidding the sport came into effect in 2012. But supporters of bullfights say it is a culturally important tradition, and movements to revoke the Catalonian ban often appear before the Spanish congress. The League Against Cruel Sports campaigns to stop bullfighting and all other cruel fiesta events involving animals. These include the Pamplona Bull Run - when dozens of bulls are chased through the streets of the Spanish city of Pamplona - and the Toro del Fuego - a Spanish custom involving setting a bull's horns alight and allowing it to run through the streets. A spokesperson from League said: 'Bullfighting is an incredibly cruel and outdated spectacle. 'We are very disappointed to see such an influential public figure wearing an item of clothing that symbolises the barbaric bloodsport.' Outdated: The League Against Cruel Sports says bullfighting is an old-fashioned spectacle that should not be promoted .

chatgpt: The League Against Cruel Sports (LACS) has criticized the Earl of Wessex's choice of tie, calling it "disappointing" due to its display of pictures featuring matadors. According to the organization, the images showcased "the barbaric sport" of bullfighting. The Earl of Wessex wore the tie during a visit to Liverpool earlier this year, and the images sparked a backlash from animal rights groups who deemed it insensitive. The LACS, a UK-based charity organization with a primary objective of stopping animal cruelty in sport, condemned the tie, noting that it sent the wrong message to the public, especially in light of the recent rise in awareness about animal welfare and the growing opposition to hunting. Bullfighting is a controversial sport that has been around for centuries, particularly in Spain, Portugal, and Latin American countries. It is typically characterized by a lone matador facing a bull while armed with a sword and a cape. The sport has been at the center of numerous animal rights protests due to its perceived cruelty towards the animals involved. The LACS criticized the style of the tie, saying it was particularly disappointing given the organization's work in fighting against animal cruelty. "We are very disappointed to see the Earl of Wessex wearing such a tie, especially given our work in raising awareness about the cruelty inherent in so many sports," a representative from the LACS said. Despite the backlash from animal rights groups, it is not clear whether the Earl of Wessex intended to include any political or social messages with his wardrobe choice. Nevertheless, the incident has sparked a debate about the role of prominent people, such as royals, in promoting or detracting from causes, particularly those based on animal welfare. The LACS noted that it is particularly troubling when members of royalty or other public figures condone sports that feature animal cruelty. "We are hopeful that the public, as well as members of the royal family, will consider the ethical implications of their choices when it comes to animal welfare," the organization said. Bullfighting has been banned in several countries, including the UK. However, it still remains a popular form of entertainment in some regions. The LACS, and other animal welfare groups, have continued to voice their opposition to such practices. In the end, the controversy surrounding the Earl of Wessex's tie demonstrates the power of fashion in promoting or detracting from social messages. The incident serves as a lesson to all public figures when it comes to sensitive topics such as animal welfare, to carefully consider the messages they are sending with their wardrobe choices.
