article: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Monday proposed listing the African lion as threatened after a study showed the big cats were in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future. A listing as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act would bar trafficking of the species as it faces dwindling habitat in Africa and more competition with humans. African lions, or Panthera leo leo, are found across a wide range in the continent, but about 70 percent, or 24,000, of them live in only 10 major strongholds, the service said in a statement. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to list the African lion as a vulnerable species in order to stave off what it called the species' decline into extinction in the 'foreseeable future' Experts estimate there are around 35,000 lions left in the wild. In 1980, that number was closer to 80,000. One major problem lions face is the rapid decimation of their food animals to feed humans. As they lose prey, they turn to livestock. Humans in turn kill the lions that prey on their livestock. Listing lions as vulnerable would bar trafficking of the species the US or by Americans. Listing the African lion as threatened 'will bring the full protections of U.S. law to lion conservation, allowing us to strengthen enforcement and monitoring of imports and international trade,' Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said. The main threats to the African lion are loss of habitat and of the animals lions prey on, and increased conflict with humans, the statement said. People and farming and grazing activities have expanded into lion habitat and protected areas, putting more livestock near the big cats. As hunters reduce the number of animals that lions feed on, lions kill more livestock, leading to retaliatory killings by humans. The Fish and Wildlife Service is also proposing a rule that would set up permits for the importation of sport-hunted lion trophies. Sport-hunting is not seen as a threat to the species, the statement said. The Endangered Species Act bars such activities as import, export, commercial activity, interstate commerce and foreign commerce. It also heightens awareness of listed species and can provide financial aid to efforts to conserve them. The proposal to list the African lion as threatened follows a 2011 petition from a coalition of organizations. The Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking public comments for 90 days on its proposal.

highlights: The move would ban unwarranted killing of lions in the U.S. and by any U.S. citizen outside the U.S. Only about 35,000 remain in the wild versus 80,000 in 1980 . The Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking public comments for 90 days on its proposal .

chatgpt: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed a new regulation to ban the unwarranted killing of lions both within the United States and by any U.S. citizen outside its territorial boundaries. The new regulation would address a growing concern over the declining population of lions both in the United States and worldwide. Currently, only about 35,000 lions remain in the wild, compared to an estimated population of 80,000 in 1980. Lions have faced various threats over the years, including habitat loss, poaching, and conflicts with local communities. The new regulation would aim to ensure that lions receive adequate protection and prevent further depletion of their numbers. The proposed regulation would allow exceptions for killing lions in certain situations, such as for scientific research, to alleviate human-lion conflict, or for the benefit of the species as a whole. However, any such exceptions would require a permit issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Fish and Wildlife Service is opening up the proposal for public comments for a period of 90 days. The agency is seeking input from various stakeholders, including conservation groups, animal welfare organizations, and the general public. The proposal has received mixed reactions from different groups, with some applauding the move as a positive step toward lion conservation, while others criticize it for not going far enough. Conservation groups have consistently pushed for stronger protections for lions, while some hunting organizations have argued for more relaxed regulations. If the regulation is eventually enacted, it would be a significant win for lion conservation efforts. It would also signal the United States’ commitment to global wildlife conservation and set an example for other nations to follow. While the proposed regulation would only affect U.S. citizens, it could have ripple effects on other countries that permit lion hunting or do not implement adequate protections for the species. With the lion population in decline globally, any measures to protect and conserve the species are crucial. In conclusion, the proposed ban on unwarranted killing of lions by U.S. citizens both within and outside the territorial boundaries of the United States is a significant development in wildlife conservation efforts. The Fish and Wildlife Service’s decision to solicit public comments on the proposal shows a commitment to transparency and participation in decision-making processes. The regulation’s impact on the global lion population will be highly dependent on how it is implemented and enforced in practice. Nonetheless, the proposal marks a step in the right direction towards protecting and conserving this majestic species.
