A small lapse could leave them vulnerable to falling ice, slashing their ropes with their own climbing axes and spikes, changes in weather and even avalanches. From the other-worldly forest of stalagmites and stalactites on Neolithic to the dagger-like formation of The Real Big Drip - each route offers something unique to take on. Jen, from Canmore in Alberta, Canada, said: 'The views are magical and lovely - but the route is tough.

'On Neolithic you have all your weight on your arms for long periods of time so the clock is ticking. You need to keep moving to keep holding on.' Adventure photographer Paul Pride, who captured the trip in February this year, added: 'There is a difference of opinion as to which is harder - climbing ice or climbing rock. 'But I think ice is much more unstable - ice climbs form differently each year. Ice climbing provides a harsher climate not to mention the fact it melts and can break. 'There's no question photographing ice climbing can he hard on you and your gear. 'Freezing weather, melting ice and blowing snow are just a few of the problems that are faced each day as well as long hours hanging around in a harness or sitting on the side of a mountain waiting for the right shot. 'But the contrast of colours and locations make it all worthwhile - it really is one of my most favourite subjects to photograph.'

chatgpt: Jen Olson, Jon Walsh and Magda Kosior recently embarked on a challenging adventure in the Canadian Rockies. With their passion for ice climbing, the trio set out to tackle some of the most difficult ice cliffs the region had to offer. Each ice cliff climb took the group between four and six hours, as they carefully navigated the icy terrain, and employed their technical skills to overcome any obstacles they encountered. Despite the harsh conditions, the climbers remained focused and determined to reach the summit of each climb. For Jen Olson, ice climbing in the Canadian Rockies is a thrilling experience that offers a unique sense of adventure. "The beauty and rawness of the Rocky Mountains is truly breathtaking. The ice cliffs are so challenging and unpredictable, which only adds to the intensity of the climb," said Olson. Meanwhile, Jon Walsh emphasized the importance of teamwork and communication when tackling such difficult climbs. "Ice climbing is not only physically demanding, but mentally challenging as well. You need to be able to trust your partner and communicate effectively to ensure everyone's safety," said Walsh. Magda Kosior echoed Walsh's sentiments, stating that without each other's support, the climb would have been impossible. "You have to rely on your partner 100% in ice climbing. Without their support, it's easy to become overwhelmed and lose focus," said Kosior. Despite the challenges they faced, the trio succeeded in their mission and reached the summit of each ice cliff they tackled. The experience left them with a profound sense of accomplishment and appreciation for the beauty of the Canadian Rockies. Ice climbing is an activity that requires a high level of technical skill and experience. However, for those who are up for the challenge, it offers an exciting and rewarding way to explore the beauty of Canada's natural landscapes. With the right training and equipment, anyone can take on the Canadian Rockies and experience the thrill of ice climbing.
