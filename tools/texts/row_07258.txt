At least 200 people in the UK are costing the NHS £16million because weighing 35 stone and more they are too fat to leave their home, it has been claimed. Bed-ridden and needing up to four visits a day by health workers, they cost an average of £80,000 a year each, but this is believed to be just the tip of the iceberg. Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum told the Sun: 'The number of super-obese people who are housebound is in the hundreds.

'They are hidden in the care system and no one knows exactly how many there are. It really is a tragedy.' Britain's worsening obesity crisis has been brought to the forefront of public attention after 63st teenager Georgia Davis was rushed to hospital last week in an operation involving 40 emergency workers. It cost an estimated £100,000 as firefighters spent eight hours demolished two walls of her home in Aberdare, South Wales, to free her from her first-floor bedroom. And yesterday reports told how 17 firefighters and paramedics battled for eight hours to free 40st Russell Parkin after he fell ill at his home in New Eltham, south east London.

chatgpt: In the UK, the cost of care for bed-ridden patients can be extremely high, with each health worker visit costing an average of £80,000 per year. This cost highlights the ongoing struggles faced by those who require constant medical attention, including severely overweight individuals such as 63st teenager Georgia Davis and 40st Russell Parkin. Last week, Georgia Davis was rushed to the hospital and required the assistance of 40 emergency workers during her operation. Her weight made the operation much more complicated, and the healthcare professionals on hand had to adapt their approach to ensure her safety. Despite the challenging circumstances, Georgia received the care she needed and is reportedly now in a stable condition. Similarly, over the weekend, emergency services were called to the home of Russell Parkin, who had fallen ill. However, due to his size, it took a team of eight workers over eight hours to free him from his home and transport him to the hospital for medical attention. This situation highlights the additional challenges that are faced by those with severe obesity, as it can significantly impact the ability of emergency service workers to provide effective care. The cost of caring for overweight individuals such as Georgia and Russell is also increasingly concerning for the NHS. With specialist medical equipment and extra staff required to provide care, it's evident that the cost of treating such patients can rapidly increase. To address this, hospitals are increasingly looking for innovative solutions to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. One potential solution is to provide additional support for overweight individuals to help them manage their weight and improve their health before they require hospitalisation. This approach would require the collaboration of healthcare professionals, local authorities and support organisations, and would aim to provide targeted interventions that can help prevent the need for intensive medical interventions. Overall, the cases of Georgia Davis and Russell Parkin serve as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by those with severe obesity and the healthcare professionals and emergency service workers who care for them. As the NHS looks to address these challenges, it's essential that innovative solutions are explored to ensure that all patients receive the care they need while also reducing the overall cost of care.
