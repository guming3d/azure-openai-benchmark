chatgpt: Retailers in 2012 have labeled the holiday season the 'tablet Christmas' due to the huge demand for these electronic devices. The tablet frenzy has been attributed to the wider range of models available and a significant drop in prices compared to previous years. Major retail chains and online stores experienced record-breaking sales of tablets in the run-up to Christmas, with some even running out of stock. Most retailers who had stocked up on tablets were pleasantly surprised by the surge in sales, with many reporting an increase in average sales by over 60%. According to industry experts, the growing popularity of tablet devices can be attributed to the versatility and convenience they offer. With features like Wi-Fi, 4G connectivity, increased processing power and high resolution, tablets have become an essential part of everyday life for many people. Retailers also played a significant role in meeting the growing demand by offering a wider choice of models at different price points. This allowed consumers to pick models that best suited their individual needs and budgets. The prices of tablets fell by approximately 20% compared to the same period in the previous year, attracting more consumers to the market. Media technology analyst, Emily Appleton, stated that "Tablets are becoming an essential item for both work and personal use, which has led to a surge in demand. Retailers deserve credit for recognizing this and capitalizing on it by offering a wider range of products at varying price points." The surge in demand for tablets has had a positive impact on the tech industry as a whole. Key players in the tablet market, such as Apple, Samsung and Amazon, have been able to drive sales and increase market share during this holiday season. Apple alone sold more than 20 million iPads during the 2012 Christmas season. One industry expert, Jacob Palmer, stated that "The success of tablets is expected to continue well into 2013 and beyond. We expect to see more innovative models that cater to the specific needs of different consumer groups, which will further drive growth in the industry." At this rate, it's easy to see why the 2012 holiday season has been dubbed a 'tablet Christmas'. With growing demand, retailers are expected to continue to stock up on these popular devices, while the tech industry is set to develop even more innovative models. This only highlights the increasing importance of tablets in our daily lives, and we anticipate their popularity will continue to grow in the years to come.
