article: This creepy footage shows a decaying mall overwhelmed by mold and rampant plantlife - just six months after it closed its doors. It shows the Jamestown Mall in St Louis, Missouri, which closed for good in July 2014 after being declared 'blighted' by local authorities. An unidentified explorer made his way inside the complex, and finds his way through old stores, into the bowels of the building and through decaying sales displays from its heyday. Scroll down for video . Creepy: The Jamestown Mall in St Louis, Missouri, is now overgrown and dark . Close-up: An explorer made his way inside the complex and posted torchlit footage of what he found . Decay Lauder: Product displays from inside one of the mall's stores were surrounded by broken glass . Moldering: This once-purple cinema carpet is now covered in green growths . And while much of the building seems to be untouched, the man, whose path was lit only by a head torch, found a bed and pillow inside, suggesting at least on person has made the mall their home. While the last stores in the complex stayed open into last year, according to Fox 2 St Louis, by that time many had already been closed for years. Many areas visited in the footage seemed to show their age - a movie theater, which had mold growing from the carpets, was displaying posters for movies from the summer of 2008. Other seemingly out-of-place features were a room full of developed film photographs, and stacks of 90s-style cathode ray televisions in a back room. Clues? It is unclear how long all the parts of the mall were closed for - but these cinema posters show movies from 2008 . Old-school: Among the finds inside the store was a stash of 90-style cathode ray television sets . Not quite empty? The explorer even found a mattress and pillow inside the mall - suggesting it hasn't been completely vacated . The footage, uploaded to Youtube in December, passes through shops and corridors, which have received remarkably little vandalism, which usually strikes abandoned places soon after they are closed down. The explorer, who is not identified, warns anybody watching that they could be arrested and charged for trespass in the eerie complex. He also wrote that the power and alarm systems in the mall are still functional - although at least one alarmed door he pushed in the course of the video did not appear to respond. The unknown posters appears to be part of the urban exploration community - explorers who often dodge authorities to investigate abandoned places, and show off their footage and photographs online. Relics: The explorer also found a stash of film photographs in a back room, suggesting some areas had been long-abandoned . Not much on: The mall's cinema was hauntingly empty - and starting to get overwhelmed by mold .

chatgpt: An unknown explorer recently embarked on an adventure through the abandoned Jamestown Mall in Missouri. The mall, which closed its doors for good back in July 2014, has long been a source of fascination for urban explorers and thrill-seekers alike. However, what this explorer found inside the deserted complex was truly chilling. The explorer's journey through Jamestown Mall was captured on film and uploaded to social media platform, YouTube, in December 2020. The video footage shows scenes of decay and neglect, with the once-bustling mall now resembling an eerie ghost town. As the explorer picked their way through the abandoned corridors, they came across stores that had been left completely untouched since the mall's closure over six years ago. Shattered glass and debris littered the ground, while plant life had begun to creep through the edges of the floors and ceilings. In one particularly spooky part of the footage, the explorer came across an escalator that was still in motion, despite the mall being deserted. The footage captured the eerie sound of the escalator's mechanical groans as it continued to move, creaking and clanking as it ascended and descended all on its own. Jamestown Mall was once a bustling complex that drew visitors from all over the surrounding area to its stores and restaurants. However, in the years since its closure, the complex has fallen into disrepair and neglect. The mall's owners had attempted to revitalize the complex over the years, but none of their efforts had been able to bring the mall back to life. The mall's current owners are now in the process of selling the property, with hopes that it will be repurposed for a new use. Despite the current state of the mall, there are many who still hold fond memories of visiting Jamestown Mall in its heyday. For those who are interested in exploring the deserted complex themselves, it's important to note that accessing the mall is illegal and potentially dangerous. The physical conditions of the mall are extremely degraded and there have been reports of asbestos present in the building. Urban exploration, although it falls into a gray area of legal activity, has surged in popularity across the United States in recent years. Adventurers are drawn to the thrill of exploring abandoned buildings and other deserted areas, documenting their journeys with photographs and videos. In conclusion, the recent footage that surfaced from Jamestown Mall in Missouri shows the extent of the decay and abandonment that the complex has undergone since its closure in 2014. Although the mall once had a vibrant history, it is now nothing more than a creepy, decrepit shell of its former self.
