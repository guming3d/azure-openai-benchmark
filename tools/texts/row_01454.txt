article: Stuart Lancaster has issued a reminder on the behaviour he expects from his England players as Steffon Armitage prepares to discover the ruling over his alleged assault charge. The judgement of a Toulon court is due on Tuesday with French prosecutors having recommended a suspended jail term of between five and six months. Armitage denies the charge that relates to his arrest alongside teammate Xavier Chiocci in January following an incident involving a 30-year-old man.

The 29-year-old back row is not a member of England's RBS 6 Nations squad, but he may involved at the World Cup if Lancaster decides to temporarily relax the rule on not picking overseas-based players. 'I've not spoken to anyone from Toulon or the player. I'll wait and see how the process unfolds,' Lancaster said. 'Clearly from my point of view, behaviour and standards on and off the field are critically important in any team. We'll wait and see, but ultimately you know my view on it.'

Lancaster has offered his thoughts on another player who will not be involved against Ireland on Sunday but may yet figure at the World Cup, Sam Burgess. Burgess has been disappointing since his switch from rugby league to union late last year and his performance for Bath against Northampton on Saturday was poor, but Lancaster remains upbeat over his progress. 'I think he his doing well. He's been here three months in a new code, playing at highest level,' Lancaster said. 'Realistically the Six Nations was always going to be a push. And the World Cup would be too, but never say never.' Armitage looks on during the Heineken Cup Final between Toulon and Saracens at the Millennium Stadium .
