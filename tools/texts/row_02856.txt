chatgpt: Fort Worth City contractors have admitted to making a major blunder that nearly cost a Texas resident his family home. David Underwood and his wife had planned to move into their property at 9716 Watercress Drive, which had been in his family for several decades. However, city contractors reportedly marked the wrong house for demolition, leading officials to schedule the destruction of Underwood's property by mistake.  According to reports, Underwood only found out about the error after a neighbour contacted him about the demolition notice posted on his door. He quickly contacted the city's code enforcement office, but was told the demolition could not be stopped. Underwood and his wife then rushed to the house, where they were met by a city inspector who confirmed that they had indeed marked the wrong property.  Underwood says he was left shaken and puzzled by the experience. "They just took the wrong house," he told local news outlets. "This is my ancestral home. There's been nobody but my family in that house for over 70 years." Fortunately, the city has agreed to rebuild Underwood's house, and he says he is relieved that his family's history will be preserved.  The contractor responsible for the mistake has not been named, but a spokesperson for the city apologized for the error and said the administration is committed to working with homeowners to resolve any issues. "It was a human error," the spokesperson said. "We apologize and we're trying to make it right."  Underwood's story has gained national attention, with many social media users expressing shock and outrage over the incident. Some have criticized the city for its handling of the situation, saying that it highlights systemic issues in the construction and demolition industry. Others have slammed the contractors responsible for the mistake, calling for more stringent regulations and oversight.  For now, Underwood says he is just grateful that his family's home will be rebuilt. "I'm ready to move on," he said. "Hopefully, this won't happen to anybody else." The city says it will be conducting a full investigation into the matter to ensure that such a mistake does not happen again.
