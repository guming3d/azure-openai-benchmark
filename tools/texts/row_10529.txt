article: By . Sam Creighton . Play fights are a long honoured tradition on many a family swimming trip - although they are not usually between mother and son. However, this was the situation today when a mother otter and her pup jokingly came to blows at the British Wildlife Centre in Lingfield, Surrey. The pair pushed, prodded, strangled and scrapped in a bid to stay afloat and dunk the other and the whole raucous affair was caught on camera by photographer Sue Edwards, 51. The otters were playfighting so the child could learn how to defend itself before striking out on its own . The scrap between mother Emmy and child Franklyn went on for a little over ten minutes . From the pictures the fight might seem vicious but neither animal was seriously hurting the other . She said: 'These two European Otters were play fighting with each other in open water. 'Otter pups stay with their mum for up to a year after birth and play fighting is an essential part of their development to hone their skills for survival. 'I was fascinated to watch their antics, pushing each other under the water, grabbing, boxing, biting, and wrestling each other. 'However, I was also very much aware that there is a serious side to their behaviour. 'On river systems otters are extremely territorial and fighting is common, particularly in populations that are nearing carrying capacity, and this may result in death.' The fight between the two otters, nicknamed Emmy and Franklyn by the centre's staff, went on for ten minutes and Mrs Edwards took these snaps from only 12 metres away. The snaps were taken by photographer Sue Edwards at the British Wildlife Centre, Lingfield, Surrey . Emmy eventually admitted defeat to Franklyn and went to sleep on the bank to recoup her energy . Otter pups stay with their mothers for up to a year after birth and play fighting is important for development . She said: 'Emmy, as any mother would, admitted defeat and went to sleep on the bank. 'I hope that future generations will continue to have the opportunity to see our native wildlife in their natural habitats. 'I believe we should respect our natural heritage and that our existing countryside. 'The return of otters to most of England has been one of the major conservation success stories of the last 30 years.' Sue Edwards was standing only metres away from the animals to take these fascinating pictures . Hopefully, Franklyn will be able to fend for himself thanks to his mother's training .

chatgpt: Otters Emmy and Franklyn were caught on camera play fighting at the British Wildlife Centre in Lingfield, Surrey. The adorable snaps were taken by wildlife photographer Sue Edwards, 51, who captured the two playful otters fighting for dominance. The playful altercation between Emmy and Franklyn looked harmless, but in reality, it was part of the mother's process of teaching her young pup how to defend himself. Otters are known to play fight with their offspring to teach them essential life skills, which will help them fend for themselves when they reach adulthood. Wildlife experts have said that during these play fights, the mother otter will show the young one how to hunt and fight. The mother will also teach her young how to find food by showing them how to use their whiskers to sense the presence of fish in the water. Sue Edwards captured the moment when Emmy finally conceded defeat to her son and rested on the bank. The young pup was seen playing in the water before emerging victorious from the play fight. Emmy, tired from the ongoing struggle, nodded off next to her slightly smaller but equally rambunctious son. The British Wildlife Centre in Lingfield, Surrey, is home to a range of species, including otters, red foxes, and badgers, all of which can be seen up close and personal by visitors to the center. The center offers educational tours for children and adults, which help them to better understand wildlife and conservation. It also runs various programs that allow visitors to interact with the animals and learn about their habitat and behavior. Otters are known for their playful nature, which makes them a popular attraction at zoos and wildlife centers worldwide. They are also known to be great swimmers, able to hold their breath for up to eight minutes while hunting underwater for their prey. Emmy and Franklyn's playful fight is just one example of how otters interact with their young and teach them vital life skills. While it may appear amusing to onlookers, it is a crucial process in a young otter's life, which will eventually allow them to fend for themselves in the wild. In conclusion, the playful fight between Emmy and Franklyn was a great example of how otters teach their young how to defend themselves in the wild. It is amazing to see the level of interaction that these animals have with their young, and we can learn a lot from them about the importance of teaching young ones valuable lessons from a young age.
