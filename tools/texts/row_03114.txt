Nathan Baxendale was shamed into turning himself in - less than 48 hours after pulling off the bank raid . A bank robber has been jailed after his poorly planned caper turned him into an online laughing stock and forced him to turn himself in. Nathan Baxendale, 21, surrendered to police less than 48 hours after pulling off the bank job because his failure to wear a disguise while committing the crime made evading capture impossible. Baxendale strode into a branch of the Co-op bank in Bury, Greater Manchester, last month and handed staff a note saying: 'Give me your money, I have a gun.' Hailing a taxi to make his getaway with £2,000 in cash, Baxendale thought he had escaped cleanly. However, by not concealing his identity, the hapless criminal made it easy for police to obtain clear pictures of him from the bank's high quality CCTV system. Only hours later, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) had Baxendale's identity after Facebook users recognised him from the CCTV images, posted by the force on the social networking site. Comments written below the photos were less than kind to Baxendale, branding him an 'idiot', a 'plonker', and a 'fool'. Officers turned up at Baxendale's mother's house and, while he was not home, he handed himself in the very next day - less than 48 hours after the bank raid had taken place. He later admitted to committing the crime to pay drug debts and buy clothes. He appeared at Bolton Crown Court on Monday admitting to robbery and was sentenced to three years and four months behind bars. Detective Sargent Ian Partington said: 'This was an extremely bizarre incident for which there was only ever going to be one outcome. By failing to hide his identity, Baxendale made it very easy for police to trace him using CCTV footage . 'Baxendale . walked into the bank bold as brass, made no attempt to conceal his . identity and made what the cashier believed was a credible and . terrifying threat. 'Once . we reviewed the CCTV and saw just how good the systems were and how . clearly he had been captured we knew if would only be a matter of time . before he was caught and obviously he has pleaded due to the . overwhelming evidence against him. 'I would also like to thank the public for their assistance in identifying Baxendale and helping us to expedite our inquiries. 'Since . the appeal was issued on social networking sites, we had an . overwhelming response and as a result of comments and information left . on GMP’s Facebook site, we made an arrest. 'Baxendale now has a long time in prison to reflect on his actions, which were, quite frankly, stupid in the extreme.'

chatgpt: A 21-year-old man named Nathan Baxendale handed himself over to the authorities just under two days after his robbery attempt. What's unique about this case is that Baxendale did not make an attempt to hide his identity, leading to his immediate recapture. Baxendale attempted to rob a bank in the United Kingdom, but his face was fully caught on CCTV cameras. Police quickly posted images taken from the footage on Facebook, and within hours, they received a tip-off, identifying the culprit as Nathan Baxendale. Upon questioning, Baxendale confessed to the authorities that he committed the robbery to pay off his drug debts. Despite his confession, the court sentenced him to three years and four months behind bars. Baxendale's failed robbery attempt illustrates how social media platforms like Facebook can sometimes have a positive impact in solving crimes promptly. Following the release of the CCTV footage on social media, the police were able to quickly identify Baxendale. The authorities have voiced their satisfaction in the swift resolution of the case, thanks to the footage capturing the entirety of the failed robbery attempt. The police gave credit to the help of the public in identifying Baxendale, emphasizing that social media is an essential platform for instant communication with people and solving crimes promptly. The sentencing puts Baxendale's fate in jeopardy, highlighting that the risk of committing a crime to pay off debts is never the right answer. Although Baxendale came forward and admitted to his mistakes, this does not excuse his actions or clear him of his fate. The case is a reminder of the risks involved in committing a crime and expecting to get away with it. With CCTV cameras in most public places and law enforcement agencies like the police continually updating their techniques to identify criminals, it is no longer feasible to rob banks, stores or commit crimes with the expectation of anonymity. Evidently, crimes committed like those of Baxendale's will not go unnoticed. A fair justice system exists to prosecute those responsible for criminal offences, emphasizing that there is no way to go about the resolution of drug addiction or debt through criminal activity. The case has been a conversation starter for the public at large, leading to debates on the significant impact of electronic surveillance on crime prevention, which remains a question of privacy for some. Overall, Baxendale's sentence serves as a lesson to those considering criminal activity. In the long-term, such acts of robbery decrease the standard of life of both the offender and the victim, and can leave a person with a criminal record that becomes challenging to overcome.
