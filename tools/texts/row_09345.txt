The office sex romp took place last Friday night in the Marsh Ltd offices when the two employees left the lights on in the building on Papanui Road while they got to know each other better. Unfortunately for them their fun was filmed and photographed by revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery across the street who posted images on Facebook and Twitter. Scroll down for video .

Customers across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery got a front-row seat for the show . Stuff.co.nz reported that the photos have attracted thousands of likes and hundreds of shares.

chatgpt: A Christchurch couple's late-night tryst in the offices of Marsh Ltd has landed them in hot water. The couple's escapade was reportedly filmed and photographed by other patrons at the nearby Carlton Bar and Eatery, with images being posted on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Several bar-goers reported that the band playing at the bar even stopped playing to watch the couple's activities through the office windows. While some patrons found the situation amusing, others were more critical, with one patron being quoted as saying, "They should have turned the lights out." The man and woman involved in the incident have since been identified, and an employment investigation is currently underway. It remains unclear whether the couple were employees of Marsh Ltd or were simply using the offices for their tryst. The incident has sparked a debate about workplace conduct and the dangers of social media. While some commentators have been quick to criticize the couple for their behavior, others have expressed concern about the potential for public shaming and the impact that social media can have on people's lives. There is also unease about the impact that the incident could have on Marsh Ltd's reputation. The company is a well-respected insurance brokerage firm, and some fear that the incident could damage the company's image and harm its relationships with clients and business partners. In response to the incident, Marsh Ltd has released a statement saying that it is "deeply concerned" about the incident and is taking steps to address the matter. The company has not yet announced what form these steps will take, but it is believed that they may involve disciplinary action against the couple involved in the incident. The incident highlights the need for employers to have clear policies in place regarding workplace conduct and the use of company facilities. It also raises questions about the role of social media in policing behavior and holding individuals accountable for their actions. For the couple involved in this incident, the repercussions could be significant. They may face disciplinary action at work or even lose their jobs altogether. They may also experience public shaming and ridicule, as the images of their tryst continue to circulate on social media. Overall, this is a cautionary tale about the dangers of behaving recklessly in the workplace and the potential consequences of social media exposure. It is a reminder that our actions can have far-reaching consequences and that we must always be mindful of the impact that our behavior can have on ourselves and others.
