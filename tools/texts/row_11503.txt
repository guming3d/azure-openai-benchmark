chatgpt: A lorry carrying mashed potato crashed in Henley-on-Thames last night, spilling its load across the bridge and causing the road to be closed for three hours. Emergency services were informed that the substance was "chemical waste" and was "bubbling," causing alarm among the authorities and locals. The incident occurred late in the evening when the lorry was transporting the mashed potato to be used in animal feed. However, the driver lost control of the vehicle and subsequently collided with a barrier on the bridge, causing the load to spill onto the road. Concerns were raised when the emergency services arrived on the scene and were informed that the spilled substance was "chemical waste" that appeared to be bubbling. Hazmat teams were then dispatched to the location to investigate the substance. However, it was later established that the spilled substance was merely mashed potato that had spilled from the lorry. The driver of the lorry explained that he had been transporting the mashed potato to be used as animal feed and that the substance was not harmful. Despite the mashed potato not posing a danger, the road had to be closed for three hours while the authorities cleared the substance from the bridge. The closure caused a significant disruption to traffic in the area, and motorists were advised to seek alternative routes. The incident highlights the challenges that emergency services face when dealing with incidents involving unidentified chemicals. While the substance in this case was harmless, the initial fear and concern surrounding the incident show that accidents can happen at any time, and it's essential to take all necessary precautions in these situations. Fortunately, nobody was injured in the accident, and the spillage was safely contained and cleared. The incident also emphasizes the importance of proper handling and transportation of goods, particularly when they are destined for the food industry. The authorities have now reopened the road, and traffic is flowing freely again. However, the incident will serve as a reminder of the importance of proper risk management and preparations for handling hazardous materials.
