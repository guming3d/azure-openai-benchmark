article: LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The doctor who implanted six embryos in octuplets' mother Nadya Suleman last year has been expelled from a fertility medical society, a spokesman for the group said. Nadya Suleman gave birth to eight babies after being implanted with six embryos by Dr. Michael Kamrava. Dr. Michael Kamrava demonstrated "a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards," American Society for Reproductive Medicine spokesman Sean Tipton said. An employee at Kamrava's Beverly Hills, California, clinic -- the West Coast IVF Clinic -- said the doctor would not be commenting on the expulsion. The expulsion, which was imposed last month and just announced, does not affect Kamrava's ability to practice, because affiliation with the professional association is voluntary. Suleman was 33 years old in January 2009 when she gave birth to eight babies. She was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in-vitro fertilization. The reproductive medicine society recommends no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40, for whom it is harder to get pregnant, according to guidelines published on its Web site. Suleman, in an interview in February on NBC, said Kamrava told her about risks for the children, but she did not want to have only one or two embryos implanted. "Of course not, I wanted them all transferred," she said. "Those are my children. And that's what was available and I used them. I took a risk. It's a gamble. It always is." Two of the six embryos split in utero, resulting in the birth of eight babies. Doctors say giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies. Risks for the children include bleeding in the brain, intestinal problems, developmental delays and lifelong learning disabilities. Suleman's children, six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature, all went home after an extended stay in the hospital. No indication has been given on whether any problems have emerged. Suleman and her children will star in a "quasi-reality TV series" about the family, it was announced in June. CNN's Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) has found Dr. Michael Kamrava guilty of "violating" standards in the field of reproductive medicine. The investigation was initiated following the birth of octuplets to Nadya Suleman in 2009. Kamrava was the fertility specialist who implanted Suleman with six embryos, which resulted in the octuplets' birth. The ASRM's review found that Kamrava's actions were "beyond the reasonable standards of medical practice." The governing body has consequently expelled Kamrava from its membership. However, this action does not restrict Kamrava's ability to practice as a fertility specialist, as the ASRM is a professional society and not a licensing agency. Suleman became a high-profile case after giving birth to octuplets following fertility treatments. The case received significant media attention and criticism from various quarters. Still, Kamrava maintains that he acted within the relevant standards of medical practice. Following the case, the ASRM established guidelines on the number of embryos that should be implanted during fertility treatments. The guidelines advise that no more than two embryos should be implanted in women under the age of 35 to reduce pregnancy complications and the likelihood of multiple pregnancies. The case involving Suleman highlights the gray area in infertility treatments and the ethical boundaries that must be observed. Fertility treatments are an important tool for couples struggling with infertility. However, it is also essential to balance the desire to conceive with the risk of complications that can arise from such treatments. The ASRM's decision to expel Kamrava from its membership is a symbolic move that sends a message to fertility specialists across the United States to adhere to the standards set by the organization. The society's guidelines on the acceptable number of embryos to transplant are critical to prevent complications such as multiple pregnancies, which can put both the mother and her unborn child at risk. In conclusion, the case involving Kamrava and Suleman highlights the need for stricter regulations in the field of reproductive medicine. While fertility treatments are important, it is essential to maintain ethical boundaries and adhere to standards that ensure the health and wellbeing of both mother and child. The ASRM's guidelines provide a blueprint for best practices in fertility treatments and are essential to ensuring the safe practice of reproductive medicine.
