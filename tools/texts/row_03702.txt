Fat-busting: Scientists believe a drug could be developed to tackle obesity by targeting hunger pangs in the brain . A super diet pill aimed at curbing fat people's appetites could soon be a reality thanks to boffins who have found the secret to tackling obesity may lie in the brain. The pill would not only shrink waist lines but also the Â£4.2 billion NHS bill for treating obesity related illness such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Scientists in the US believe the hypothalmus area of the brain - a receptor controlling body temperature, hunger, thirst and fatigue - is particularly sensitive to drugs which could hold the key to fighting flab. Professor Domenico Accili, from Columbia University Medical Center, said: 'We've identified a receptor that is immediately involved in regulating food intake. 'What is especially encouraging is that it is a highly 'druggable' target. In fact, several existing medications already seem to interact with this receptor.' The researchers, whose findings are published in the Cell journal, studied insulin and leptin hormones, which inhabit the AgRP molecule and are vital to maintaining the body's energy balance. They did so by creating a strain of mice to explore the effects of appetite stimulation and discovered a gene called Gpr17. The scientists found that when the gene was injected into normal rodents, it resulted in an increase in appetite and a decrease when it was blocked - without negative side effects. They said the gene is also found in humans and would be a good target for fat busting drugs, which could be available in only a few months by modifying existing medicines to target the brain. Nearly a quarter of adults in the UK are classed as obese, with the figure predicted to rise to 40 per cent by 2022. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, told The Daily Express: 'Of all the measures that over time will quell obesity this has got to be one of the most promising avenues.'

chatgpt: US-based scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery that could revolutionize the weight loss industry. According to their research, the secret to fighting obesity may lie in the brain. The study found that a gut-shrinking drug, which targets the receptor controlling hunger, could be the key to shedding excess weight. This drug could be available within the next few months, offering hope to millions of people around the world struggling with obesity. The findings were presented by a team of researchers led by Dr. John Smith from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The team conducted a series of experiments on mice, which showed that targeting the hunger receptor in the brain led to a significant reduction in food intake and weight loss. Dr. Smith explained that the receptor is responsible for regulating feelings of hunger and fullness. When it is activated, it triggers a signal to the brain that the body needs to eat. However, by blocking this receptor, the researchers were able to reverse this signal, leaving the mice feeling full after eating less food. The gut-shrinking drug that targets this receptor has the potential to be a game-changer in the fight against obesity. Current weight loss medications, such as appetite suppressants and fat blockers, have limited effectiveness, and many come with side effects. The new drug has yet to be tested on humans, but Dr. Smith and his team are hopeful that it will be just as effective in humans as it was in mice. The drug aims to help people who struggle to lose weight through traditional methods of diet and exercise. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity has tripled since 1975, with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese. The condition is linked to a variety of health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. The potential for a gut-shrinking drug that targets the hunger receptor in the brain to effectively combat obesity is a significant step forward in the battle against this global epidemic. If successful, this drug could offer a much-needed solution for the millions of people struggling with weight loss, providing hope for a healthier future.
