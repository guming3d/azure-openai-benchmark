chatgpt: Barcelona  ace Neymar Jr. has set his sights on a return to the pitch in next week's Gamper Trophy match with Leon. The Brazilian international has been sidelined since July 4, when he sustained a fractured vertebra in his back following a reckless challenge from Colombia's Juan Zuniga during the World Cup quarterfinals. This came as a serious blow to his country's hopes of winning the trophy on home soil. Despite his absence, the 22-year-old star remains upbeat about his prospects and is determined to bounce back stronger than ever. He has spent much of his recovery in his native Brazil before traveling to Japan for a promotional appearance. "It's been a difficult few weeks, but I'm feeling good and I'm looking forward to getting back on the pitch with my teammates," said Neymar. "I've been working hard with the medical staff and I'm confident that I'll be ready for the Gamper Trophy." Barcelona's traditional preseason friendly will take place on August 18 at the Camp Nou. It is a chance for the Catalan giants to show off their new signings to the home crowd, as well as to experiment with different formations and tactics ahead of the new season.  Neymar's absence has presented a challenge to manager Luis Enrique, who has had to rethink his attacking options without the Brazilian's impressive dribbling skills and clinical finishing. However, the manager will undoubtedly be delighted to have him back fit and firing as the team defends its La Liga and Champions League titles. The forward's impressive 15 goals in 41 appearances last season helped Barcelona win the Copa del Rey and reach the Champions League quarter-finals. The Gamper Trophy match will also give Neymar an ideal opportunity to blow away the cobwebs before Barcelona's season opener against Elche on August 24. With Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez providing support, the Brazilian international will be looking to start the season in style and build on his impressive debut campaign.
