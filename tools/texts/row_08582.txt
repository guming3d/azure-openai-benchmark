article: Staff in one government department in Sweden are to work six-hour days on full pay to see if it makes them happier than those working for seven hours . Hundreds of Swedish workers are trialling a six-hour working day in the hopes that it will cut sick leave and save the country money. In an experiment, workers in one government department in Gothenburg are to be put on to six-hour days on full pay, while workers in another department will work a standard seven-hour day. Mats Pilhem, Left Party deputy mayor of Gothenburg, hopes the six-hour staff will take fewer sick days, and have better physical and mental health as a result. Speaking to The Local, he said: 'We think it's time to give this a real shot in Sweden. 'We'll compare the two afterwards and see how they differ. We hope to get the staff members taking fewer sick days and feeling better mentally and physically after they've worked shorter days.' He claimed that a car manufacturer in the city had trialled the six-hour day with promising results. He added that in other sectors, such as social care, the problem was not a lack of employees but people working inefficiently over the course of a long shift. However, opposition politicians blasted the move as a cheap trick to win favour ahead of elections, and said the policy had be trialled before with no success. For 16 years around 250 staff at Kiruna council worked a six-hour shift, but the policy was abandoned in 2005 after a report found that it had no impact on health. The trial, announced by the deputy mayor of Gothenburg (pictured), has been dismissed by opposition politicians as a cheap trick to win favour ahead of upcoming elections . Another trial in on staff in one hospital department in Stockholm had to be abandoned after workers in other departments became resentful, and a third on childcare workers was scrapped because it drove up costs. However, Pilhem dismissed the criticisms, saying: 'We've worked a long time on this, we've not planned it to be an election thing. These people are always against shortening hours.'

chatgpt: The Swedish city of Gothenburg will soon take part in a major trial that will see government staff in two different departments work different hours. One department will work a six-hour day, while the other will work a seven-hour day. The aim of the trial is to compare the results of the two departments in order to determine whether working shorter days can improve overall efficiency. The concept of a six-hour work day has gained traction in Sweden in recent years. Many experts believe that shorter working hours can help to reduce stress and increase productivity, resulting in happier and healthier employees. This trial will be one of the largest experiments in shorter working hours to date. The trial will be conducted by the municipal government of Gothenburg, which aims to evaluate the effects of shorter working hours on productivity in the public sector. The trial will be implemented in two separate municipal departments over the course of one year. One department will work six-hour days, while the other will work seven-hour days. Both departments will work the same number of hours per week. Staff from both departments will be carefully monitored over the course of the trial, with performance indicators such as sick leave days, productivity levels, and work satisfaction being carefully recorded and analyzed. The results of the trial will be compared in order to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two work patterns. According to the city's deputy mayor, Mats Pilhem, the idea behind the trial is to "create a healthier and more productive work environment" for city employees. Pilhem believes that the six-hour work day has the potential to improve efficiency, creativity, and the quality of work produced by government staff. The trial has not been without its critics, however. Some experts have raised concerns that reducing working hours may not necessarily lead to increased productivity. Others have suggested that the cost of paying staff for shorter workdays may be prohibitive for many companies and organizations. Despite these concerns, the Swedish government is committed to exploring the potential benefits of a six-hour work day. The trial in Gothenburg is just one of many experiments being conducted in Sweden and other countries around the world. If successful, the six-hour work day could become a more common practice in workplaces worldwide, leading to happier and healthier employees, and potentially more efficient and productive organizations overall.
