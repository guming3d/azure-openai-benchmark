article: (CNN) -- Quest Means Business begins a new chapter in New York Monday -- just as the U.S. economy also enters a new phase. Five years since Lehman Brothers collapsed, America is a different place. Back then, in 2008, investors endured "Shocktober" and the Dow made a record points loss, down 778 at the close in one day. Economic growth went into reverse, and by the end of that year jobs were disappearing at the rate of 700,000 every month. READ MORE: Lehman bankruptcy fees hit $2.2 billion . Now, the markets keep on hitting record highs, to the point where it's almost routine. Month by month, the economy is slowly gaining jobs. The vital signs appear to be stronger; the patient's illness is in remission. And the Federal Reserve is about to start withdrawing the treatment. Quantitative easing was first used as shock therapy in 2008, and investors are still attached to the money drip at the rate of $85 billion a month. Many analysts expect Ben Bernanke to start cutting down the flow in the coming days. But as he "tapers" the treatment, another great tide of fortune is rising -- that of American oil. Domestic crude production has been increasing since 2008, reversing a decline which began in 1986. Now, given the right conditions, the U.S. could even become a net oil exporter, according to the U.S. Energy Administration. Five years ago, that would have seemed an impossible dream. And it is all because of the controversial new technique of fracking. CNN EXPLAINS: What is fracking? Across the country, fracking is re-making boom towns, where income is high and jobs are plentiful. On next week's Quest Means Business, some of those working in this new oil industry describe it as a "wonderful revolution" and "American capitalism at its best." But as Lehman Brothers proved, American capitalism is not always kind. The industry is building on fractured or "fracked" ground, and what goes boom can surely go bust too. Richard Quest traveled to Midland, Texas, where he met some of the new generation of oilmen extracting crude from solid rock. State Governor Rick Perry told him that the success of shale oil and gas is a product of free spirit and innovation, raising the U.S. economy out of its miasma. And that it is here to stay. Hard knocks, seismic shocks and intense pressure may have made the U.S. economy hurt; these days a similar process is also helping to make it strong. At least for now.

chatgpt: CNN's Quest Means Business is making a return, just in time for a new phase in the US economy. This comes five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and signs are starting to show that the economy is on the mend. The Federal Reserve's "shock treatment" is now set to be withdrawn, but the US could still find a boost in other ways. One potential boost for the US economy is through the controversial technique of fracking. The US could become a net exporter of oil thanks to this technique, which has allowed previously unattainable oil deposits to be accessed. While there are concerns about the long-term environmental impact of fracking, some experts see it as a potential game-changer for the US economy. The past five years have been rough for the US economy and its citizens. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 set off a chain reaction that triggered a global financial crisis. In response, the Federal Reserve took unprecedented steps to shore up the US economy, including cutting interest rates to near-zero and launching a series of bond-buying programs known as quantitative easing. The result was a surge in asset prices and a rebound in GDP growth. However, the economy still faced major challenges. The unemployment rate remained high and many households were still struggling to make ends meet. Now, however, the signs are starting to look more positive. GDP growth is picking up, job creation is on the rise, and consumer confidence is improving. As a result, the Federal Reserve has started to lay out its plan for unwinding its massive stimulus program. This process is known as "tapering," and it involves gradually reducing the amount of bonds the Fed buys each month. The goal is to avoid a sudden shock to the markets that could send interest rates soaring and trigger a new recession. However, the Fed's exit from the stimulus game is generating some anxiety. Some experts worry that the economy is still too fragile to stand on its own, and that the withdrawal of the Fed's support could cause a new downturn. That's where fracking comes in. The technique has allowed the US to tap into previously inaccessible oil reserves, and some experts see it as a potential game-changer for the US economy. The benefits are clear: more jobs, a stronger economy, and reduced dependence on foreign oil. However, there are also significant concerns about the environmental impact of fracking. Critics argue that the process can cause groundwater contamination, air pollution, and even earthquakes. As a result, there is heated debate about the merits of fracking and how best to regulate it. Overall, the outlook for the US economy is cautiously optimistic. The signs of improvement are clear, but there are still major challenges to be overcome. The Federal Reserve's exit from the stimulus market is a major step in the right direction, but the US will need to find other sources of growth to keep the recovery going. Fracking could be one key to unlocking the US's economic potential, but it remains a controversial and divisive issue. Only time will tell if it will be a net positive for the US economy in the long run.
