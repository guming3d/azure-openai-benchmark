article: The desk used by Hitler to work on his plans for the most evil crimes in history has been discovered. The Nazi dictator used the simple office desk, which was made in 1937, in his ornate Reichschancellery in Berlin throughout the Second World War while his Alsatian Blondi slept at his feet beneath it. German officials say the desk became the property of the Americans after the war and was used as just another piece of furniture in a rest home for US soldiers in Berlin between 1957 and 1996. They even installed telephone and fax connections to its side. The desk belonging to Adolf Hitler was discovered in a government storeroom in Germany . The furniture was handed over to American authorities at the end of the war and was returned to the German government around 2000 . The Nazi dictator used the desk to formulate his genocidal plans, however German authorities said they will never sell the item . It was passed back to Germany in 1996 and has been kept in a storeroom since. Officials say it will never be sold, even though collectors would pay thousands for it. The desk was made in 1937, has four lockable drawers and was used continuously by Hitler until the end of the war. Hanging on one side is an outdated ticket reading: 'This item is the property of the United States and falls under the Potsdam Agreement.' The desk, along with much else besides, formed part of the fixtures and fittings of a rest home for U.S. soldiers in Berlin between 1957 and 1996. Its general manager, Norman Marcus, was responsible for the electrical upgrades fitted to its side. Some time around 2000 the desk was returned to the German government. It now resides in a storeoom in Weissensee near Berlin. This is the first time it has been pictured since the war years. Germany says it will never be sold, even though it would fetch tens of thousands of pounds to a militaria collector. 'The desk is, and remains, the property of the Federal Republic,' said government spokeswoman Jacqueline Besse.

chatgpt: The desk where Adolf Hitler's beloved dog, Blondi, used to sleep has resurfaced after being hidden for over two decades in a German storeroom. The piece of furniture was taken by the US military after the end of World War II, and it remained in their possession until 1996. Hitler's bunker in Berlin was a gloomy and fortified concrete structure designed to protect the Nazi leader and his inner circle from Allied bombing. Blondi, a purebred German shepherd, was one of the few living creatures that the dictator truly cared for. She often slept underneath Hitler's desk as he worked in his underground lair. After the war ended, the desk was shipped to the US, where it became part of a collection of war memorabilia. However, in 1996, the desk was returned to Germany, and it went into storage. It wasn't until 2000 that the desk resurfaced in a German storeroom, where it was rediscovered by chance. Since then, the desk has been at the center of a historical debate. Some have argued that it should be used as an educational tool, to remind people of the horrors of the Nazi regime. Others, however, have called for its destruction or lockaway, arguing that its association with Hitler should be erased from history. For now, the desk remains in the storeroom, where it is kept safely under lock and key. German authorities have stated that they have no plans to sell the desk, citing its links to the fascist dictator as the reason why it must remain under their watchful eye. It is not the first time that objects that are linked to the Nazi regime have caused controversy. In recent years, debate has raged over whether or not statues and memorials dedicated to the era should also be removed or repurposed. The rediscovery of Hitler's desk has once again brought the issue into focus, and it is clear that the debate over how to deal with the legacy of the Nazi regime is far from over.
