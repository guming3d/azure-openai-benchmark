article: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A World Health Organization consultant who was conducting a polio vaccination campaign was attacked by unknown assailants in Karachi, Pakistan, on Tuesday, the group said. Dr. Constant Dedo, who was hired by the WHO's polio drive, was returning from a routine visit to Gadap, a town in northwestern Karachi, WHO spokeswoman Maryam Yunus said. His vehicle was intercepted by gunmen on a motorbike and shot at; the first bullets struck the tires, rendering the vehicle immobile, Yunus said. The assailants then fired at the driver, who was struck in the neck and shoulders, and Dedo, who was shot in the abdomen, Yunus said. "Both were given first aid and shifted to Agha Khan Hospital," Yunus said. "Their condition is stable, and they are out of danger." The motive for the attack was unclear. However, Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. Last month, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. "Polio drops will be banned in North Waziristan" until the strikes cease, according to a Taliban statement. North Waziristan is a tribal region of Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. The WHO said the ban could affect about 280,000 children living in tribal areas. A three-day nationwide effort to administer polio vaccines began this week, but health workers and volunteers were not able to immunize children in North and South Waziristan, the organization said.

The driver was a WHO staffer, Yunus said. Police were investigating and would interview the driver, she said. It was unclear whether Dedo's vehicle had a security convoy with it, a routine practice, she said. WHO officials had informed leaders in Gadap of Dedo's visit before his arrival, Yunus said. It was the first time WHO staff has been attacked in Pakistan, she said, but the organization will not suspend operations. CNN's Reza Sayah and Madison Park contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Karachi, Pakistan - Dr. Constant Dedo, a medical professional working for the World Health Organization (WHO), was in Karachi, Pakistan to lead a polio vaccination campaign. However, the mission took a dramatic turn when Dedo and his driver were shot by unknown assailants. According to reports from the WHO, Dedo and his driver were shot while traveling in their vehicle within the city. The circumstances behind the shooting are still unclear, but the WHO has confirmed that both men are in stable condition and receiving medical treatment. The incident has sparked concern within the global health community, particularly as Pakistan is one of just a few countries where the polio virus remains endemic. The WHO has been working to eradicate the disease, and has made significant progress in recent years. However, efforts have been hampered by misinformation campaigns, mistrust of healthcare workers, and violence against those working on vaccination campaigns. The attack on Dedo and his driver is just the latest in a series of violent incidents targeting healthcare workers in Pakistan. In 2019, several people were killed in an attack on a vaccine team in Balochistan province. In 2018, a police officer escorting a polio vaccination team was shot dead in Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Despite the risks, the WHO remains committed to its efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan. In a statement, the organization condemned the attack and reiterated its commitment to working with local health authorities to ensure the safety of all healthcare workers. "We condemn this attack on our colleague and his driver, who were working tirelessly to ensure that children in Pakistan are protected against polio," said Arshad Altaf, WHO's country head in Pakistan. "We will continue to work with the government and partners to ensure the safety and security of all those involved in polio vaccination campaigns." Pakistan is one of just three countries where the polio virus remains endemic, alongside Afghanistan and Nigeria. The WHO and its partners have made significant progress in recent years, with just 12 cases of polio reported in Pakistan in 2020, down from 147 in 2019. However, the recent attack on Dedo and his driver highlights the ongoing challenges facing healthcare workers trying to eradicate the disease. Until all children are vaccinated and polio is eradicated globally, the risk of violence will continue to loom over vaccination campaigns.
