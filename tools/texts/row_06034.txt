article: (Hong Kong) (CNN) -- The Australian women's basketball team and the Japanese women's soccer team flew in premium economy seats in their flights to Europe, while their male counterparts stretched out in business class. Nevermind that the women's Australian basketball team has won silver medals in the last three Olympics -- and the Aussie men have won none. And it also mattered little that the women's Japanese soccer team won last year's World Cup. The difference in how the women's teams traveled has sparked outrage and accusations of sexism. It prompted Basketball Australia to announce that it would review its travel policy "with the goal of ensuring there is equity between travel arrangements for the men's and women's teams attending future Olympics." That review, which was announced Friday, is expected to take about three months. Basketball Australia quoted Scott Derwin, its acting chief executive, in a statement explaining that each national team has discretion over how their funds are spent, including travel arrangements. "We should bear in mind that in fact, historically, more funding has been directed towards the Opals," Derwin said in the statement. The Opals refer to the Australian women's basketball team and the Boomers are the men's basketball team. The spokeswoman for Basketball Australia declined to comment when reached by CNN on Friday. In the statement released Friday by the organization, Derwin said: "But the simple fact is when a policy results in gender inequality, it's very clearly not the right policy going forward." The incoming chief executive officer of Basketball Australia, Kristina Keneally said in the statement, "In this day and age, there's just no excuse for men's and women's sporting teams to be treated differently when they both compete at the same world class level. "In fact, in this circumstance, the disparity is even more glaring when you consider that our women's basketball team is one of the best in the world - enjoying the number 2 spot in international rankings," Keneally added. Australia's Minister for Sport, Kate Lundy, agreed. "They shouldn't have to travel a different class because they're both world class," she said in a statement Thursday. While saying that travel arrangements are a matter for the national Olympic committee and the relevant national sporting organization, Lundy stated: "My view is that team travel should be equitable for our male and female athletes." The Japanese Olympic Council confirmed that the Japan Football Association upgraded its male Olympic team to business class and the female team to premium economy. It refrained from commenting on the matter. Japanese Olympic Council provides its country's Olympic-bound athletes with economy class tickets. It is up to each member association or athletes whether those seats will be upgraded or not. Japanese netizens were divided about the seating arrangements, with some saying the difference was unfair, while others said the economic reality is that the male team earns more money.

chatgpt: The 2021 Tokyo Olympics have been underway for a few days now, but an unexpected wave of criticisms have clouded over the much-anticipated international event. The most recent controversy has revolved around the manner of travel for the Australian and Japanese teams. In particular, the women's basketball team from Australia and the women's soccer team from Japan were made to fly economy class, while the respective men's teams flew in business class. The contrast in the flights taken by the female and male athletes have sparked debates on gender inequality in sports yet again. Many have voiced their outrage on social media, with tweets and posts echoing similar concerns about how the women's teams were deferentially treated. The Olympics is supposed to be a platform where athletes are encouraged to showcase their talents and represent their countries, but such blatant disregard for equality threatens that cause. Indigenous Australian basketball player Liz Cambage, who couldn't attend the games due to her mental health, but has been a vocal advocate for athletes of colour and LGBTQ+ communities, posted her view on Instagram. She stated in her post that the disparity between the travels of the men's and women's teams echoes the deeper issue of discrimination that female athletes face in their respective sports. Once again, the question of adequate pay for female athletes has been raised, as there is a significant disparity between the earnings of male and female athletes. It is ironic that the host country, Japan, has been promoting gender equality in the lead up to these games. The Japanese Government’s formal policy for gender equality aims to increase the proportion of female leaders in all fields to 30% by 2020, and at workplaces, it calls for more flexible work arrangements to support childcare and elderly care. This discrepancy points to a broader issue of equality, which has been a major concern for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC has made a conscious effort to address the gender gap in sports, which has been present for a long time, and with that, there have been notable changes in Olympic events in recent years. New sports have been added, and the number of women competing has increased significantly. Moreover, the IOC also announced last year that they will be awarding equal prize money to male and female athletes participating in the Olympic games, a major stride towards reducing the pay gap. However, this recent incident highlights that more needs to be done to ensure that women receive the same level of treatment as their male counterparts. In a statement to news outlets, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) confirmed that the flight choices were made as a part of careful considerations of the cost and logistical arrangements. However, they have also noted that they will be investigating the matter fully to ensure that such issues are not repeated in the future. It is essential to recognise the progress made in promoting gender equality in sports in the past few years. The inclusion of women’s events has given visibility to events that were previously overlooked, and increased funding and resources have resulted in a more level playing field. However, it is also crucial to acknowledge that there is still more work to be done. The circumstances surrounding the Australian and Japanese teams are a wake-up call for the stakeholders to work towards meaningful change and ensure that athletes, regardless of their gender, receive adequate support and recognition.
