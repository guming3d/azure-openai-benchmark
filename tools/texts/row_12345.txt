Among those arrested on suspicion of carrying out the killings was the local traditional healer, or witch doctor. Relatives of the victims said that their family members were hacked with machetes or burned almost beyond recognition. Josephat John, whose parents were killed in the attack, told Tanzania's Mwananchi newspaper: 'When I returned home in the evening, I found the body of my mother lying 10 metres away from our house, while the body of my father was burnt inside the house.' The assault in the village of Murufiti took place on Monday but reports only emerged after police announced the arrest of the suspects. Mr Mohamed said: 'We are holding 23 people including local leaders in connection with the attack. They will appear in court to face murder charges.'

One local human rights group, the Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), has estimated as many as 500 'witches' are lynched every year, based on reports that counted some 3,000 people killed between 2005 and 2011. Many of those killed were elderly women, the centre said. The group said some are targeted because they have red eyes, which is seen as a feared sign of witchcraft. But reddening of the eyes can be caused by the use of dung as cooking fuel - a necessary method in impoverished communities. The centre said that many local people believe that witchcraft is behind every misfortune - from infertility and poverty to failure in business. Past attacks have included a series of bloody assaults against albinos, as well as against young children. In Tanzania, albinos are killed and dismembered because of a widespread belief that charms made from their body parts bring good fortune and prosperity.

chatgpt: In Tanzania, five victims over the age of 60 and two over the age of 40 were reportedly attacked and killed in connection with accusations of witchcraft. The incident has since led to the arrest of 23 individuals, including a local witch doctor. The belief in witches and black magic remains prevalent in many parts of the country, leading to incidents of violence and lynching. According to local human rights groups, an estimated 500 individuals accused of witchcraft are killed each year. The recent incident occurred in the Njombe region, located in the southern part of the country. The victims, accused of practicing witchcraft, were reportedly beaten and then set on fire. The accused were later arrested by local authorities. Police have confirmed that investigations are ongoing and have urged the public to refrain from taking the law into their own hands. Human rights groups have also condemned the recent incident, calling for increased education and awareness-raising campaigns to combat harmful beliefs and practices. The use of witch doctors in such incidents further perpetuates the belief in witchcraft and can exacerbate tensions within communities. The government, therefore, must take action to identify and prosecute those inciting violence and those who participate in these acts. Tanzania is not the only country where such incidents occur, with reports of similar incidences happening across the African continent. In some cases, elderly individuals, particularly women, are often targeted, leading to the loss of lives and destruction of families. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has spoken out against the incidents, stating that the deaths are a violation of human rights and must be stopped. The international community has also been called upon to support efforts aimed at combatting such practices and promoting accountability. In conclusion, incidents involving witchcraft and violence remain prevalent in Tanzania, with the loss of lives and destruction of families being a common occurrence. The government must take decisive action to identify and prosecute those responsible for these acts while also increasing education and awareness-raising campaigns to combat harmful beliefs and practices. It is only through such efforts that Tanzania can hope to eradicate these shameful practices and ensure a brighter future for all its citizens.
