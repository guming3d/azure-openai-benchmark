chatgpt: Former England and Chelsea full-back Ashley Cole has been named as a nominee for England's Player of the Year award. Fans can register their choice by voting on the website of the Football Association (FA).  Cole joins an initial five-name shortlist which includes Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart. Fans are now able to show their support for the player they believe has made the biggest impact during the year by voting for them through the FA website.  Cole earned the recognition after a good season, during which he showed his quality for Roma. His experience and performances were crucial for the Italian side over the course of the season.  The FA website had earlier stated that Rooney and Hart, who both impressed for both club and country, were among those being considered for the award. However, after taking into account Cole's incredible performances, the FA deserves praise for including him on the shortlist. Cole's nomination was further confirmed by England's official Twitter account, which stated that he might be a possible candidate for the award. The inclusion of such a respected and admired name in the world of football has certainly added to the excitement around the award.  Ashley Cole retired from international football just prior to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The full-back was one of England's key players during his time on the international scene, including the Three Lion's run to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2006, and both Euro 2004 and 2012.  Despite his retirement from international football, Cole continued to be a vital figure for Roma, making 34 appearances for the Italian side during the 2019-20 Serie A season. Although not making as many appearances as in previous seasons, Cole still provided a commanding and steady presence to anchor Roma's defence. Cole's nomination for the England Player of the Year award can be attributed to the wonderful performances he produced for the team during his career, and has not gone unnoticed by the public. Cole played just 45 minutes during a friendly match against Denmark in March, which merely served to remind England and football fans everywhere of the value and importance of one of the nation's greats. With the deadline approaching fast for fans to vote for their favourite player, the competition is tight, but Ashley Cole's nomination offers a touching tribute to a great full-back who has given his all to the game.
