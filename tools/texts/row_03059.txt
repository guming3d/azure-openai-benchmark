Year 11 pupils - three white and one mixed-race - had come to school dressed as the Jamaican bobsleigh team in a tribute to the film Cool Runnings. After an outcry, head Stephen Lehec removed the picture and said: 'It was not the intention of either the students or the school to cause offence and the school unreservedly apologises for any offence that was caused. 'The school accepts that it exercised poor judgement in not acting swiftly when it saw the boys concerned and it has taken steps to ensure that this does not happen at future school events.' MailOnline contacted the Cheshire Midland Pub, where a member of staff said that everybody's ID had been checked before they were served and that they had caused 'no trouble'. Altrincham Grammar School was not available for comment.
