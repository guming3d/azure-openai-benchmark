article: By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . An 81-year-old woman has been ordered to repay more than $500,000 in falsely claimed Centrelink benefits . Pauline Mitchell has been ordered to repay more than half-a-million dollars in Centrelink benefits she claimed over a 30-year-period on behalf of her dead brother and sister. The 81-year-old from the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney,Â  was ordered to repay the government more than $514,000, which she has received in the names of her dead siblings, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal last week. The tribunal is investigating whether Mrs Mitchell, who also goes by her married name Pauline Crowhurst and her mother's maiden name Pauline Henning, will have to repay a further $219,000 based on false reporting of assets to Centrelink. Mrs Mitchell received $292,000 for pensions in the name of her brother Kenneth between 1984 and August 2010, despite the fact he died at sea in 1942 during active service in the Second World War. She also claimed $231,000 in pension benefits for Mary Mitchell, the legal name of her older sister also called Marie or Maria, who died in 1983. Payments to Mrs Mitchell and her deceased siblings were stopped in August 2010 and Australian Federal Police raided Mrs Mitchell's houses at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney and in Asquith, in northern Sydney in September 2010. Police found bank account details and key cards for Kenneth and Mary Mitchell. Mrs Mitchell claimed that her brother Kenneth had not died in the war and she met him in a park in the 1980s and saw him again in 2005. She insisted that Mary Mitchell was Kenneth's wife and that she had been withdrawing money from their accounts at their request, which she would leave on a table in the shed for them to collect. Mrs Mitchell has been receiving pensions for her deceased brother since 1984 and for her deceased sister since 1990 . Mrs Mitchell was also ruled to have 'told untruths' and deliberately failed to reveal her assets to Centrelink over the last thirty years, failing to tell them about four properties she owned in Kangy Angy on the central coast of NSW, Asquith and Wentworth Falls. At various times over the last few decades she told Centrelink officials that she lived 'in the National Park in the Blue Mountains by a river', in a caravan, and that she was homeless. Senior Member of the AAT Geri Ettinger ruled that 'much of Mrs Mitchell's evidence [was] less than credible' including her claims that she had suffered serious memory loss after being thrown from a horse in 1994. Mrs Mitchell also claimed that she did not tell Centrelink about her living arrangements because her three daughters had been abducted from her in 1968, after she separated from her husband and she 'lived in fear' of a second abduction. She also said that she had moved from her home in Asquith because there was a prostitute living downstairs.

chatgpt: Pauline Mitchell, an 81-year-old woman from Australia, has been ordered to repay a staggering $514,000 to Centrelink, the government department responsible for welfare payments. Mrs Mitchell, who received pensions in the name of her deceased brother and sister, is also being investigated over additional claims that she provided false reporting of assets. According to reports, Mrs Mitchell was receiving pension payments in the name of her brother from 1984 to 2010, despite the fact that he died at sea in 1942. She was also receiving payments in the name of her sister, who died in 1983, from 1990 to 2010. She failed to inform Centrelink of her siblings' deaths and continued to collect their pension payments for almost three decades. But that's not all. Mrs Mitchell also failed to disclose that she owned four houses over the years, instead telling Centrelink officials that she was homeless and lived in a caravan "by a river." It is suspected that Mrs Mitchell may have to repay an additional $219,000 based on false reporting of her assets. Mrs Mitchell's case has raised concerns around the effectiveness of Centrelink's monitoring and verification processes. The Department of Human Services, which oversees Centrelink, has stated that it has "robust systems in place to detect and prevent welfare fraud," but it is clear that in this case, those systems failed. In a statement to the media, the Department of Human Services said that "deliberate fraud against the welfare system is a crime and takes money away from those who need it most." The statement also emphasized that the department takes a strong and proactive approach to identifying and prosecuting those who try to cheat the system. Mrs Mitchell, who is now in her 80s, has been ordered to repay the full amount of the overpaid pensions within the next 28 days. If she fails to do so, the government may take legal action to recover the funds. The case has sparked a debate around the treatment of welfare recipients who provide incorrect information about their circumstances. Some have accused Centrelink of being too harsh on those who make mistakes, while others argue that deliberate fraud must be punished severely to protect the integrity of the welfare system. For Mrs Mitchell, the case serves as a harsh reminder of the consequences of trying to cheat the system. For Centrelink, it highlights the need for more robust checks and balances to prevent fraud and ensure that those who need assistance receive it. As for the wider community, it raises important questions around the ethics of welfare and the responsibilities of those who receive it.
