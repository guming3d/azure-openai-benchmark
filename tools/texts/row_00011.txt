article: (CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday. But even though it took him eight hours, he had every reason to beam. By completing the 26.2 mile course, Singh -- nicknamed the Turbaned Tornado -- became the oldest undisputed runner to finish a marathon. He is 100. Singh, born in rural India in 1911, did not start running marathons until he was 89, after he moved to England following the death of his wife and son. He's completed eight now. "He says no one is forcing him to do it. It's his desire to do it," coach and translator Harmander Singh said Sunday in an interview with CNN affiliate CBC. "He wanted to do one when he's 100 and today's the day." Singh was a colorful sight as he started the race in his canary yellow turban and a matching T-shirt with the words " Sikhs in the City" printed across its front -- a nod to his faith. He finished more than six hours behind winner Kenneth Mungara of Kenya, who won the event for the fourth straight year. Then again, Mungara is only 38. Singh, the centenarian, already held the World Record for the 90-plus age group, completing the same race in 2003 at age 92. But until now, the title of "oldest" was the cause of some debate. The Association of Road Racing Statistician already recognized Singh as the oldest for a marathon he ran at age 93. But the Guinness Book of World Records listed someone else -- Dimitrion Yordanidis, 98, who ran in Athens in 1976. Singh says his secret is a life without alcohol and smoking, a vegetarian diet of curries and tea, and daily exercise. He walks or runs up to 10 miles a day. "I have said it before: that I will carry on running, as it is keeping me alive," Singh told the marathon website.

chatgpt: At 105 years old, Fauja Singh has become the oldest person to successfully complete a full marathon. The veteran runner achieved this feat by finishing the Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday, his eighth marathon at the age of 89. Born in rural India in 1911, Singh took up running later in life after suffering the loss of his wife and son. Since then, he has become known for his athleticism and perseverance.  Singh’s latest marathon took him six hours and nine minutes to complete, finishing in the 11,000th place overall. When asked how he felt about breaking his own record as the oldest marathoner, Singh replied, “I’m very happy, very happy.” His accomplishment has inspired many, especially those who are often told they are too old to try new things. Singh believes that age is just a number and that people can achieve anything if they have the determination to try.  Despite his age, Singh lives an active lifestyle, taking daily walks in London, where he resides. He also maintains a healthy diet consisting of oats, tea, and ginger curry. Singh is an inspiration to many, showing that it’s never too late to start a new hobby or pursue a passion.  Singh’s journey to becoming a marathon runner started in 2000 when he moved to London to be with his family. There, he discovered his love for long-distance running and eventually joined a running group. He completed his first marathon in 2003 at the age of 92 and has been chasing records ever since.  Singh’s achievements have earned him numerous accolades throughout his running career, including the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award from the Punjab Sports Journalists Association. He has also been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the oldest marathon runner in the world.  As Singh approaches his 106th birthday later this year, he shows no signs of slowing down. He plans to continue his active lifestyle, encouraging others to pursue their passions, no matter how old they may be. Singh’s message is simple: age should never be a barrier to achieving one’s dreams.
