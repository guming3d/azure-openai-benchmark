article: By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 05:29 EST, 26 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:30 EST, 26 December 2012 . Plans to allow grands prix and motor races to be held on UK roads are being considered by Government ministers. Towns in Cumbria, Cornwall and Kent have all expressed an interest in holding road races with proposals to scrap laws that require race organisers to get special dispensation from Parliament to hold a event being drawn up. Under the proposals, which will be revealed in a formal consultation, plans for road races would only have to be approved by local authorities. Proposals: Scenes like this could be coming to a street near you with the Government considering changing the law to make it easier to hold races and grands prix on UK streets . Current laws require a suspension of the 1988 Road Traffic Act for a race to be held on a public highway. Speed limits would be legally lifted under the plans. Should the move be agreed, towns and cities in the UK could follow the lead of cities such as Valencia and Monte Carlo which famously hold races on the Formula 1 calendar. Towns in west Wales, Cornwall, Kent, Cumbria and the East Midlands are all understood to have expressed an interest in holding events, with Cheltenham hoping to hold an environmentally friendly race. It is thought that races could generate as much as Â£40million for local economies over five years, according to a study by Sheffield Hallam University and commissioned by the Motor Sports Association. Established: European cities such as Monte Carlo ad Valencia already famously hold glamorous Formula 1 races on their roads . The UK currently holds its annual Formula 1 race at Silverstone but no such events are currently held on the country's roads. The last major road race held in the UK was the Birmingham Superprix more than 20 years ago. Britain has a long association with motor racing with its first major race held in Bexhill-on-Sea in 1902. The town still recognises its association with the sport with signs on its outskirts that herald it as the 'Home of British Motor Racing'. That event was used to promote the town and it is hoped that the new laws would allow areas to attempt to do the same. Former Road Safety Minister Mike Penning told The Daily Telegraph: 'The public should have the flexibility to decide how they use their roads, in the interests of the local community and local businesses.' The Motor Sports Association say that the events would be fully regulated and insured.

chatgpt: Racing fans in the UK could be in for a treat as plans are being drawn up to allow races to be held on the country's roads. The move could see the country's 1988 Road Traffic Act relaxed to pave the way for exciting races on UK roads. According to reports, towns across the UK have already expressed an interest in holding the events, which are expected to attract thousands of fans from across the country. The plan could turn some of the UK's busiest roads into race tracks, with drivers taking on each other on open roads. Racing on the country's roads is not currently allowed, as the 1988 Road Traffic Act stipulates that motorsports can only be held on designated tracks. However, the new plans could see the law relaxed, allowing the races to take place on the country's public roads, much like they do in locations around Europe. The plan has been met with excitement from racing enthusiasts across the UK, with many celebrating the potential of being able to watch races on their local roads. The move is also expected to bring a major economic boost to the country's towns and cities, as motorsport fans flock to see the events. While the plans are still in the early stages, towns and cities across the UK have already begun to express their interest in holding the races. Many are believed to have already drawn up proposals that would allow the events to go ahead, with some even earmarking specific routes for the races. One of the biggest benefits of the plan would be the boost it would give to the UK's motorsports industry, which has struggled in recent years due to a lack of funding and interest. The move would not only provide a new outlet for motorsports enthusiasts, but it could also create new business opportunities for the industry, which has long been a major contributor to the UK's economy. However, there are also concerns about the safety and security of the races, with critics arguing that they could pose a significant risk to drivers and others on the roads. There are also concerns about the potential for accidents and injuries, which could lead to legal issues and expensive lawsuits. Despite these concerns, it seems that the plans are moving forward, with many towns and cities across the UK already taking steps to prepare for the races. Whether or not the plan will be successful remains to be seen, but it is clear that there is a growing appetite for motorsports in the country, and the new plan could well provide the boost the industry needs to thrive once again.
