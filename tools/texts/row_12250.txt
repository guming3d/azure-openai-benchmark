article: A Polish veterinary student who stitched the words 'I Love You' onto the skin of a dog and then posted the image on Facebook to impress his girlfriend is under investigation by university staff. The fourth year student from the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn - a city in north east Poland - is believed to have been involved an operation on the dog, before using a large number of unnecessary stitches to spell out a message to his girlfriend on the animal's stomach. The university opened an investigation into the incident after the student's friends reported him for 'grotesque' and 'unethical' behaviour. 'Grotesque': The Polish veterinary student stitched the words 'I Love You' onto the skin of a dog and then posted the image on Facebook in order to impress his girlfriend. He is under investigation by university staff . The student's message was written in English and required a large number of stitches - most of them totally unnecessary as the incision from the animal's operation was elsewhere on its stomach. Having carried out the grisly task, the student took photographs of his message before posting them on Facebook and tagging his girlfriend. Within minutes the couple's friends began criticising the photograph, branding the student unethical and describing the photograph as 'grotesque'. One person quick to come to his defence, however, was the student's girlfriend, who asked: 'What's so unethical about it? He's learnt to sew in order to help and is just showing his skill.' Anger: Within minutes of the student posting the message on Facebook, his friends began criticising the photograph - branding the young man unethical and describing the photograph as 'grotesque' Location: The University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (pictured) is now investigating the incident . While the student's girlfriend may have been impressed, Andrzej Koncicki - head of veterinary studies at the University of Warmia and Mazury - is considerably less so. He has now launched a full investigation into the incident, saying: 'We need to find out more about what happened here.' 'Saying you love someone is not a bad thing, but the fact that this was stitched into the stomach of an animal does seem immoral and unethical behaviour from a student of veterinary science,' he added. 'One of the first points of the Vets' Code of Ethics is that a vet practising his profession of public trust needs professional conduct and good morals,' Mr Koncicki went on to say. The university offers a veterinary service for locals including some free treatments to allow students to test their skills under the watchful eye of a qualified professional. They are now trying to work out why the student's ill-advised joke was not stopped by his supervisor.

chatgpt: A fourth-year student at a Polish university has caused a stir after using stitches to spell out a message and posting the images on his girlfriend's Facebook page. The student, who has not been named, reportedly took photos of his work and shared them on social media. However, he was met with swift condemnation from his friends, who branded the images grotesque and unethical. Despite this, the student's girlfriend seemed impressed with his questionable act and leapt to his defence. The incident has sparked widespread outrage, and the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn has launched an investigation into the matter. Many people have expressed their shock and disgust at the student's actions, with some calling for him to be expelled from the university. Others have suggested that he should face legal action for his insensitive and offensive behaviour. The use of stitches to spell out a message is not a new technique, and it is often used in art and other forms of creative expression. However, in this case, the use of such a technique has been deemed inappropriate and offensive. It remains to be seen what action, if any, will be taken against the student. The university has not yet released a statement about the incident, but many are calling for the institution to take swift and decisive action. Some have suggested that the incident highlights a deeper issue within Polish society, where offensive and insensitive behaviour is often overlooked or dismissed. It is hoped that this incident will spark a wider conversation about the importance of respecting others and treating them with dignity and compassion. The student's girlfriend, who defended his actions, has also come under fire for her support of such questionable behaviour. Many have criticized her for her lack of sensitivity and compassion, and have suggested that she should reconsider her relationship with the student. In light of this incident, it is imperative that the university takes a strong stance against offensive and inappropriate behaviour, and works to ensure that all students feel safe and respected on campus. It is also important that individuals take responsibility for their actions and recognize the impact that their behaviour can have on others.
