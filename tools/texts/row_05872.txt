In a recent video released as part of a World Cup promotion for Dutch suit maker Van Gils, the 40-year-old was seen playing a game of football with three real lions.  Richardson, who has worked with animals his entire adult life, has built up an amazing rapport with not just these lions, but with a whole host of other animals, from hyenas to cheetahs. He is believed to have such an affinity with the animals that he can feed, call, stroke, cuddle and even sleep next to the predators. The latest video shoot shows that Richardson's connection with these magnificent creatures only continues to grow. Since going viral, the video has been viewed millions of times on social media, sparking praise from fans and animal lovers around the world.

"My passion is to save and protect them in the wild as well as educate people about their true nature and behavior." Richardson's approach to working with these predators has made him a household name. His unique methods have not only helped him gain the trust of many wild animals but have also shown the world that there is much to learn from nature.  The video's release comes at an appropriate time, given the World Cup is just around the corner. With Richardson showcasing his skills in a game of football with the lions, itâ€™s drawing attention to international sporting events taking place in Russia, firing up fans for the months ahead.
