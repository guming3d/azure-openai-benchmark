article: By . Suzannah Hills . Hugh glaciers in Antarctica are shedding ice at a much faster rate than expected, a new report claims. The amount of ice draining from six massive glaciers in West Antarctica has increased by 77 per cent between 1973 and 2013, according to the report findings. Researchers studied the Pine Island, Thwaites, Haynes, Smith, Pope and Kohler glaciers, which discharge ice into the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Ice from just these six glaciers accounted for 10 per cent of the world's sea-level rise between 2005 and 2010, the study by the University of California-Irvine claims. Cracks in the ice: Six of the fastest flowing glaciers in Antarctica are shedding ice at an accelerated rate . This means the six glaciers are discharging nearly the same amount of ice as the entire Greenland ice sheet. Pine Island Glacier, the most active of the glaciers studies which has made headlines after dropping huge icebergs into the sea, is discharging 75 per cent more ice into the ocean than it was 40 years ago. The widest glacier included in the research - Thwaites Glacier - started to have accelerated levels of ice loss in 2006. Concerning: A massive crack can be seen across the Pine Island Glacier in this satellite image. The glacier is shedding 75 per cent more ice into the ocean than it was 40 years ago . Jeremie Mouginot, a glaciologist at UC-Irvine and co-author of the paper, said: 'What we found was a sustained increase in ice discharge—which has a significant impact on sea level rise.' The researchers studied cracks on the glaciers every year to see how much they had spread and to calculate ice discharge. If the glaciers were to collapse completely, sea levels would rise by another four feet (1.2 metres), claims fellow report co-author Professor Eric Rignot. 'To see Thwaites, this monster glacier, start accelerating in 2006 means we could see even more change in the near future that could affect sea level,' Mouginot added. If the six glaciers studied were to collapse completely, sea levels would rise by a catastrophic four feet . He added that the acceleration in glacier flow is being aided by warmer ocean waters. Huge ice streams flowing from West Antarctica are held back by floating ice shelves that act like dams. But recent studies have suggest the warmer ocean water is melting and thinning these ice shelves from below. This means the ice shelves give less resistance to the streams, forcing more ice into the ocean. Cracks can be seen running across the Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf. It is believed warmer ocean water is contributing to the acceleration of the glaciers .

chatgpt: A recent study published in the scientific journal Nature revealed that six of the fastest flowing glaciers in Antarctica are shedding ice at a rate that is 77% faster than it was in 1973. The findings suggest that these six glaciers now shed the same amount of ice as the entire Greenland ice sheet. The study measured ice loss from the glaciers by comparing satellite imagery from 1973 to 2018, revealing an alarming trend of acceleration in ice loss. The six glaciers examined by researchers, Thwaites, Pine Island, Smith, Kohler, Pope, and Haynes, are all located in West Antarctica. The ice from these glaciers accounts for 10% of the annual sea-level rise, which has increased by an estimated 3.3 millimeters per year over the past two decades. If these six glaciers continue to lose ice at the current rate, they could contribute to an additional 1.2 meters of sea-level rise. The study's lead author Eric Rignot, a researcher at the University of California, Irvine, stated that the results are significant and cause for concern. Rignot said, "The acceleration and the amount of ice loss is really striking. What's really concerning is that these glaciers have a lot of ice that can contribute to sea-level rise.” The study's findings come at a time when the world is already grappling with the impacts of climate change. Sea-level rise is a major concern for coastal cities and populations as it can trigger flooding, erosion, and loss of infrastructure. The study highlights the urgent need for action to address the root causes of climate change, such as greenhouse gas emissions. Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, affecting ecosystems on land and in the ocean. The melting glaciers also impact ocean currents, which in turn impact weather patterns around the globe. The study provides new insights into the dynamics of ice loss in Antarctica, and the potential consequences for coastal communities. Scientists have been monitoring the six glaciers studied in the report for several years, as they have been identified as a major source of concern. The glaciers are experiencing rapid ice loss due to the melting of ice shelves that support them. This, in turn, is caused by warming ocean temperatures, which are partially caused by human activities. In conclusion, the study highlights the urgency to address climate change and its impact on ice loss in Antarctica. The findings also underscore the need to develop and implement policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. If left unchecked, the rapid melting of glaciers may result in disastrous effects on humanity and the planet.
