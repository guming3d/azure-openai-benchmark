article: Donald Trump has been found personally liable for operating a for-profit investment school without the required license. New York state Supreme Court Justice Cynthia S. Kern said he was notified by the state in 2005 that his Trump Entrepreneur Initiative - known as Trump University until 2010 - was in violation of state education law. 'It is undisputed that Mr. Trump never complied with the licensing requirements,' Kern wrote in a decision made public on Wednesday. Donald Trump, pictured opening Trump University in 2005, has been found personally liable for operating a for-profit investment school without the required license . Damages will be determined later. Jeffrey Goldman, an attorney for Trump, said the ruling was mistaken, but ultimately little if any damages would be awarded. The decision came in an ongoing lawsuit filed last year by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that accuses Trump of misleading more than 5,000 people who paid between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investment techniques. A trial still must be held to determine whether Trump and the school defrauded students. The judge did toss out some claims and ruled that some evidence was beyond the statute of limitations. Damien LaVera, a spokesman for Schneiderman, called the decision 'an important victory' and said the office looks forward to proving the rest of the case at trial. Goldman said 'the heart of the attorney general's case has been eviscerated.' He said the judge ruled that the statute of limitations restricts claims to only the last six months the school was in existence. The university ceased operation in late 2010, Goldman said. The lawsuit, brought by the New York attorney general,  sparked a bitter reaction from Trump, who called Schneiderman a publicity seeking 'lightweight,' attacked his 'gross incompetence' and filed ethics complaints against him. The decision came as part of a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, accusing Trump of misleading more than 5,000 people who paid between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn his techniques .

chatgpt: The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, better known as Trump University, has recently been found to have violated state law. This information comes as part of an ongoing lawsuit that concerns whether or not President Donald Trump defrauded nearly 5,000 students who enrolled in the institution.  Trump University offered courses in real estate, with students paying between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn techniques from the now-president himself. However, the institution has been accused of falsely advertising the quality of its courses and students' ability to learn and become successful in the real estate industry.  This recent finding of state law violations is likely to further the case against Trump University, which already has a history of legal trouble. After being founded in 2005, the institution ceased operations in 2010, indicating that it may not have been as successful as advertised.  The allegations against the institution and its former owner, President Trump, have been ongoing since 2010. The lawsuit claims that the students were misled and defrauded, with false promises of access to high-quality instructors and real estate industry secrets. Instead, many claim that they received subpar instruction and support, leading them to believe they wasted money on a low-quality educational experience.  Given these findings of state law violations and the ongoing allegations of fraud, it is of little surprise that the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative has ceased operations. However, the repercussions of these actions may continue to haunt both President Trump and his former institution.  The legal battle is ongoing, with both sides continuing to argue their case in court. However, this recent finding suggests that Trump University was not operating within the bounds of state law, and may have misled the thousands of students who enrolled in its courses.  As the case continues, it remains to be seen whether or not President Trump will be further implicated in these allegations of fraud. However, for the thousands of students who paid to learn real estate techniques, the closure of the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative and this recent finding of state law violations may be a small comfort in the face of an educational experience that did not live up to expectations.
