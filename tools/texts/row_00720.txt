article: HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- The global "war on terror" can't be won if people are living in "desperate" conditions, Archbishop Desmond Tutu told CNN. Archbishop Desmond Tutu says "war on terror" will be thwarted by poverty, disease and ignorance. "You can never win a war against terror as long as there are conditions in the world that make people desperate -- poverty, disease, ignorance, et cetera," the Nobel laureate said. Tutu is in Hong Kong, where he is due to give a lecture on conflict resolution, reconciliation and forgiveness. He said the disparity between the rich and poor in parts of the world causes instability and insecurity, but added that he was hopeful the relationship between the two was becoming clear. "I think people are beginning to realize that you can't have pockets of prosperity in one part of the world and huge deserts of poverty and deprivation and think that you can have a stable and secure world," he said. The former head of South Africa's Anglican church is an advocate of reconciliation, and he often speaks out against violence and is a frequent critic of human rights abusers. Tutu also discussed with CNN the military junta in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Tutu described the rulers of that southeastern Asian county as "a military dictatorship that is running dead scared of a woman." He was referring to fellow Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, a leading dissident and pro-democracy activist there. Aung San Suu Kyi's politics have led to her being held in varying degrees of detention off and on since 1989. "The fact of the matter is she has nothing except her moral authority," said Tutu, adding that he believed recent street protests against the junta could signal an end to military rule. Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his vocal opposition and leadership against South Africa's apartheid system -- a government-sanctioned policy of racial separation which ended in 1994.

chatgpt: Nobel laureate and former Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, has stated that the ongoing global "war on terror" cannot be won if the people living in "desperate" conditions are not addressed. Speaking to CNN, Tutu stressed that poverty, disease, and ignorance are the key drivers of conflict that must be addressed to achieve sustainable peace worldwide. Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, has been an outspoken critic of military intervention in conflicts as a means to fight terrorism. He noted that ignoring the root causes of conflict does not bring lasting peace, and that it is crucial to ease the suffering of those who feel they have nothing to lose. The archbishopâ€™s comments came during a discussion on the ongoing conflict in Myanmar. Tutu slammed the country's government for being "running scared," as it shows resistance to the presence of international media and aid workers in the country. The Myanmar government has been accused of carrying out a military crackdown on the country's Rohingya Muslims, with thousands forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. The conflict has been raging for years, with many calling for international intervention to help the affected population. Tutu echoed these calls, stating that the situation in Myanmar has become a crisis that demands immediate attention from the international community. He added that the government needs to be held accountable for its actions and must be transparent in its handling of the crisis. The archbishop also emphasized the need to address other issues that contribute to global conflict. He pointed out that poverty, disease, and ignorance are not just in developing countries, but also in developed countries, including the United States. Tutu highlighted the importance of education as a means to combat ignorance and bring about lasting change. He also called on governments to make healthcare accessible to all and to address the issue of poverty to reduce the likelihood of conflict. In conclusion, Tutu's message is clear; the global "war on terror" cannot be won without addressing the underlying causes of conflict. By addressing poverty, disease, and ignorance, the world can reduce the likelihood of conflict and bring about sustainable peace.
