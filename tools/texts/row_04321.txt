chatgpt: Peter Lanza, father of Adam Lanza, the man responsible for the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, met with the leader of a Connecticut state panel investigating the tragedy for an hour on Thursday. According to Hamden Mayor Scott Jackson, who was also in attendance, Mr. Lanza was "cordial, business-like and friendly" during the meeting. The Sandy Hook Advisory Commission was established by Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy in the aftermath of the tragedy that occurred on December 14th, 2012. The panel was created to investigate the attack and to make recommendations for preventing future incidents. During the meeting, Mr. Lanza reportedly discussed his son's mental health and the challenges that he faced as a parent trying to get him the help he needed. The conversation was described as "constructive" by Mr. Jackson, who also noted that Mr. Lanza was very upfront and honest in his remarks. This meeting was a rare public appearance for Peter Lanza, who has largely remained out of the public eye since the tragedy. In a statement released in the wake of the shooting, Mr. Lanza expressed his condolences for the victims and their families and stated that he has been cooperating with law enforcement officials in their investigation. The tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School resulted in the deaths of 26 people, including 20 children. The incident sparked a national conversation about gun control and mental health, as well as a renewed focus on school safety. The Sandy Hook Advisory Commission has been meeting for over a year and is expected to release a final report with recommendations later this year. The panel has been examining a range of issues related to the tragedy, including school safety, mental health, and gun control. Peter Lanza's meeting with the commission comes at a time when many people are still trying to make sense of what happened at Sandy Hook. His willingness to meet with the panel and discuss his son's mental health is a welcomed addition to the conversation. While there are no easy answers, it is important that we continue to work together to prevent tragedies like Sandy Hook from happening again. The Sandy Hook Advisory Commission's report will undoubtedly provide valuable insights and recommendations that can help us move forward as a society.
