article: More than a century after it was first observed by astronomers a star has been identified as the oldest yet seen in the universe. The star is just 186 light years away from Earth and is at least 13.2 billion years old, and quite possibly many millions of years older than that. The Big Bang is calculated by scientists to have taken place about 13.77 billion years ago and the star, known only as HD 140283, was among the earliest stars to form. An artist's impression of how the oldest known star in the universe might look . 'We believe this star is the oldest known in the Universe with a well determined age,' Howard Bond, an astronomer at Pennsylvania State University, told the American Astronomical Society. Because it contains some heavy elements it is thought to have been one of the second generation of stars to be created following the Big Bang. The first generation of stars contained hardly any elements heavier than helium but when they exploded in a succession of supernovas within a few hundred million years after forming they were replaced by stars like HD 140283. Observations from the Hubble Telescope helped researchers fix the distance of the star from the Earth with unprecedented accuracy which allowed them to make more accurate measurements of how brightly it shines. Once its brightness was established they were able to work out how rapidly its hydrogen is being exhausted and so determine its age. When stars start running short of hydrogen they start dimming which is regarded as a reliable indicator of age.

The actual age that the astronomers’ calculations gave was 13.9 billion years but calculations of this type usually contain large error margins. In the case of HD 140283 the error margin was 700 million years, making it at least 13.2 billion years old. One other star, known as Methuselah2, has previously been shown to be 13.2 billion years old but the research team are confident they have determined HD 140283’s age with greater certainty.

chatgpt: Astronomers have recently discovered the oldest known star, located just 186 light years away from planet Earth. Known as HD 140283, this star has been observed for over a century and was found to have formed within the first 600 million years of the Big Bang. Scientists believe that the discovery of HD 140283 could provide invaluable insights into the formation and evolution of the universe. The process of discovering the age of HD 140283 was a complicated one, as the star does not have any planets or other celestial bodies orbiting around it. To determine its age, researchers had to analyze various properties of the star, including its temperature, brightness, and chemical composition. By doing so, they were able to conclude that the star was born approximately 14.5 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang occurred. This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the universe's origins. The fact that HD 140283 formed so early in the universe's history means that it has been around for nearly the entire lifespan of the universe, providing astronomers with a unique opportunity to study its characteristics and behavior. By studying the star's composition and structure, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of how the universe formed and how it has evolved over time. The discovery of HD 140283 also highlights the incredible advancements that have been made in the field of astronomy over the past century. The fact that we are able to observe and study a star that is over 14 billion years old is truly remarkable and speaks to the ingenuity and dedication of the scientists and researchers who have worked tirelessly to advance our understanding of the universe. Moving forward, researchers plan to continue studying HD 140283 in order to gain further insights into its properties and characteristics. By doing so, they hope to unlock even more secrets about the universe's origins and evolution, as well as gain a deeper appreciation for the incredible complexity and intricacy of the cosmos. In conclusion, the discovery of HD 140283 is a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy and has significant implications for our understanding of the universe. As scientists continue to study this ancient star, we can expect to learn even more about the origins and evolution of the cosmos and the incredible forces that have shaped our universe over the course of its long and fascinating history.
