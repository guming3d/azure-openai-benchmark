chatgpt: As the anniversary of the tragic murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby approaches, a charity event has been organized in his honour. Photographs from the upcoming event have already been released, and all profits will be donated to Fusilier Rigby's son Jack and other local causes. The charity event, which is set to take place on 22nd May, is being organized by the Fusilier's Aid Society. It will be a day of fun, food and music for the local community, as well as an opportunity to remember the life of the fallen soldier. Lee Rigby, a soldier in the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was brutally murdered in May 2013, outside Woolwich Barracks in southeast London. His death shocked the nation and sparked a surge of grief and anger. Since then, many charities and organizations have come together to support and remember Fusilier Rigby. The upcoming charity event is just one of many ways that people are showing their dedication to his memory. All the profits from the event will be split between Fusilier Rigby's son Jack and other local causes. Jack was just two years old when his father was brutally murdered, and has had to grow up without the love and support of a devoted father. The other local causes that will benefit from the event include the Royal British Legion, which supports ex-servicemen and women, and the Help for Heroes charity, which provides assistance to wounded or injured military personnel and their families. The event will take place at Staines Rugby Club, and will feature live music, food, and a host of activities for all ages. Organizers are hoping to raise a significant amount of money for the various charities, and are encouraging everyone to come along and support the cause. Speaking about the event, the organizers said: "This is a great opportunity for people to come together and remember Lee, while also raising money for some very worthy causes. "We are really excited about the day and hope to see a big turnout from the local community. We have worked hard to make sure that there will be something for everyone, and we are looking forward to a great day of fun and fundraising." As the nation prepares to remember Fusilier Lee Rigby on the anniversary of his death, events like this charity fundraiser show that his memory will never be forgotten, and that his legacy will continue to inspire and support others for many years to come.
