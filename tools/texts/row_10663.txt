article: By . Karolos Grohmann . Germany coach Joachim Low on Monday dismissed suggestions his pre-World Cup camp resembled a hospital due to the number of injured players. Captain Philipp Lahm and keeper Manuel Neuer are recovering from injuries and have yet to start training, while playmaker Bastian Schweinsteiger and defender Marcel Schmelzer are training alone at their northern Italy training camp. Holding midfielder Sami Khedira only recently returned to action after six months out injured and although he played for Real Madrid in Saturday's Champions League final, he was replaced after an hour. Bullish mood: Joachim Low is confident he will have his key men fit for the World Cup . '(When you) see reports you would think that we are in a hospital here but that is not the case," he told reporters in his first news conference since the team's arrival in the Italian Alps for a 10-day camp last week. 'We will travel to Brazil with a competitive and good team. The players are working very well and as it stands now I am very satisfied. Some are still injured and cannot fully train with the team but they are all training individually and I am very confident that it will work out.' Germany, drawn with Ghana, Portugal and the United States in Group G, are eager to end an 18-year title drought and Low said all would be fit in time for the tournament starting in Brazil next month. Talking tactics: Low briefs his squad during training . 'Philipp will start running on Tuesday and then we have to see every day. We should not force it,' he said, adding that Neuer would continue receiving treatment for an injured shoulder. He said players like Lahm, Schweinsteiger and Neuer would not be affected too much if they missed a few days of training. 'We assume that all of them will be fully fit within days,' said the 54-year-old. 'That is what they are working on. According to our medical department these are all short-term injury and I see no problem.' Limbering up: Andre Schuerrle, Julian Draxler, Toni Kroos and Mario Goetze  stretch it out . With Lahm expected to be fit well before the tournament starts, Low will delay his decision on where to deploy the right back, with his captain eager to move into a permanent role in midfield. 'We will decide during the preparation where he will play,' said Low, whose team take on Cameroon and Armenia in World Cup warm-up games on June 1 and June 6. 'It also depends on other players. It is still a bit early. We have to see what happens with Khedira and Schweinsteiger. We will take a decision after those friendlies.'

chatgpt: Germany's World Cup preparations have been called into question after reports that their pre-tournament camp resembled a hospital. However, the team's head coach, Joachim Low, has hit back at these claims, insisting that the squad is in good spirits and ready for the challenge ahead. Two key members of the squad, Philipp Lahm and Manuel Neuer, are currently recovering from injuries and have yet to begin training with the team. Lahm, in particular, is expected to be a key player for Germany in Brazil, but he remains a doubt for the tournament due to an ankle injury sustained in Bayern Munich's DFB-Pokal victory over Borussia Dortmund last month. However, Low remains confident that Lahm will be fit for the World Cup and will play an important role in the team's success. Neuer, on the other hand, is recovering from a shoulder injury sustained in the DFB-Pokal final and is unlikely to be fit for Germany's opening game against Portugal on June 16. However, the Bayern Munich goalkeeper is said to be making good progress and could play a part in the later stages of the tournament if his recovery continues at its current rate. In addition to Lahm and Neuer, other members of the squad are also carrying injuries into the tournament. Defender Marcel Schmelzer is recovering from a calf injury, while midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger is battling to overcome a knee problem. Both players are training alone at Germany's base in Italy as they attempt to regain their fitness ahead of the World Cup. Despite these injury concerns, Low remains upbeat about Germany's chances in Brazil. Speaking to reporters, the coach said: "We have a strong squad and we are in good shape. The injuries are a concern, but we have players who are ready to step up and make a contribution." Germany will be looking to go one better than their performance in the 2010 World Cup when they finished third. Low's team will be among the favourites to win the tournament this time around, but they face a tough task in a group that also includes Portugal, Ghana, and the United States. Low's squad is packed full of talent, with players like Mesut Ozil, Thomas Muller, and Mario Gotze among the standout performers. With a strong defence and a prolific attack, Germany will be looking to make a big impression in Brazil. Despite the injury concerns, the mood in the Germany camp remains positive. Low and his players are determined to do their country proud and bring home the World Cup for the fourth time in their history. With Lahm and Neuer on the road to recovery and other players stepping up to the plate, the German team is well placed to challenge for the biggest prize in world football.
