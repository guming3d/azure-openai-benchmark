Forgiven: Gregory Todd (left) forgave his girlfriend Tiffany Baillie (right) for stabbing him in the back, but she has now dumped him from prison . The chef however has now had his heart broken after she sent him a letter from prison saying 'it never would have worked out' and that they had been apart for too long, the Sunday People has reported. Mr Todd said: 'I was used like a fool but love is blind and I didn't see it. Tiffany has ruined my life and I will never be the same again. 'She has stabbed me in the back twice.' Baillie was jailed for three years after she admitted GBH with intent. Hurt: Mr Todd had been planning on marrying Baillie before she sent him the letter ending their relationship . Mr Todd wrote an emotional letter to the judge which was read out in court during the hearing. It said: 'She has made a big mistake that she will regret for the rest of her life. Please show compassion and allow her to prove what a valuable member of society she is and a mother to her son. She will have a husband, if you allow us to marry. I promise we wonâ€™t let you down.' Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'You must realise what you did could have killed him or caused him long-term serious injury. I will sentence you on the basis he has fully recovered or nearly recovered from the attack. The offence was aggravated by the use of a knife and the fact he was asleep at the time of the stabbing.' Following the marriage proposal, which was relayed by her barrister, Mr Todd had to wait 24 hours to be told it had been accepted in a phonecall from Newhall Prison to his home in Hessle which the couple share.

chatgpt: In a tale of love and forgiveness, Gregory Todd has made headlines for his ability to forgive his girlfriend, Tiffany Baillie, despite the physical harm she inflicted on him. Todd spent three months in the hospital after Baillie committed grievous bodily harm with intent, resulting in serious injuries to Todd's face and body.  Baillie was subsequently jailed for three months for her actions, during which time Todd continued to show his support and love for her. However, news has emerged that Baillie has ended their relationship, sending a letter from prison explaining her decision. Despite the betrayal, Todd has once again shown his ability to forgive, stating that he understands Baillie's decision and continues to support her during this difficult time. He has expressed his hope that she will use her time in prison to reflect upon her actions and strive towards becoming a better person. The case has brought to light the troubling issue of domestic violence and the power dynamics within relationships. Many have lauded Todd for his ability to forgive and move forward despite the harm inflicted upon him. However, others have criticized the relationship dynamics that allowed the violence to occur in the first place. Domestic violence is a recurring problem worldwide, affecting both men and women in various forms. It often goes unreported due to fear of reprisal or social stigma, making it difficult to address and prevent. This case highlights the urgent need to address and prevent domestic violence, with emphasis on education, awareness, and support for survivors. Despite the tragic circumstances, Todd's ability to forgive and support his former partner serves as a ray of hope in a dark situation. It is a testament to the power of love and forgiveness, offering a glimmer of hope for those affected by domestic violence. As the case continues to make headlines, it serves as a reminder of the importance of open communication, healthy relationships, and a zero-tolerance policy towards domestic violence. It is up to all of us to create a safe and supportive environment for survivors, and to work towards a society free from violence and fear.
