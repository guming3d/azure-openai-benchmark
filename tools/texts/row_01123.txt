article: Andrea Downie says she slipped on a grape while shopping and can no longer work . A Queensland woman is suing Woolworths for $320,000, claiming she slipped on a grape and injured her back. Andrea Downie, 39, from the Sunshine Coast, has filed a claim with the District Court in Brisbane, claiming she fell at the Tewantin Woolworths store in March or April last year. Ms Downie claims the fall injured her back and caused an existing condition of post-traumatic stress disorder to flare up, meaning she could not return to work, reported the Courier Mail. Ms Downie is suing Woolworths claiming that the supermarket failed to keeps its floors clean. She also claims the grape was 'in clear view' of staff and that the supermarket chain failed to have an 'adequate system of inspecting floors'. Ms Downie claimed Woolworths staff failed to be alert to hazards and spills, or warn her about loose grapes on the floor. She also said Woolworths should place mats on the floor of the produce section to stop loose grapes from 'escaping' onto the floor. Woolworths defended itself against the claims saying that Ms Downie did not complain to staff about the fall when it occurred and that it is 'uncertain' of the truth of her claim.

The company says it is 'uncertain' if Ms Downie really did slip and fall, but if she did the damages she is claiming are 'excessive' 'If the fall occurred as alleged by [Ms Downie], it was not reported to anyone at Woolworths on the day,' the company states in its defence, reported the Courier Mail. Woolworths stated that if the incident did occur, the damages claimed by Ms Downie were 'grossly excessive and unreasonable' and any loss of income results from her pre-existing physical and psychiatric conditions. Woolworths offered to settle the case in April and the case will go to trial on November 17. Woolworths declined to comment further on the matter. Lawyer Sam Macedone told Today that the case was 'very interesting' because the incident was reported after the event. He advised anyone involved in a slip-and-fall incident to report the accident to management immediately. 'If you fall over and you believe it’s their fault, you’ve slipped on something that’s on the floor, make a report of it straight away… Make sure it's on the record,' he said.

chatgpt: A customer of Woolworths has claimed that she slipped on a grape in one of their stores and injured her back. Andrea Downie says that the fall occurred while she was shopping at one of the supermarket's stores and that the accident has left her unable to work. However, Woolworths has disputed these claims, stating that they are 'uncertain' whether the fall even took place. They have yet to release an official statement on the matter at the time of writing. Ms Downie has been vocal about her frustration with the supermarket's response to her claims. She alleges that she has attempted to contact the store and its management multiple times, only to be met with silence or indifference. She has also stated that the lack of support she has received from Woolworths has worsened her current situation, making it even harder for her to cope with the physical and emotional toll of her injury. In response to these accusations, Woolworths has stated that they take customer safety very seriously and that they are always looking for ways to improve their safety measures. It is unclear at this time whether they plan to investigate Ms Downie's claims. The incident has highlighted the issue of slip and fall accidents in supermarkets and other public places. According to data from the National Safety Council, falls are the second-leading cause of accidental injury and death worldwide, accounting for over 8 million emergency room visits in the US alone each year. Supermarkets, in particular, are often held to high safety standards due to the large number of customers they serve on a daily basis. However, accidents can still occur, and customers may be left feeling frustrated and unsupported if they are injured. Despite Woolworths' promises to prioritize customer safety, incidents like this one are a reminder that more can always be done to prevent accidents and provide support to those affected by them. As Ms Downie continues to fight for her claims, it remains to be seen how this situation will play out. Both sides will need to provide evidence and support for their claims in order to come to a satisfactory resolution. In the meantime, customers may continue to be wary of the potential risks of shopping in supermarkets and other public places.
