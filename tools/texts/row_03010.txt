article: LG has launched its eagerly awaited 55ins television which, thanks to OLED technology, promise startlingly clear images on screens just 4mm thick. The set - the first big screen OLED on the market - heralds the arrival of a new technology which is set to take over our living rooms. The South Korean company said the TVs have a price tag of 11million won (£6,363), and will be delivered to buyers in its home market next month. Scroll down for video .

Wafer thin: Thanks to the OLED technology, the new 55in television has a screen that is just 4mm thick . The advanced, energy-efficient display technology makes it possible to manufacture thinner televisions, with LG's model measuring up at just 4mm thick. LG's announcement is the culmination of a race by electronics makers to be the first to deliver the next-generation sets. Sony showed up the world's first 11in OLED TV set in 2007, but the Japanese company failed to follow up with a bigger display. While OLED panels are more widely used in mobile screens, mass producing large panels is still tough because of technological challenges. Jang Moon-ik, director of LG's TV business, said in an interview last year that only two companies in the world have a capacity to mass produce large screen OLED TVs: LG and rival South Korean company Samsung Electronics. Even though LG and Samsung touted OLEDs as the future of television, both failed to deliver them to the market as promised in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to manufacturing challenges. Samsung declined to comment on the availability of its OLED TVs, saying making perfect products is more important than the launch schedule. Grabbing the title of the first OLED TV maker is much more symbolic than practical because initial production numbers will likely be small. Manufacturing big-screen new TVs requires billions in investments to upgrade factories. South Korean TV makers nevertheless hope their cutting-edge display technology can help offset falling prices and make their products stand out from those of their fast-growing Chinese rivals. Japanese companies, which previously dominated the global TV market, are struggling to come up with their own next-generation TV sets to avoid falling further behind but don't have enough cash to invest in new technology.

chatgpt: South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics has announced the release of its much-awaited QD-OLED (quantum dot and organic light-emitting diode) TV technology. The launch of this technology promises to bring about a major shift in the TV industry, as it delivers crystal-clear images, deep colours and outstanding contrast. The first QD-OLED TVs from Samsung are set to debut in South Korea, starting next month, and then will be released globally by the end of March. One of the key advantages of this new technology is its use of OLEDs, which are organic, carbon-based materials that enable brilliant image quality, making them ideal for flatscreen displays. OLEDs offer several advantages over conventional Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). OLEDs have self-emissive light, which means that each pixel is capable of generating its own light, resulting in deeper blacks and higher contrast ratios. OLED displays also offer wider viewing angles and better color accuracy compared to LCD displays. Additionally, OLEDs generate less heat, consume less power, and are much thinner and lighter than LCDs. Samsung's QD-OLED technology combines OLEDs with quantum dots, or QDs, which are tiny semiconductor particles that can emit light in a specific color. The use of quantum dots in TVs has become increasingly popular because of their ability to display a wide range of colors more accurately than traditional LCDs. QDs operate by converting blue light from LEDs to a broad spectrum of colors. This creates deeper, richer and more vibrant hues, producing a wide, realistic color gamut that's more similar to what we see in real life. Samsung's QD-OLED TV also offers 4K (Ultra HD) resolution, which means that the screen has four times as many pixels as a standard 1080p TV. This ensures a stunning picture, even on larger screens, while also making the image less pixelated and smoother.  The new TVs also promise to revolutionize the viewing experience for sports and gaming events. The QD-OLED technology offers an industry-leading response time of just 1ms, which makes for a fast and fluid viewing experience, reducing motion blur and making images appear sharper. At an initial cost of just over £6,300, the first QD-OLED TV sets will be made available to customers in South Korea next month, and later in the United States and Europe by the end of March. The hefty price tag is attributed to several factors, such as the sophisticated technology involved and the initial production costs. Despite this, the QD-OLED TVs are expected to see strong demand, particularly from early adopters who appreciate more realistic and immersive viewing experiences on larger screens in their living rooms. Samsung's foray into QD-OLED TVs comes at a time when the industry is undergoing a massive change, driven by consumer demand for thinner, lighter, energy-efficient and higher-quality screens. Samsung itself has been a pioneer in the introduction of new technologies, and the QD-OLED TV is the latest of many such innovations. However, the tech giant's competitors, such as LG and Sony, are not far behind and have their own offerings in the works. In conclusion, Samsung's QD-OLED technology promises to reshape the TV industry by delivering unparalleled picture quality and immersive experiences. While the price may be high at first, demand among early adopters is expected to be strong. As Samsung and other companies continue to introduce new technologies, the future of TV is looking brighter than ever.
