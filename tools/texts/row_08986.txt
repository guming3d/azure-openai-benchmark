chatgpt: In a tragic turn of events, 88-year-old Norma Sheldon died of hypothermia while being left out in an enclosed courtyard at Canterbury Gardens Alzheimer's Care Center. The incident took place after the required midnight bed check was not performed, and Sheldon wasn't noticed missing until after 1 a.m. Due to this negligence, her husband Donald Sheldon, 89, is suing the care center and is seeking expedited testimony as he doesn't believe he'll live long enough to reach the trial proceedings. According to the facility records, it was found that Norma's absence went unnoticed for several hours, which resulted in her death. This lack of attention towards residents' well-being is alarming, and Donald Sheldon believes that it's a severe case of malpractice that should not go unnoticed. Donald Sheldon is not seeking any monetary compensation from his lawsuit. Instead, he wants to highlight the need for care homes to take the necessary precautions to ensure their residents' safety. The elderly should be given the utmost care and attention, and their rights to proper care should not be compromised. Canterbury Gardens Alzheimer's Care Center has not yet released an official statement regarding the matter. However, this lawsuit has brought to light concerns about the quality of care that these facilities provide to their residents.

Donald Sheldon's determination to fight for his wife's rights and bring this issue to the forefront deserves acknowledgment. It's a testament to his love and concern for the welfare of the elderly, and his case should set a precedent for necessary reforms in the industry. In conclusion, this unfortunate incident should serve as a wake-up call to care homes and the healthcare industry at large to reevaluate their practices and put in place better protocols to prevent such tragedies from occurring again. Donald Sheldon's lawsuit has definitely sparked a conversation about the importance of the elderly in our society and the need to give them the necessary attention and care they deserve.
