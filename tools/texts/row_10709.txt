article: By . A. Srinivasa Rao . UPDATED: . 17:27 EST, 18 January 2012 . Bereft of friends or hope for five years and confined to a small room in a corner of the Government Niloufer Children’s Hospital in Hyderabad, Siamese twins Veena and Vani now face an uncertain future. Having decided against surgery to separate the conjoined twins, the hospital doctors on Wednesday called their parents, N. Murali and Nagalaksmi, and told them to take the girls back home. Their argument was that it was time for the kids to see the outside world, 'which is essential for their psychological and social development'. But those in the know claim that the fact is that taking care of the twins has become a burden for the cash-strapped hospital. Uncertain future: Doctors have told the parents of twins Vena and Vani to take them home. Bu they say they cannot afford to . But the parents are in no mood to oblige: 'We are too poor to take care of them in this condition. I have two more daughters,' Murali, a casual labourer from Beerusettigudem village in Warangal district, said. He also asked the government for 'some permanent employment', besides asking it to bear the medical expenditure of the twins. 'I have signed the consent form for the operation, whatever the consequence', he added. Unfortunately, nine-year-old Veena and Vani understand the situation to some extent. But seeing their parents after nearly two years, they don’t have any attachment towards them. Temporary reprieve: Hospital authorities have decided to keep the twins for the time being but have written to the government to look into the issue . 'No, we want to stay in the hospital. We are happy here. After the operation, we want to go to school', Vani said. Left with no option, the hospital authorities have decided to keep the twins for the time being. 'We have written to the government to look into the issue. But it is essential to take them out of the hospital for their overall development', hospital in-charge superintendent Dr K. Ramesh Reddy said. The doctors suggest that the government should shift them to an orphanage under the Women & Child Welfare Department, where they would get education and other facilities. Nowhere to go: The girls have been living in a small room in the corner of the Government-run Niloufer Children's Hospital in Hyderabad .

chatgpt: Two sisters, Veena and Vani, are currently living in a room in the corner of a Hyderabad hospital after their parents claimed they could no longer afford to care for them. The girls were originally from a poor family in the state of Andhra Pradesh, but their parents moved them to Hyderabad in search of better healthcare for Vani who suffers from a rare condition that has left her partially paralyzed. However, the family's financial situation continued to worsen, and they were unable to provide for their daughters' basic needs. It was then that the girls' parents made the difficult decision to leave their daughters in the care of the hospital. Veena, who is now 17, has taken on the role of her sister's primary caregiver. She helps feed, bathe and care for Vani, who is now 20. The sisters share their small room with a few personal belongings, including a set of clothes and a small radio. Although the girls' situation is far from ideal, they have found some solace in their hospital room. Vani's medical needs are taken care of by the hospital, and the sisters have also received support from kind-hearted volunteers who have provided them with food and other essentials. Despite the hardships they face, Veena and Vani have refused to give up on their dreams. Veena has expressed her desire to continue her education and become a teacher, while her sister Vani hopes to pursue a career in music. Their story has touched the hearts of many, with people from all over the world offering their support and help. A crowdfunding campaign has been set up to raise funds for the girls, with donations pouring in from India and beyond. The hospital staff have also been impressed by the girls' resilience and determination. Dr. Prabhakar, who has been treating Vani, praised the sisters for their positive attitude, saying "they are an inspiration to us all". While their future remains uncertain, Veena and Vani have shown that even in the face of adversity, they are determined to succeed. Their story serves as a reminder that with a little help and support, even the most difficult challenges can be overcome.
