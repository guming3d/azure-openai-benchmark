article: A collection of around 500 fairytales left forgotten in an archive for more than 150 years have been discovered in Germany. The stories - written around the same time as the Brothers Grimm folk tales - offer a new selection of entrapped princesses, evil witches and dashing young princes. Historian Franz Xaver von Schönwerth gathered the unique collection of stories in the 1800s from across the Bavarian region of Oberpfalz in Germany. The fairytales were collected by historian Franz Xaver von Schonwerth in the 1800s - around the same time the Brothers Grimm were writing tales such as the Town Musicians of Bremen, shown in a sketch by Carl Offterdinger in 1829 . Many of the tales were told to him by local country folk, labourers and servants which had previously only been passed on through the generations by word of mouth. He completed a book on his findings called Aus der Oberpfalz – Sitten und Sagen, which came out in three volumes in 1857, 1858 and 1859, which included the fairy tales and historical background on them. In 1885, Jacob Grimm said this about him: 'Nowhere in the whole of Germany is anyone collecting [folklore] so accurately, thoroughly and with such a sensitive ear.' But his book never gained prominence and faded into obscurity. It was only when Oberpfalz cultural curator Erika Eichenseer was sifting through his work which had been stored in an archive in Regensburg, Germany, for 150 years, that his work re-emerged into the public domain. Ms Eichenseer has now published a selection of fairytales from Von Schönwerth's collection, the Guardian reports. The book is called Prinz Roßzwifl - meaning 'scarab beetle' which is better known in English as a 'dung beetle'. Legends: Von Schonwerth's collection has never-heard-before tales but also more well-known stories like Brothers Grimm's Little Red Riding Hood, depicted in a drawing by Ludwig Pietsch . Ms Eichenseer chose the beetle because it buries its most treasured possession - its eggs - which she says is symbolic of the hidden knowledge and wisdom to be found in fairytales. Many of the fairytales in the collection had been completely lost to the public consciousness until now. One story tells of a maiden who escapes a witch by transforming herself into a pond. The witch then lies on her stomach and drinks all the water, swallowing the young girl. But once she has drunk the pond, the girl uses a knife to cut her way out of the witch. Ther are also more well-known but local examples of tales such as Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin. Ms Eichenseer says the fairytales were invented for people of all ages. She said: 'Their main purpose was to help young adults on their path to adulthood, showing them that dangers and challenges can be overcome through virtue, prudence and courage.' Ms Eichenseer helped to found the Franz Xaver von Schönwerth Society, an interdisciplinary committee devoted to analysing his work and publicising it.

chatgpt: A rare and valued collection of fairy tales collected by German historian Franz Xaver von Schönwerth has been discovered in a German archive after being lost for over 150 years. In the early 1800s, von Schönwerth travelled across the Bavarian region of Oberpfalz in Germany, collecting stories that had been passed from generation to generation by word of mouth. These tales were then compiled into a collection of over 500 fairy tales, which were published in three volumes from 1857 to 1859. Despite his efforts, von Schönwerth's collection of fairy tales gradually faded into obscurity. However, thanks to the discovery of his original manuscripts in a Munich archive, these lost stories have been brought back to life. The collection of fairy tales offers an insight into the world of the Bavarian region of Oberpfalz during the 19th century. The tales are a unique representation of the culture, beliefs and values of the region, and offer a glimpse of the stories that were being passed down through the generations. The stories range from the magical and fantastical to the more realistic and grounded, with each tale offering something different. Many of the tales collected by von Schönwerth have similarities to stories from other famous collections of folk tales, such as the Brothers Grimm's famous collection of German fairy tales. However, von Schönwerth's collection offers a unique perspective on German folk tales, and adds to the wider body of work surrounding the topic. Maria Tatar, a Harvard professor who has studied folklore and fairy tales, stated that "these tales offer us a window into the world of the people who told and retold them for generations. They reflect the values and attitudes of their audiences, and help us to understand their fears, desires, and hopes.” The discovery of von Schönwerth's lost collection of fairy tales has been widely celebrated, with many experts praising the significance of the find. German Culture Minister Monika Grütters stated that “von Schönwerth’s collection of fairy tales is a unique cultural treasure, which we can now make available to the world.” Translations of the fairy tales are already being prepared in different languages, including English. The first English edition of the collection, 'The Turnip Princess and Other Newly Discovered Fairy Tales', has already been published in the UK. The discovery of the lost fairy tales is a reminder of the importance of preserving cultural traditions and historical artifacts. In this case, von Schönwerth's collection of fairy tales is a treasure trove of historical, cultural, and literary significance, and its rediscovery is cause for celebration.
