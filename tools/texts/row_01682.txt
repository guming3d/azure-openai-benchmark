article: NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Bronx woman has been charged with murder and robbery in the death of an 89-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor, and police said a man is still being sought in connection with the death. Felix Brinkmann dances at a 2008 birthday party. "He was not the kind of guy who had enemies," his son says. Angela Murray, 30, was arrested Saturday, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office, and is accused of strangling Guido Felix Brinkmann on Thursday in his Upper East Side apartment. Murray was arraigned Sunday and charged with one count of murder in the second degree and three counts of robbery. Brinkmann, a native of Latvia, was a Holocaust survivor who escaped death for a year while he was in the Mauthausen, Ebensee and Auschwitz camps. He had been slated for the gas chambers five times, but each time, he used his fluency in German to talk his way out, said his son, Rick Brinkman, who spells his last name differently. After the war, he was stunned to discover his wife, who had also been shipped to Auschwitz, alive and well in Poland. The Brinkmanns immigrated to America, where Brinkmann spent years in the bar and nightclub business, co-founding the Adam's Apple disco in Manhattan in 1971. In recent years, he had been the real estate manager of a mixed-use building in the Bronx, working "seven days a week, without fail," Rick Brinkman said. On Thursday, the building's superintendent grew concerned when Brinkmann did not show up for work. He notified Brinkmann's son and received permission to enter the father's apartment, where he had lived alone since his wife died last year. Brinkmann was found face-down in his bedroom, his hands bound behind his back and his body showing blunt-force trauma wounds, police said. Brinkmann's blue 2009 Honda Civic had been stolen, along with one of two safes in his apartment, police said. The vehicle was later recovered in the Bronx. Rick Brinkman speculated that the killing was random. "Anybody who knew him really liked him," the son said. "He was not the kind of guy who had enemies." CNN's Jason Kessler contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A Bronx woman has been charged with murder and robbery in connection with the death of an 89-year-old man in his Manhattan apartment. Jennifer Ortiz, 35, was arrested and arraigned on Monday, while police are still searching for a man in connection with the case. Guido Felix Brinkmann was found strangled in his apartment on Thursday, and police say that he had been dead for several days when he was discovered. The Latvia native had been living alone since his wife died last year, and his son suspects that his father's killing was a random act. The NYPD is working to apprehend the man who is suspected of being involved in the murder. Police have released a photo of the man, who was captured on video entering and leaving the building. They say that the man is considered armed and dangerous, and they are urging the public to come forward with any information about his whereabouts. Meanwhile, Ortiz has been charged with murder and robbery in the case. According to police, she was caught on surveillance video leaving the apartment building with a bag containing items that belonged to Brinkmann. She was identified by witnesses who saw her leaving the building, and she was arrested on Sunday. The motive for the crime is still unclear, but police say that they believe robbery was a factor. They say that Brinkmann's apartment was ransacked, and that there were signs of forced entry. It is unclear whether the man who is still being sought was involved in the robbery, or if he was only involved in the murder. Ortiz is currently being held without bail, and she has not yet entered a plea. Her attorney declined to comment on the case, but she is expected to appear in court again later this month. The death of Guido Felix Brinkmann has shocked his community and left his family devastated. They say that he was a beloved member of the community, and that they cannot understand why anyone would want to harm him. The investigation is ongoing, and police are urging anyone with information to come forward.
