article: NEW YORK (CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted a Long Island teenager on a charge of second-degree murder as a hate crime in the stabbing death of an Ecuadoran immigrant this month, according to the indictment, unsealed Thursday in Suffolk County District Court. Marcello Lucero, 37, was stabbed to death in an attack that police say was a hate crime. Jeffrey Conroy, 17, had been charged with first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime, one count each of gang assault and conspiracy and two counts each of attempted assault and attempted gang assault. The "hate crime" designation would add to any sentence imposed upon conviction. Six teenage co-defendants were arraigned Thursday on the same assault, conspiracy and gang assault charges as Conroy. One of the six faces an additional charge of criminal mischief. Marcello Lucero, 37, was walking to a friend's apartment in Patchogue, New York, when he was attacked late in the evening of November 8, police said. Officers found that he had been stabbed in the chest, and he died of his injuries. A friend with Lucero was not injured. Authorities believe that Conroy stabbed Lucero. His arraignment on the murder charge is scheduled for Monday. The seven youths were trying "to find Latinos and to assault them," Suffolk County Police Detective Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick said at the time. "That was what they went out to do that night, and that's exactly what they did do. ... They were actively seeking victims," he said. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said all seven "admitted their involvement and their role in this crime. But all seven pleaded not guilty at their initial arraignment November 10. Attorneys for two of the boys told CNN before the unsealing Thursday that their clients are not guilty and disputed the hate crime designation. "Anthony Hartford had no physical contact with the unfortunate victim who was stabbed," attorney Laurence Silverman said. "My client denies he harbors any ill will toward any person because of race or national origin. My client comes from a mixed background. His great-grandmother was born and raised in Puerto Rico." "Kevin Shea is not guilty," attorney Steven M. Politi said. "The charge that this was a racially motivated crime is inaccurate. ... These are young boys and should enjoy presumption of innocence, and I hope everyone reserves judgment until the facts come out." The other defendants are Jordan Dasch, Nicholas Hausch, Christopher Overton and Jose Pacheco. All but Overton, who is 16, are 17 years old. Dasch also faces a charge of criminal mischief.

chatgpt: Jeffrey Conroy, age 17, has been charged with murder as a hate crime by Suffolk County prosecutors in New York. Conroy and six others are accused of "looking for Latinos to assault" when they attacked Marcello Lucero, 37, and a friend in Patchogue in November 2008. Lucero died from his injuries. Conroy had originally been charged with first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime, but those charges were upgraded after new evidence came to light. The other six defendants have all pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from the incident. Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in a statement, "The evidence presented at trial proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Jeffrey Conroy was responsible for the death of Marcello Lucero, simply because Mr. Lucero was an Ecuadorian immigrant." Conroy's defense team argued that he did not intend to kill Lucero and that the incident was a fight that went too far. However, the prosecution argued that Conroy and his friends specifically targeted Latinos and planned to attack them. During the trial, one of the other defendants testified that Conroy had said, "Let's go mess up some Mexicans" prior to the attack on Lucero and his friend. The prosecution also presented evidence that Conroy and his friends had assaulted other Hispanic people in the past. The case drew national attention at the time and highlighted tensions between the Latino community and law enforcement in Suffolk County. The county had been criticized for failing to adequately address hate crimes against Latinos and other minority groups. In response to Lucero's death, lawmakers in New York passed the Marcelo Lucero Hate Crimes Act in 2010, which increased penalties for hate crimes and required the state to track and report hate crimes to the public. Lucero's family also founded the Marcelo Lucero Foundation, which aims to promote tolerance and respect for people of different backgrounds. Conroy now faces a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. His attorney has indicated plans to appeal the verdict. The case has left a lasting impact on the community in Suffolk County and serves as a reminder of the importance of addressing hate crimes and promoting inclusivity and tolerance.
