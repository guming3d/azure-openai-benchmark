chatgpt: A 12-year-old girl, Sade Boone, was attacked by a rabid fox while waiting for her school bus. The incident occurred in a quiet neighborhood in South Carolina. According to witnesses, the fox suddenly appeared out of nowhere and charged at Sade. It knocked her over and latched on to her leg, biting her repeatedly. The girl was shocked and terrified, but quickly gathered her wits and fought back. In a desperate attempt to save herself, Sade grabbed the fox by the neck and tried to strangle it. She managed to wrestle it off her leg and held it down until help arrived. Animal control officers arrived on the scene and took the fox away for testing. It was later confirmed that the fox was infected with the deadly rabies virus. Despite her heroism, Sade was not out of the woods yet. She had to undergo a series of rabies shots to prevent the virus from spreading throughout her body. These shots are mandatory when someone is bitten by a rabid animal, and can be quite painful.

Despite the difficult circumstances, Sade is determined to make a full recovery and return to her normal life.
