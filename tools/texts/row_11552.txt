article: (CNN) -- French baguettes and pastries aren't the traditional bread of choice in the Middle East. But a bakery opened by a one of the region's foremost gourmet food companies is aiming to change that. Saudi Arabian firm, Bateel, hopes that by providing an international flavor to their offerings they will be able to further entice customers to their branded stores and cafes across the Middle East. The group has certainly come a long way from its early days as a humble date producer. Bateel first started manufacturing gourmet dates in 1992, adding nuts and chocolate to the traditionally popular fruit and selling them in upmarket boutique stores. "At that time dates were being sold in supermarkets and souks," said Bateel CEO, Ata Atmar. "But we decided that we wanted to market dates like Swiss chocolates." "We took essentially an agricultural product and turned it into a luxury food item and in the process created an entire new industry." A little more than 20 years later and Bateel is now operating in 17 countries with Saudi Arabia and the UAE representing its biggest markets. Drinks, oils and jams have also been added to its product repertoire during this time. "Surprisingly, dates is not as big of a business for us (any more)," said Atmar. "We are now a very much integrated premium food company. About 25% to 30% of our business comes from dates." To help market its food products the company launched the Bateel Cafe in 2007, featuring its ingredients on the menu. It also carried on selling its goods through its shops and other outlets like hotels and airports. This carefully calculated strategy of diversification has paid dividends. "We just signed with Qatar, the new terminal, so in a way the airport is an extension of our retail business," Atmar said. "In the (Dubai Duty Free) we are the number one food market here ... so there is a major presence." Atmar says Bateel has seen 20% to 30% growth in the past five years. But he said that this is not enough for what he eventually envisions for the company. "Outside the Middle East, or outside the Gulf, we are going on a franchise business," he said. "I'd like to see when you go to Beijing, you say it's time to go out and have a cup of coffee and you say 'oh, there's a Bateel here, let's go to Bateel.' Just as you do that in Dubai or Abu Dhabi." Perhaps this is the next stage of the Bateel story, transforming a homegrown Middle Eastern group into a truly global brand.

chatgpt: Bateel, a Saudi-based gourmet food company founded in 1992, has been on a mission to expand its food offerings and become a major international brand. What started as a company specializing in manufacturing dates has blossomed into a vast array of products. The journey of Bateel's success story started with the founders recognizing the shortage of high-quality dates in the market. By the time they started, only a small percentage of farmers were specializing in dates. The founders, with their expertise in the field, dedicated themselves to providing the best dates to their customers. They started with their farm in Al Ghat, a fertile place for date palm trees. Today, the company has multiple date farms, and their dates are sold all over the world. In the years since the company's inception, Bateel has expanded its range of products to include baked goods, chocolates, and spreads. Each of the items is made with the same dedication and commitment to quality as the dates. "I wanted to create a new brand that reflected the modern world's values and standards, combining innovation with tradition," said Bateel's CEO, Dr. Ata Atmar. "I always had a passion for food and felt inspired to turn it into a business." One of the driving forces behind Bateel's success is its commitment to quality control. From farm to shelf, the company strictly monitors its products to ensure consistency and quality. Moreover, the company takes pride in tracing back its products' origins to the farm level, which ensures authenticity and purity. In addition to the strict adherence to quality control, Bateel has invested in creative packaging and merchandising, which has contributed to the products' appeal globally. The elegant, sleek design of each product is a reflection of the company's dedication to excellence. As Bateel has grown, the company has expanded its retail presence globally. The company's stores now can be found in over 16 countries, with the Middle East being its biggest market. They have over 60 stores worldwide, including locations throughout Europe and the United States. The company also offers services online, providing customers with the convenience of shopping for their favorite items from the comfort of their homes. Bateel's brand recognition has also been enhanced through its participation in high-profile events, both nationally and internationally. In 2013, the company was the official gift provider for the World Economic Forum in the Middle East and North Africa. This event helped the company further its exposure and reputation. In conclusion, Bateel's journey to become an international gourmet food company has been successful. The company's quality control, innovative packaging, and retail presence have contributed to its exponential growth. Their commitment to providing exceptional products from farm to shelf has earned them a loyal customer base, both domestically and globally.
