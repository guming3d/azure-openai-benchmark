article: Police in New Zealand are appealing to overseas tourists - possibly including Australians - who stayed at a backpackers’ lodge and suspect 'something happened to them there' to come forward with their stories. The appeal went out on Wednesday to British and other male overseas travellers after a 56-year-old New Zealand man who ran the backpackers' lodge appeared in court on dozens of indecent assault charges involving 16 young men who were said to have been drugged. But police said they suspect Michael Harris allegedly assaulted many other young men, mostly overseas tourists aged between 18 and 25, who stayed at the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years in the small town of Kaitaia - which has a population of 5,100 - on the northern tip of the North Island. It is alleged Michael Harris allegedly assaulted 16 male backpackers in a lodge he owned in Kaitaia on New Zealand's North Island . Harris, who appeared in the Kaitaia District Court on Wednesday, was charged with almost 40 offences, including aggravated wounding related to allegedly drugging his victims to facilitate indecent assault and making intimate visual recordings. He was also charged of possession of intimate visual recordings and indecent assault and was remanded in custody to appear at the court again on September 18. The New Zealand Herald reported police said many of the victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years. The premises offers general backpacking facilities, hotel units and, on occasions, longer term accommodation in the owner’s residence. Asking backpackers to come forward, police said they were continuing their investigations. ‘It is very important for us to speak to anybody who has stayed in the owner’s residence over the last two and a half years,’ said Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnson. ‘These victims are unlikely to know that something has happened to them, although they may have suspicions,’ the Herald quoted him as saying. Victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years . Police allege the 54-year-old drugged the men from overseas countries - possibly including those from Australia . ‘We will deal sensitively with them and offer all appropriate support required. ‘This is an ongoing investigation and we have a lot of work ahead to assess evidence and establish if there are further victims we are not yet aware of.’ To help potential victims contact the investigation team, police have set up an email address.

chatgpt: A shocking case of alleged sexual assault has been reported in Kaitaia, located in New Zealand's North Island. Michael Harris, a 56-year-old hostel owner, appeared in court on Wednesday after being charged with nearly 50 counts of indecent assault. It is believed that up to 16 men were involved, and they were potentially drugged during the incidents. The allegations against Harris stunned the tight-knit community, which is known for being peaceful and welcoming to tourists. According to police reports, the incidents occurred between 2008 and 2018 at the hostel that Harris owned. The victims were predominantly young male backpackers, many of whom were visiting New Zealand for the first time. During the court proceedings, Harris pled not guilty to all charged offenses. However, the police believe that there may be other victims who have yet to come forward. They are urging anyone who may have been assaulted by Harris to come forward and share their story. The allegations against Harris have sent shockwaves throughout the community, with many expressing their disbelief at the accusations. Speaking to local news outlets, one resident said, "This is not the kind of thing you expect to happen here. Our community is small, and we are like family. This is a terrible situation for everyone involved, and my heart goes out to the victims." Police are currently investigating the claims against Harris and are appealing to anyone who may have information to come forward. They have set up a dedicated hotline for victims to report incidents or provide any details that may help with the investigation. The case highlights a growing concern about sexual assault and harassment in the tourism industry, particularly in hostels and backpacker accommodation. The New Zealand government has previously launched campaigns to raise awareness of the issue, and this case underscores the need for continued efforts to address it. The trial for Michael Harris is set to begin later this year, and the outcome will be closely watched by the community and those who have been affected by the allegations. In the meantime, the police are urging anyone who may have been affected by Harris to come forward and speak out. It is hoped that by doing so, justice can be served, and the victims can start to heal from this traumatic experience.
