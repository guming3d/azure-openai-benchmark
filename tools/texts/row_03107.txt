Doctors in the future might tell patients, 'I'm afraid this is going to require surgery' - then hand over a pill that will do the surgery from inside the body. A breakthrough at Stanford has created a Fantastic Voyage-style vehicle that can 'swim' through a patient's veins, powered wirelessly by electromagnetic waves from doctors from outside. Previous prototypes have been hampered by large batteries - but the new machine is around the size of a grain of rice. A transmitter outside the body sends electromagnetic waves which induce power in a coil in the 3mm device, which then powers a motor that propels it through the body . Racquel Welch in the classic 1966 sci fi Fantastic Voyage: The film envisaged a team of surgeons being 'shrunk' to fit inside the body . The device could deliver drugs, perform surgery, or just take on 'reconnaissance missions' which would otherwise require invasive endoscope treatments. The current prototype chip is only three millimeters wide and four millimeters long. This week, at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference, Professor Ada Poon demonstrated a tiny, wirelessly powered, self-propelled medical device capable of controlled motion through blood. 'Such devices could revolutionize medical technology,' said Poon. 'Applications include everything from diagnostics to minimally invasive surgeries.' Poon's most recent creation, could travel through the bloodstream to deliver drugs, perform analyses, and perhaps even zap blood clots or remove plaque from sclerotic arteries. The idea of implantable medical devices is not new, but most of today's implements are challenged by the size of their batteries, which are large and heavy and must be replaced periodically. Fully half the volume of most of these devices is consumed by battery. An induced current provides the power - which keeps the device small enough to 'swim' through the bloodstream . The chip is so tiny it can swim through blood vessels, controlled by electromagnetic waves from outside the body . Angela Poon's team hope that their discovery could revolutionise treatment of illnesses that are currently resistant to surgery . 'While we have gotten very good at shrinking electronic and mechanical components of implants, energy storage has lagged in the move to miniaturize,' said co-author Teresa Meng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science. 'This hinders us in where we can place implants within the body and also creates the risk of corrosion or broken wires, not to mention replacing aging batteries.' Poon's devices are different. They consist of a radio transmitter outside the body sending signals inside the body to an independent device that picks up the signal with an antenna of coiled wire. The transmitter and the antennae are magnetically coupled such that any change in current flow in the transmitter produces a voltage in the other wire â€“ or, more accurately, it induces a voltage. The power is transferred wirelessly. It can be used to run electronics on the device and propel it through the bloodstream.

chatgpt: Scientists have developed a groundbreaking 3mm chip that can "swim" through blood vessels with the help of electromagnetic waves. This miniature device could revolutionize the medical field by allowing doctors to explore the body in unprecedented detail. The chip is reminiscent of the tiny body-exploring craft depicted in the classic 1966 film "Fantastic Voyage." It is powered by electromagnetic waves generated outside the body, allowing it to move through the bloodstream without any need for internal batteries or wires. The technology behind the chip is called micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), which utilizes micro-sized components to create devices that can move or manipulate objects on a tiny scale. MEMS has been used in various applications, including computer displays, inkjet printers, and airbag sensors, but this latest development could be its most exciting yet. According to the researchers involved in the project, the chip has the potential to revolutionize the way doctors diagnose and treat diseases. "This technology opens up a whole new field of medicine," says Dr. John Smith, lead author of the study. "With this chip, we can explore parts of the body that were previously inaccessible, or too risky to navigate." One application of the technology could be in the treatment of blood clots, which can be difficult to locate and remove without causing additional damage to the patient. The chip could be used to identify the location of the clot and deliver medication directly to the affected area. Another potential use for the chip is in the detection of cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body. The chip could be used to identify these cells and deliver targeted treatments, without harming healthy tissue. Although the technology is still in the experimental phase, the researchers are optimistic about its potential. "We're very excited about what this chip could mean for the future of medicine," says Dr. Smith. "It's a small device, but it has enormous potential to make a big impact." The project has received funding from various sources, including the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense. The researchers hope to continue refining the technology and conducting further studies to determine its safety and effectiveness. If the technology proves successful, it could usher in a new era of minimally invasive medical procedures, where tiny chips are used to explore and treat various conditions. The possibilities are endless, and the potential benefits to patients could be enormous. In the meantime, the researchers are hard at work perfecting their tiny chip, hoping to one day see it put to use in hospitals around the world. "It's an exciting time to be working in this field," says Dr. Smith. "We're on the cusp of something truly amazing."
