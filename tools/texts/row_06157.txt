Police in India are hunting a man-eating tiger that is believed to have killed seven villagers in two weeks after escaping from an animal reserve. The tiger's latest victim was an unidentified woman who was found in a forest Tuesday in Uttar Pradesh, India yesterday. The female tiger is believed to be prowling over an area covering around 80 miles and is considered to be far more dangerous than others in the area due to a lack of hunting experience that forces the desperate cat to move closer to human occupation. Man-eater: Police in India are hunting a tiger which is believed to have killed seven people over two weeks . Rupak De, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests in Uttar Pradesh, said of the latest attack: 'A hunt has been launched to kill the tigress that has turned into a man-eater... It must still be hungry as it has been running without rest and adequate food.' The tiger is believed to have strayed from the nearby Jim Corbett National Park . which covers an area of over 200 square miles and is is home to an . estimated 200 tigers. Forest officials have recruited two elephants in their efforts to track down the tiger which they hope to drive back towards the national park. Salim Luqmaan, a government official in Moradabad, a forested area dotted with villages where most the killings have happened, said: 'People are terrifiedâ€¦ They have been asked not to go near forest areas alone. Three hunters have been hired to kill the tigress.' Angry villagers have accused authorities of not acting quickly enough to capture the animal after the first death was reported at the end of last month.

Moves are underway to have the animal categorised as a 'man-eater' meaning it can be legally killed. Wildlife activist and member of Parliament Meneka Gandhi has appealed to Uttar Pradesh's government not to shoot the tiger, however. In a letter to forest officials, she said the animal was only attacking people because it is hungry and would spare humans once it returns to its natural habitat. She said the Uttar Pradesh government should capture the tiger and release it in the neighboring state of Uttarakhand. India is home to some 1,700 tigers - half of the world's rapidly shrinking wild tiger population - but has been struggling to halt the big cat's decline in the face of poachers, international smuggling networks and loss of habitat. The country has seen its tiger population plummet from an estimated 40 000 upon independence in 1947.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a woman's body was found in a forest in Uttar Pradesh, India, on Tuesday. According to authorities, the cause of her death was a tiger attack. It is believed that the tiger had strayed from Jim Corbett National Park, which is about 40 km from the area where the woman's body was found. The forest department officials, along with local authorities, are trying to locate the tiger, but the search has proved to be difficult. The terrain is rocky and uneven, and the tiger could be hiding in caves or crevices. The officials are using drones and thermal imaging cameras to trace the tiger's movement. Authorities are taking serious measures to capture or kill the tiger. The forest department has already declared the tiger as a potential man-eater and is trying to categorize it as such officially. Once the tiger is classified as a man-eater, they will be legally permitted to eliminate it. Over the past few years, cases of human-tiger conflict have increased in India. Tigers are moving out of their natural habitats and venturing into the fringe areas of forests due to shrinking habitats and overpopulation. This situation has led to human encroachment and the consequential conflict between humans and tigers. Wildlife authorities believe that the only solution is to kill these tigers if they become habitual man-eaters. The Jim Corbett National Park initially gained fame as a sanctuary for the Bengal tiger, which had become a symbol of the country's pride and identity. However, in recent years, the park and its surroundings have witnessed an increase in tiger attacks. Farmers, forest workers, and tourists have all faced danger from wild tigers. In 2018, India witnessed a significant surge in tiger attack cases, with over 80 being reported across the country. The central government has launched a new initiative called the Tiger Commandos, a special team of trained wildlife warriors, to tackle this issue. The team has already been deployed in Jim Corbett National Park, and their mission is to track, capture, or kill man-eaters. The forest officials and authorities in the area where the woman's body was found are taking necessary measures to ensure the safety of the people living nearby. They are warning residents to stay alert and not venture alone into forest areas. They are also setting up traps to capture the tiger. The incident highlights the need for governments to address the growing issue of human-tiger conflict. Wildlife experts say that it is crucial to find a balance between human progress and wildlife conservation. They suggest that the government should protect the habitats of wildlife and implement measures to promote sustainable development. They also urge people to be more aware of their surroundings and respect wildlife. In conclusion, the incident of the woman's body found in the forest in Uttar Pradesh has once again brought forth the issue of human-tiger conflict. While authorities are taking steps to capture the tiger, it is also important to take long-term measures to address the issue. It is the responsibility of each one of us to ensure that we coexist harmoniously with nature and protect its treasures for future generations.
