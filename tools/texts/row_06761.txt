article: (CNN) -- In a scathing letter released on the anniversary of George Zimmerman's arrest in Trayvon Martin's shooting death, Zimmerman's mother writes that her son was charged "solely to placate the masses," and that the news media helped pass on a false narrative against an innocent man. "April 11, 2012, will be forever remembered by the Zimmerman family as the day the justice system failed us as Americans, and as a consequence an innocent man was arrested for a crime he did not commit, solely to placate the masses," Gladys Zimmerman wrote. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, posted a link to her letter on his Twitter account. Authorities say George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot 17-year-old Martin in Zimmerman's neighborhood in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012. Zimmerman's brother apologizes for offensive tweet . Zimmerman is awaiting trial, charged with second-degree murder in Martin's death. He claims he shot Martin in self-defense after Zimmerman saw the teenager acting suspiciously in the neighborhood. Zimmerman told police that the two exchanged words and Martin went after him. According to his account, the teen -- who was unarmed -- punched him, forced him to the ground and slammed his head on a sidewalk. Attorneys for Martin's family have accused Zimmerman of racially profiling the 17-year-old and shooting him "in cold blood." Gladys Zimmerman's letter is critical of those attorneys for the Martin family, claiming they manipulated "perception in order to sway the 'court of public opinion.'" She contends that a vast amount of evidence released since the shooting supports her son's self-defense claim, but most media outlets have avoided its publication and turned him into a "mythological monster." In response to the letter, Martin's family members and their attorneys released a statement saying, "For the Zimmerman family to allege that the justice system doesn't work, simply because they are unhappy their son was arrested in the first place, is disingenuous and disrespectful to the very system that is currently affording him every available opportunity to defend himself." The statement continued, "The arrest of an admitted killer is not a violation of due process, it is due process." Addressing supporters, Gladys Zimmerman wrote about her son's trial, set for June: "My son has always told the truth and your trust is well-placed. The upcoming trial will not disappoint you." Meanwhile, a financial update posted Thursday on the website for the Zimmerman Legal Defense Fund Trust said the defense "is now running at a deficit, and it is unclear how the defense will be funded moving forward." According to the update, since March 3 the fund raised $14,458.63 to help pay for Zimmerman's defense. "Current liabilities exceed cash on hand by about $10,000," the update said. The site said from the time the fund was established last May 2 through January 3, more than $314,000 was raised for Zimmerman's defense. Letters to Zimmerman show split opinions . CNN's Jason Hanna and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.

chatgpt: One year after the arrest of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin, tensions remain high among the families and communities affected by the tragedy. While supporters of Martin's family continue to call for justice, Zimmerman's family insists that his arrest was simply part of due process. "Arresting an admitted killer is not a violation of due process, it is due process," said a spokesperson for Martin's family in a statement released to the media. Despite the fact that Zimmerman has maintained that he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Martin, people on both sides of the issue continue to be divided over the case. Recently, Zimmerman's mother spoke out publicly about the case and expressed her disappointment with the justice system. "The justice system failed us as Americans," Zimmerman's mother said in a statement released to the media. "My son acted in self-defense and was falsely accused of a crime he did not commit." While the case has been controversial from the beginning, it is clear that it will continue to be a topic of discussion for many years to come. For the families of Martin and Zimmerman, the events of that tragic night will never be forgotten. In the weeks following the shooting, protests and demonstrations sprang up across the nation to call for justice for Martin. Many viewed the incident as a clear case of racial profiling, with a white man targeting and killing a young black teenager. Despite the controversy surrounding the case, Zimmerman has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder. His defense team has argued that he acted in self-defense when he shot Martin and that he had no other choice. Even with the trial behind him, Zimmerman's name continues to be associated with controversy and racial tension. Many believe that his acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, while others argue that he was simply standing his ground and defending himself from an attacking Martin. Regardless of one's personal beliefs about the case, it is clear that the events of that night have had a profound impact on both the Martin and Zimmerman families. While one family grieves the loss of a son, the other continues to struggle with the aftermath of a trial that has left many wondering whether justice was truly served. As the one year anniversary of Martin's death passes, both families continue to seek closure and healing. While the future remains uncertain, one thing is clear â€“ the tragic events of that night have changed the lives of everyone involved forever.
