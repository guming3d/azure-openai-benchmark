Actress Billie Piper, left, and husband Laurence Fox, right are both fans of the new Bikram yoga fad . The high intensity workout is also described as 'hot yoga' due to the sweltering temperature and high humidity . And the pair are breaking a sweat in star-studded company, with actress Helena Bonham Carter attending the same sessions. Miss Piper’s love of the ‘hot yoga’ workouts was revealed by Fox in an interview in which he lifted the lid on family life and marriage. The 36-year-old actor – best known for playing James Hathaway in long-running drama Lewis – told Woman magazine: ‘I’ve just started exercising – to stop my mind wandering, more than anything. ‘Me and the missus do a bit of 'Bikram' yoga twice a week. Helena Bonham Carter was there the other day. I said hello and then realised I didn’t know her.’ Madonna, Coleen Rooney, Andy Murray and Gwyneth Paltrow are also known to be fans of Bikram, which is based on the more common hatha yoga but performed in sweltering temperatures and 40 per cent humidity. Devotees claim that not only does it leave them stronger and more flexible, it also helps them shed weight fast. Just a few years ago, Miss Piper insisted her fitness regime involved nothing more than running around after sons Winston, now five, and Eugene, two. Shortly after Winston was born, she declared: ‘Exercise is the most boring thing in the world. It’s boring and hellish.’ Helena Bonham Carter, left, and Madonna, right, are both fans of the Bikram yoga workouts . In another interview, she said: ‘Having a child is the best way to keep trim as it completely changes your metabolism. I just don’t stop.’ Former Doctor Who star Miss Piper and her husband recently swapped their £825,000 cottage in a secluded West Sussex village for a four-bedroom home in North London which they bought for £1.7million last year. They moved to the countryside in 2007 and threw themselves into rural life, buying a horse called Chutney, two pigs named Boris and Barack, and three chickens. But with their careers flourishing in the capital, they decided to return. Miss Piper recently starred in Great Britain at London’s National Theatre and played an Irish immigrant in Sky Atlantic drama Penny Dreadful. Fox is busy recording an album and made his own West End appearance in Strangers on a Train at the Gielgud Theatre.

chatgpt: Laurence Fox, the husband of actress Billie Piper, has revealed the couple's secret to staying in shape: hot yoga. The couple is among the many celebrity devotees of the popular exercise trend, which includes the likes of Madonna and Helena Bonham-Carter. Hot yoga is a type of yoga that is typically carried out in hot and humid conditions. The craze was developed in the 1960s by Bikram Choudhury, who created a specific series of 26 postures that are carried out in a room that is heated to around 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The theory behind hot yoga is that the heat can help loosen muscles and increase flexibility, while also aiding in sweating out toxins from the body. For Piper and Fox, their preferred type of hot yoga is Fierce Grace. This variation of hot yoga incorporates elements of various yoga styles, including Ashtanga, Iyengar, and Vinyasa, with a focus on providing a challenging, yet accessible practice for individuals of all levels. Speaking about their love of Fierce Grace, Fox revealed that the practice has been integral to their physical and mental wellbeing, helping them to stay calm and focused in their often-hectic lives in the entertainment industry. "We've been practising Fierce Grace for a while now, and it's really helped us to stay balanced," Fox said. "It's a great way to unwind, and it's also helped us to cope with the stresses of our careers." While hot yoga has become increasingly popular in recent years, it's not without controversy. Some experts have raised concerns about the potential health risks associated with performing intense exercise in such high temperatures, such as dehydration, heat exhaustion, and even heat stroke. However, advocates of hot yoga argue that when carried out safely and under the guidance of a qualified instructor, the benefits can outweigh the risks. For Piper and Fox, it's clear that the benefits of hot yoga far outweigh any potential drawbacks. By practising Fierce Grace regularly, they are not only staying in shape physically but also learning to better manage the stresses of their demanding careers. It seems that for this celebrity couple, hot yoga is the key to maintaining balance and wellbeing in their busy lives.
