The housing association which manages the site has apologised following the discovery at the complex in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Berkshire coroner's office said the man was believed to be Benigno Lacey, 74, but formal identification was still taking place. His body was discovered at Blandford House in the town after he was understood to have lain undiscovered for up to four weeks. The body of the pensioner is understood to have lain undiscovered at Blandford House sheltered housing complex for up to a month . The body was only found after maggots were discovered in the building's hallways. One Blandford House resident, who did not want to be named, said a neighbour had noticed maggots 'dropping down through the light switches' in her flat. He added they initially thought the smell was from a dead cat. The tenant says he and his neighbours estimate the man may have been dead for three to four weeks. He said: 'There are still flies flying around.' Housing Solutions manages the site and said it has now cleaned contaminated areas to get rid of the infestation. A letter to tenants from Housing Solutions said: 'It is with great regret and a heavy heart that I have to inform you that your neighbour has passed away. 'Unfortunately, due to the circumstances of the death Housing Solutions were unable to react as quickly as we would have liked. 'We are aware this is an unpleasant situation and apologise for the inconvenience caused.' The letter goes on to say the number of maggots should 'decline' as a result of the cleaning and the level of communal cleaning would be increased to'reduce any further impact on residents'. A spokeswoman from Housing Solutions said: 'Sadly one of our sheltered housing residents was found dead in his flat. Housing Solutions, who manage the complex, have issued an apology to residents for the inconvenience . 'This resident had signed a disclaimer that he did not want daily contact with our staff, just monthly health and safety visits. 'We would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience this has caused.' Police confirmed they were called to a property in Ashcroft Road on October 30. The death was being treated as unexplained but 'not suspicious' and the details have been passed to the coroner.

chatgpt: Residents of a complex in the town of Basingstoke, Hampshire were left alarmed after a bad smell started emanating from one of the flats. They initially believed it was due to a dead animal until maggots started falling through light switches in various areas of the complex. A search of the building led to the grim discovery of a man who appeared to have been dead for up to four weeks. The identity of the man has been confirmed by the Coroner's office as 74-year-old Benigno Lacey. Authorities are investigating how the man lay dead for so long without being noticed. It is believed that he died of natural causes. Housing Solutions, the company responsible for managing the complex, has issued an apology to residents. They said they "were unable to react as quickly as we would have liked" due to the wishes of the deceased. Reportedly, Lacey had told staff in the past that he did not want daily contact with them. It is unclear if this is the reason for the delay in discovering his body. According to sources, Lacey lived alone and had no known relatives. It is not known what he did for a living or how he spent his time. Neighbors remember him as a quiet, reserved man who kept to himself. The case has sparked concerns about the well-being of elderly people living alone. Experts suggest that regular checks and visits could help prevent such situations from occurring. Local organizations have urged individuals to check on their elderly neighbors and offer assistance if needed. The incident has also raised questions about the role of housing companies in ensuring residents' safety. Some have criticized Housing Solutions for their allegedly slow response. However, others have pointed out that the company may have been hamstrung by the wishes of the deceased. The case remains under investigation by local authorities. Meanwhile, residents of the complex are still reeling from the grim discovery. Some have expressed shock and disbelief that Lacey had been dead for so long without anyone noticing. The incident serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of regular social contact with elderly residents. It is hoped that steps will be taken to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.
