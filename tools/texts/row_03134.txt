chatgpt: Thomas Rica, a former employee of Ridgewood Village Hall, New Jersey, pleaded guilty on Thursday to four counts of theft. He admitted to stealing more than 1.8 million quarters from the parking meter collection room over a period of several years. The 43-year-old man was fired from his job in January 2013 for stealing just $500 in coins. However, investigators later discovered that the amount of missing coins was much larger than initially suspected. Rica's scheme involved rigging a device to divert the coins into bags that he then took home. He was able to steal the coins for several years without getting caught. The theft was discovered in March 2015, when the village's finance department conducted an audit of the parking meter revenue. At that time, it was discovered that there was a significant discrepancy between the amount of revenue generated and the amount of money collected from the meters. Rica's theft had serious consequences for the community, as the money stolen was intended for public services such as road repairs, snow removal, and public safety. Rica's guilty plea is a reminder that theft of public funds will not be tolerated. "This is a clear message to those who contemplate stealing public funds," said Village Manager Heather Mailander. "We will work hard to uncover the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice." The defendant faces up to ten years in prison for each count of theft, and will be required to make restitution of the stolen funds. Rica will be sentenced on February 22, 2022. The Ridgewood Police Department and Bergen County Prosecutor's Office worked together to investigate and prosecute the case.
