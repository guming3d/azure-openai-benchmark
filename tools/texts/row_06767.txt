Argentina has unveiled a coin to commemorate the 30th anniversary of its invasion of the Falklands, inscribed with the year it claims Britain seized the islands. The South American nation's Central Bank will put into circulation 4.9 million of the two peso coins, which bear the dates 1833 and 1982-2012. In a statement the bank said that 1833, since when the islands have been under continuous British rule, represented the 'year of the usurpation by Great Britain'. Rewriting history: The Argentine coin commemorates the '30th anniversary of the recovery of the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich' Argentina claims Britain expelled a small Argentine civilian population in that year, but Britain had actually laid claim to the islands as far back as 1765 and Falklanders say it was only an illegal Argentine military garrison that was later expelled. The Central Bank said 1982-2012 was inscribed on the coins to mark the '30th anniversary of the recovery of the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich'. The reverse of the coin also features the crest of Unasur, the Union of South American Nations, over a map of the Falkland Islands with the two dates above and below. On the coin's outer ring, the word 'Malvinas' - the Argentine name for the islands - is written at the head with 'Causa Regional Americana' (American Regional Cause) below. The use of the coin to highlight Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Falklands and its backing from other South American nations marks a further attempt by the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to stoke the controversy. Controversial: The release of the coin marks the latest in a series of attempts by the government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (left) to lay claim to the Falkland Islands.

On the other side of the coin is a map of Argentina and Antarctica with the 'Malvinas' and other disputed islands in the middle with the words '2 pesos, Republica Argentina' and '2012' inscribed. Two pesos is worth around 25 pence. The coin was unveiled alongside a new 100 pesos note in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the death of Eva Peron, better known as Evita, the second wife of former president Juan Domingo Peron. Argentina's invasion of the Falklands in April 1982 triggered a 74-day war which cost the lives of 255 British servicemen, 649 Argentines and three Falklands citizens. The Falklands is to hold a referendum next year on its status as a British territory in a move designed to send a clear message to Argentina about the population's wishes.

chatgpt: In Argentina, a new coin has been causing a stir. The coin, which is inscribed with the dates 1833 and 1982-2012, is the latest attempt by the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to stoke controversy. The date 1833 is significant as it marks the year of the "usurpation by Great Britain" of the Falkland Islands, which Argentina claims as its own. The date range 1982-2012 refers to the Falklands War, fought between Argentina and Britain over the sovereignty of the islands. The coin, which is worth 10 pesos ($1.20), features an image of an Argentine flag flying over the Falklands and the words "Malvinas Argentinas" (Argentine Falklands) written underneath. The decision to produce the coin has sparked criticism from the Falkland Islands government, which has accused Argentina of trying to stir up tensions over the disputed territory. In a statement, the Falkland Islands government said: "This is a regrettable attempt by Argentina to exploit the issue of the Falkland Islands for political gain. The production of this coin is a clear example of Argentina's ongoing campaign of aggression towards the people of the Falkland Islands." Argentina has long disputed Britain's sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, which are located in the South Atlantic Ocean, around 300 miles east of Argentina. The dispute has led to several conflicts between the two countries over the years, including the 1982 Falklands War, which resulted in the deaths of over 900 people. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who has been in power since 2007, has been a vocal supporter of Argentina's claim to the Falkland Islands. In recent years, she has stepped up her efforts to raise awareness of the issue, including making speeches at the United Nations and lobbying other countries to support Argentina's stance. The decision to produce the coin is just the latest in a series of controversial moves by the Fernandez de Kirchner government. Last year, the government passed a law that nationalized oil company YPF, which had been owned by Spanish energy giant Repsol. The move sparked a diplomatic row between Argentina and Spain, with the Spanish government accusing Argentina of violating international law. Despite the controversy surrounding the new coin, it has proved popular with many Argentinians, who see it as a symbol of national pride. In a recent poll, over 70% of respondents said they supported the government's decision to produce the coin. However, critics say that the coin is a sign of Argentina's aggressive stance towards the Falklands and could further escalate tensions between the two countries. With tensions between Argentina and Britain already high, the decision to produce the coin is likely to exacerbate an already fraught situation. The Falkland Islands government has called on Argentina to engage in constructive dialogue with Britain to resolve the dispute peacefully.
