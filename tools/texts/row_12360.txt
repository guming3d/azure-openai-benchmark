Plans: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will announce that councils should ban speed bumps in town centres . Councils should ban speed bumps in town centres and provide more parking spaces for shoppers, Eric Pickles will announce today as he targets ‘anti-car’ measures. The Communities Secretary will tell local authorities their parking rules must aim to rejuvenate high streets, rather than raising revenue from ‘penalising’ drivers. New guidance will state that ‘draconian’ measures against cars, including ‘over-zealous’ traffic wardens, and ‘street clutter’ such as bollards and road humps which prevent parking, are stifling the local economy. Half of parking services are run by councils and Mr Pickles said attempts to put off drivers have pushed shoppers away from high streets and into out-of-town shops. He cited recent research from the Association of Town and City Management which has shown a strong relationship between parking provision and high street footfall. Mr Pickles said simpler rules – to replace 7,000 pages of previous planning documents – would be issued to councils this week with guidance on the design of parking arrangements to boost walking and cycling but without penalising car users. He said: ‘Draconian town hall parking policies and street clutter can make driving into town centres unnecessarily stressful and actually create more congestion because of lack of places to park. ‘Anti-car measures are driving motorists into the arms of internet retailers and out-of-town superstores. ‘Trying to find somewhere to park is an obstacle course in too many of our towns, cities and seaside resorts. 'Confusing and difficult car parking practices are undermining the economic vitality of the high street and tourist destinations.

Town halls need to ditch their anti-car dogma.’ Figures out this month from the RAC showed the 359 English councils raked in a £565million surplus from parking charges in 2011-12 – £50million more than the previous year. This is what they earned from on-street parking, off-street parking and penalties, minus running costs. 'Town halls need to ditch their anti-car dogma' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles . Westminster council in London had the highest individual parking surplus at nearly £42million. A Local Government Association spokesman said parking charges were falling in real terms, while councils were investing the money in filling potholes and improving roads. He added: ‘Councils work hard to try to boost trade and keep high streets vibrant through parking incentives. ‘Creating more spaces in town and city centres where there is no room for them is simply not the way to draw more shoppers to the high street.’

chatgpt: The UK government's Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles, has stated that parking rules should be redesigned to encourage consumers to shop locally and boost high street footfall. Speaking recently, Pickles noted that pushing shopping traffic to out-of-town retail parks has significant negative implications for traditional high street shops and their surrounding areas. The government has recently been under pressure to address the decline of high street stores, with many retailers struggling to compete with the convenience of online shopping and the variety of big-box stores located outside of town and city centers. One potential solution, according to Pickles, is to create a stronger relationship between parking provision and high street footfall by leveraging parking regulations to encourage more consumers to shop locally. In his speech, Pickles highlighted the importance of refreshing high street stores by introducing a new range of shops and services that would cater to modern consumer needs. He noted that a well-maintained high street with a diverse range of businesses – including cafés, bars, restaurants, and leisure facilities as well as retail stores – would encourage locals to visit and spend more time in their local area. To make this a reality, Pickles suggests adjusting parking rules to ensure that free or low-cost parking is more readily available for shoppers in city and town centers rather than out-of-town retail parks. He also emphasized the importance of reducing parking restrictions outside of shopping hours, giving customers greater flexibility when planning their shopping trips. The Communities Secretary also mentioned the role of technology in changing the way consumers shop and how retailers interact with their customers. He discussed the use of mobile apps and shared data schemes to help retailers understand who their customers are, their preferences, and how they choose to shop. These tools, he said, would help smaller businesses compete with more established brands by giving them access to valuable customer insights and helping them tailor their offerings to local needs. Pickles concluded his speech by outlining some of the potential options available to local authorities that are looking to rejuvenate their high streets. He highlighted the introduction of pop-up stores and businesses, regular markets and festivals, and encouraging innovative start-ups that can offer new and exciting products on the local market. The idea of lowering parking costs or making it free for high street shoppers has been a topic of much discussion in recent years, with some advocating for significant reductions or even making parking completely free. However, controversial proposals for significant cuts to high street parking charges have been rejected in some instances with some arguing that it would come at a significant cost of reducing revenues that are used to maintain and develop local roads and transport infrastructure. Despite the hurdles in perfecting a solution, the UK government remains committed to rejuvenating its high streets and improving the local environment for small businesses and retailers. The changing face of shopping with the rise of online retail and out-of-town shopping centers means that a new approach to parking regulations is essential if traditional high street shops are to survive and thrive.
