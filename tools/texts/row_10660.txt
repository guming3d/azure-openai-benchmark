Only half of parents think their neighbourhood is safe enough for their children to walk through. And fewer than a third believe their children are safe to ride their bikes, a poll reveals today. Such fears about playing out are at odds with the freedom to roam enjoyed by many of the parents when they were youngsters. Only half of parents think their neighbourhood is safe enough for their children to walk through. And fewer than a third believe their children are safe to ride their bikes, a poll reveals today . The study by AA Streetwatch reveals that more than nine out of ten (94 per cent) think that children should walk more. However, fewer than six out of ten (56 per cent) believe their neighbourhood is safe enough to do so. Moves to encourage children to cycle more are supported by nearly eight out of ten people, but fewer than a third feel their local streets offer a secure enough environment . Similarly, moves to encourage children to cycle more are supported by nearly eight out of ten people (76 per cent). But fewer than a third (31 per cent) feel their local streets offer a secure enough environment. The responses came from a survey of more than 22,000 AA Streetwatch volunteers who gave their views on roads in their local neighbourhood. The results also reveal a postcode lottery of safety fears. Luton came out as the least safe place for children to walk locally. By contrast, St Albans, just 12 miles down the road, was in the top five safest areas. Nationally, only one in 14 (7 per cent) agreed with the statement that it is better to take children  everywhere by car no matter how short the journey. Among the areas where people considered it least safe for children walking were Luton,  Liverpool, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Slough. Considered the safest were St Albans, Harrogate, Portsmouth, Bromley, Brighton and Bolton. The lowest proportion of respondents agreeing that children should be encouraged to cycle more was in London (71 per cent).

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by AA Streetwatch has shown that nine out of every ten adults believe that children should be walking more frequently. The study surveyed a wide range of individuals across various regions, cultural backgrounds, and age groups. However, the findings also indicated that less than six out of ten people believe that their neighbourhoods are safe enough for young children to walk in on their own. The implications of this disconnected perspective are significant, as it indicates that while many adults believe that kids should have more freedom to roam and walk to school, they are hesitant to let their children do so due to safety concerns. This issue raises crucial questions about the safety of today’s neighbourhoods and communities, as well as the freedom parents give to their children. The study highlights the importance of children’s physical activity and how it has diminished over time due to an increase in screen time and a lack of outdoor exercise. Children who grow up walking to school or walking as part of their daily routine are known to have better physical health and mental wellbeing. Walking is also an effective way for children to connect with nature, learn new things, and build their cognitive abilities. Despite the benefits, many parents choose to drive their kids to school, and children spend less time playing outside than previous generations. The fear of unsafe neighbourhoods and of strangers poses a significant obstacle and limits children’s adventures outside. The findings of the study also point to a broader issue: a lack of public confidence in neighbourhood safety. The results suggest that steps can be taken to improve public safety and encourage more children to walk or play outside. These could include measures such as enhanced street lighting, traffic calming measures, and better support for neighbourhood watch schemes. The AA Streetwatch survey highlights the need for parents, communities, and policymakers to work together to create safer, more walkable neighbourhoods. It is vital to enhance public safety by working with local authorities and communities to address concerns about unsafe neighbourhoods. Parents also have a role to play in creating a safer neighbourhood environment. By walking more frequently and working within existing neighbourhood watch schemes, parents can become an active participant in the creation of a more vibrant, connected, and safe community. In conclusion, the AA Streetwatch study indicates that while most people believe that children should walk more, there is an underlying fear of unsafe neighbourhoods. The results of the survey suggest that it is imperative to improve public safety and encourage outdoor activities for children. Parents, policymakers, and communities must work together to create safer neighbourhood environments that encourage children to walk or play outside safely.
