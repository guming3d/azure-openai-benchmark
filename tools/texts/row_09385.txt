article: (CNN) -- A Chicago hotel has closed and drained its pool, hot tub and fountain in response to the deaths of two people who contracted the flu-like Legionnaires' disease, authorities said Monday. Since August 14, health officials have recorded eight confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease, including the two deaths, among guests who visited the JW Marriott Chicago hotel in downtown Chicago. "We believe that there is no ongoing health threat at the hotel. Individuals who stayed at the hotel during this time period who are experiencing flu-like symptoms are encouraged to get in touch with a healthcare provider because it is important that all potential cases are diagnosed and treated as soon as possible," said Kathleen Ritger, a doctor at the Chicago Department of Public Health. Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory bacterial infection usually spread through mist that comes from a water source, such as cooling towers, air conditioning or showers. It is not transmitted person to person. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills and a cough. Most people recover, but between 5% to 30% of those who get the disease die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Each year an estimated 8,000 to 18,000 hospitalized cases occur in the United States. An outbreak of the disease in Philadelphia in 1976, largely among people attending a convention of the American Legion, led to its name. Along with draining a pool, fountain and hot tub, the hotel is working to alert guests who stayed there from July 16 through August 15, a Marriott spokeswoman said.

chatgpt: Health officials in Chicago have confirmed that they have found eight cases of Legionnaires' disease, a respiratory bacterial infection. Two of those infected have unfortunately died from the disease. The cases have been linked to the JW Marriott Chicago, where all eight individuals had stayed.  Health officials first became aware of the outbreak when the first two cases were reported at the hotel in mid-July. Both individuals were guests who had stayed at the hotel, but had no other known connection. Following this, an investigation was launched and samples were taken from the hotel's plumbing system to try to identify the source of the outbreak.  This isn't the first time that Legionnaires' disease has been linked to hotel plumbing systems. It can thrive in warm water systems, such as those found in hot tubs, fountains, and even air conditioning systems. It can then become airborne and transmitted to individuals through inhalation of the bacteria.  The hotel has already taken several steps to try to prevent further infections, including temporarily closing its pool and hot tub facilities. The hotel is also working closely with health officials to identify any other possible sources of the outbreak.  Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria. It can be fatal in up to 10% of cases and is most commonly contracted by inhaling small droplets of contaminated water. Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease can include fever, chills, cough, and difficulty breathing.  It is essential that anyone who stayed at the JW Marriott Chicago in the past few weeks and is experiencing any of these symptoms seeks medical attention immediately. Health officials are also urging anyone who stayed at the hotel during this time to contact their local health department to report any illness.
