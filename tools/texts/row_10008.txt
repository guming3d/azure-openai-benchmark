chatgpt: A female tourist had a harrowing experience in the mountainous tourist city of Mudanjiang, as she found herself stuck in a crevice during her exploration. The incident occurred earlier this week, when the woman, identified as Walker, was exploring the rugged terrain of the scenic city. According to eyewitness accounts, Walker had wandered off the beaten path and accidentally slipped into a narrow crevice. She tried to pull herself out but found that she was tightly wedged between the rocks. Fearing for her life, she raised the alarm, and rescue teams were immediately dispatched to the location. The rescue operation was a complicated one, as the crevice was deep, and the woman was stuck in an awkward position. Firefighters spent several minutes devising a plan to pull her out of the crevice safely. Eventually, they decided to use ropes to lift the woman out of the gap. After about thirty minutes of careful maneuvering, the rescue team managed to extricate the woman from the crevice. Fortunately, she emerged from the incident unharmed but visibly shaken. Walker expressed her gratitude to the rescue team, emphasizing that she would not have made it out without their help. The incident has drawn comparisons to the film 127 hours, in which a man was forced to cut off his arm to free himself from a canyon. Although Walker's predicament was less severe than that of the film's protagonist, the rescue operation underscores the importance of caution when exploring unfamiliar terrain. The accident serves as a timely reminder to all tourists to exercise caution when exploring mountainous regions. Even the most experienced hikers and climbers can find themselves in tricky situations such as this.

However, they have emphasized that safety should always come first and that visitors can continue to enjoy the city's many attractions while taking the necessary precautions. In summary, a female tourist became trapped in a crevice while exploring the mountainous tourist city of Mudanjiang. Firefighters used ropes to lift her out, echoing the plot of the movie 127 hours.
