article: (CNN) -- On a man-made island in the Middle East, the world's newest super mall sits empty -- for now. Inside, water fountains shoot into the air, giant plasma screens flash advertisements, escalators rise and fall; their only admirers are the odd construction worker. Missing from this scene are the shoppers. But come November, Abu Dhabi's 235,000 square meter Yas Mall plans to open its doors to 20 million visitors per year. "It's a conservative estimate," says Mohammed Khalifa Al Mubarak, CEO of Aldar Properties, the developers behind the ambitious design. Think big . With over 400 stores, Yas Mall will be the second largest shopping complex in the United Arab Emirates, developers hoping it will emulate the success of neighboring Dubai Mall -- double the size at 502,000 square meters. "Over the last five years, the growth of both Dubai Mall and the Mall of the Emirates has been immense," explained Al Mubarak. "They've both become destinations in themselves. "Abu Dhabi does not have that sort of destination here, it does not have that visitor experience. It needs that, it's hungry for it, and Yas Mall is hopefully going to cater to that hunger." Island living . The plush shopping center is the latest addition to Yas Island, a purpose-built $40 billion holiday destination rising off the coast of Abu Dhabi. Opened in 2009, the island boasts a Formula One circuit, water park, and "Ferrari World" with the fastest roller coaster on the planet. If shoppers are as "hungry," as Al Mubarak says, then Abu Dhabi is working hard to feed them. Last year the city was ranked 18th in the world in terms of new retail space. And before consumers have even stepped inside Yas Mall, Al Mubarak is already talking expansion. "We couldn't fit all the retailers we wanted to be here, so we're already starting to plan phase two," he said. "Abu Dhabi is a growing city. It's growing in its developments, it's growing in its demographics. And we are catering our retail for each aspect." Smooth sailing? This phenomenal growth hasn't been without losses. Aldar was 13.7billion dirhams (U.S. $3.7 billion) in debt last year, later merging with rival Sorouh Real Estate. "We continue to manage our debt to the best of our abilities, and we continue to be a development company," said Al Mubarak. "Over the last year we've launched two major projects that had been completely sold out. But we have developed in a mature, professional manner." As the finishing touches are made at Yas Mall, we'll soon find out if the island's latest addition sinks or swims. Property: Middle East hot spots not where you think .

chatgpt: Abu Dhabi, UAE - The Yas Mall, the long-awaited super mall in the UAE, is set to open its doors this November. The mall is expected to attract up to 20 million shoppers in its first year of operation. The Yas Mall is part of the $40 billion Yas Island entertainment center, which also includes the famous Formula 1 circuit. The developers, Aldar Properties, are pinning their hopes on the mall to help the company bounce back from the heavy debt it accumulated in recent years. The Yas Mall boasts a massive 2.5 million square feet of retail space, making it the largest shopping destination in Abu Dhabi. The mall features over 370 stores including some of the biggest names in fashion and luxury such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci. It also includes a 20-screen cinema complex, catering to moviegoers with the latest releases. Visitors to the Yas Mall can also expect a unique shopping experience. The mall features a cutting-edge design inspired by traditional Emirati trading villages, complete with wind-towers, narrow alleyways, and shaded courtyards. The mall's architecture combines contemporary Western flair with traditional Arabian elements, creating a dynamic and visually appealing shopping destination. The Yas Mall also focuses on providing shoppers with plenty of entertainment options, including KidZania, a popular children's edutainment center. It offers role-playing activities for children to learn practical skills, such as cooking or firefighting. The mall also features an indoor skate park, a multiplex cinema, and a family entertainment zone. "We are excited to bring a truly one-of-a-kind shopping experience to Abu Dhabi residents and visitors from around the world," said Mohammed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of Aldar Properties. "We believe the Yas Mall will be a game-changer in the retail industry and put Abu Dhabi on the global map as a premier shopping destination." The Yas Mall is expected to drive significant economic growth in the region, with the potential to add up to $1.6 billion to the local economy. The mall will create job opportunities for up to 10,000 people, offer spaces for budding entrepreneurs, and provide training programs for young people. Retail experts predict that the Yas Mall will become a regional shopping destination for fashion-conscious consumers from across the Middle East. The mall offers a variety of high-end and luxury brands, along with access to the latest fashion trends. "The Yas Mall is not just a mall, but a destination for entertainment, shopping and leisure. We are confident that it will become an iconic destination for shoppers from all over the world," said Al Mubarak. With the opening of the Yas Mall, the UAE continues its march towards becoming a top global shopping destination, competing with established shopping meccas such as London, Paris, and New York City. With a unique blend of cutting-edge design, luxurious shopping, and entertainment options, the Yas Mall is poised to be a game-changer for the region's retail industry.
