It has taken ten years and some rather painstaking work, but  horticulturalists have managed to grow orange raspberries. The new breed, called Autumn Amber, is the same shape and  size as the red raspberry and tastes the same, although some growers have said they are slightly more tangy. And while normal raspberry plants bear fruit only once every two years, the Autumn Amber variety has fruit every year.

Paignton, Devon, or from suttons.co.uk. The plants are now being sold in the UK for the first time and can be grown in the ground or in a large container. Tom Sharples, 65, a senior horticulturalist at Suttons Seeds, said: ‘The breeder used cross pollination techniques to make the orange coloured raspberries. ‘They used an autumn fruiting red raspberry plant with the yellow variety to make the orange shade. The fruit is exactly the same size and shape as its red cousin and even tastes the same, but is an unusually eye-catching shade . The new fruit has been dubbed 'Autumn Amber' because of its warm hue . ‘Normally raspberry plants only grow fruit on them once every two years but the Autumn Amber will have fruit every year. ‘The plants grow to a maximum height of 6.5ft tall and they can be harvested every autumn after planting in the spring. ‘This is the first time people can grow the orange variety in their garden and they can be grown in the ground or in a large container on the patio. ‘They taste very similar to the normal ones you would find in the supermarket but I would say they have more of a tang to them. ‘We suggest putting them in a fruit salad with red raspberries for a good contrast.’ Horticulturalists at a plant research centre in Kent have spent the last 10 years breeding the Autumn Amber raspberry by using natural cross pollination techniques . The East Malling Research Centre crossed a red raspberry plant with the yellow variety to make orange shades until they bred the perfect colour without the red pigmentation .

chatgpt: A new raspberry hybrid has been developed in Kent through cross pollination techniques. Named Autumn Amber, the fruit closely resembles its famous cousin, the red raspberry, in both size and shape.  Created by crossing red and yellow raspberry plants, the Autumn Amber has a similar texture and flavor to the classic red raspberry. The hybrid plant is now available for purchase across the United Kingdom, delighting fruit lovers with its unique characteristics. The development of the Autumn Amber represents a significant milestone in berry breeding, with the hybrid being the product of years of dedicated research by scientists. The goal of the project was to create a new raspberry plant that combined desirable traits from both the red and yellow varieties. The process involved crossbreeding the parent plants, selecting the best offspring, and then breeding them further to create a stable line that would produce fruits with the desired characteristics. The aim was to come up with a new plant that offered the best of both worlds, in terms of appearance, taste, and texture. The Autumn Amber is notable for being highly resistant to diseases and pests that typically affect raspberry bushes. Additionally, the hybrid plant can produce a higher yield of fruit compared to other raspberry varieties, thus making it an appealing option for commercial growers. Farmers and gardeners alike are already praising the Autumn Amber, touting it as a highly versatile fruit that can be used in a variety of culinary settings. It can be eaten fresh, turned into preserves or jams, or used as an ingredient in desserts and baked goods. The fruit has a subtle sweetness that is backed by a pleasant tanginess, making it an ideal ingredient in dishes that require a balance of sweet and sour flavors. Additionally, the color of the fruit is a stunning amber hue, adding a touch of visual appeal to any dish. The Autumn Amber has quickly become a favorite among fruit growers and is seen as a potential game-changer in the market. With its resistance to diseases and pests, high yield potential, and versatility in the culinary world, the hybrid plant has the makings of a highly successful crop. Many industry experts are predicting that the Autumn Amber could become as popular as the red raspberry within the next few years. As more people become aware of its unique characteristics, demand for the fruit is only expected to increase, leading to a potential surge in production. As with any new crop, however, there are still some uncertainties that need to be addressed. For instance, some have questioned whether the hybrid will be able to thrive in different climates, or whether it can be grown sustainably over the long term. Despite these concerns, the development of the Autumn Amber is a major breakthrough in plant breeding, and a testament to the hard work and dedication of the scientists involved in the project. It is a fine example of what can be achieved through cross-pollination and a reminder of the importance of continued research in the agricultural sector. In conclusion, the arrival of the Autumn Amber to the UK is a welcome addition to the country's rich agricultural heritage. The hybrid raspberry plant's unique characteristics make it an appealing option for both commercial growers and home gardeners alike. Only time will tell whether the Autumn Amber will become the next big thing in the world of fruit, but one thing is certain: its arrival is worth celebrating.
