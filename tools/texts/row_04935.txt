chatgpt: Kris Ford, 31, and Stephanie Hayden, 29, were arrested on Friday and booked into jail in Livingston, Louisiana. The couple, who worked at a family firearms business featured on the Discovery program, were accused of abusing Hayden's son. According to reports, Ford, who is the boy's stepfather, allegedly beat him with a black belt in September. Hayden is accused of being present during the beating and not doing anything to stop it. Both now face charges of cruelty to a juvenile and second-degree battery. The case has garnered attention not only because of the serious allegations but also because of the couple's previous association with a popular TV show. 'Sons of Guns,' which aired on the Discovery Channel for five seasons, followed the workings of the family firearms business in Louisiana. The show was known for its explosive scenes and gun-related stunts. However, the program was pulled after accusations of rape against Stephanie's father, Will Hayden. In 2014, he was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of multiple counts of rape and sexual assault against minors. The allegations sent shockwaves through the community and resulted in the cancellation of the show. Now, with the arrests of Kris Ford and Stephanie Hayden, the family business is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Fans of the show were quick to express their disgust and disappointment, with many calling for justice for the alleged victim. Authorities have not released further details regarding the case, but the allegations of abuse are serious and will no doubt be thoroughly investigated. If convicted, both Kris Ford and Stephanie Hayden could face significant jail time, putting an end to their careers and bringing further shame to the already damaged reputation of the family firearms business. In conclusion, the arrest of Kris Ford and Stephanie Hayden has once again thrust the family firearms business into the limelight. The charges against the couple are serious and should be taken seriously. This latest incident is one in a string of unfortunate events for the family and the community as a whole.
