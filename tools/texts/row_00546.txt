article: By . Victoria Woollaston . Glow-in-the-dark trees could soon be a natural alternative to electric street lighting, according to scientists. Researchers at the Glowing Plant project from California have transferred the glowing genes seen in fireflies, in to plants to make them glow-in-the-dark. The team is now hoping to extend the technique to larger plants and trees, and use them to replace electric lights. Scroll down for video . A team of scientists from California has developed bacteria than can make plants glow-in-the dark. They have taken genes from fireflies, glow worms and other bacteria that create naturally-occurring light and added it to household plants. The team is hoping that luminescent trees could replace electric street lighting . The genes used in the Glowing Plant project are taken from glow worms and fireflies that create natural light through what's called bioluminescence. The genes are added to agrobacteria, and this agrobacteria transfers these genes to the plants, which makes them glow-in-the-dark . Luciferase is an enzyme used in bioluminescence. The name comes from Lucifer. Lucifer is Latin for lucem ferrem, which means 'light-bearer'. Fireflies, glow worms and jellyfish can regulate how much light they produce by using different lucieferases in a range of ways. The enzyme can also be found in some bacteria and Jack-O-Lantern mushrooms. Antony Evans from the University of Cambridge, with Stamford PHDs Kyle Taylor and Omri Amirav-Drory have been creating glow-in-the-dark plants in a DIY biolab in California. The team were inspired by fireflies and glow worms that both produce what's called bioluminescence. Bioluminescence is the process that makes these creatures produce naturally-occurring light from their bodies. The team start off by getting glowing protein enzymes called Luciferase, from the genes of fireflies or from bacteria. They then use software called Genome Compiler to make it possible for the plants to read what those genes are. The genes are then made in labs and shipped to the team in California. This chart from the Glowing Plant project shows how the team creates the glow-in-the-dark plants, which could be used to replace electrical street lighting . The Californian scientists have tested their technology on a range of plants in their DIY biolab. Anyone who pledges money to the project's Kickstarter campaign can get a glow-in-the-dark rose, or be given the chance to buy one before anyone else . Evans and his team put these genes into liquid agrobacteria and the bacteria is poured over the plants. Agrobacteria is able to transfer genes into plants, and when these glowing genes are added, they are transferred to the plants, which makes them glow-in-the-dark. To create these genes, the scientists have had to redesign the DNA sequence. They have successfully managed to create small glowing plants and are now asking for extra funding, via a Kickstarter campaign, to use the technology on larger plants and trees. The campaign ends on 7 June. So far it has had more than 5,000 backers and raised over Â£183,000. VIDEO: Company's idea to develop glowing plants to light streets .

chatgpt: Scientists in California have utilized genes from fireflies and glow worms to produce plants that glow in the dark. This remarkable feat has been achieved by a team of researchers at the University of California who believe that their revolutionary creation could hold the key to a more sustainable future, where electric lighting could potentially become a thing of the past. The researchers have utilized the genetic material in fireflies and glow worms that emits light, called luciferase, to create a light-emitting plant that glows throughout the night. The genes were introduced into the plants' DNA using a technique called agrobacterium, which inserts foreign DNA into the plant's genome. The project began seven years ago when an artist in San Francisco named Antony Evans came up with the idea of producing plants that glow in the dark. He then founded the biohacking company, Glowing Plant, in order to fund the project and bring it to fruition. The team's initial aim was to produce a small glowing plant, but after much experimentation, they were able to produce larger, glowing plants that emit much brighter light. The genetically modified plants are capable of absorbing sunlight during the day and emitting light at night, making them an ideal alternative to electric lighting. The team has already produced glowing tobacco plants and Arabidopsis plants, a common research plant used in biology, and now they are looking to extend their research to larger plants like trees and shrubs. This innovation has potential uses in the fields of agriculture, urban development, and even in space exploration where self-sufficient energy sources are necessary. If glowing plants could replace electric lighting, it could lead to significant energy savings and reduce the overall environmental impact of lighting systems. Furthermore, the team believes their glowing plants have the potential to transform the way we interact with our natural surroundings. In the future, people could be able to walk through glowing forests at night or have gardens filled with plants that light up after dark. However, some experts have warned that there may be potential dangers associated with these genetically modified plants, especially if they enter the food chain or ecosystems. The team has emphasized that their plants are safe and will not harm the environment or living organisms around them. Regardless of the potential risks, the team is confident that their glowing plant technology could have a positive impact on the world. They have even launched a crowdfunding campaign to support further research and development of their plant technology. In conclusion, the team at the University of California has made an impressive breakthrough in the field of biotechnology by creating glowing plants using genes from fireflies and glow worms. As research progresses, there may be an opportunity for this innovation to replace electric lighting and provide a more sustainable and energy-efficient solution.
