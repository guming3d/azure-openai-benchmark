Two Marine generals have been fired over the security lapses that allowed 15 Taliban insurgents to infiltrate the NATO base in Afghanistan where Prince Harry was housed last September. The attack claimed the lives of two U.S. Marines, including a Lieutenant Colonel, and destroyed six $24million Harrier jets and a C-130 transport plane - the largest single loss of American air power since the Vietnam War. Major General Charles 'Mark' Gurganus, the commander of Regional Command Southwest in Afghanistan, and Major General Gregg Sturdevant, the commander of the Marines' aviation wing, have both been asked to retire, it was revealed today.

Target: The Taliban said that Prince Harry, who was stationed at Camp Bastion, was a target of the attackers . Marine Corps Commandant General James Amos demanded the resignation of the two commanders because they failed to ensure security at the base. On September 14, 2012, 15 Taliban insurgents, dressed in U.S. military uniforms, slipped under a fence at the military outpost in Helmand Province. Taliban propagandists said the Camp Bastion attackers intended to find and assassinate Prince Harry, who was living at the compound. There have been conflicting reports as to whether Captain Wales, the fourth in line to the throne, was sent to a safe room or whether he was treated like any other soldier during the four-hour gun battle. Prince Harry is the pilot of an Apache helicopter gunship. However, the team targeted numerous NATO aircraft, destroying or heavily damaging more than a dozen and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Reliving the day: Details of the September 2012 raid were state secrets until now . USA Today reports that General Amos said : 'In their duty to protect their forces these two generals did not meet that standard.' Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Raible, 40, was killed when he mustered a counter attack against the invaders and charged armed only with his sidearm. Marine Sergeant Bradley Atwell, 27, was killed, as well. American Marines and members of the British Royal Air Force killed 14 of the attackers and captured one. General Gurganus was in charge of ensuring that the American aircraft were secure from assault. He requested more Marines for base security, but was denied. Still, commanders say the general left base guard towers unoccupied and other defenses under-manned. General Sturdevant was faulted for assuming other units would protect his aircraft wing and not setting up security measures of his own.

chatgpt: In a stunning announcement, the United States Military has asked two senior officers to retire over their alleged role in the tragic September 2012 attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. Major General Charles 'Mark' Gurganus and Major General Gregg Sturdevant have both been asked to step down from their positions after a thorough investigation into the incident. The attack, which saw fifteen Taliban insurgents slip into Camp Bastion and destroy $200 million worth of U.S. aircraft, sparked outrage and shock around the world. The base was home to numerous aircraft and support personnel, including Prince Harry, who was at the base at the time. The Taliban later claimed that the attack had been a targeted assassination attempt on Prince Harry, stating that a suicide squad had intended to kill the Prince. While Prince Harry was unharmed in the incident, the attack resulted in the deaths of two Marines and left several more wounded. Following the attack, questions were raised about the level of preparedness and security at the base. The U.S. Military conducted a detailed investigation, led by Brig. Gen. Robert Castellvi, which has now resulted in the decision to ask Gurganus and Sturdevant to retire. According to the investigation's findings, Gurganus and Sturdevant were both found to be at fault for the security lapses that allowed the Taliban to gain access to the base. Specifically, they were accused of failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks posed by the insurgents, resulting in the devastating attack. The move to ask the two officers to retire has been met with mixed reactions. While some have praised the military's decision to hold leaders accountable for their actions, others have criticized the move as a scapegoating of individuals for systemic failures within the military's command structure. In a statement, Gurganus expressed his "profound gratitude for having had the opportunity to serve alongside so many extraordinary Marines and Sailors over the past 37 years." Sturdevant similarly expressed his gratitude, stating that he was "honored to have served alongside the courageous men and women of the United States Military." The incident at Camp Bastion remains a painful reminder of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and the sacrifices made by the men and women of the U.S. Military. While the retirement of two senior officers may provide some measure of closure for the families of the Marines who lost their lives in the attack, it remains to be seen whether any lasting changes will be made to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
