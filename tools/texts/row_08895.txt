Jihadist: Zawahiri made the claim in a video posted online, part of a series about bin Laden .

chatgpt: In a newly-released video, Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of al-Qaeda, has revealed that the notorious Osama bin Laden was once a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.  The revelation is significant, as it sheds new light on the path that led bin Laden to become one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. The Muslim Brotherhood is a global Islamist organization that is widely considered more moderate than al-Qaeda - its membership is known to include a range of Islamist academics, politicians, and activists.  It has long been known that bin Laden was once a member of the Brotherhood, but the extent of his involvement has never been fully understood. Al-Zawahiri's video provides new details on this period of bin Laden's life, and what it meant for his subsequent career as a jihadist leader.  Speaking in Arabic in the video, al-Zawahiri references a letter written by bin Laden in which he reflects on his time with the Brotherhood. According to al-Zawahiri, bin Laden wrote that the group "provided me with the practical experience and understanding I needed to approach Jihad and develop my religious and military abilities."  Al-Zawahiri suggests that the Brotherhood's emphasis on grassroots organizing and community outreach was influential in shaping bin Laden's worldview. "I learned from them the importance of mobilizing the masses and the necessity of taking power through the people," bin Laden allegedly wrote.  While the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda share a commitment to Islamic fundamentalism, the Brotherhood has historically been more open to participating in democratic processes and engaging with non-Islamist actors. Al-Zawahiri's video suggests that bin Laden's time with the Brotherhood helped to nurture these inclinations.  However, the video also makes clear that bin Laden ultimately rejected the Brotherhood's more conciliatory approach in favor of a more confrontational, militant one. "[Bin Laden] disagreed with their approach of education and graduation, and their focus on democratic participation and peaceful coexistence," al-Zawahiri says.  The video further cements al-Zawahiri's status as the leader of al-Qaeda since bin Laden's death in 2011. Al-Zawahiri took over the group following bin Laden's death, but has struggled to maintain its influence amid competition from other jihadist groups, such as ISIS.  Experts say that the revelation about bin Laden's Brotherhood membership is unlikely to have a major impact on global terrorism, but could be significant in terms of historical understanding of al-Qaeda and the broader Islamist movement. "It gives us a better sense of the intellectual origins of someone like bin Laden, and where he was coming from when he made the decisions that ultimately resulted in 9/11," says terrorism expert Thomas Hegghammer.  The video is also notable for its timing, coming amid a period of political turbulence in the Middle East. Al-Qaeda and its affiliates have been active in the region since the early 2000s, and have recently sought to capitalize on the chaos of the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Al-Zawahiri's video may be intended to rally supporters and draw attention to al-Qaeda as a viable alternative to groups like ISIS, which have garnered more media attention of late. Whether it will have that effect remains to be seen - but the revelation about bin Laden's Brotherhood membership is a reminder that the roots of al-Qaeda are complex and multifaceted, and that its ideological evolution has been shaped by a range of influences over time.
