An American Airlines flight attendant is suing the airline after allegations were made by her colleagues that she had smuggled her pet rats inside her underwear and pantyhose onto an international flight. Long Island flight attendant Louann Giambattista, 55, says the accusations have resulted in her being blacklisted by customs for more than a year. The 33-year industry veteran is seeking damages for 'debilitating anxiety' and post-traumatic stress disorder from the airline. Suing: Louann Giambattista was routinely scrutinized by customs officials after colleagues alleged she smuggled rats onto planes in her pants . Ratted out: Louann Giambattista's colleagues told ICE officials they suspected she had smuggled rats onboard an American Airlines flight in her underwear and hosiery . In February 2012, a pilot reported that Giambattista had 'a bulge in [her] pocket' and saw 'what he thought was a live pet,' according to papers filed in Brooklyn federal court. Another colleague reported that on a flight to Miami that same day, she saw Giambattista feeding a pet rat. Giambattista claims that the bread roll in a paper cup was not for feeding a rat but rather herself, and that the cup was to avoid looking unprofessional in front of passengers. According to the court papers, colleagues on the Miami flight smelled a rat and dobbed Giambattista in to customs officials upon landing in Florida. Rat race: As a result of the allegations of rat-smuggling, American Airlines put a flag on Giambattista's passport but wouldn't take her off international flights . She says she was questioned and had her luggage searched for more than an hour, but the agents didn't find any rats. Nevertheless, Giambattista claims the airline put a flag on her passport as a result of the accusations, meaning that every trip through customs became a lengthy ordeal and ICE agents bullied her and threatened her with a strip search, and that it became 'nearly impossible for [her] to report to work.' Rat-finks: Despite Giambattista's colleague's claims, no rats were ever found about her person . According to the New York Post, Giambattista is an admitted animal lover, but her lawyer says she knows there's a time and a place for pets. 'Everybody has pets - she has her pets at home, not at work,' Stephen Morelli said. 'She’s not a nut. They’re making her out to be a nut.' 'She’s got a lot of different pets. She had the rat - it died.' Giambattista told the Post that the claims she smuggled a rat on board a flight are 'absurd' and 'patently false'. 'There was no reason for it,' she said. 'People say, "There must have been a reason" but there was none.' She says she was made an example of in front of colleagues and questioned in a communal break room where other colleagues could witness her interrogation.

chatgpt: A former American Airlines flight attendant is suing the carrier for an undisclosed amount after being blacklisted by US Customs for over a year. Louann Giambattista, 55, was accused of smuggling pet rats onto a flight last year, but no rats were found. The incident began in February 2019 when Giambattista boarded a flight from St. Martin to Miami. A passenger allegedly saw her stow a small bag under a seat and heard scratching sounds coming from it. The passenger reported their suspicions to the captain, who notified authorities upon landing. The plane was searched, but no rats were found. However, Giambattista was questioned by Customs and Border Protection officers for several hours before being released. She was then placed on a blacklist, preventing her from traveling outside the US for over a year. Giambattista claims that she suffered severe stress and anxiety as a result of the incident, which prompted her to file the lawsuit against American Airlines. She says that the airline failed to provide her with proper training on how to handle situations like these and did not do enough to defend her reputation after the incident. In the lawsuit, Giambattista also alleges that American Airlines did not properly investigate the passenger's allegations, and instead relied on them as the sole basis for blacklisting her from travel. "Ms. Giambattista was subjected to severe emotional distress and embarrassment as a result of American Airlines' wrongful and malicious conduct," the lawsuit states. An American Airlines spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing company policy not to discuss pending legal matters. However, the airline previously stated that it had followed standard procedures in the case and had cooperated fully with Customs and Border Protection. Giambattista's lawyer, Stephen Morelli, said that the lawsuit is not just about damages but also seeks to bring attention to the issue of employee mistreatment by airlines. "This case is about making sure that airlines are held accountable for the way they treat their employees," Morelli said. "We're confident that the evidence will demonstrate the airline's wrongdoing." The case is set to go to trial next year, and if Giambattista prevails, it could have implications for how airlines handle similar incidents involving their employees in the future. In the meantime, Giambattista is still seeking compensation for the emotional toll that the incident took on her, and hoping to clear her name in the eyes of authorities and the public. "I did nothing wrong, and yet I suffered immensely because of American Airlines' actions," she said. "I just want justice and closure."
