article: (CNN) -- What's that in the sky? Is it an asteroid? A comet? A lawn sprinkler? Turns out a newly discovered object is a little bit of all three -- minus the fact that you won't find many green lawns millions of miles from Earth -- NASA announced Friday. "We were literally dumbfounded when we saw it," David Jewitt, who leads the team exploring the "asteroid with six comet-like tails of dust radiating from it like spokes on a wheel." "It" is P/2013 P5, which NASA described as an "unusually fuzzy-looking object" when it was spotted in August in our solar system's asteroid belt. The Hubble Space Telescope then focused on it, photographing it first in early September and then again 13 days later. By then, it looked completely different -- as if it had done a 180-degree flip, NASA said. "Its tail structures change dramatically ... as it belches out dust," Jewitt, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said in a news release. "That also caught us by surprise. It's hard to believe we're looking at an asteroid." Satellite falling to Earth . The first-of-its-kind discovery "completely knocked out" astounded astronomers, he added. Perhaps just as exciting is the expectation that this "amazing object (is) almost certainly the first of many to come." As Jewitt said: "In astronomy, where you find one, you eventually find a whole bunch more." The giant rock is about 1,400 feet wide and probably reaches surface temperatures of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. For that reason, NASA thinks it's made of rock and not ice, like a typical comet is. Tens of billions of planets out there are like Earth . The streams of dust were ejected six times between April and September -- something that the NASA team members believe might have been caused by the asteroid spinning so fast that its surface, at times, broke apart. NASA is still watching P/2013 P5 -- which Jewitt says apparently is a fragment of a bigger asteroid that broke off approximately 200 million years ago -- to figure out exactly why it's doing what it's doing. One theory is that this is one way that asteroids die. The full findings were published on November 7 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Big asteroid past Earth and will again in 19 years .

chatgpt: The Hubble Space Telescope, one of the most powerful telescopes in the world, has recently uncovered a fascinating object in the asteroid belt of the solar system. To the surprise of astronomers, the object is not just another lifeless asteroid, but one with six comet-like tails of dust radiating from it.  "We were literally dumbfounded when we saw it," said lead astronomer David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles. "It's hard to believe we're looking at an asteroid. We were completely blown away."  Jewitt and his team have been studying the object, known as P/2013 P5, since its discovery in September 2013. The telescope's high-resolution images have revealed details never before seen in an asteroid.  The six tails that emanate from P/2013 P5 are not equally spaced but appear to originate from a single point on the asteroid's surface. The tails themselves are narrow and curved, giving the asteroid a stunningly beautiful appearance.  The discovery of such a strange object has raised many questions among astronomers. One theory is that P/2013 P5 is showing signs of disintegration and will eventually break apart.  "This is a unique and puzzling object," said Jewitt. "We're not sure how it formed or what its future will be. One possibility is that it's what happens to asteroids before they die, but we need more observations to say for sure."  The discovery of P/2013 P5 offers a glimpse into the complex and unpredictable nature of the universe. "It's amazing to think that there is still so much we don't understand about our own solar system, let alone the cosmos beyond," said Jewitt.  The Hubble Space Telescope has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the universe. Since its launch in 1990, the telescope has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the existence of dark energy and the discovery of exoplanets.  The discovery of P/2013 P5 is yet another reminder of the significance of investing in scientific research and exploration. As we continue to explore the cosmos, we are sure to uncover more fascinating and unexpected objects like P/2013 P5.  The Hubble Space Telescope will continue to study P/2013 P5 and other objects in the asteroid belt to unlock the mysteries of our solar system and beyond. With each new discovery, we come one step closer to unraveling the secrets of the universe.
