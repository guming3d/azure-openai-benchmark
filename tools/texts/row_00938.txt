article: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A gay man expelled from the Boy Scouts in 2003 said Monday he misses being a scout but has no regrets. "There is no bitterness in my heart against these people," Greg Lattera said in an interview following his court appearance. "They are still an organization that gave me the core values as to who I am." Lattera testified Monday at the federal court case filed by the Boy Scouts of America attempting to keep the $1-a-year lease for their downtown Philadelphia offices. The local chapter, Cradle of Liberty Council, was told by the city to pay $200,000 a year to lease the building or vacate the headquarters that have been located on city land since 1928. The national scout policy that prohibits the hiring of gay men puts the local chapter in violation of the city charter and an ordinance outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and other grounds. The lawsuit contends the city's ultimatum violates their First Amendment rights and that the city's position is unconstitutional and violates the organization's right to free speech and equal protection. Lattera was 18 when he attended a local meeting about gays and the scouting policy. The meeting was open to the press, he said. "Here I¹m thinking this is a meeting about the policy and how I feel about it," he said. "I'm in my uniform and next thing I knew was that I was on TV." Two weeks later, on June 6, 2003, he received a letter ordering him to sever all ties with the scouts because they "received information" that led to his dismissal. "I broke down and cried," said Lattera, now 25, adding the scouts opened his eyes to the world around him and taught him life skills. "It was like a part of me was taken away." In court, Lattera answered questions about the 2003 meeting and the letter. At the time of his dismissal, Lattera was a camp counselor and held the rank of Life Scout, which is one step below the organization¹s highest rank of Eagle Scout. He joined the scouts at age 10. Lattera, who declined to name his scout troop or reveal where he resides, said scouting is about more than a building. "No matter what they say or do, it¹s not my choice," he said. "³Scouting isn¹t the building. The troops will still be there in the morning. People make the scouts." Closing arguments are expected Tuesday.

chatgpt: The local chapter of the Boy Scouts of America is fighting back against a city ordinance that they say discriminates against their policies. This comes after the chapter lost their $1-per-year office lease due to their exclusion of gay men from their organization. Greg Lattera, a former member of the Scouts who was dismissed after appearing on television following a meeting on the organization's policy, has spoken out about the importance of the Scouts in shaping his values despite his dismissal. The conflict began when the local chapter of the Boy Scouts lost their previously-held office lease due to their policy of excluding gay men from the organization. The decision was made in accordance with a city ordinance that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Scouts are now fighting back against the ordinance, arguing that their policies should not be subject to outside interference. They are seeking to regain their office space and continue operating as they have in the past. Lattera, who was dismissed from the Scouts after speaking out against their policy, has remained proud of his involvement with the organization. He credits the Scouts with giving him the core values and beliefs that have shaped his character. While the Scouts' policy on gay men has been a source of controversy in recent years, the organization remains a beloved institution in many communities across the country. Their emphasis on service, outdoor activities, and character development has helped countless young people grow into responsible adults. However, this latest conflict underscores the challenges that the Scouts face in a changing world. As public attitudes towards LGBT rights continue to shift, traditional organizations like the Scouts may find themselves at odds with the values of the broader community. Despite the conflict with the city and the loss of their office space, the local chapter of the Boy Scouts remains committed to upholding their values and continuing their important work in the community.  As the debate over LGBT rights and discrimination continues, it remains to be seen how organizations like the Scouts will adapt to a changing landscape. But for now, members like Greg Lattera will continue to cherish the lessons they learned in their time with the Scouts, regardless of the organization's policies.
