article: A dad left his five-year-old son inside his freezing cold car for two hours in the middle of the night so that he could go to a strip club, police have said. Dwayne Keith Winn, 44, left the youngster in the parking lot of B.Y.O.B Eclipse Club in Humble, Texas just before 3am on Sunday and headed inside, police said. A security guard doing checks on the parking lot noticed the young boy inside the car, but thought he was a young woman. Just after 5am, the guard noticed the person was still inside the car and on closer inspection, he noticed that it was a child. Arrest: Dwayne Keith Winn, 44, allegedly left his young son in his car while he went to a strip club in Houston, Texas in the early hours of Sunday. The boy was found shivering inside two hours later . Captain Wally Wieghat with the Precinct 4 Constable's Office told Click2Houston that the child had been in the car for more than two hours in almost 40-degree temperatures. 'He was cold and he was shivering and he was hungry, one of the officers went and bought food for him,' Wieghat said. Guards found Winn inside the club and tried to question him but he ran off, Wieghat said . When he eventually returned, he told officers that he had only been using the restroom in the club and had been there for around 15 minutes. But security guards at the club take a time stamp photo of patrons' ID cards and Winn was found to have entered the club at 3am and left after 5am, Click2Houston reported. Found: A security guard checking the parking lot, pictured, found the young boy shivering and hungry at 5am . Inside: The 44-year-old father claimed he went to the club, pictured, to use the restroom but investigations revealed he had actually been inside for two hours. He was arrested and remains in jail . 'I hesitate to think how it could have ended up and just thank the good Lord it did not end that way,' Wieghart said. Winn was charged with abandoning a child with intention to return and remains in the Harris County jail on $15,000 bond. If convicted, he could face a $10,000 fine as well as a jail term ranging from 180 days to two years. At the time, the boy's mother was at home with another baby. The five-year-old boy has been released to relatives and the Children's Protective Services will check on the home, officials said. See below for video .

chatgpt: Dwayne Keith Winn, a 44-year-old father from Humble, Texas, was arrested on Sunday and charged with abandoning his son in the parking lot of a local club. The incident took place at 3am on Sunday when a security guard at the club spotted the young boy, who appeared to be shivering and hungry. Winn initially claimed that he had only gone inside the club to use the restroom. However, the security guard noticed that Winn's ID card had been time-stamped two hours before. This led the authorities to conclude that Winn had abandoned his child in the parking lot, intending to return later. The incident has sparked outrage among the community, with many residents expressing shock and disgust at Winn's behavior. It is not yet clear why Winn chose to leave his child in the parking lot of a club, particularly at such a late hour. Some locals have speculated that he may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time. Winn is now facing charges of abandoning a child with intention to return. If convicted, he could face significant jail time and fines. Tragically, this is not the first time that a parent has been accused of abandoning a child in Texas. Earlier this year, a woman was arrested after leaving her two children in a hot car while she went shopping. Thankfully, both children were ultimately rescued and are now in the custody of child protective services. While incidents like these are shocking and distressing, they also highlight the importance of community vigilance and intervention. In the case of Winn, it was the quick thinking of a security guard that helped to ensure the safety of his young son. Without this intervention, the outcome could have been much more dire. As Texas continues to grapple with issues of child safety and parental responsibility, it is crucial that individuals and organizations remain vigilant and proactive in protecting children from harm. By working together, we can ensure that all children have the safe and nurturing environments they need to thrive and grow.
