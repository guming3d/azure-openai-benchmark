article: ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to meet in their capacity as the sole shareholders of the corporation that manages their iconic father's estate. Dexter King has denied taking "substantial funds" from his parents' estates. King's children were in Fulton County, Georgia, Superior Court Monday in a dispute over their parents' estates. Two children of the civil rights icon are suing their brother, accusing him of wrongfully taking money from their parents' estates. The Rev. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III allege Dexter King took "substantial funds" out of Coretta Scott King's estate and "wrongfully appropriated" money from their father's estate. Dexter King has publicly denied the accusations. It was unclear what outcome having a shareholder meeting for the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr., Inc. would have on the dispute. The three siblings have not held such a meeting since 2004, corporation attorney Luke Lantta said. The removal of Dexter King as the estate's administrator is unlikely because that would require a meeting of the board of directors. Judge Ural Glanville on Monday also ruled in favor of dismissing some of the allegations against Dexter King, but left the question of whether he failed to act in the best interest of his father's incorporated estate to a jury. A trial on the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty could happen as early as next month. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King were in the courtroom Monday, but Dexter King was not. He had been injured in an accident in California and did not make the trip to Georgia. Dexter King had filed a counter claim against his sister, asking the court to force her to hand over to the corporation some items that belonged to Martin Luther King Jr. In a special hearing Monday, the court ruled that the items, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s Nobel Peace Prize and his love letters to Coretta Scott King will be turned over to the court to hold until a resolution is reached. The courtroom was packed with supporters of the King family. Among those in attendance were the Rev. Joseph Lowery and former Ambassador Andrew Young, friends of Martin Luther King Jr. who worked with him during the civil rights movement. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Atlanta, Georgia - The King family is once again embroiled in a legal battle as two of Martin Luther King Jr.'s children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, have accused their brother, Dexter King, of taking money from the estates of their late parents. However, Dexter has strongly denied such claims. The dispute, which is playing out in a Georgia court, centers around the estates of Coretta Scott King and her husband, the world-renowned civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Dexter, who is the executor of the estates, has been accused of mismanaging funds and making unauthorized payments to himself. Bernice and Martin Luther King III have claimed that their brother has not been transparent about the details of his management of the estates. They allege that he has violated the trust agreements and fiduciary duties that were established to ensure that funds were properly managed and distributed according to their parents' wishes. The allegations have caused tension within the King family and even resulted in a courthouse showdown, with civil rights icons like Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson turning up in support of the sibling accusers. In contrast, Dexter King attended the legal hearing with his wife, Leah Weber King. The family dispute reportedly arose from a 2007 settlement agreement in which the siblings agreed to allow Dexter to serve as the executor of the estates, in exchange for a share of the profits earned from the estates. Mostly, they agreed to have their mother's archives preserved at Morehouse College. The current dispute, however, centers around what the siblings believe to be an abuse of that trust. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III are seeking to have their brother removed as executor and replaced with an independent trustee to ensure the estates are properly managed. Dexter King, however, strongly defended his actions, stating that his management of the estates has always been legal and above board. He claims that his siblings are simply trying to oust him for personal gain. "Dexter believes that these claims are frivolous and are without merit," said William Hill Jr, Dexter's lawyer. The legal battle between the King siblings is ongoing, and the case is expected to drag on for some time. Meanwhile, the civil rights icons who have rallied around the family have called for a peaceful resolution to the dispute so that the King legacy can continue to inspire future generations.
