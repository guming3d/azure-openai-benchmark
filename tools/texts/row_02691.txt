article: By . Richard Arrowsmith for MailOnline . Not only did Petr Cech get dropped for Chelsea's opening Premier League game against Burnley but, to add insult to exclusion, the keeper's name was misspelt as a substitute on the official team sheet. Jose Mourinho has chosen to start with the returning Thibaut Courtois for Monday evening's game at Turf Moor, casting doubt over the 32-year-old's future at Stamford Bridge. Having collected three Premier League titles and the Champions League during his time in west London,you might think the Czech Republic keeper would be a recognisable name to most. Scroll down for video... Oops! Petr Cech had his name spelt wrongly on the Burnley team sheet ahead of Chelsea's opening game . Lost in translation: The Blues goalkeeper was one of several players to have his name misspelt . However, some confusion at the Clarets home saw the team sheet delivered bearing the name 'PETR CHECH'. At least the Blues legend can rest assured that the slight was nothing personal as new signing Felipe Luis' name was also misspelt to 'PHILIPE LUIS' and Cesar Azpilicueta was as wrongly transcribed as 'AZPILCUETA' - while the 'h' was omitted from John Obi Mikel's first name. Paris Saint Germain are monitoring Cech's situation at Chelsea with reports they are interested in taking him to Ligue 1, despite Mourinho insisting he can keep both stoppers happy this season. New kid on the block: Jose Mourinho has chosen to start with Thibaut Courtois in goal . Mourinho said: ‘We are Chelsea. We can have two of three best goalkeepers in the world at the club. We can. We are economically stable. 'We can have Diego Costa, Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres, so we can have Courtois and Cech. I can have Ramires, Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar, yet I cannot have two top goalkeepers? 'I can. Chelsea can as a club, and I can as a manager.'

chatgpt: Chelsea's goalkeeper Petr Cech has been left out of the team for their opening match against Burnley on Monday. Manager Jose Mourinho opted for Thibaut Courtois instead, a decision that came as a surprise to many fans. Cech has been Chelsea's starting goalkeeper for over a decade but Courtois, who spent three years on loan at Atletico Madrid, has returned to the club and has impressed Mourinho during pre-season. The young goalkeeper is regarded as one of the best in the world, and his selection for the opening match signals Mourinho's confidence in his abilities. However, Cech's absence from the starting lineup was not the only surprise on Monday. The official team sheet listed Cech, Felipe Luis, and John Obi-Mikel's names with spelling errors, an embarrassing mistake from the Chelsea staff. Meanwhile, PSG are reportedly interested in signing Cech, who has been a mainstay for Chelsea since joining the club in 2004. The French club have been actively seeking a goalkeeper this summer after losing Salvatore Sirigu to Torino, and Cech could be an ideal addition to their squad. Despite the rumors, Chelsea have not yet given any indication that they are willing to sell Cech. The Czech goalkeeper still has two years left on his current contract and remains a valuable member of the squad. Chelsea went on to win the match 3-1 against Burnley, with Courtois making a number of impressive saves. Mourinho praised the young goalkeeper's performance after the game, stating that "he showed why he is one of the best in the world." As for Cech, his future with Chelsea remains uncertain. While he could still play a significant role in the squad, it's clear that Courtois is now the club's first choice goalkeeper. Whether the PSG rumors will lead to a transfer remains to be seen, but for now, Cech will have to wait for his chance to regain his starting position.
