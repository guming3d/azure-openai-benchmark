article: (CNN) -- Cesc Fabregas is returning to London and the English Premier League after the Spain international signed for Chelsea from Barcelona Thursday. The midfielder, who started his career with Barcelona, spent eight years with Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal between 2003 and 2011, before rejoining the Catalan club. "Firstly I'd like to thank everyone at Barcelona where I enjoyed three wonderful years," said Fabregas, who has joined Chelsea on a five-year contract, in a statement on the club's website. "It was my childhood club and I'll always be proud and honored that I had a chance to play for such a great team," added the 27-year-old, who is on World Cup duty with Spain in Brazil. Chelsea finished third last season, securing the EPL's third European Champions League automatic qualifying spot. In manager Jose Mourinho's first season back in charge at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea also reached the Champions League semifinals before being knocked out by Atletico Madrid. Fabregas' arrival gives Mourinho a wealth of midfield talent, given Chelsea's Portuguese manager already has Eden Hazard, Oscar, Ramires, Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel at his disposal. "I do feel that I have unfinished business in the Premier League and now is the right time to return," said Fabregas, who played over 300 games for Arsenal during his first spell in England but won just one trophy -- the FA Cup in 2005. "I considered all the other offers very carefully and I firmly believe that Chelsea is the best choice. They match my footballing ambitions with their hunger and desire to win trophies. "They have an amazing squad of players and an incredible manager. I'm fully committed to this team and I can't wait to start playing." Barcelona, which failed to retain the Spanish title last season, issued a statement thanking Fabregas for his "professionalism and dedication" during his time at the Nou Camp. The Spanish club will reportedly receive an upfront payment of $45.4 million for Fabregas, though the transfer fee could rise with contractual add-ons. Chelsea are also reportedly keen to sign another La Liga player -- Atletico Madrid's Spain international striker Diego Costa.

chatgpt: Chelsea Football Club has announced the signing of Cesc Fabregas on a five-year deal. The Spanish midfielder is moving back to London for the second time after making a switch from Barcelona.  Fabregas, who is currently in Brazil for the World Cup with Spain, expressed his excitement over the move as he hopes to win trophies with Chelsea after a disappointing season in Spain with Barcelona.  The 27-year-old midfielder who was a key player in Arsenal before joining Barcelona in 2011 admitted that he had to leave the Camp Nou for more playing time. Fabregas who once captained Arsenal at 21 is expected to play a major role in Chelsea’s midfield. “I believe that his vast experience makes him a valuable addition to our squad. As a player, Cesc has proved his worth time and again, and his technical ability is beyond doubt,” said Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho after the signing was announced. Fabregas becomes the first signing for Chelsea this summer as Jose Mourinho is expected to bolster his squad ahead of next season's campaign. His arrival at Stamford Bridge could see the departure of Frank Lampard, who is currently a free agent. Fabregas spent three years at Arsenal, where he won the FA Cup and played a vital role in the team. He moved to Barcelona in 2011, where he helped the Catalan giants to win the La Liga title in 2012. He played a pivotal role in Spain’s World Cup triumph in 2010 with an impressive performance in the final against Netherlands. Fabregas also played a key role in their successful defense of the European Championships in 2012. With Fabregas now in Chelsea’s midfield, the team is expected to challenge for the Premier League and the Champions League trophies next season. Despite finishing third last season, Chelsea is known for its strong midfield and attack, and Fabregas’ signing would be a major coup for the Blues. As the announcement of his signing was made, Chelsea fans expressed their excitement for the return of Fabregas to London. It’s expected that he will play his first game for Chelsea during the pre-season tour in July.
