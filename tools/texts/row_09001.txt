article: Hillary Clinton got back at a heckler who interrupted her with a bullhorn on Sunday by making a joke about his mental health. Clinton was giving a speech on early childhood development to the American Academy of Pediatrics in San Diego, California, when an unidentified man set off an alarm on the noise-amplifying device and began shouting at her. 'You know there are some people who miss important developmental stages,' Clinton facetiously told the 3,000 or so pediatricians listening to the speech after the man was hauled out by security. Hillary Clinton was interrupted during remarks on Sunday in San Diego, California, by a heckler with a bullhorn. Clinton winced, made a joke about the heckler's mental health, then went on with her speech . The unidentified heckler can been seen in this photo, taken from a video of the event, hollering at Clinton as he is led out by security . It was not immediately clear what the individual who made the disturbance was upset up about as he did not make his case through the bullhorn. Clinton was at the event to announce a partnership between the Clinton Foundation and the Academy, according to The Hill. As part of the foundation's To Small to Fail program, Clinton said, it would work with the Academy to encourage parents to begin reading to their children at a young age. The former secretary of state and presumed 2016 presidential candidate is no stranger to heckling at her speaking events. At an event last October in New York, a man began harassing Clinton about her involvement in the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. 'Benghazi, Benghazi, you let them die!' he shouted at her. Clinton responded to that man with a lecture on democracy and appropriate behavior in a civil society. 'We have to be willing to come together as citizens to focus on the kind of future we want, which doesn't include yelling, it includes sitting down and talking with one another,' she said. At an April event in Las Vegas, Nevada, Clinton was memorably accosted by a woman wearing a blonde wig. The woman threw a black and orange athletic shoe at Clinton for inexplicable reasons. Clinton responded to that incident lightheartedly. She ducked the flying object and made a Vegas-themed joke. 'Is that somebody throwing something at me?' she asked the 1,000 person audience at the event sponsored by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. 'Is that part of Cirque de Soleil?' she said, referring to the popular acrobatic group that performs in Vegas and at other venues across the country. 'My goodness, I didn’t know that solid waste management was so controversial,' she continued. 'Thank goodness she didn’t play softball like I did.'

chatgpt: On Saturday, Hilary Clinton was speaking at the American Academy of Pediatrics convention in San Diego, California when an unexpected incident occurred. During her speech on early childhood development, a man disrupted the event by setting off an alarm on a noise-amplifying device and began shouting at Clinton. As the commotion escalated, security stepped in and removed the man from the room. Once the man was escorted out, Clinton joked with the crowd, saying, "You know there are some people who miss important developmental stages." Despite the incident, Clinton continued to deliver her message to the audience about the significance of early childhood development. She highlighted the importance of investing in children's health and education, particularly during their formative years when they are most receptive to learning. Clinton has been a longtime advocate for children's rights and education reform. She has been a vocal proponent of expanding access to pre-kindergarten programs, increasing funding for public schools, and improving teacher training and support.  Her speech to the AAP was seen as an opportunity to build support for these initiatives, and she used the platform to call on pediatricians to become more engaged in advocacy efforts aimed at promoting the welfare of children. In her speech, Clinton also acknowledged the challenges faced by many American families, such as inadequate access to quality healthcare and education, as well as the impact of poverty on child development. Despite these challenges, Clinton remained resolute in her belief that all children have the potential to succeed, and that with the right support and resources, they can thrive both inside and outside the classroom. The incident at the AAP convention is the latest in a string of unexpected disruptions targeted at Clinton. During the 2016 presidential campaign, she was also interrupted by protesters at several campaign events, including one event in Nevada where a group of animal rights activists stormed the stage. Despite these disruptions, Clinton remains committed to promoting her message of progress and change. With her advocacy for children's rights and education, she continues to inspire and empower individuals to take action and fight for the issues they believe in.
