article: Sorry, "bae." The noun -- a " term of endearment for one's romantic partner" -- was shown no love by Oxford Dictionaries, which instead selected "vape" as the 2014 word of the year. "Vape" can be used as either a noun meaning "an electronic cigarette or similar device" or a verb in which one would "inhale and exhale the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device." According to a press release from Oxford, research showed the use of the word "vape" more than doubled in 2014 over the previous year. Couple that with the growth of electronic cigarettes into a multimillion dollar industry and the Oxford editors decided that the word's time had come. "A gap emerged in the lexicon, as a word was needed to describe this activity, and distinguish it from 'smoking','" the Oxford press release says. "The word vape arose to fill this gap, and it has proliferated along with the habit." Oxford's lexicographers grapple every year with a list of potential winners. Last year, "selfie" -- "a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website" -- trumped "bitcoin" and "twerk" to take the honor. In addition to "vape" and "bae," this year's shortlist included: . budtender, noun: . A person whose job is to serve customers in a cannabis dispensary or shop . contactless, adjective: . Relating to or involving technologies that allow a smart card, mobile phone etc. to contact wirelessly to an electronic reader, typically in order to make a payment . indyref, noun: . The referendum on Scottish independence, held in Scotland on September 18, 2014, in which voters were asked to answer yes or no to the question "Should Scotland be an independent country?" normcore, noun: . A trend in which ordinary, unfashionable clothing is worn as a deliberate fashion statement . slacktivism, noun, informal: . Actions performed via the Internet in support of a political or social cause but regarded as requiring little time or involvement, e.g. signing an online petition or joining a campaign group on a social media website .
highlights: The word "vape" grew in use over last year . Oxford says it "arose to fill" a gap . The word beat out "bae" and "normcore"

chatgpt: According to the latest report from Oxford Dictionaries, the word "vape" was one of the fastest-growing and most popular new entries in their language database last year. The report defines this term as "the action or practice of inhaling and exhaling the vapor produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device". However, why did the word "vape" increase in popularity, and what does this mean for society as a whole? Oxford's report suggests that "vape" arose to fill a gap in the English language, specifically describing the act of smoking electronic cigarettes. This trend began to gain a significant surge in popularity towards the end of 2014, and it's only continued to grow since then. With numerous international debates surrounding the use of e-cigarettes, it's unsurprising that individuals are searching for a specific term to describe their usage accurately. Moreover, Oxford’s report revealed that “vape” easily defeated popular terms like “bae,” which means "before anyone else," and "normcore," meaning a style that is purposely unremarkable. While such terms have become popular amongst millennials, they don't seem to have the same staying power as "vape." The rise of the word "vape" in Oxford's digital database up until 2019 is notable, considering that it was not even a recognized word by the dictionary before the 2014 campaign. This trend demonstrates the power of language and how it adapts to popular culture. However, it's worthwhile to note that while the term "vape," and the usage of e-cigarettes, may be on the rise, this has not come without criticism. Many experts claim that vaping can be dangerous, especially to young people, where starter kits are readily available, and the flavors are appealing to minors. Some have even called for tighter regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes and other related smoking products. In conclusion, the growth of the word "vape" is a reflection of the shift in society towards a more health-conscious, technologically advanced culture. However, it’s also essential to remember the potential dangers associated with this trend. As language continues to evolve, it's imperative that we stay vigilant and considerate of the consequences associated with our actions, whether it be through our choice of words or our habits.
