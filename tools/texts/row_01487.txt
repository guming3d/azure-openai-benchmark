article: By . Richard  Shears . Ewen Geoffrey Peter, 68, has been arrested in Cambodia on sex charges . A British man who ran website for 'best Thai woman' in Devon has been arrested in Cambodia on sex charges. Officials named the man as 68-year-old Geoffrey Peter Ewen, although Cambodian police are known to often get the names of foreigners muddled. The Briton was arrested in the southern resort of Sihanoukville on charges which include filming her naked against her will. ‘He confessed that he sexually assaulted his girlfriend and produced pornography,’ provincial deputy police chief Mam Makal told the Cambodia Daily website. A Cambodian website used by expatriates claimed that the man had also hired a Vietnamese woman for sex and that police believed the video was being shot for commercial purposes. According to police, Peter has been a regular visitor to Cambodia. He was said to have met his alleged victim, a 20-year-old woman, at the Dream Bar in Sihanoukville, a drinking establishment which claims to have the ‘most beautiful girls in Sihanoukville’,and where a draft beer sells for just 75 cents. They began a sexual relationship, but a week later the woman went to police. She claimed that she had caught Peter videoing her as she left the bathroom naked - and that he had used a sex toy against her will while they were having sex. Mr Makal said police raided the guesthouse where the Briton was staying and seized a computer, camera, sex toys and a generic form of Viagra.

chatgpt: Authorities in Cambodia have arrested a 68-year-old British man named Geoffrey Peter Ewen in the southern resort of Sihanoukville, according to officials. Ewen has been accused of committing a crime, although no details have been provided by authorities as yet. The arrest occurred on Sunday, and the authorities have not yet released any statement about the circumstances surrounding the arrest. It is also unclear where Ewen is currently being held, and whether or not he has been formally charged. Sihanoukville is a popular tourist destination in Cambodia, known for its stunning beaches and relaxed atmosphere. The town is located in the southwestern part of the country, about 185 km from the capital city, Phnom Penh. This is not the first time that a foreign national has been arrested in Sihanoukville. In recent years, the town has become the site of several high-profile crimes involving foreigners, including drug trafficking and money laundering. The local authorities have been cracking down on crime in the area, and have made several arrests in recent months. However, the presence of foreign criminals in the town has had a negative impact on the local economy and has led to concerns about the safety of tourists visiting the area. The British Embassy in Phnom Penh has not yet commented on the arrest of Ewen. However, they have warned British nationals traveling to Cambodia to exercise caution and be aware of the risks associated with visiting the country. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to parts of Cambodia due to the risk of kidnapping and crime. British nationals are also advised to avoid political gatherings and demonstrations, and to be cautious when using public transport. Ewen's arrest comes at a time when relations between Cambodia and the UK are strained. The two countries have been at odds over the issue of human rights, with the UK government expressing concern about Cambodia's recent crackdown on freedom of expression and the press. In recent months, the Cambodian government has closed down several independent media outlets and arrested journalists and activists. The country's main opposition party was also banned and its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested on charges of treason. The UK government has been vocal in its criticism of these actions, and has called for the release of those who have been detained. The arrest of Ewen is likely to further strain relations between the two countries. It is not yet clear what the outcome of Ewen's arrest will be, and whether he will be released or face a lengthy detention. However, the incident highlights the ongoing concerns about crime and security in Cambodia, and the challenges faced by the authorities in dealing with these issues.
