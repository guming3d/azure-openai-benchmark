article: Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- Starting a business is never easy, but in Tanzania, the obstacles for women can be particularly fierce. Few women hold land titles, and as a result, many don't have the necessary collateral to secure funding from a bank. Dr. Victoria Kisyombe has set out to change that. She runs SELFINA, a micro-credit institution focused on female entrepreneurs. In addition to lending, SELFINA loans women equipment to start up their businesses. "This is the era for Africa to move forward, and if Africa is moving forward, the women can move forward with it," says Kisyombe. Since launching in 2002, the company has financed more than 2,000 female-owned businesses and won a plethora of international awards, including the one from the World Economic Forum and Hillary-Clinton-backed Vital Voices. And to think, it all started with a cow. The story of Sero . Like many of the women she helps, Kisyombe struggled to get financing when first starting out. "I thought, okay, instead of chasing money through the banks, which I cannot get, I started looking at what I had ... it was a cow," she recalls. "It was that 'a-ha moment.' If a woman could have a cow like I had, she could have an asset that could generate income, then we could go around the problem of not being able to access financing." Kisyombe sold milk from her cow, Sero, in order to raise money to start her business. Ultimately, the cow even named the enterprise (SELIFINA stands for Sero Lease and Finance). Empowering women . When women become business owners, they become pillars in their communities. Betty Materimu is one such woman. SELFINA leased her sewing machines, and Materimu used them to launch her own dressmaking enterprise. "She has created a number of jobs for fellow Tanzanians," says Kisyombe. "Women and men alike." By offering loans to women in a range of industries, SELFINA is effecting change throughout Tanzania, though Kisyombe envisions the women she supports will have a global impact. Many of her charges have started exporting their products across the border. Take Chiku Shumari, a local farmer who, among other things, has started growing cashew nuts for export. Shumari is also hoping to develop a fish pond where she can farm tilapia for the local market in Dar Es Salaam. "(These steps) may look small, but actually the impact is huge," says Kisyombe. Ultimately, she sees SELFINA encouraging women in a broader context than business. "Some of our women now are even qualifying for political positions," she notes. Starting young . The key to empowerment, Kisyombe believes, is education, and to that end, she raised money to build the Mukuza Girl's Secondary School in Dar Es Salaam. The school has 129 students, and provides room and board so the girls can have their own space to study and learn. "They are given an equal opportunity to become economically empowered, socially empowered and politically empowered," she says. Video: Entrepreneur fights energy poverty .

chatgpt: Victoria Kisyombe, a Tanzanian entrepreneur, has found a unique solution to the problem of financial inclusion for women in her country. Many women in Tanzania, particularly those in rural areas, do not have collateral to secure loans from traditional banks. This can make it difficult for them to start or grow a business, which in turn limits their economic opportunities. In response to this challenge, Kisyombe founded SELFINA, a micro-credit institution that provides small loans to female entrepreneurs. SELFINA, which stands for Sustainable Enterprises for Livelihood Finance in Tanzania, has helped thousands of women start and grow businesses that they might not have been able to otherwise. Kisyombe's inspiration for SELFINA came from an unlikely source: her own cow, Sero. Kisyombe purchased Sero with a small loan from a local bank, and the cow provided her family with a steady source of milk and income. Kisyombe saw the potential for other women to use similar small loans to start businesses and improve their livelihoods. Today, SELFINA serves women in 31 regions across Tanzania. The institution provides loans ranging from $100 to $10,000, with interest rates that vary depending on the borrower's creditworthiness. SELFINA also provides business training and mentorship to its borrowers, helping them develop the skills they need to succeed. The impact of SELFINA has been significant. According to Kisyombe, 80% of the loans are repaid on time, and the institution has helped more than 20,000 women start or expand businesses. These businesses range from small-scale farming operations to food production and retail. Many of the women who have benefitted from SELFINA's loans have also been able to hire additional employees, creating jobs and boosting local economies. Kisyombe's work with SELFINA has earned her numerous accolades and recognition. She has been named a Schwab Foundation Social Entrepreneur of the Year and a Vital Voices Global Trailblazer, among other honors. She has also been invited to address global leaders on the importance of financial inclusion and women's empowerment. While Kisyombe's work with SELFINA has made a significant impact in Tanzania, she recognizes that there is still much to be done. Many women in the country still lack access to basic financial services, and social and cultural barriers can make it difficult for them to start or grow businesses. However, Kisyombe remains committed to her mission, and she sees a bright future for female entrepreneurs in Tanzania. Overall, the story of Victoria Kisyombe and SELFINA serves as an inspiring example of entrepreneurship and social impact. By identifying a need in her community and developing a creative solution, Kisyombe has helped countless women achieve financial independence and improve their quality of life. As we continue to grapple with issues of economic inequality and social justice, her work offers a powerful model for making a difference in the world.
