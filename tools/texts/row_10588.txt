article: (CNN) -- Forget Disneyland! Costa Rica is the happiest place in the world, according to an independent research group in Britain with the goal of building a new economy, "centered on people and the environment." Costa Rica is known for its lush rain forests and pristine beaches. In a report released Saturday, the group ranks nations using the "Happy Planet Index," which seeks countries with the most content people. In addition to happiness, the index by the New Economics Foundation considers the ecological footprint and life expectancy of countries. "Costa Ricans report the highest life satisfaction in the world and have the second-highest average life expectancy of the new world (second to Canada)," the organization said in a statement. They "also have an ecological footprint that means that the country only narrowly fails to achieve the goal of ... consuming its fair share of the Earth's natural resources." The Central American country, tucked between Nicaragua and Panama, touts its lush rain forests and pristine beaches. Its president, Oscar Arias Sanchez, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for trying to help end civil wars in several Central American countries. This year's survey, which looked at 143 countries, featured Latin American nations in nine of the Top 10 spots. The runner-up was the Dominican Republic, followed by Jamaica, Guatemala and Vietnam. Most developed nations lagged in the study. While Britain ranked 74th, the United States snagged the 114th spot, because of its hefty consumption and massive ecological footprint. The United States was greener and happier 20 years ago than it is today, the report said. Other populous nations, such as China and India, had a lower index brought on by their vigorous pursuit of growth-based models, the survey suggested. "As the world faces the triple crunch of deep financial crisis, accelerating climate change and the looming peak in oil production, we desperately need a new compass to guide us," said Nic Marks, founder of the foundation's center for well-being. Marks urged nations to make a collective global change before "our high-consuming lifestyles plunge us into the chaos of irreversible climate change." The report, which was first conducted in 2006, covers 99 percent of the world population, the statement said.

chatgpt: Costa Rica has been officially recognized as the "happiest" place in the world, beating out the Dominican Republic to claim the title. An independent British group conducted a study and claimed that Costa Ricans have the highest life satisfaction in the world.  The Central American nation has consistently been praised for its environmentally-friendly practices, which are believed to contribute significantly to its people's overall happiness. Costa Rica boasts an impressive commitment to renewable energy sources and eco-friendly policies, which have gained recognition around the world.  The concept of happiness has been widely debated in recent years, with different definitions being applied depending on culture, geography, and socioeconomic status. However, the study conducted by the British group aimed to find an entirely objective measure of happiness, based on criteria like health, social support, freedom, and, most importantly, overall life satisfaction.  According to the study, Costa Rica scored well in all areas, with locals reporting high levels of happiness and a strong sense of community. The country's commitment to environmental sustainability was also highlighted as a contributing factor, with the report citing Costa Rica's renewable energy sources and biodiversity as central to its citizens' happiness.  Locals are understandably delighted by the recognition. "We have always known that we live in a special place," said Maria, a local resident of San Jose. "We have nature, we have peace, and we have happiness. Costa Rica is truly a unique country, and now the world knows it," she added.  The news is also likely to boost the country's tourism industry, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Costa Rica is a popular destination for eco-tourists and nature enthusiasts, with its diverse landscape of rainforests, beaches, and mountains. The country's reputation as a happy and welcoming nation is expected to draw even more visitors in the coming years.  Aside from tourism, the study's findings may have implications for policymakers around the world who are looking to improve the well-being of their citizens. Costa Rica has already made significant progress in areas like healthcare, education, and social welfare, providing a model for other countries to follow.  In conclusion, Costa Rica's status as the "happiest" place in the world is no coincidence. The country's commitment to sustainability, impressive quality of life, and warm and welcoming people are all key factors. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of the 21st century, Costa Rica's example offers a ray of hope, showing that a happy and sustainable society is possible to achieve.
