article: (CNN) -- After dealing a walloping blow to Haiti, where at least six people died and a number of homes were destroyed, Tropical Storm Tomas weakened rapidly Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 4 p.m. ET, Tomas was located about 500 miles (805 kilometers) south-southwest of Bermuda, forecasters said. It was downgraded to a tropical storm early Sunday. Its maximum sustained winds were at 60 mph (95 kph), but Tomas was not posing a threat to land. The storm was heading north-northeast at near 3 mph (6 kph). It was forecast to turn northeast or east-northeast and accelerate in the next couple of days, the Hurricane Center said in its last advisory on Tomas. Further weakening is expected, forecasters said. In Haiti, a nation still grappling with the effects of a killer earthquake and a deadly cholera outbreak this year, Tomas ruined houses and turned some streets into rivers. Six people were also killed by the storm, according to the Haitian Civil Protection Authority. January's 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed 250,000 people and left 1 million more homeless. Many of those Haitians have been living in tent camps, and aid workers had been working in recent days to move the residents to safer housing, which was difficult to find. Aid workers were already struggling to keep up with the cholera outbreak, which has killed 501 people since the first cases were reported in October. An additional 7,000 are hospitalized. The bacterial disease causes diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to deadly dehydration within hours. In Leogane, west of Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, residents waded in knee-deep water after Tomas. Box trucks got stuck in water, said relief worker Roseann Dennery of Samaritan's Purse. While the flooding receded somewhat over the weekend, the threat of waterborne disease remained a concern. "Samaritan's Purse is moving quickly to set up cholera treatment centers in areas where there currently aren't any, and where new cases are appearing as the bacteria continues to spread," Dennery said. Mudslides also remain a risk because many of the nation's mountains have been stripped of vegetation, which means rain can flow downhill relatively unimpeded, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. "We could see mudslides a week after the storm has passed," Wolf said. Tomas has also dumped more than 10 inches of rain in the Dominican Republic. Earlier, it caused extensive damage and killed 12 people on St. Lucia and also caused damage on St. Vincent. CNN's Paula Newton contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Tropical storm Tomas is expected to weaken further as it moves towards the Caribbean islands after already claiming numerous lives and causing significant damage. The storm, which has been classified as a hurricane in the past, first made landfall on the island of St. Lucia, killing 12 people and leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.  Sadly, the storm did not stop there. Tomas moved on to Haiti, where it claimed six more lives and caused flooding in some areas. Officials in Haiti are urging residents to remain vigilant and take precautions as the weakened storm system approaches. Haiti, which is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that struck earlier in the year, has been particularly hard hit by Tomas' torrential rainfall. The country's fragile infrastructure has not been able to withstand the widespread flooding that has occurred in many areas. The potentially deadly combination of high winds and heavy rainfall has prompted authorities to issue warnings across the region. Residents in areas likely to be affected by the storm have been advised to stock up on essential supplies, secure their homes and evacuate if necessary.  While the storm is expected to weaken as it moves through the Caribbean, experts are warning that the potential for dangerous conditions still exists. Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable, and residents have been advised to avoid going near the water or engaging in activities such as swimming and surfing until the storm has passed.  The arrival of tropical storm Tomas marks the latest in a long line of severe weather events that have battered the Caribbean region this year. Heavy rainfall, high winds and powerful storms have caused widespread damage and claimed numerous lives.  Despite this, many people in the region are determined to stay positive and rebuild their homes and communities in the aftermath of these tragedies. The resilience and determination of the Caribbean people in the face of adversity is one of the region's defining characteristics, and this spirit will undoubtedly help them to weather this latest storm. As Tomas continues on its path through the Caribbean, officials are urging residents to remain calm and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families. With the right measures in place, the region will hopefully weather this latest storm and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before.
