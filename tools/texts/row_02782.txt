article: (CNN) -- Twitter is giving users the bird. A cute, little, upwardly mobile bird. The social-networking company wants to be universally known by a new streamlined bird logo, replacing the scruffier bird that had symbolized Twitter since ... well, way back in 2010. "Starting today you'll begin to notice a simplified Twitter bird," Twitter said in a blog post Wednesday. "From now on, this bird will be the universally recognizable symbol of Twitter. (Twitter is the bird, the bird is Twitter.) There's no longer a need for text, bubbled typefaces, or a lowercase "t" to represent Twitter." Twitter gave no reason for the refreshed bird, which is less chubby, has fewer feathers and is angled more towards the sky than its predecessor. But jokesters in the Twittersphere, where #twitterbird was trending Wednesday, were only too happy to offer some. "About time we get a simplified #twitterbird That last one was so not 140 characters!" wrote MeetZoe. "Twitter is too young to be changing its logo. Although, now the bird is soaring," added Andrew Mager. "The new #twitterbird is the Situation of social media icons. He's all "Gym, Tweet, Laundry. What, Facebook?! Want some?!" said Sam Killermann. Last year's short-lived Twitter darling, the Bronx Zoo's Cobra, offered this: "Twitter changed its little blue bird logo! He still looks delicious...nice, I mean nice." And Adam McCombs may have spoken for many users when he tweeted, "Maybe @twitter should spend more time working on performance instead of playing with their logo." In its post, Twitter says the new bird is "crafted purely from three sets of overlapping circles â€” similar to how your networks, interests and ideas connect and intersect with peers and friends." In rather flowery rhetoric, the post goes on to say, "Whether soaring high above the Earth to take in a broad view, or flocking with other birds to achieve a common purpose, a bird in flight is the ultimate representation of freedom, hope and limitless possibility." The company on Wednesday was urging developers to switch to the new logo -- although the Twitter icon in Apple's App Store was still showing the old bird.

chatgpt: Twitter has updated its widely-recognised, beloved logo, prompting a range of reactions to the world's favourite social media platform. The little blue bird has sported a new and refreshed look, and Twitter users have had plenty to say about it. In classic fashion, the comments have come faster than you can say "retweeted." The new version of the famous bird features a "fluffier" look, with more feathers jutting out from its body, as well as a more geometric design compared to its predecessor. The colour scheme remains the same, with the iconic shade known as "Twitter blue," which has become synonymous with the company, present in the logo's background. Despite the minute change, Twitter users couldn't resist cracking a few jokes about the newly-groomed bird. Some comments include comparisons to Sesame Street's Big Bird, while others have likened it to the famous blue character known as Cookie Monster. Some users have also taken the opportunity to poke fun at the social media giant's struggles with handling misinformation and trolling. One Twitteratti wrote, "New logo, same fake news." Twitter has faced a string of challenges over the past few months, including criticism over its handling of misinformation and its role in spreading hate speech. However, despite the recent controversies, the platform remains a popular destination for people around the world to share their opinions and interact with their favourite personalities. The modification of Twitter's logo does not come as a surprise, given the company's fondness for rebranding itself every so often to signal changes to its strategy. Furthermore, Twitter's logo has evolved significantly since its inception in 2006, with various design tweaks made during the past 15 years. The social media giant is no stranger to criticism, and reactions to its latest logo update have not been any different. However, with millions of users worldwide, it is safe to say that Twitter will continue to be a feature of our digital lives as the company continues to refine its image and improve its user experience. In conclusion, Twitter's little blue bird has been made over, and the online community has not failed to notice. Unsurprisingly, Twitterverse is always happy to deliver an endless stream of jokes and comments, proving once again that the site is a never-ending source of entertainment.
