article: (CNN) -- Ask friends whether they remember the IKEA monkey, and a few may nod tentatively. The backstory: On a chilly December day in 2012, a small monkey dressed in a faux shearling coat and diaper appeared inside the doors of a Toronto IKEA store. The animal appeared frantic, racing around the parking lot and near the store. It created quite a stir. Photos soon appeared on social media, with memes not far behind. A parody Twitter account quickly gained thousands of followers. The story that emerged left the monkey's caregiver, a real-estate lawyer named Yasmin Nakhuda, in a tough spot. She had reportedly obtained the Japanese snow macaque, named Darwin, illegally when he was just over a month old. Videos on her YouTube channel provided glimpses of the next seven months, in which she described how often he ate and how much attention he required. But after Darwin's public escape and appearance, she was fined and forced to hand Darwin over to animal services. Animal services quickly turned him over to the Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary. Nakhuda vowed to get Darwin back and filed a lawsuit against the sanctuary. On Friday, a judge ruled against Nakhuda. CBC News reported the judge rejected her argument that Toronto animal services staff duped her and acted illegally by seizing Darwin. The judge also ruled that Nakhuda purchased Darwin knowing that it was illegal and lied by later saying the animal was a gift, CBC News reported. Bronwyn Iler Page became Internet famous when she was first to tweet about Darwin: "Umm saw a monkey in the ikea parking lot," alongside a photo of the wistful-looking monkey in his tiny coat. She still has posted on her Twitter bio, "I saw the monkey #Ikeamonkey." Judging from her newsfeed, Page continues to post about monkeys whenever the opportunity arises. Attorney Kevin D. Toyne said sanctuary volunteers are very happy and relieved with the decision. Toyne said Darwin is making good progress, becoming a young adult macaque instead of a small child.

chatgpt: Darwin, the adorable snow macaque, gained instant fame when he wandered into an IKEA store in December 2012. But the fame didn't end there. Animal services captured the primate and sent him to an animal sanctuary. However, this wasn't the end of Darwin's story. Yasmin Nakhuda sued the sanctuary, hoping to get her pet monkey back. Nakhuda had purchased Darwin from an exotic animal dealer for $5,000 two years prior to his IKEA adventure. She had trained him to behave like a human, dressing him up in human clothes and even feeding him with utensils. However, her pet monkey could not legally be kept in Toronto, Canada where she resided, so she kept him hidden. When Darwin became an internet sensation, he was taken by animal services and placed in Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Sunderland, Ontario. Nakhuda objected to this and filed a lawsuit against the sanctuary, making a desperate attempt to regain custody of her pet. The lawsuit centered around the issue of whether Darwin was a wild animal or a domestic pet. Nakhuda argued that Darwin was like any other domestic animal and therefore, there was no reason he could not be returned to her care. However, the sanctuary argued that Darwin was a wild animal that needed to be in a natural habitat, away from human interference. According to the sanctuary, it was the best place for Darwin to be, given that he needed space, fresh air, and proper care, which he could not get in Nakhuda's home. The case had huge implications as it forced the court to determine the definition of a wild or domestic animal. Animal welfare organizations also watched carefully as they hoped that a ruling would set a precedent for wild animal ownership rules. In the end, the court ruled against Nakhuda's attempt to reclaim Darwin, stating that the monkey was indeed a wild animal and did not belong in a human home. Darwin was to stay in the animal sanctuary where he was receiving the proper care, surrounded by his own kind. In conclusion, while the court case was a loss for Nakhuda, it was a victory for animal welfare. The ruling established that wild animals were better off in their natural habitats or in a proper sanctuary, away from humans, rather than being kept as pets. Darwin's story continues to educate many on the importance of animal welfare and the risks associated with keeping wild animals as pets.
