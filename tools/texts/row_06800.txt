The resulting editorial repeats Communist Party talking points, lauding China's stability and education system while counseling that any changes in China are 'likely to be subtle, incremental, and coming from the top.'

'It omitted crucial parts, including the most important point: that I believe it's harder to make a political change in China, where the system is deeper rooted than in Egypt, and thus the flaws are also more deeply rooted,' Hessler wrote. 'I said that this is the reason why the current anti-corruption campaign will be a failure, because China is not addressing its systemic flaws.'

The newspaper removed the online piece in English, but it remains available in state media in Chinese. On Facebook, Hessler wrote he asked the China Daily for a retraction but the paper refused.
