article: Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will return to work next week after a nasty bout with stomach flu and a concussion sidelined her for three weeks. "The Secretary continues to recuperate at home. She had long planned to take this holiday week off, so she had no work schedule," her spokesman, Deputy Assistant Secretary Philippe Reines said in a statement. "She looks forward to getting back to the office next week and resuming her schedule." Clinton spent the holidays with her family after working from home for the past week. Clinton's doctors, in a statement released last weekend, said they told her to cancel all work events and "rest and avoid any strenuous activity." Clinton was recovering from the stomach flu when she fainted and suffered a concussion. Her doctors have grounded her from overseas travel for several more weeks, but her return to the State Department paves the way for her to testify before Congress on the September 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic office in Benghazi, Libya. Last week Clinton's deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns testified in her place at open hearings on the deadly attacks after Clinton had to bow out under doctors' orders. That did not sit well with some members of Congress, especially Republicans, who have been highly critical of the Obama administration's handling of the Libya attack and who have called for Clinton to appear when she returns to work. Clinton has promised to testify her next month before the before the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees about the findings of a scathing independent report that found "grossly inadequate security" and "systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies" at the State Department. Clinton said in letters to the heads of those committees that she accepted every one of its recommendations, including strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas. One official has resigned and three more have been disciplined in the wake of the report.

chatgpt: Former Secretary of State and Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been out of the public eye for over three weeks since she was sidelined with a stomach flu that caused her to faint resulting in a concussion. However, despite her health issues, she has vowed to testify before congressional committees next month. These committees are focusing on the 2012 terrorist attack on the US diplomatic office in Benghazi, Libya, which happened during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. Clinton was scheduled to testify before the committees in December, but her health condition forced her to cancel the appearance. Her absence sparked speculation and rumors, and her team was quick to squash any unfounded allegations. Some conspiracy theorists speculated that her health condition was a deliberate ploy to avoid testifying in front of the committees. Clinton's team, however, was adamant that this was not the case. Clinton has publicly acknowledged that the Benghazi attack was one of the most challenging situations she had faced during her tenure as Secretary of State. The committees investigating the attack have been critical of Clinton's handling of the incident, and her appearance is seen as critical to answer questions about the State Department's role in the events leading up to and following the attack. Clinton's appearance before the committees could also have implications for her potential presidential bid in 2016. Opponents may use her testimony as a way to challenge her foreign policy record, and it is essential that she is prepared for any questions that may be thrown her way. Despite her illness, Clinton has been working behind the scenes to prepare for her testimony. Her team has been gathering information and preparing her for the types of questions that she can expect from the committees. Clinton has also been receiving flowers and messages of support from well-wishers who hope that she makes a speedy recovery. In conclusion, Hillary Clinton's bout with stomach flu and subsequent concussion has forced her to sit out of the public eye for over three weeks. However, she has remained resolute in her vow to testify before the congressional committees next month. Her testimony will be critical in answering questions about the Benghazi attack and could have implications for her potential presidential bid in 2016.
