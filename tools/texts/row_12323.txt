article: (CNN) -- How will El Niño affect hurricane season? It depends on the ocean, forecasters say. Forecasters announced Thursday that the Atlantic hurricane season likely will have fewer storms than the average year, while in the Pacific, the numbers might be higher. The outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center forecast three to six hurricanes, with one or two major hurricanes for the Atlantic season, which begins June 1. There likely will be eight to 13 named storms in the Atlantic. "It doesn't matter whether we get one or a dozen, it matters which one(s) hit land and what land it hits," CNN meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers said. About 40% of Americans live in counties on a shoreline, said Holly Bamford, the assistant administrator for NOAA's National Ocean Service. El Niño, characterized by warmer water in the equatorial Pacific, increases strong wind shear in the Atlantic, which reduces the intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes and prevents other systems from becoming powerful enough to be named storms. The Atlantic Ocean is also cooler than in recent years. "We are currently seeing strong trade winds and wind shear over the tropical Atlantic, and NOAA's climate models predict these conditions will persist, in part because of El Niño," said Gerry Bell, NOAA's lead hurricane season forecaster. The Atlantic hurricane season runs through November 30. The region includes the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and north Atlantic Ocean. Last year there were 11 tropical storms and two hurricanes. The center said there was a 70% chance there would be 14 to 20 named storms for the Eastern Pacific, with seven to 11 hurricanes, with the likelihood of three to six being Category 3 hurricanes or stronger (winds greater than 100 mph). That would be near normal or above normal. "El Niño decreases the vertical wind shear over the eastern tropical Pacific, favoring more and stronger tropical storms and hurricanes," Bell said. It is extremely rare for an Eastern Pacific hurricane to affect the U.S. mainland, though some do have an influence on Hawaii. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 through November 30. Last year there were nine tropical storms and nine hurricanes. There is a 65% chance of an El Niño forming, the center said on May 8.

chatgpt: As hurricane season approaches, forecasters have provided some insight into what to expect for the upcoming year. According to reports, the Eastern Pacific may experience more hurricanes than usual, while the Atlantic may see fewer. These predictions are based on the weather patterns caused by a phenomenon known as El Niño. The winds from El Niño are expected to lessen the intensity of storms in the Atlantic, which could lead to fewer storms overall. However, it is essential to note that what truly matters is not how many storms are predicted but how many make landfall and where they hit. According to a CNN meteorologist, the damage from hurricanes is dependent on their landfall location and the preparedness of the affected areas. As a result, it is important that communities in hurricane-prone regions remain vigilant and prepared, regardless of the number of storms predicted for this year. Last year, the Atlantic saw a record-breaking number of storms with a total of 30 named storms, 12 of which made landfall in the United States. This caused widespread destruction, particularly in Louisiana, where multiple hurricanes hit within a short period. Meanwhile, the Eastern Pacific experienced a relatively mild hurricane season, with only 18 named storms and seven hurricanes. However, the impact of these hurricanes was significant, particularly in Central America, where Hurricane Eta caused widespread flooding and landslides. With the possibility of more hurricanes in the Eastern Pacific and fewer in the Atlantic, the focus for officials and communities should be on proactive measures, such as preparing evacuation plans and securing homes and businesses before any storms make landfall. One positive note is that many parts of the United States have increased their preparedness efforts following the devastating hurricanes of the past few years. This includes investing in infrastructure such as improved drainage systems and strengthening emergency response teams. The bottom line is that hurricane season is unpredictable, and forecasters can only provide an estimation of what to expect. Thus, residents in vulnerable areas should remain alert, prepared, and up-to-date with the latest weather updates to stay safe and avoid damage caused by these severe storms.
