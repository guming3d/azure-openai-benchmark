chatgpt: Australian musician Phil Rudd has announced his return to the rock band AC/DC, despite facing charges of threatening to kill and drug possession. The 60-year-old drummer, who denies the charges, made the announcement outside a court in New Zealand. "I'm going back to work with AC/DC, and I don't care who likes it or who doesn't," he declared. Rudd has made no secret of his desire to return to the band, which he was a member of for more than three decades. He was famously fired from the group in 2015, after being convicted of charges related to drugs possession and making threats to kill. Rudd served eight months of home detention as a result. The current charges against Rudd are believed to relate to an alleged incident in which he is said to have made threats against a former employee. The Crown has given a brief outline of the case against him, but the specifics of the allegations have not been made public. The threatening to kill charge is due back in Tauranga District Court on February 10. In his appearance outside the court, Rudd addressed the charges briefly, saying: "The only thing I'm guilty of is being a drummer in a rock and roll band." He added that he was "looking forward to getting back to work" with the band. The announcement has been met with mixed reactions from fans of the band. While some have expressed their support for Rudd, others have questioned whether he should be allowed back into the group while he is facing such serious charges. In a statement, AC/DC have said that they are aware of the charges against Rudd, but have declined to comment further. The band's current line-up includes Axl Rose, who joined them on tour in 2016. Rudd's return to the band has been seen as something of a surprise, given the acrimonious nature of his departure in 2015. The drummer had been with the group since the 1970s, and played on hits such as "Thunderstruck" and "Back in Black". The charges against Rudd are just the latest in a long line of controversies to have hit the band over the years. The group's original lead singer, Bon Scott, died in 1980 after an alcohol-related incident, while his replacement, Brian Johnson, was forced to leave the band due to hearing problems. Guitarist Malcolm Young also died in 2017 after a long battle with dementia. Despite these setbacks, AC/DC have continued to be one of the world's most popular rock bands. Their most recent album, "Power Up", was released in 2020 to positive reviews. The album features the single "Shot in the Dark", which reached number one on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. Whether Rudd's return will lead to new music from the band remains to be seen. For now, fans will be eagerly anticipating his return to the stage with AC/DC, as he looks to rebuild his career and reputation after a turbulent few years.
