article: What do dogs want, petting or being spoken to? According to a study it’s very much the former. Scientists found that dogs had a preference for petting, whether it was from a stranger or from their owner. And it was found that dogs will only respond to vocal praise when they are very familiar with an owner and their voice. Scroll down for video . Research led by the University of Florida says dogs prefer petting (stock image shown). In the study they found dogs were more satisfied by physical contact. But they also found that dogs never tired of being petted. The results were true for dogs being petter by strangers and their owners . The research was led by Dr Erica Feuerbacher from the University of Florida. In the study, co-authored by Dr Clive Wynne of Arizona State University, the scientists examined a variety of dogs and their responses to situations. They looked at shelter dogs, owned dogs with strangers providing interactions and owned dogs with their owner providing interactions. Scientists think they know why domestic species tend to have certain characteristics that accompany their tameness, such as floppier ears, patches of white fur, and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws. Geneticists believe that a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest, link all these traits, which are seen in many people’s pet cats and dogs. Although the experts' proposal has not yet been tested, it is the first hypothesis that connects several components of the ‘domestication syndrome.’ It not only applies to mammals like dogs, foxes, pigs, horses, sheep and rabbits, but it may even explain similar changes in domesticated birds and fish, according to the study published in the journal Genetics. Across all groups they found the dogs had a preference for petting over vocal praise. Additionally they found that dogs never tired of being petted. When the dogs were petted they also preferred to stay in the proximity of the experimenter. But when only vocal praise was used they showed little proximity-seeking behaviour, on a similar level to when no interaction was initiated at all. ‘Overall, petting seems to be an important interaction between dogs and humans that might maintain inter-specific social behavior but vocal praise likely has to be specifically conditioned,’ the researchers write. Previous research this year from the same two scientists, however, found that petting wasn’t the be-all and end-all; the animals actually preferred food to being touched. When food was readily available the dogs preferred to eat than be petted, and when access to food was limited the dogs showed ‘sensitivity’. ‘Overall, petting seems to be an important interaction between dogs and humans that might maintain inter-specific social behavior but vocal praise likely has to be specifically conditioned,’ the researchers write. In previous research they also found that dogs preferred food to petting .

chatgpt: Dogs may be known as man's best friend, but it seems as though they have a preference in how they want to be treated. According to new research led by the University of Florida, dogs prefer petting over other forms of interaction. In the study, researchers found that dogs were more satisfied with physical contact than any other form of attention. And not only that, but they found that dogs never seem to tire of being petted. The results held true for both dogs being petted by strangers and their owners. The research team came to these conclusions after observing more than 100 dogs in various social situations. They measured the animals' physical and behavioral reactions to different types of interaction, such as patting, talking, and offering food. Interestingly, the results of this latest study contradict previous research that suggested dogs preferred food to petting. However, the University of Florida researchers say there could be a reason behind this discrepancy. "Previous studies may have overemphasized the importance of food to dogs because they were conducted in feeding situations," said Dr. Clive Wynne, a professor of psychology at the University of Florida and lead author of the study. "In non-feeding situations, we find that dogs are far more interested in petting and attention from people." The research team also noted that dogs seemed to prefer petting over vocal praise. While dogs certainly appreciate attention in any form, physical touch seemed to be the most satisfying to them. "These results suggest that dogs are social animals, who crave physical contact with their owners and strangers alike," said Dr. Wynne. "The findings have significant implications for how we should interact with our furry friends." The study's authors noted that the results likely reflect the evolutionary history of dogs, who evolved from wolves and were raised in close proximity to humans. Dogs are thought to be particularly sensitive to human social cues, and it seems that physical touch is one of the most important ways we can communicate with them. While the study focused on dogs, the researchers believe that the findings could have implications for other domesticated animals as well. Ultimately, the research team hopes that their work will help improve our understanding of animal behavior and improve the lives of our animal companions. So the next time you're in the presence of a furry friend, take a moment to give them a good pat. It may be the most satisfying thing you can do for them.
