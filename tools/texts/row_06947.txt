Humiliated: Transgender woman Amira Gray claims bar staff at Bistro 18 printed a gay slur on her receipt . Ms Gray, a transgender woman, also claimed that wait staff at the bistro had treated her group differently to other customers. She said that although other groups were served at their table, Ms Gray and her friends had to order at the bar every time they wanted drinks, and that 'no wait staff approached our table'. When a waitress handed Ms Gray her check at the end of the night, the phrase 'Gay b*****s' had been printed at the top. 'As a transgender woman I was extremely hurt, embarrassed, and upset,' Ms Gray wrote in her statement on the legal complaint. 'I felt the slur was meant as a slap in the face because of my gender identity and expression ... and my friends who are or may have been perceived as being lesbian or gay.' Ms Gray said one of her friends confronted the manager about what had been printed on the receipt, but claimed the manager removed the check and printed a new one without the slur. Her friend had retained a copy of the original, which was released by transgender rights group Lambda Legal.

chatgpt: Amira Gray is taking legal action against Bistro 18, a popular restaurant and bar in the heart of the city, following an incident where she and her friends were subjected to a racial slur by staff members. Gray and her friends were enjoying a night out at Bistro 18 when they were subjected to what she describes as "blatant racism and discrimination" by several staff members. Gray, who is of African American descent, claims that the staff members treated her and her friends differently, refusing to serve them and making derogatory remarks. "I was absolutely shocked and hurt by the way we were treated," Gray said. "It was clear that we were being singled out because of the color of our skin. We were made to feel like second-class citizens and it's not acceptable." Gray claims that she and her friends were the only people in the bar who were treated in this way, and that the staff members in question were all white. "I can't believe that in this day and age, we still have to deal with this kind of racism," she said. "It's time for businesses like Bistro 18 to take a stand against discrimination and make sure that everyone is treated equally." Gray has now filed a lawsuit against Bistro 18, seeking damages for the emotional distress she suffered as a result of the incident. She is also calling for the bar to implement new policies and training programs to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. "Nobody should ever have to experience what I went through," Gray said. "By taking legal action, I hope to make a difference and send a message that racism and discrimination will not be tolerated." Bistro 18 has not yet responded to the lawsuit, but a spokesperson for the restaurant released a statement condemning any form of discrimination. "At Bistro 18, we pride ourselves on treating all of our customers with respect and dignity," the statement read. "We are deeply troubled by these allegations and are taking them very seriously. We are committed to conducting a thorough investigation and taking appropriate action." The incident at Bistro 18 is just one example of the ongoing struggle for racial equality in the United States. While progress has been made over the past few decades, incidents of racism and discrimination still occur far too frequently. Gray's decision to take legal action against Bistro 18 sends a powerful message that discrimination of any kind is not acceptable in our society. It's time for businesses and individuals alike to take a stand against racism and work towards creating a more just and equitable world for all.
