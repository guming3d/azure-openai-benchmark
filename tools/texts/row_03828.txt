article: London, England (CNN) -- Reports that Iran has sentenced a British embassy employee to four years in prison are "deeply concerning," British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Thursday. Hossein Rassam "is a hardworking embassy official" who was "doing work that was wholly within the boundaries of diplomatic work," Miliband said at a news conference in Brussels, Belgium. The reported sentence is "wholly unjustified and represents further harassment of embassy staff for going about their normal and legitimate duties," Miliband had said earlier, in a statement issued Wednesday. Rassam is one of several British embassy employees arrested in the wake of Iran's disputed June 12 presidential election. Thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the official results declaring President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner. Iran accused Britain and the United States of fomenting the unrest. Rassam was put on trial in August. The European Union, France and the United Kingdom denounced the proceeding. Rassam's lawyer has not officially been informed of the embassy worker's sentence, and he does not know where Rassam is, he told Iranian media. Abdolsamad Khorramshahi told the Fars News Agency that the terms of Rassam's bail did not prevent him from leaving the country. He said Rassam had been in Iran recently, but he did not know his current whereabouts. He said he could not express an opinion on the verdict before the court officially informs him of it, which he said normally happens after it is issued. The European Union condemned the reported verdict as "unjustified and harsh," and urged "the Iranian authorities to overturn it swiftly," the Swedish presidency of the 27-nation bloc said in a statement Thursday. "Any action against one EU country (a citizen or member of embassy staff) is considered an action against the entire EU, and will be treated accordingly," the statement said. France also condemned the sentencing of Rassam. Miliband said he understood the sentence could be appealed and urged "the authorities to conduct this quickly and overturn this harsh sentence." "This will be seen as an attack against the entire diplomatic community in Iran," he said in a statement late Wednesday. The Foreign Office summoned the Iranian ambassador to London, and Britain's envoy in Tehran spoke to Iran's deputy foreign minister, Miliband said.

chatgpt: The trial of several UK embassy employees who were arrested during the unrest in Iran in June continues to attract condemnation from across the international community. The latest voices to speak out against the trial were the representatives of the European Union, France and the United Kingdom. One of the employees on trial is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Rassam. He was among several others who were arrested after thousands of Iranians took to the streets to voice their discontent over the results of the presidential election in June. The protests led to a violent crackdown by the authorities, with hundreds of people being arrested, and some being killed or injured. The trial of the embassy employees has been widely criticized for lacking any semblance of due process, and for being politically motivated. The detainees are accused of fomenting unrest in Iran, a charge that many believe is spurious and without any factual basis. The UK government has been outspoken in its condemnation of the trial. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said that the trial was "a blatant attempt by the Iranian authorities to use innocent individuals as pawns in a political game." The statement went on to say that the UK government "fully supports the defendants and their families and continues to call for their immediate release." The European Union has also weighed in on the matter, with its High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, saying that the trial was "a clear violation of human rights and due process." Borrell called on the Iranian authorities to release the detainees and to respect the rule of law. France has also expressed its concern over the treatment of the embassy employees. A statement from the French foreign ministry said that the trial was "unjust and unacceptable," and that the detainees were entitled to a fair trial in accordance with international law. The trial of the embassy employees comes at a time of increased tensions between Iran and the international community, with the US and European countries imposing a range of sanctions on Iran in response to its nuclear program. The deteriorating situation has led to fears of a conflict in the region, which would have far-reaching consequences for the global economy and security. As the trial continues, the pressure is mounting on the Iranian authorities to release the detainees and to respect their rights. With the international community calling for justice, it remains to be seen whether the authorities in Iran will listen, or whether the detainees will be caught in the crossfire of a wider geopolitical struggle.
