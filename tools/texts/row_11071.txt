article: What the #@!%? Some gamers uploading R-rated videos of themselves playing on the new Xbox One are learning the hard way that Microsoft is trying to crack down on cursing. Over the past few days, gamers using the Upload Studio on Xbox Live to share videos online have reported being banned from the network, at least temporarily, after using salty language. What do they think this is? "Grand Theft Auto"? On Monday, Microsoft confirmed it's trying to clean up language in its online community. "(W)e take Code of Conduct moderation via Upload Studio very seriously. We want a clean, safe and fun environment for all users," the company said in a statement. "Excessive profanity as well as other Code of Conduct violations will be enforced upon and result in suspension of some or all privileges on Xbox Live. We remain committed to preserving and promoting a safe, secure and enjoyable experience for all of our Xbox Live members." The statement did, however, quell a rumor that Microsoft was also monitoring direct communications such as Skype chats among players using the network. Because Skype often was one of the apps suspended, some players said they thought their behavior on the voice-calling service was being monitored. Several suspended gamers reported having full services restored after 24 hours. Not surprisingly, the announcement isn't going over well with some in the gaming community. "Saying that swearing is not to be tolerated (at least partially) in this one area of gaming on top of a platform that is an obscenity cannon just feels squishy," Alex Wilhelm wrote for TechCrunch. "Also, it's inconsistent. And as I don't think that language deemed by some as 'foul' should be banned while playing games, I don't think that it should be banned in uploaded videos of games being played." Many online were echoing Wilhelm's initial point: How can a company crack down on profanity while at the same time promoting video games filled with the stuff? "Xbox Live is suspending accounts for (foul) language. They don't want kids hearing four letter words as they go on a virtual killing spree," said Mike Frankovich on Twitter. "If Xbox is gonna ban 12 yr olds for abusive language they just eliminated their entire fan base," added Twitter user Malakye Morgan. In "Dead Rising 3," an exclusive title for the Xbox One, " the words "f**k," "sh*t," and "a*shole" can be heard in the dialogue," according to the game's "M for Mature" rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Players are also able to visit a "XXX supply shop" and buy an adult toy that can be turned into the Super Massager -- a weapon that can be used on zombies. Microsoft said players who run afoul of its rules are being temporarily suspended from using certain apps, not banned from Xbox Live indefinitely.

chatgpt: Xbox Live players who use profanity in their videos are being temporarily suspended from some services, according to recent reports. Microsoft, the parent company of Xbox, says it's cracking down on profanity as part of its ongoing effort to create a "clean, safe, and fun" environment for all players. According to gamers who've been suspended, the punishment lasts for 24 hours and can affect features like multiplayer gaming and the Xbox Live party system. While some gamers have criticized the move as overly strict, others have pointed out that the use of profanity can be harmful and offensive to some players. Microsoft has not released an official statement on the matter, but the company has previously emphasized its commitment to maintaining a family-friendly environment on Xbox Live. In recent years, the company has taken steps to limit the use of profanity and other offensive content on the platform, including implementing systems to automatically filter out certain language. The move to suspend players for cursing in videos comes as many new games, particularly ones aimed at adult audiences, feature a great deal of profanity and other mature content. Some gamers have argued that it's unfair to penalize players for using language that's common in many of the games available on the platform. However, many others have praised the decision as a positive step toward creating a more respectful and safe gaming environment. In recent years, the gaming industry has come under fire for widespread harassment and toxic behavior toward marginalized groups, leading many companies to take active measures to combat these issues. Microsoft's decision to suspend players for cursing in videos could be seen as part of this broader effort to create a more inclusive and welcoming space for all gamers. While some may view the policy as overly strict or limiting, it's clear that Microsoft is taking the issue of profanity seriously and is committed to creating a gaming community that's both fun and safe. For many gamers, Xbox Live is more than just a platform for playing games â€“ it's a social space where they can connect with friends and other players from around the world. By enforcing strict standards around language and behavior, Microsoft is sending a clear message that it takes this responsibility seriously and is willing to take steps to ensure that all players can enjoy the platform without fear of harassment or harm. Overall, while the decision to suspend players for cursing in videos may be controversial, it's clear that Microsoft is pursuing a larger goal of creating a more respectful and inclusive gaming community. Whether or not this effort will be successful remains to be seen, but it's heartening to see a major player in the gaming industry taking concrete steps to address some of the broader challenges facing the industry today.
