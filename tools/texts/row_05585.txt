chatgpt: Melbourne Cup was marred by the unfortunate deaths of two runners, Japanese-trained favourite Admire Rakti and seventh-placed Araldo. The event drew attention from across the globe, as excitement and anxiety permeated the racing community. The loss of the two horses cast a somber dose of reality over the festive event. However, the death of the two horses could not take away from the thrill of the race itself. The 2014 Melbourne Cup was won by German-trained Protectionist, ridden by jockey Ryan Moore. Moore raced to a four-length victory, leaving the other horses in his wake. This was a significant achievement for Moore, who had won Australia's Cox Plate on Aidan O'Brien's Adelaide only last month. Moore's victory on Protectionist has left the racing world in awe of his skill, and his success in Melbourne is one for the books. Protectionist's trainer, Andreas Wohler, was delighted with the victory, stating that, "We had a plan to try and win the race, and we had the perfect jockey on board. Ryan rode him very sweetly, and the horse was relaxed throughout.” Wohler's confidence in Moore and Protectionist was well-placed, as they accomplished their goals and achieved success in Melbourne. While the race was overshadowed by the tragic passing of Admire Rakti and Araldo, the reactions of the racing community indicate that this is an isolated event. Everyone involved in the sport knows the risks that come with racing, and the organizers and officials work tirelessly to minimize those risks. The industry is committed to ensuring that horses are properly cared for, and that the necessary precautions are taken to ensure their safety. The Melbourne Cup has always been a significant event in Australian culture, and the international flair brought by European and Japanese trainers and jockeys only adds to the race's prestige. This year was a fitting demonstration of that, with horses, jockeys, and trainers from all around the world coming together to compete, and to marvel at the beauty of the sport. The passing of Admire Rakti and Araldo serves as a sad reminder that racing can be dangerous, but the Melbourne Cup is a showcase of the best traits of the industry. It represents passion, excitement, and prestige, and draws attention from around the world. Ryan Moore's victory on Protectionist is the cherry on top of the lovely event that was the 2014 Melbourne Cup, and the emotions of the day will be remembered by all involved for years to come.
