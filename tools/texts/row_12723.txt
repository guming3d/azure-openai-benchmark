article: (EW.com) -- AMC has canceled "The Killing" after two seasons, but the rainy murder mystery could live on at another network. A statement from the network read: "After much deliberation, we've come to the difficult decision not to renew 'The Killing' for a third season. AMC is incredibly proud of the show and is fortunate to have worked with such a talented team on this project, from showrunner Veena Sud and our terrific partners at Fox Television Studios to the talented, dedicated crew and exceptional cast." Fox Television Studios quickly sent out a statement saying the studio plans to shop the drama series to other networks: "Fox Television Studios is extremely proud of 'The Killing,' the extraordinary writing staff and crew, and what we believe is one of the best casts on television. We will proceed to try to find another home for the show." "The Killing" has been one of AMC's few missteps in an otherwise remarkable plunge into scripted television during the last several years. The show premiered last year to 2.7 million viewers and plenty of fan and critic excitement. But in a move that will likely be used as a real-time lesson in serialized series management for years to come, AMC and Sud managed to infuriate fans by declining to solve a mystery that viewers felt they had been led to believe would be cleared up by the end of the first season. When season 2 debuted in April, ratings dropped 33% to 1.8 million viewers. The audience continued to ebb until the finale, which garnered 1.4 million viewers and finally revealed who killed teen murder victim Rosie Larsen. With the ratings showing a clear downward trajectory, and having established across two seasons that the Larsen murder is the driving force of the show, cancellation seemed very likely. The lesson? Don't take viewers for granted. See the full story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . Â© 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc. All rights reserved.

chatgpt: After two seasons of intense drama and suspense, AMC has decided to cancel "The Killing." Despite the show's dedicated fanbase and critical praise, the network has cited declining viewership as the main reason for its cancellation. The decision was made after the finale of "The Killing" drew in only 1.4 million viewers, a significant decrease from the series' peak viewership. While the show was initially hailed as a groundbreaking crime drama, its audience has continued to ebb over time. However, all hope may not be lost for fans of "The Killing." Fox Television Studios plans to shop the series to other networks in the hopes of finding a new home for the beloved characters and spine-chilling storylines. "The Killing" originally aired on AMC in 2011, to rave reviews from both TV critics and viewers. The show followed a pair of Seattle homicide detectives as they investigated the death of a young girl, and built an intricate web of suspense and drama that kept audiences on the edge of their seats. Despite its success, "The Killing" faced its fair share of controversy over the years. The show drew criticism for keeping its central mystery unsolved for two full seasons, and for its bleak and often gruesome subject matter. But for many fans, "The Killing" was a unique and engrossing TV experience that will be sorely missed. Fox Television Studios' decision to shop the show to other networks will undoubtedly give many hope that the series may continue to live on. For now, though, the story of "The Killing" has come to a close. While its cancellation may be disappointing for many, there's no denying that the show left an indelible mark on the world of television crime dramas. Its legacy will be felt for years to come, even as its characters fade into the unknown.
