article: Manchester United were always masters of the late show. They were the team that never gave up until the final whistle, often scoring last-gasp goals that snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, they made an art form of it, winning innumerable Premier League games, Cup ties and even the Champions League through their never-say-die spirit. Opponents would always have that nagging doubt in the back of their minds as the clock ticked ever-more-slowly down. When would the onslaught come? Did they have the resolve to hold out?

Courtesy of Opta . Louis van Gaal's team seem to have lost the knack of scoring late in games, something that is quite alarming considering their porous defence. Compare this season to the last 10 under Sir Alex Ferguson - 468 goals were scored between minutes 0 and 62, while 296 came between minutes 63 and the final whistle. So during Ferguson's last decade at Old Trafford, 38.7 per cent of goals came in the final 27 minutes of games plus that indefinite added period known as 'Fergie Time'. The late show reached its height in the 2009-2010 season when 39 of United's 86 Premier League goals - or 45 per cent - came after 63 minutes. United had even retained the knack of scoring late goals under David Moyes last season. It wasn't quite the dying seconds smash-and-grab raids of Ferguson's era but 21 of their 64 league goals came after 63 minutes. Unless Van Gaal's fearsome front line can ensure every match is wrapped up by the hour mark, it is essential they rediscover that characteristic Man United ability to keep going until the bitter end.

chatgpt: Manchester United's current manager Louis van Gaal has a reputation as a tactician who values possession and control over attacking flair. Under his leadership, the Red Devils have been a cautious team that often struggles to break down defenses. However, one statistic from this season might come as a surprise to fans who have grown used to United's slow-paced approach: they have yet to score a goal later than the 62nd minute. This remarkable consistency was reinforced on Sunday when Radamel Falcao netted a late winner against Everton. The Colombian striker's goal was United's latest of the campaign, and it secured a vital 2-1 victory that lifted them up to fourth place in the Premier League table. Falcao's strike was also a reminder of United's former glory under Sir Alex Ferguson. During Fergie's last 10 years in charge, the team became known for their never-say-die attitude and their ability to snatch late winners from the jaws of defeat. In fact, nearly 40% of United's goals in that period came after the 63rd minute mark. This contrast between Van Gaal's conservative approach and Ferguson's bold, attacking style has been a talking point among United fans and pundits for some time. While the Dutchman has brought some stability and structure to the team, he has not yet managed to replicate the excitement and flair of the Ferguson era. However, some observers argue that United's ability to score early and then hold onto their lead is a sign of progress. Under Van Gaal, they have become a more disciplined team with a better defensive record than in recent seasons. In fact, United have conceded just once in their last six league matches, a run that has seen them claim 16 points from a possible 18. Nevertheless, some United supporters will be hoping that their team can recapture some of the late drama that defined the Ferguson years. With tricky fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester City, and Arsenal on the horizon, they will need all the firepower they can muster if they are to stay in the title hunt. One player who could play a key role in United's bid for glory is Falcao. Despite a slow start to his Old Trafford career, the former Atletico Madrid and Porto man has now scored four goals in his last six appearances. His winner against Everton was a typically clinical finish, as he controlled a cross from the left and drilled a low shot past Tim Howard. Falcao's goalscoring prowess has not gone unnoticed by Van Gaal, who praised the striker's work rate and attitude after the Everton game. With Robin van Persie still recovering from injury and Wayne Rooney occasionally deployed in midfield, Falcao could become United's main source of goals in the coming months. Overall, United's ability to score late goals this season has been a pleasant surprise for fans who feared that Van Gaal's reign would be a drab affair. While the team's defensive solidity is admirable, they will need to show more attacking spark if they are to win over the Old Trafford faithful and reclaim their place among English football's elite.
