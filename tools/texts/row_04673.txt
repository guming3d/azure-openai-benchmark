article: The app - available on the U.S. iTunes store and on Android - lets you tell the world where and when you 'made love' - and even rate the experience out of five and offer comments . Sharing apps such as Foursquare already let us share where we eat, drink and shop. Now 'I Just Made Love' lets you log and GPS-tag your private life in just the same way - and, bizarrely, some people seem to want to. The Android app has been downloaded 10,000 times, and rated five stars by dozens of users. 'Did you just make love? Or just want to check where people near you made love?' says the app. 'I just made love lets you do all that and more!' The Android - and now iPhone - app lets you record where, when and even in what position you 'made love' - and then upload it to an online database - with your comments. The Android app has already been downloaded 10,000 times. The iPhone app is available to download via I Just Made Love's site - and seems to be available via the U.S. iTunes store, although not the UK one. The app is free, earning its money via advertising. The I Just Made Love site claims to have recorded 193,000 'acts of love', along with where the event occurred and a limitedÂ  amount of context - very limited, in fact, offering only the options of Inside, Outdoors, In a Car and On a Boat. Most of the posts via the site so far seem to be in Polish - with only isolated instances of lovemaking in other countries. One brave soul (male, on a sofa) even logged an act of love from Iran - although he declined to comment. Highly unlikely: The overwhelming majority of posts seem to be from men, many seem simply to be jokes, and the majority seem to be from Poland . Tech site The Register pointed out that as the app is anonymous, posting lovemaking statistics on a version of Google Maps, its impossible to verify, or even challenge anything posted via the app. 'I Just Made Love lets one brag without the fear that someone who knows better will pointing out that one apparently managed it without company,' the site wrote. 'What is clear, and at risk of quoting Tina Turner, is that love has nothing whatsoever to do with it.'

chatgpt: A new GPS-enabled app is making waves in the world of smartphone technology. The innovative software allows users to tag their location and the time of their visit with ease. The app, available on Android, has already been downloaded over 10,000 times and is quickly gaining popularity with both tech-savvy users and everyday individuals alike. The app, which is aptly named "TagMe," is designed with ease-of-use in mind. Users simply tap a button to tag their location and the time of their visit. This information is then stored in the app and can be accessed at any time. Users can also give their visit a score out of five, which makes it easy to remember which places they liked and which ones they didn't. One of the key benefits of TagMe is that it can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, a user might use it to remember a particularly interesting museum exhibit they saw during a trip. Or, they might use it to keep track of their favorite restaurants or bars. The app can also be used to track business-related travel for expense reporting purposes. Another benefit of the app is that it allows users to share their visits with others. TagMe's social sharing feature allows users to easily share their visits with friends and family on popular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This can be particularly useful for travelers who want to share their experiences with loved ones back home. Privacy concerns have been taken into account during the development of TagMe. The app only tracks location and time, and does not collect any personal data. Users can also choose to keep their visits private if they wish. Overall, TagMe is a welcomed addition to the world of GPS-enabled apps. Its ease-of-use, social sharing features, and privacy options make it a great choice for anyone looking to keep track of their travels or favorite places. With over 10,000 downloads and counting, it's clear that TagMe is quickly becoming a staple for smartphone users.
