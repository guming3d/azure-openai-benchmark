But 27-year-old Dimambro, who admitted in police interviews to shaking the child, insisted that he had never intended to kill the little boy, saying it was 'simply an accident'. 'This was not intentional,' he said before the sentencing. 'I wish he could come back.' Damian was being looked after by Dimambro when he was attacked on August 21.

chatgpt: Ronald Dimambro Jr. was convicted of first-degree murder and child abuse last month and sentenced to life on Thursday. The horrifying crime took place last year when Dimambro, 30, beat Damian Sutton, his girlfriend's toddler, so violently that the little boy ended up with a broken skull and blunt force trauma to the head. Damian, who was just two years old at the time, was put in a coma but died six days later. During the trial, Damian's parents both spoke about the devastating impact of their son's death on their lives. The little boy had been a ray of sunshine in their household, and his loss had turned their world upside down. They spoke about how they had been looking forward to watching Damian grow up and the milestones they had been eagerly anticipating. However, all their hopes and dreams for their son were snatched away in a single moment of violence by Dimambro. He showed no remorse for his despicable actions, and even tried to pin the blame on Damian's mother, claiming that she was responsible for the little boy's injuries. The jury, however, saw through Dimambro's lies and found him guilty of first-degree murder and child abuse. Judge Wanda Stokes later sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In her judgement, Judge Stokes spoke about the horrific nature of the crime and the utter disregard for human life shown by Dimambro. She said that his actions had shattered the lives of Damian's parents and left an indelible scar on all those who knew and loved the little boy. Following the sentencing, Damian's parents expressed their relief at seeing justice served. Although nothing will ever bring their son back, they hope that the outcome of the trial will serve as a warning to other young parents to be vigilant about who they allow into their homes. They also expressed their gratitude to the police and prosecutors who had tirelessly worked to bring Dimambro to justice. Their hard work and dedication had meant that Damian's killer was held accountable for his actions and prevented from hurting anyone else. Dimambro's conviction and sentencing serve as a stark reminder of the horrific consequences of child abuse. It is a crime that leaves deep scars and causes immeasurable pain to victims and their families. It is up to all of us to remain vigilant to the signs of abuse and to take action where necessary to protect the most vulnerable members of our society.
