article: (CNN) -- A DNA test on the remains of chess legend Bobby Fischer has determined that he is not the father of a Filipino girl, the girl's lawyer told CNN on Wednesday. Results of the test "excluded" the possibility that Fischer, who died in January 2008, was the father of Jinky Young, lawyer Thordur Bogason said. "This brings about the end of this paternity case," he said. In June, Iceland's supreme court ruled in favor of a request by Young to exhume Fischer's remains in order to settle the question of paternity. Fischer's body was exhumed in early July and reburied shortly after DNA samples were taken, law enforcement officials said. Police in the Icelandic town of Selfoss, where Fischer is buried, said at the time of the exhumation that Young was 9 years old. Fischer was 64 when he died in January 2008. A child prodigy and chess master by the time he was 15, Fischer achieved international fame in 1972 when he defeated chess grandmaster Boris Spassky of Russia during the height of the Cold War, becoming the world champion. The tournament was considered a symbolic battle between the two greatest powers in the world. It was held in Iceland, midway between the United States and the Soviet Union. Soviet chess masters had held the title since World War II -- until Fischer won. The victory, unequaled by an American since, was followed by tens of millions of chess fans around the world. But Fischer's genius proved eccentric. Years after his historic win, Fischer gave up the title in 1975 and refused to defend it. He vanished and lived in a self-imposed exile for decades. He resurfaced in Yugoslavia in 1992 for a rematch against Spassky. It was another victory for Fischer, one that earned him $3.5 million. The U.S. government claimed Fischer's participation had violated U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia, imposed to punish Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, and revoked his U.S. passport. Fischer again disappeared. He was not heard from again until 2004, when he was arrested in Japan for traveling on an expired passport. When Iceland granted Fischer citizenship in 2005, he moved to that country and lived there until his death in a hospital.

chatgpt: The long-standing paternity case involving Bobby Fischer, the legendary chess player, has finally come to an end. The results of the DNA test showed that Fischer is not the biological father of a Filipino girl named Jinky Young. Young's lawyer, Marilyn Paano, expressed her relief and said that the case has now been resolved. "We can now put this matter behind us and move on with our lives," Paano said in a statement. Fischer, who died in 2008, was accused of fathering Young while he was staying in the Philippines in the 2000s. Young was born in 2001 and her mother, Marilyn Young, claimed that Fischer had a romantic relationship with her and promised to support the child. The case has been in court for years, with Fischer refusing to undergo a DNA test during his lifetime. Last month, however, his body was exhumed so that a DNA sample could be taken. The results showed conclusively that Fischer is not the father of Young. This finding has put an end to the long legal battle and has brought closure to both parties involved. Fischer's legacy remains intact as a chess legend, but the paternity case has tarnished his reputation. Young, on the other hand, can now move on and live her life without the stigma of being an illegitimate child. The case has also highlighted the importance of DNA testing in resolving legal disputes. It is a powerful tool that can be used to determine paternity, identify criminals, and exonerate the wrongly accused. It remains to be seen whether this case will have any impact on future paternity cases. However, it is clear that DNA testing has become an indispensable part of the legal system, and its role will only continue to grow in the years to come. In conclusion, the long-standing paternity case involving Bobby Fischer has finally come to an end. The DNA results have shown that Fischer is not the father of Jinky Young, and her lawyer has expressed her relief that the case has finally been resolved. Fischer's legacy remains intact as a chess legend, but the paternity case has left a stain on his reputation. Nonetheless, this case has highlighted the significance of DNA testing in resolving legal disputes and will have a lasting impact on the legal system for years to come.
