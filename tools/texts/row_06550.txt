Worried: The girl has gone to court after her family allegedly scheduled her a birth centre appointment to have an abortion (file picture) A pregnant 14-year-old girl has gone to court after her family allegedly scheduled her a birth centre appointment to have an abortion. She claims her adult cousins, whom she lives with in Corpus Christi, Texas, stopped her going to school and threatened to beat her up. Judge Missy Medary has barred the girl’s family from forcing her to make any decisions on the abortion until at least Thursday next week. ‘One family member threw her into the car on her stomach, and said: "I'm going to beat you until you decide otherwise”,’ her lawyer told ABC News. Stephen Casey added that he wants his client to be protected and ‘assert her rights’ to avoid her being physically or emotionally harmed. The girl's grandmother Carmen Pantoja has denied the allegations against her family but admitted that she did suggest an abortion. ‘I advised her to have it,’ Ms Pantoja told ABC News. ‘That's not the same as forcing her. Nobody forced her do anything.’ The girl secretly texted the pro-life legal group Texas Center for the Defense of Life when she was seven weeks pregnant.

chatgpt: A Texas teenager has received a temporary restraining order against her family members, citing threats of violence. The unnamed teenager, who has been staying with her boyfriend's family since the incident, claims that her adult cousins threatened to beat her up. The situation began when the girl's grandmother allegedly offered advice that the teenager found insulting. This led to a heated argument between the two, during which the girl's adult cousins got involved. According to the teenager, the cousins threatened her physical harm and she felt forced to flee for her safety. Since then, the teenager has been staying with her boyfriend's family, who have been supportive of her. The temporary restraining order, which was granted by a local court, prohibits the family members in question from coming into contact with the teenager until further notice. The grandmother has denied any wrongdoing, stating that she only offered advice to her granddaughter. She claims that she had no knowledge of the alleged threats made by the girl's cousins, and denies that any such threats were ever made. The situation has caused tension within the family, with some members taking sides and others trying to remain impartial. It remains to be seen how the situation will be resolved, and whether the teenager will be able to return to her family home. Cases such as these highlight the importance of families maintaining healthy communication and managing disagreements in a respectful manner. While disagreements can be natural in any family, it is important to avoid escalating them to the point of physical threats or violence. For now, the teenager will continue to stay with her boyfriend's family and the temporary restraining order will remain in effect. It is unclear how long this arrangement will last, but hopefully, the family will be able to come to a peaceful resolution in the near future.
