article: (CNN) -- The man accused in the brutal killing of Arkansas television anchor Anne Pressly will appear next Thursday in Pulaski County Circuit Court, where he will enter a plea in the high-profile case. Anne Pressly, 26, was a news anchor at KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Curtis Lavell Vance, 28, was formally charged Thursday with capital murder, rape, residential burglary and theft, Prosecutor Larry Jegley said Friday. Neither he nor police would discuss details of the case because of a gag order imposed by the judge. Jegley hasn't said whether he will seek the death penalty. Jegley said Vance, who denies he was in Little Rock, Arkansas, when Pressly was killed, was being held at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. Vance was linked to the killing through DNA testing. Lt. Terry Hastings, spokesman for Little Rock police, told CNN in December that investigators are "110 percent" certain Vance killed Pressly, 26, who was the morning news anchor for KATV, a CNN affiliate. Pressly was found unconscious in her home October 20 and died five days later at a hospital. "She fought for her life. She fought her attacker. Her left hand was broken from trying to fight this man off," Pressly's mother, Patti Cannady, told NBC. "Six weeks ago this morning, I found my daughter beyond recognition with every bone in her face broken, her nose broken, her jaw pulverized so badly that the bone had come out of it; I actually thought that her throat had possibly been cut. Her entire skull had numerous fractures from which she suffered a massive stroke." Hastings told CNN that DNA evidence also ties Vance to a rape in April in Marianna, Arkansas, about 90 miles east of Little Rock. The affidavit related to the Pressly case, from Little Rock detective Tommy Hudson, said police made contact with Vance at his home in Marianna. Hastings said investigators have found no link between Pressly and Vance, and they do not believe Pressly's being on TV had anything to do with the killing. "I think he saw her someplace, probably followed her home with intention of robbing her. And then went from there." The killer also took Pressly's purse, Hastings said.

chatgpt: After months of investigation, Curtis Lavell Vance, a 28-year-old man, has been charged with capital murder, rape, burglary, and theft in connection with the death of news anchorwoman Anne Pressly.  Pressly was found unconscious in her home in October of last year and died five days later, leaving her loved ones devastated and the community in shock. Vance was linked to the killing through DNA testing, which was a breakthrough in the case that had gone cold for several months.  According to police, DNA evidence also ties Vance to a rape that occurred in April in Marianna, Arkansas. While the victim's name has not been released, authorities are treating the case with utmost seriousness and have urged anyone with information to come forward. Vance's arrest comes as a relief to those who have been following Pressly's case from the beginning, with many hoping that justice would be served. The 28-year-old suspect is currently being held in jail without bond, and his court date has yet to be finalized.  The evidence against Vance is particularly damning, given the DNA matches not only to the murder of Pressly, but also to the rape in Marianna. The authorities have vowed to investigate further and ensure that Vance is held accountable for his alleged actions. Meanwhile, Pressly's loved ones have issued a statement expressing their gratitude to the police and everyone who worked tirelessly to bring the killer to justice. They also requested privacy during this difficult time, as they continue to mourn the loss of their daughter, sister, and friend. Pressly was a well-known and respected news anchorwoman in the Little Rock area, and her death had a profound impact on the community. The charges against Vance bring some measure of closure, but for many, the loss of such a vibrant and talented woman is still keenly felt. As the case moves forward, the authorities will undoubtedly continue to investigate the circumstances that led to Pressly's death and the alleged rape in Marianna. For the moment, however, the community can take some solace in knowing that the suspect has been apprehended and will face justice for his alleged crimes.
