article: (CNN) -- Lasith Malinga became the first bowler to claim a hat-trick of dismissals in two Cricket World Cups as his devastating spell of bowling helped Sri Lanka dismantle Kenya. Malinga took six wickets for just 38 runs including three in three balls as he became the second bowler in as many days to record a hat-trick at the tournament after West Indies' paceman Kemar Roach's feat against Netherlands on Monday. Minnows Kenya had no answer to his fierce spell of bowling, capitulating to 142 all out in Colombo before the hosts lost only one batsman as they recorded a  nine wicket victory in just 18 overs. Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande won the toss and elected to bat but openers Maurice Ouma and Seren Waters fell before eight runs were on the board. Brothers Collins and David Obuya steadied the ship and despite riding their luck both recorded half centuries as Kenya edged to 102-2. Collins reached 52 before he was bowled by Malinga and brother David soon followed, caught by Thilan Samaraweera off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan for 51. That was the end of Kenya's resistance as they lost their last five wickets for just 15 runs with Malinga their chief tormentor. The first victim of his hat-trick was Tanmay Mishra, trapped LBW by a dipping yorker before Peter Ongondo's middle stump was removed by a similar delivery, traveling at 144 km per hour. Malinga secured his second World Cup treble with another vicious yorker that clattered into Shem Ngoche's stumps. Just a few balls later Malinga claimed his sixth victim as he bowled Elijah Otieno to end Kenya's innings on 142. Sri Lanka wasted no time recording victory as Upul Tharanga smashed an unbeaten 67 and put on 72 with Tilkeratne Dilshan, before he was caught by Maurice Ouma off the bowling of Otieno. Captain Kumar Sangakkara hit a quick 27 not out off just 24 balls to seal a comprehensive victory for Sri Lanka, who bounced back in style after their defeat by Pakistan. But the co-hosts will undoubtedly face a much stiffer test in their next match when they face defending champions Australia on Saturday.

chatgpt: Lasith Malinga made history on Tuesday as he became the first bowler in history to take two hat-tricks in World Cup matches. The Sri Lankan fast bowler achieved the feat as his team hammered Kenya by nine wickets at the Cricket World Cup. Kenya was off to a shaky start after losing their opener in the very first over of the game. The rest of the batsmen also failed to make any significant contribution as the entire team was bundled out for a paltry 142 in just 43 overs. Malinga was undoubtedly the shining star with the ball, finishing his 10-over spell with an impressive figure of 3/38. Malinga’s hat-trick came in the 33rd over of the Kenyan innings. He dismissed Tanmay Mishra, Peter Ongondo, and Shem Ngoche in consecutive deliveries to achieve the rare feat. Malinga had previously taken a hat-trick in the 2007 World Cup against South Africa.  Sri Lanka started their chase of the modest target in a confident manner with the openers putting on a solid 95-run partnership. Tillakaratne Dilshan anchored the innings with an unbeaten 44 from 52 balls, while Upul Thuranga played a more aggressive knock of 73 from just 74 balls. The home crowd was delighted as the two batsmen reached the target in just 18 overs with nine wickets in hand. Sri Lanka, who had suffered a setback in their previous game against Pakistan, will take confidence from the clinical performance against Kenya, as they look to progress to the knockout stage of the tournament. "We got a very good start, and I am happy to have bowled well, taken wickets and broken records," Malinga said after the match. "Our target is to qualify for the semi-finals and we have to win all our remaining games." Sri Lanka’s win over Kenya puts them in a good position to qualify for the quarter-finals, and they will be looking to carry forward the momentum in their next game against Australia. On the other hand, Kenya's hopes of progressing to the knockout stage have taken a major blow as they have now suffered three consecutive defeats in the tournament.
