article: (Financial Times) -- A stand-off between two titans of finance, the Bank of Italy and the Vatican, has forced tourists to abandon their visits to the Sistine Chapel -- unless they have cash in their pockets. Italy's central bank has blocked all electronic payments through cash machines and by credit cards in Vatican City following the world's smallest state's failure to fully comply with international anti-money laundering rules. The incident raises further questions about the transparency of the Vatican's finances. Its efforts to adopt international standards in combating money laundering and terrorist financing were given a mixed assessment last July in a study of its financial system. Deutsche Bank's Italian division, which runs a network of cash machines for the Vatican, was refused authorisation from the central bank to continue operating its services within the walled state from the start of the year. The Vatican is not included in the European Commission's "white list" of states that fully comply with international standards against tax fraud and money laundering. In a tightly worded statement, Father Federico Lombardi, head of press relations at the Holy See, said the use of the cash machines inside Vatican City was "at the point of expiry". "Discussions are under way with other providers and we foresee that the interruption to credit card services will be short." A person familiar with the matter said a new provider could be announced on Monday. A report by Moneyval -- Council of Europe experts who examine measures to counter money laundering -- last year passed the Vatican in nine out of 16 core recommendations. It said the city state had to address important issues to demonstrate that a fully effective banking regime existed in practice, signally that it could be a lengthy process before the city state met the standards necessary to be accepted into the white list of countries. A message on the Vatican Museums website apologises to visitors for any inconvenience, blaming "reasons beyond the control of the directorate of museums".

chatgpt: Italy has blocked payments through cash machines and by credit cards in Vatican City after the world's smallest state failed to comply with anti-money laundering rules. The move comes after a lack of progress from the Vatican in improving their financial transparency and efforts to combat money-laundering.  The Italian Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) implemented the ban after concerns were raised that the Vatican had not taken sufficient measures to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The ban fans the flames of an already tense relationship between Italy and the Vatican, who have been at odds over a range of issues, from tax evasion to corruption. The Vatican has long been criticized for opaque financial transactions and a lack of accountability. In 2012, the Holy See was caught up in a major money-laundering scandal involving an Italian bank that resulted in the arrest of its president and financial director. Since then, the Vatican has taken steps to clean up its finances and has implemented new laws to prevent such occurrences in the future. However, the Italian government is still not satisfied with the level of transparency and is continuing to push for stricter laws and regulations. Meanwhile, the Vatican maintains that it has made significant progress in recent years and that Italy's decision to block transactions is unwarranted. The ban has caused frustration for many visitors to Vatican City, who have been unable to withdraw cash or use their credit cards. However, authorities have assured the public that the ban will only be temporary and that they will work to find a solution that complies with both Italian and Vatican laws. While the ban may cause some inconvenience, it is an important step towards increasing transparency in Vatican City's financial transactions. The Vatican, as the spiritual and moral center of the Catholic Church, has a duty to ensure that its finances are clean and above reproach. By complying with anti-money laundering rules and regulations, the Vatican can help to set an example for other organizations and institutions around the world. In conclusion, Italy's decision to block payments through cash machines and credit cards in Vatican City highlights the ongoing struggle to increase transparency and combat money laundering. While the ban may cause some short-term discomfort, it is an important step towards ensuring that the Vatican's finances are clean and above reproach. It remains to be seen what further actions Italy will take to enforce anti-money laundering laws, but it is clear that the Vatican must continue to work towards greater transparency and accountability.
