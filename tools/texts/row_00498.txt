article: (CNN) -- Two Iranian warships have docked in Sudan carrying "a message of support and friendship," Sudanese state media said. The ships arrived in Port Sudan on Sunday and will stay until Wednesday, according to SUNA, the official Sudanese news agency. The presence "clearly shows the solid support of political and diplomatic relationships between the Sudanese and Iranian navies," the agency quoted Sudanese army spokesman Savarmi Khaled Saad as saying Monday. The warships arrived less than a week after a weapons factory in Khartoum was bombed, killing two people, in what Sudanese officials said was an airstrike by Israel. Sudan blames Israel for weapons factory blast . Israel has declined to comment on the attack in the east African country. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing last Tuesday. The Sudanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement Monday condemning what it called "a brutal assault carried out by the State of Israel" on the Yarmouk Industrial Complex, SUNA said. It also dismissed suggestions that the weapons factory was manufacturing arms for Iran or its allies, denying "any link between the Sudanese military manufacturing output and any external party," according to SUNA . The statement accused Israel of using "misleading leaks" to the media to allege that the factory had ties "to the states of Iran and Syria and to the Islamic Resistance Movement in Palestine (Hamas), and to Hezbollah in Lebanon." Iran has no need for weapons to be manufactured in Sudan, the Foreign Ministry statement insisted. That assertion was repeated Monday by IRNA, Iran's state-run news agency. Iran last week condemned what it also says was an Israeli airstrike on Khartoum, and it called the strike a clear violation of international laws, according to the news agency. An Iranian flotilla that left Iranian waters in September included a navy helicopter carrier and a destroyer, IRNA reported. It "aimed to echo the message of peace and friendship to the neighboring states and guarantee security of the seafaring and shipping lines vis-a-vis sea piracy," the news agency said. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.

chatgpt: According to recent reports from Sudanese state media, two Iranian warships have docked at Port Sudan. Both countries have been quick to state that the visit is a demonstration of their strong support and friendship, however, this has raised concerns across the region given the latest developments. The visit comes as Sudan accuses Israel of launching an airstrike which destroyed an arms factory in the country last week. It is believed that both Iran and Sudan have been quick to blame Israel for the attack, however, Sudan has denied that the arms factory was producing weapons for either Iran or its allies. This latest development is likely to raise further tensions in the region, particularly given the ongoing hostility between Iran and Israel. While Iran and Sudan continue to express their desire to build stronger ties, the visit of these two warships to Port Sudan is likely to be viewed with suspicion by many in the region. It is worth noting that Iran and Sudan have had close ties for a number of years. Both countries have been subjected to international sanctions and have been accused of supporting extremist groups, which has brought them closer together. However, the recent airstrike has highlighted the fragility of their relationship and the ongoing geopolitical situation in the region. Many experts believe that this latest development could also have wider implications for the relationship between Israel and Sudan. The two countries recently signed a landmark agreement to normalize their relations, which was seen as a significant step towards regional stability. However, this recent attack on the arms factory in Sudan is likely to have strained this relationship, particularly given the accusations coming from both Iran and Sudan that Israel was behind the attack. Overall, the visit of the two Iranian warships to Port Sudan is likely to be viewed with suspicion by many in the region. While Iran and Sudan continue to express their desire for closer ties, the ongoing geopolitical situation in the region and the recent airstrike on the arms factory is likely to complicate matters further. It remains to be seen how this latest development will impact the wider stability of the region and the relationship between Iran, Sudan, and Israel.
