The club's new manager, Louis van Gaal, has been keen on bringing the player to Old Trafford since last summer and has made him his first signing in charge of the Reds. The deal was made possible after Herrera's agent traveled to London to negotiate the terms of the contract. It is said that Manchester United will offer the Spanish international a four-year deal that will see him earn £50,000 a week. This transfer deal is a culmination of a long pursuit by United for the talented midfielder. In fact, Manchester United had previously tried to sign Herrera last summer, but negotiations reached a standstill when the Red Devils refused to pay the release clause on his contract. Despite United failing in their attempts to sign Herrera last season, the club's interest in the player remained steadfast. The Spanish international has ranked highly on the radar of United's new manager, Louis van Gaal, who will see him as a vital cog in his rejuvenation plans for the fallen giants of English football. Herrera has made 128 appearances for Athletic Bilbao during his four-year spell at the club. He has been a backbone for the Spanish side's midfield, dictating the rhythm of the team's play and providing a constant flow of creativity and energy. His signing is expected to add some much-needed spark in Manchester United's midfield, a department that is yet to recover from the retirement of club legend Paul Scholes.

He expressed his gratitude to Athletic Bilbao fans and the club's hierarchy for their support during his stay, but he now looks forward to representing Manchester United. On the other hand, Manchester United fans will be thrilled with the club's new signing. Herrera's quality on the ball and his tenacious work rate off it, make him an ideal fit for United's midfield. United fans have been calling on the club hierarchy to sign a marquee player, and although Herrera may not be quite in that category, his signing is a step in the right direction for the club. Van Gaal's cunningness in the transfer market is evident in his capture of Herrera, and fans will look forward to seeing how he settles in at the Theatre of Dreams. In conclusion, Herrera's signing offers Manchester United a renewed sense of optimism, and fans will be hoping that he is only the first of many exciting signings to come for the Red Devils.
