chatgpt: Celebrities are a constant subject of fascination, and that is especially true when they're going through a divorce. Thursday, actress Katie Holmes filed for divorce from her husband, actor Tom Cruise. The news broke soon after her attorney announced the filing. Cruise's publicist quickly released a statement on behalf of the couple asking for privacy so they can "work this out." It's clear that the public is interested in every detail of this high-profile split, but they seem to be taking the advice to heart as there are no photos of the couple or their children, Suri, Connor, and Isabella, being taken by paparazzi. "Tom is very sad about it and is concentrating on the kids," said Holmes' lawyer. "He just wants to make sure that they're okay." The couple married in 2006, seven months after their daughter, Suri, was born. They had been dating for a little over a year at the time they got married. Since then, they have been among the most talked-about couples in Hollywood. Holmes has been focused on her career and has taken on a number of roles in movies, TV shows, and on stage. Cruise, on the other hand, has continued to make block-buster movies and was recently in the news for his role in "Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol." He's also been a controversial figure, with his involvement with Scientology often being discussed in the media. The cause of the couple's split is not yet known, but rumors are already swirling. Some have suggested that Cruise's commitment to Scientology caused tension in the marriage, while others have speculated that a disagreement over the couple's lifestyle could be the cause. Despite the rumors, both Holmes and Cruise have remained silent. There have been no statements from either of them beyond the initial one released by the publicist. This is not the first time Cruise has gone through a divorce. He was previously married to Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman, both of whom he has children with. Holmes was previously engaged to actor Chris Klein. Now, people are left to wait and see what the future holds for Holmes, Cruise, and their children. The couple had been known to be a loving and devoted family, with Cruise often doting on his wife and showering her with gifts. It's unclear how the divorce will affect the couple's children, but sources close to the family say that they're likely to handle it well. For now, all eyes are on Holmes and Cruise. With so much attention being paid to their marriage over the years, it's no surprise that the divorce is generating such a buzz. As they embark on this new chapter in their lives, fans will be watching closely to see what happens next.
