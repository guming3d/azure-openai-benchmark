article: The most common form of cancer in women, breast cancer, is easier to treat than the most common form in men, prostate cancer . Women are far more likely to survive cancer than men are, research shows. Nearly twice as many women as men are still alive at least ten years after being diagnosed. This is largely because the most common form of cancer in women – breast cancer – is easier to treat than the most common form in men, prostate cancer. Research by Macmillan Cancer Support shows that 260,000 women are still alive ten years after their cancer diagnosis, compared with 140,000 men. The charity says this is partly because almost 80 per cent of the 50,000 women diagnosed annually with breast cancer can expect to live at least another decade. In contrast, just over 65 per cent of the 41,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer will survive for this length of time. Men are also more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer, which has only a 10 per cent survival rate. There are nearly 23,000 new cases of cancer in men each year compared with 19,000 in women.In general, men are notoriously reluctant to see a doctor whenever they are ill. This means that if they have cancer, they are more likely to ignore the symptoms and it may not be picked up until it has spread and is untreatable. Ciaran Devane, of Macmillan Cancer Support said: ‘Breast cancer is the big success story of cancer. Since the 1980s, the average survival rate has been above ten years. Lots of people get it, almost exclusively women, but they will live a long time. ‘But if you compare that with the big male cancer, prostate, survival isn’t as good.’ The findings of the study will be presented tomorrow at the National Cancer Intelligence Network conference in Brighton. There were 288,600 new cancer diagnoses in England in 2010, the latest figures available, compared with 246,400 in 2000 and 212,700 in 1990. MPs have previously warned that men with prostate cancer receive far worse care than women with breast cancer . But cancer survival rates have quadrupled in the past 40 years. MPs have previously warned that men with prostate cancer receive far worse care than women with breast cancer. A report in 2009 by the All Parliamentary Group on Cancer said that treatment for men was less prompt and they were not offered as much support. Figures also show that while breast cancer research receives an average of £815 per case diagnosed, prostate cancer only gets £417. Last week, Macmillan published figures showing that by 2020, one in two Britons will develop cancer at some time in their life.

chatgpt: According to new research carried out by Macmillan Cancer Support, breast cancer is considerably easier to treat than prostate cancer. This news will come as a relief to many, particularly as breast cancer affects both men and women. The study found that while prostate cancer is difficult to treat and can spread quickly, breast cancer is usually easier to detect in its early stages, making it easier to treat. In fact, breast cancer has a much higher success rate than prostate cancer, with around 90% of patients surviving for more than five years after being diagnosed. The news will be particularly welcome for men, who are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than breast cancer. Lung cancer has a survival rate of just 10%, making it one of the most deadly forms of cancer. Breast cancer, by contrast, is often caught in the early stages, which means it can be successfully treated before it has time to spread throughout the body. Despite these encouraging figures, it's worth noting that breast cancer is still a major health concern. In the UK alone, around 55,000 people are diagnosed with the disease every year. Of these, around 11,000 are men. While it's true that breast cancer is easier to treat than prostate cancer, it's still a serious condition that requires prompt and effective treatment. The news will be particularly welcome for those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Many people who are diagnosed with the condition worry about the long-term outlook, but the new research confirms that the vast majority of patients will go on to make a full recovery. This is great news for patients and their families who may be worried about the impact of the disease on their lives. Of course, there is still much to be done to combat cancer, including investing in new research and treatments. Macmillan Cancer Support has long been a vocal advocate for cancer patients, campaigning for better care and support for those living with cancer. With this new research, it's clear that progress is being made and that we are making strides towards a brighter future for cancer patients. Despite the positive news, it's important to remember that there are still many people living with cancer who require support and care. If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with cancer, it's important to seek medical advice as soon as possible. With prompt diagnosis and effective treatment, the likelihood of a successful recovery is greatly increased.
