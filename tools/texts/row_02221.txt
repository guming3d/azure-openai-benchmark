article: The daughter of a wealthy Fifa delegate who helped in the controversial decision to name Qatar and Russia future hosts of the World Cup received a £2million payment from a business associate of her father with Qatari links, it has been claimed. Antonia Wigand Teixeira, the daughter of Brazil's Fifa representative Ricardo Teixeira, was paid the large sum of money in 2011. It is not certain from whom the funds came, but it is thought that Sandro Rossell, the former president of Qatar-sponsored Barcelona football club, was behind the transfer. Transfer: The money was paid to the daughter of Ricardo Teixeira, former Fifa representative from Brazil . Documents seen by the Daily Telegraph show that Miss Teixeira was given the money on June 22 2010, when she was 10 years old. The payment is the latest in a series of financial revelations surrounding Fifa's decision to award the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. An investigation has been launched by Fifa into the bidding process, and is scrutinising the business dealings of several committee members. 'Source': Sandro Rosell, former president of Barcelona FC, is thought to have transferred the funds . A report by Michael Garcia, a chief investigator on Fifa's ethics committee, is expected to be delivered later this year. The Qatari bid in particular has drawn criticism as the country does not have a strong footballing reputation, and temperatures are often as high as 40C, raising questions about the practically of hosting a football tournament there. Probe: Fifa ethics investigator Michael Garcia is scrutinising business dealings of committee members . Mr Teixeira stepped down from the Fifa committee in 2012 - after the crucial decisions had been made. Brazilian police have recently begun their own investigation into his activities. He has recently moved to Miami. Those in charge of Qatar's World Cup efforts have denied that the payment was in exchange for Mr Teixeira's support - and say it has no relation to the bid. The Qatar bid's legal team has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Mr Teixeira was a member of the Fifa executive committee for 22 years. He has also been embroiled in corruption scandals over allegations that he took bribes from a company which was given exclusive rights to market the World Cup. Mr Rosell was president of Barcelona football club until January this year. He stepped down after a judge agreed to hear a case alleging that his misappropriated funds from a transfer deal. Barcelona counts Qatar Airways - which is wholly owned by the Qatari government - as a major sponsor. They have pledged almost €100million to sponsor the club's shirts. Neither Mr Teixeira nor Mr Rosell responded to questions from the Telegraph.

chatgpt: A shocking revelation has come to light regarding the payment of £2 million to Antonia Wigand Teixeira, aged just 10 at the time. Her father, Ricardo Teixeira, was serving as Brazil's representative to FIFA when he assisted in the decision to host the World Cup in Russia and Qatar. It is now believed that the payment was made by Sandro Rosell, former president of Barcelona FC, which is sponsored by state-owned Qatar Airways. Questions have been raised about the legitimacy of this payment, particularly given the involvement of Qatar in the bidding process for the World Cup. Lawyers for Qatar's World Cup bid team have vehemently denied any wrongdoing, asserting that the payment was a private matter that has nothing to do with the bidding process. Despite these assurances, there is growing concern that this payment may have influenced the decision to award the World Cup to Russia and Qatar. The suspicion is that it may have been a bribe meant to sway Teixeira's vote, given the involvement of Qatar Airways as a sponsor of Barcelona FC. This scandal has brought renewed attention to the ongoing controversy surrounding the next two World Cup tournaments, with many questioning the legitimacy of the decision to award them to Russia and Qatar. Concerns about corruption, human rights abuses, and other issues have dogged these events from the beginning, and this latest revelation has only added fuel to the fire. It is worth noting that this payment was made back in 2011, and there is no evidence that Teixeira was directly influenced by it. However, the fact that it was made at all raises significant concerns about the integrity of the bidding process and FIFA as a whole. It remains to be seen what, if any, action will be taken in response to these latest allegations. For now, lawyers for Qatar's World Cup bid team continue to assert their innocence, while calls for more transparency and accountability in FIFA's decision-making processes grow louder by the day. This scandal serves as a stark reminder of the need for greater transparency and accountability in the world of international sports. FIFA has long been plagued by accusations of corruption and other forms of misconduct, and only time will tell if these issues can be addressed effectively moving forward.
