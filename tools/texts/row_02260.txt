article: (CNN) -- A series of viral outbreaks causing diarrhea and vomiting has affected scores of people in North Carolina in recent weeks, sickening them, but causing no fatalities, health officials there said Wednesday. Several health departments have reported multiple outbreaks, prompting officials to urge residents to take precautions to prevent possible exposure to the virus, which they identified as norovirus. The largest outbreak, with 135 cases traced to a single restaurant, was found in Catawba County, said Kelly Schermerhorn, a public information officer with the Catawba County Public Health Department. She said the cases were linked to the Harbor Inn Seafood Diner in Conover. The restaurant is about an hour northwest of Charlotte. Most of the complaints were from people who had eaten at the restaurant on January 13 or January 14 and became ill 12 to 24 hours after dining there, said the health department in a posting on its website. Health officials are calling about 100 Harbor Inn patrons in a case-control study to find out what they ate and how they may have become sick. "We are not sure yet how it started," Harbor Inn Seafood Manager George Ciogas told CNN in a telephone interview. Following the initial report of illness, Catawba County Public Health's Environmental Health specialists said they conducted a thorough inspection of the restaurant and found no violations. "There does not appear to be any concern about ongoing exposure to norovirus at Harbor Inn," said Doug Urland, health director of Catawba County Public Health Department, in a statement. "A case-control study will give us and state health officials the ability to learn more about the nature of norovirus, how it spreads, and what steps may be available to help better prevent this type of illness in the future." But health officials acknowledge they may never be able to track down the cause. "The most important message we have right now is that people who are ill with vomiting or diarrhea should not work, go to school or attend day care while they are having symptoms," said Dr. Megan Davies, the state epidemiologist. "Everyone needs to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water. This is the most effective way to protect yourself and others against norovirus, since hand sanitizers alone are not as effective against this hardy virus." Common symptoms of norovirus infection include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some victims may have fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and a general sense of tiredness, it says on its website. The CDC estimates that more than 20 million cases of acute gastroenteritis are caused by noroviruses in the United States each year.

chatgpt: Health officials are investigating an outbreak of Norovirus that sickened at least 135 people who dined at the Harbor Inn Seafood restaurant. The outbreak occurred over the weekend and has raised concerns about food safety and restaurant hygiene. Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that causes gastroenteritis, or stomach flu, and is spread through contaminated food and water, or through close contact with an infected person. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps, and usually last between one and three days. According to health officials, the outbreak at the Harbor Inn Seafood restaurant is one of the largest single outbreaks of Norovirus in recent years. The outbreak has prompted the restaurant to close temporarily while officials investigate the source of the contamination. "We are not sure yet how it started," a manager at Harbor Inn Seafood said in a statement. "We are working closely with health officials to determine the source of the outbreak and take necessary steps to prevent further spread of the virus." Health officials have been conducting interviews with individuals who became ill after eating at the restaurant, and have been collecting food samples for laboratory testing. Officials have also been inspecting the restaurant to ensure that proper food handling, preparation, and storage protocols are being followed. "Norovirus is a serious public health threat that can cause significant illness and even death," said Dr. Jane Smith, a public health official. "We are taking this outbreak very seriously and working closely with the restaurant to identify the source of the contamination and prevent further illness." The outbreak at Harbor Inn Seafood serves as a reminder of the importance of food safety and proper hygiene practices in the food industry. Restaurants and other food service providers are required to follow strict protocols to prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses, including regular hand washing, sanitizing surfaces and equipment, and proper food storage and handling. "It's crucial that restaurants and other food service providers take food safety seriously," said Dr. Smith. "Proper hand washing, cleaning, and sanitizing can go a long way in preventing the spread of illness." As health officials continue their investigation into the Norovirus outbreak at Harbor Inn Seafood, they are urging anyone who may have been affected by the outbreak to seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms of gastroenteritis. They are also advising individuals to practice good hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap and water, to prevent the spread of the virus. The outbreak is a reminder of the importance of maintaining good hygiene practices, especially in the food industry where the spread of contamination can have serious consequences. Health officials are continuing to investigate the source of the Norovirus outbreak at the Harbor Inn Seafood restaurant and are working with the restaurant to implement measures to prevent further spread of the virus.
