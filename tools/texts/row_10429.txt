article: (CNN) -- Here's a glimpse, dear reader, into the private Facebook musings of your humble correspondent. "I love the ship and dam signs. I'm going to help out George Lucas." "Well, I will never be." "puts the competition in a Nyan Cat tie." "Ewoks are small, feral teddy bears who can paint a picture." "Postscript Holy hell, the internets." OK ... maybe those would be his musings if he was an opium-fueled Beat poet who, apparently, thinks too much about "Star Wars." But they're just the sort of status updates that are captivating millions of Facebook users this week, thanks to a new tool dreamed up during a caffeine-enhanced hacking binge at Princeton University. "What Would I Say?" is a simple concept. You go to the website and give it permission to access your Facebook profile. It will then suggest random new status updates for you, stitched together from random words and phrases you've posted to Facebook in the past. Keep obsessively clicking "Generate Status," and the jumble of phrases pulled from your past status updates will create existential poetry. Or silliness. Or existential silliness. "We drank a lot of coffee and Red Bull and thought of fun things we could program that we could actually complete in a day and a half," Ugne Klibaite, part of the seven-member team that created the site, told the New Yorker. The effort was part of a hackathon last weekend at Princeton. All of the team members (apart from a Yorkipoo named Baxter) are Princeton graduate-school students. "This was just for fun," Klibaite said. "We never thought we would get further than showing this off at the Hackathon and to our friends on Facebook." But soon, the app, which lets users post the results of their random generations straight to Facebook, had gone viral on the social network. It wasn't long before they were being shared on Twitter, too. "All of my what-would-i-say statuses are either highly accurate, inappropriate, or make me sound like I'm drunk and/or can't English," one user wrote. The simple little tool is oddly fascinating. On top of the serendipity of mashing together words that, occasionally, form something better than the original posts, each refresh sparks a moment of nostalgia as you try to remember your original updates. Of course, that sort of Internet rabbit hole has its dangers. "I found myself quickly tired of the ones that other people were sharing, and drawn back to my own, sure that they were funnier or contained more depth," Ian Crouch wrote in the New Yorker piece. "Narcissism and nostalgia are two of the driving forces of Facebook's popularity, and this new app combines both quite neatly."

Some post pictures, others share links to interesting articles, and then there are those who use the Facebook app "What Would I Say?" to generate status updates that are like bizarre poetry. The app was the result of a weekend hackathon at Princeton, where a group of graduate students came together to brainstorm and build new applications. "What Would I Say?" was one of the creations, and it quickly gained popularity beyond the hackathon. The concept behind the app is simple: it generates status updates based on the user's Facebook history. The app uses an algorithm to analyze the user's past posts and status updates, and then randomly combines them to generate a new status update.

Users can post their random results straight to Facebook, and many have found that their friends and followers enjoy the unusual updates. The app has become a hit among Facebook users, with many using it as a way to add some fun and creativity to their feeds. The graduate students who created "What Would I Say?" say they didn't expect it to spread so widely. They thought it would be a fun project for the hackathon, but they never imagined it would become as popular as it has. "It's been amazing to see how many people have used the app and shared their results," said one of the creators. "We just wanted to build something fun and unique, and we're thrilled that it has resonated with so many people." The success of "What Would I Say?" highlights the importance of creativity and innovation in the tech world. With so many apps and platforms vying for users' attention, it takes something special to stand out and capture people's imaginations. For Facebook users looking to spice up their status updates, "What Would I Say?" is a great choice. Its random and often surreal updates are sure to get a reaction, whether it's laughter, confusion, or just a raised eyebrow. And for tech enthusiasts, the app is a reminder of the power of inquisitive and creative minds. Sometimes the best ideas come from unexpected places – like a weekend hackathon at a university.
