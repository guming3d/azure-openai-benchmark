All incoming sixth-graders had been originally expected to write a graded-essay on the book, until outraged parents raised their objections. The award-winning young adult novel, by author Sherman Alexie, is about a Native American boy who transfers into an all-white high school. It includes lines such as: ‘And if God hadn’t wanted us to masturbate, then God wouldn’t have given us thumbs. So I thank God for my thumbs.’ One angry parent said she didn’t want the school dictating when she had to discuss masturbation with her son. ‘It’s about... masturbation - which is not appropriate for my child to learn at 11,’ Kelly-Ann McMullan-Preiss, 39, told the New York Daily News. 'It was like "Fifty Shades of Grey’ for kids."'

'Everything in the book is what every kid in that school is dealing with on a daily basis, whether it’s masturbation or racism or sexism or the complications of being human,' he told The Bulletin a the time. 'To pretend that kids aren’t dealing with this on an hour-by-hour basis is a form of denial.' The book won the 2007 National Book Foundation award for Young People's Literature.

chatgpt: Queens, New York - A recent incident at a local school has sparked controversy among parents and educators alike. A book called "The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian" was assigned to 6th-grade students at the school, prompting outrage from parents who felt the content was inappropriate for their children. While the book has been praised for its portrayal of Native American culture and the challenges faced by Indigenous youth, some parents objected to its depictions of sexuality and drug use. One mother likened the book to "Fifty Shades of Grey" for kids. The school initially defended its decision to include the book in its curriculum. However, after several parents expressed concerns over having to explain masturbation and other mature themes to their 11-year-olds, the school ultimately decided to remove the book from the curriculum. In a statement, the school acknowledged the concerns of parents while also expressing its commitment to offering a diverse range of literature to its students. "While we believe that 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' is an important work of literature that offers valuable insights into the experiences of Indigenous youth, we also understand that some parents may not feel comfortable with its content," the statement read. The incident has brought up larger questions about censorship and the role of parents in shaping their children's education. Some educators argue that exposing students to controversial or uncomfortable topics is an important part of their development, prompting them to think critically about the world around them. Others, however, feel that parents should have more control over what their children are exposed to in the classroom. In an interview with local news outlet WCBS, one concerned parent said, "I think parents should have the right to decide what their children should be reading. That's our job as parents." The debate over the appropriateness of "The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian" serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by educators in creating a curriculum that is both engaging and appropriate for all students. While schools must strive to expose students to a diverse range of perspectives and experiences, they must also be mindful of the concerns of parents and the sensitivities of their students. Ultimately, the decision to include any particular book in a school's curriculum must be a thoughtful and nuanced one, taking into account both the literary merits of the work and the potential impact it may have on students and their families.
