article: New York (CNN) -- For New Yorkers, a gambling fix is now just a subway ride away. The first casino in New York City opened Friday at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens to thousands of eager gamblers, some waiting hours to get in. "It was such a hassle to get in, but I'm glad I'm here," said Carmen Beverly, who said she took the subway to the casino from her home in nearby Brooklyn. "Not winning anything yet, but I'm having fun." The Resorts World Casino hit capacity almost immediately after opening, organizers said. Lines stretched around the building as police struggled to contain hundreds of people hoping for opening-day luck. Backers of the casino said they hope its close proximity to the airport and the subway will make it a draw for New Yorkers and tourists alike. It is the first casino to be built in New York City since the state legislature paved the way for its construction during the post-September 11, 2001, economic slump. "Finally New York gets money," said Helen Alamia, a slots player who said she would no longer travel to out-of-state casinos. "We're giving it to Pennsylvania and Jersey, now New York gets it, I'm very happy." Because of a technicality in the 2001 law, the casino features only video games, no live dealers. Nonetheless, Gordon Medenica, director of the New York Lottery, espoused the casino's contribution to state funds. "This facility will probably increase our video lottery income by 50%," Medenica said. Video lottery is the organization's fastest-growing source of income, he said. Some customers expressed disappointment that they would not be able to gamble with a live dealer, but most seemed happy just to have a casino nearby. Billboards for the casino advertise it as being "minutes, not hours away," a clear swipe at the more well-known -- and farther away -- gambling sites of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Indian reservations such as Foxwoods in Connecticut. "It's not competition with Las Vegas," said Mike Speller, president of Resorts World Casino. "We are 10 minutes from JFK -- 55 million customers a year come in there. We are 25 minutes from Manhattan -- another 50 million tourists come in there. So we think it's going to be a very, very busy place."

chatgpt: For visitors looking for a unique gambling experience in Queens, the Resorts World Casino is often a popular destination. However, some visitors are finding that the wait time to get in can be quite long. One major feature of the Resorts World Casino is that it only features video games, with no live dealers at any of its tables. While this may be disappointing for some, others find it to be a refreshing change of pace from traditional casinos. The casino was constructed during a particularly difficult economic time for New York City: the post-9/11 economic slump. However, the state legislature was able to pave the way for the construction of the casino, which has helped to boost the economy in the area. Despite its initial success, some visitors have expressed frustration with the long wait times to enter the casino. Some have reported waiting hours just to get inside, and many are wondering how the casino plans to address these issues. One possible solution could be to expand the physical space of the casino, allowing for more visitors to enter at once. However, this may be easier said than done, given that the casino currently sits on a relatively small plot of land. Another option would be to implement a reservation system for visitors, similar to those found at popular restaurants or theme parks. This could help to better manage the flow of visitors and reduce wait times for those who have made reservations in advance. Despite these challenges, the Resorts World Casino remains a popular destination for many visitors looking for a unique gaming experience in Queens. With its focus on video games and no live dealers, it offers a different type of atmosphere compared to traditional casinos, and has helped to boost the local economy since its construction. As the casino continues to grow in popularity, it will be interesting to see how it adapts to handle the influx of visitors and ensure that everyone has a positive experience while visiting.
