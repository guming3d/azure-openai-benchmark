'They defended a lot and they defended well. It is not a crime, it is a strategy and they did well in their approach. 'My players tried everything. We got a little bit tired but I have nothing negative to say about my people. I think Sunderland defended very, very well. 'We didn't change our football, we tried always to play. We tried fresh people to give us a bit more in attack but the game was always difficult for us.' Lee Cattermole was impressive in his role restricting the attacking space for Chelsea's midfielders .

chatgpt: In a tightly contested Premier League clash, Chelsea were held to a frustrating goalless draw by Sunderland. The match was played at the Stadium of Light and despite Chelsea’s best efforts, they were unable to find the back of the net against their stubborn opponents. It was the first time this season that Chelsea had failed to score in a Premier League game, and it was only the third time that they had dropped points in the league this season. With a comfortable lead at the top of the table, this result is unlikely to have a major impact on Chelsea’s title aspirations, but it will be a source of frustration for manager Jose Mourinho. After the match, Mourinho was critical of Sunderland’s approach to the game, suggesting that only one team was trying to win the match. Speaking to the media, he said: “We played against a team that didn't want to play”, before adding: “It's very difficult when a team doesn't want to play. They had nine players behind the ball, they had time for everything, they had time to go to the bathroom.” Despite Mourinho’s criticisms, Sunderland can be proud of their performance. They were organised, disciplined and put in a tremendous amount of effort to keep Chelsea at bay. The home crowd played a crucial role in inspiring the Sunderland players, and they were fully behind their team for the entire 90 minutes. For Chelsea, the draw will be seen as a missed opportunity. They dominated possession and created a number of chances, but they were unable to find the breakthrough that their fans so desperately craved. The likes of Diego Costa and Eden Hazard were well-marshalled by the Sunderland defence, and Chelsea will need to find a way to break down stubborn opposition in the future if they are to maintain their impressive run of form. Overall, the goalless draw was a fair result, and both teams can take positives from the game. For Sunderland, the point could prove to be invaluable in their battle to avoid relegation, while Chelsea will have to regroup ahead of their next Premier League fixture. Regardless of the result, it was a hard-fought and entertaining match that showcased the best of the English top-flight.
