article: By . Louise Eccles . Elizabeth Rose, 25, who has lost an appeal to have her eggs frozen despite facing chemotherapy treatment . An artist suffering from Crohn’s disease has lost an appeal to have her eggs frozen on the NHS before she undergoes ­chemotherapy treatment. Elizabeth Rose, 25, fears that an ­‘imminent’ bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy to treat a severe form of the disease will cause early menopause and render her infertile. Clinicians at King’s College Hospital, in south east London, applied on her behalf for funding so her eggs could be frozen. But when Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group refused to pay for the £4,000 treatment, Miss Rose took it to the High Court, claiming that its ­decision was ‘unlawful’. Miss Rose, of Margate, Kent, said she was a victim of a ‘postcode lottery’ because the treatment is available to other single women elsewhere in the UK. She accused Thanet CCG of breaking the law by not implementing NICE guidelines, introduced early last year, that egg freezing should be funded on the NHS where medical treatment could affect fertility. Mr Justice Jay dismissed her appeal, claiming Miss Rose ‘has failed to demonstrate any public law unlawfulness’. He said that NICE could not demand ‘an immediate change of policy’ when it brought in new clinical guidelines. However, he said Thanet CCG’s new policy, introduced this month, was in breach of the guidelines because it continued to refuse funding for freezing eggs. Miss Rose’s lawyer Merry Varney said an . urgent application would be made to Thanet CCG to reconsider her case . ‘within a matter of days’. Staff at King's College Hospital, in south east London, applied on Miss Rose's behalf for funding so her eggs could be frozen . Miss Rose holds a degree in fine art from London’s Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Since 2012, she has been too ill to work and receives disability ­allowance. She said she cannot afford to fund the egg freezing herself. Thanet CCG said it would consider the full written judgement carefully, working closely with NHS England. ‘If necessary we will review our policy on the freezing of eggs,’ said a spokesman.

chatgpt: Elizabeth Rose, a 25-year-old woman from Kent, has lost her legal battle to have her eggs frozen on the National Health Service (NHS). Rose, who has been diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, decided to take legal action after the Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) refused to cover the costs of freezing her eggs. Rose's doctors at King's College Hospital had applied on her behalf, citing her fear that the chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant she is due to undergo could leave her infertile. The case was heard at the High Court on Tuesday by Mr. Justice Jay, who dismissed Rose's appeal. The judge argued that while the decision was "understandably distressing" for Rose, he could not see any grounds for overturning the CCG's original decision, which was made on the basis of cost-effectiveness. Rose, who was not present in court but shared her disappointment in a statement issued by her lawyers, said: "I am devastated by this outcome, which means that I will have to face the prospect of infertility without the comfort of knowing that I have options available to me to start a family later in life". The issue of fertility preservation has become increasingly important in recent years, particularly for young women facing cancer treatment. The NHS provides funding for fertility preservation in certain circumstances, such as when patients are due to undergo chemotherapy and there is a significant risk that it will damage their fertility. However, these guidelines are often interpreted differently by local CCGs, leading to postcode lotteries in access to services. Rose's case has highlighted the need for clearer and more consistent guidelines across the NHS, particularly for fertility preservation for cancer patients. While the NHS has made significant strides in recent years to improve access and support for patients with cancer, there are still gaps in provision that need to be addressed. Rose's lawyers have said that they plan to appeal the decision, although it remains uncertain whether they will be successful. In the meantime, Rose and other young women facing a similar situation will have to rely on private clinics to provide fertility preservation services, at a cost that is often prohibitively expensive. The case has sparked widespread debate about the ethics of fertility preservation, particularly in cases where the costs are high and the potential benefits uncertain. While many argue that all patients should have access to these services, regardless of cost, others believe that funding should be targeted to those who are most likely to benefit. For Elizabeth Rose, the legal battle may have been lost, but the wider debate about fertility preservation and access to healthcare is far from over.
