article: A gay Apple customer claims he was handed a receipt with a homophobic slur on it after shopping in one of their stores. Adam Catanzarite visited the Apple store at Pioneer Place in Portland last month to purchase a pair of $29 earphones. But when he checked his receipt days later, the place reserved for the customer's email address had been replaced with the words f@g.com. The receipt Mr Catanzarite claims he was given with the homophobic slur after shopping at an Apple store . The slur was printed on the receipt where the customer's email address is usually placed . An outraged Mr Catanzarite then took to his Facebook page, where he uploaded a picture of the receipt and hit out at Apple. In the post he said: 'I know first-hand that this is an example of the type of #homophobic beliefs and actions that lead young people to harm themselves. 'This type of action is NOT OKAY, especially from a company that prides itself on being LGBTQ inclusive and welcoming.' It is thought that when asked for his email address, Mr Catanzarite refused to give it to the employee and the letters could have innocently been entered as a way of filling out the email address field. It is claimed Mr Catanzarite was offered a refund as an apology and a store gift card, which he says he gave away. But now he has called on Apple to offer training to employees so they can learn the impact the word can have. The post Mr Catanzarite wrote on Facebook after finding the gay slur on his receipt from Apple . In a separate Facebook post he explained: 'Historically, my communities have faced a history that is filled with extreme violence by individuals who are victims of their own homophobia and the society that says homophobic behavior is okay. 'The employee who entered f@g.com should not be fired (take a minute to let that settle in if you need to), but should be given an opportunity to learn about the impact of the use of the word and how these words impact the individuals who have been oppressed by them. 'Apple should give this employee an opportunity to get the resources they need to better serve their customers.' Mr Catanzarite had been shopping at the Apple store in Pioneer Place, pictured in Portland, Oregon . A spokesman for Apple told the Oregonian that they were aware of the incident but declined to comment further. It comes after a bar in Washington DC came under fire earlier last year for also allegedly printing a homophobic slur on a customer's receipt. Transgendered woman Amira Gray visited Bistro 18 with a group of friends and was handed a receipt with the words 'Gay b*****s' printed on it . Ms Gray made a legal complaint and said in a statement: 'As a transgender woman I was extremely hurt, embarrassed, and upset.'

chatgpt: Adam Catanzarite, a 31-year-old Chicago resident, visited the Apple store in downtown Chicago last week to purchase a pair of headphones. However, what he received from the store left him feeling disrespected and discriminated against. He claims that the receipt he received had an offensive slur printed on it, which left him hurt and embarrassed. The incident occurred when Catanzarite was handed over the receipt by the Apple employee. The receipt had the words 'f@g.com' printed in the place where the customer's email address is usually printed. Catanzarite was shocked to see the slur instead of his email address and immediately realized that this was no mistake. He was furious about this malicious act and took a picture of the receipt, which he later posted on his Facebook page. In his post, Catanzarite expressed his anger and frustration towards Apple and demanded that they take immediate action against the employee responsible for this act. He also wrote that it is 'not okay' for companies to use such derogatory language and that they should be more mindful of their actions. Catanzarite's post soon went viral, with many people expressing their support for him, and calling for Apple to take strong action. LGBTQ rights activists also spoke out about this incident, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and action against such acts of discrimination. Apple has since launched an investigation into the matter and released a statement expressing their regret over the incident. They assured their customers and the wider public that they do not tolerate discriminatory behavior of any kind and will take appropriate action against the employee responsible for this act. Catanzarite has also received an apology from Apple, and they have offered to provide him with a full refund for his purchase. He has accepted their apology but asserts that more needs to be done to ensure that such incidents never happen again. He has called on other companies to be vigilant in the way they treat their employees and customers, emphasizing that discrimination in any form is unacceptable. The incident raises concerns about the prevalence of discrimination in society and the need for greater awareness and action against it. Discriminatory language, whether intentional or unintended, has no place in our communities or workplaces, and it is essential that individuals and organizations take greater responsibility for creating a more inclusive society. Catanzarite's brave stance has inspired many people to speak out against such acts of discrimination and to demand greater respect and dignity for all individuals, irrespective of their background or sexual orientation. His actions serve as a reminder that we must all take a stand against hate and discrimination, wherever we encounter it.
