article: The shoe attack on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Egypt, the latest on a politician in the Middle East, causes many in West to ask: Why is throwing a shoe such a big deal? One of CNN's resident experts is producer Mohammed Tawfeeq, who was in Baghdad when President George W. Bush dodged a flying shoe at news conference in the U.S. Embassy in December 2008. Journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi tossed it because he wanted to "humiliate the tyrant," his brother told CNN. "Yes, I was there," Tawfeeq said. "It was a very big deal in Iraq."

"Other people were not happy because for them they see it -- by end of the day -- like a guest visiting their country," Tawfeeq said.  "Traditionally, it was also offensive to insult a guest." The act of throwing a shoe at someone or showing them your sole is "incredibly offensive" in the Middle East, he said. "The bottom line is a shoe is dirt," he said. "Throwing a shoe on someone means throwing dirt on that person." Professor Faegheh Shirazi, with Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, agreed, saying it is offensive "regardless of the religious practices." "Throwing a shoe or hitting someone with a shoe or showing the bottom of your shoe when sitting with legs up on a chair and facing another person all are culturally unacceptable and are considered to be a grave insult and belittling to a person," Shirazi said. Another offensive aspect is the significance of the shoe being a sign of wealth. "Most often, lower-status people and poor men could not wear shoes," Shirazi said. "The feet came in contact with pollution and the dirt on the road. The dirt on the feet indicated the lack of social status, the level of economic class and the level of education and lack of sophistication and intellect." Tawfeeq, who occasionally visits the United States, was surprised to learn shoe throwing was not considered an offense in North America. A search of literature reveals references suggesting the power of the shoe is ancient. For example, in the King James Version of the Old Testament, Psalm 60:8 says: "Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me." "Perhaps it has to do with the hierarchy of the body position, that is, the relationship between the head and the feet, the head being at the top and not touching the ground and the dirt," Shirazi said.  "The head carries a more prestigious status in comparison to the feet, which in older times mostly remained bare."

chatgpt: Throwing a shoe has become a point of discussion again after a reporter threw his shoe at President George W. Bush during a press conference in Baghdad in 2008. At the time, many Iraqis celebrated the act, even creating songs and dances in its honor. However, a recent statement by a professor has brought the conversation back into focus. Regardless of any religious practices, the act of throwing a shoe is seen as offensive. According to CNN Iraq producer, Mohammed Tawfeeq, "The bottom line is a shoe is dirt." This sentiment is echoed by many across the world, as shoes are considered unclean in many different cultures. Additionally, historical evidence shows that throwing a shoe has been an insult since ancient times. Psalm 60:8 in the Bible states, "Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I will toss my shoe." This verse is interpreted as a message to Moab and Edom, expressing contempt and dominance. Despite the fact that shoe-throwing has become a popular form of protest in some parts of the world, it is important to remember that it is not a universally accepted form of expression. It is not difficult to see why so many people are appalled by this act, as it is both disrespectful and potentially dangerous. The act of throwing a shoe at a person is not only a physical assault, but it can also spread disease. Shoes pick up all sorts of germs and bacteria as people walk around, and throwing them at someone can potentially harm them. This is especially concerning now, given the current global pandemic, as the virus can survive on surfaces for several hours. Another area of concern is the impact it can have on relationships between nations. As a form of diplomacy, throwing a shoe can be seen as incredibly insulting and have far-reaching consequences. This was evident in the aftermath of the 2008 incident, as many Iraqi leaders condemned the act and expressed regret for the behavior of their fellow countryman. In conclusion, throwing a shoe is an ancient and widely recognized form of insult. While it may be seen as a form of protest in some circumstances, it is important to remember that it is both disrespectful and potentially dangerous. The act has the potential to harm both individuals and diplomatic relationships, and should be avoided at all costs. As CNN Iraq producer Mohammed Tawfeeq stated, "The bottom line is a shoe is dirt."
