Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were re-convicted of killing the 21-year-old British exchange student by a Florence court in January this year. If the verdict is upheld, Italian officials are expected to start the process of extraditing 27-year-old Knox from the US. Final verdict: More than a year after being re-convicted of killing Meredith Kercher, Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito's case will be heard in Italy's highest court of appeal . The case will be heard by the Court of Cassation in Rome on March 25th, the highest appeals court in Italy. A court of cassation does not re-examine the facts of the case, but will only rule on the interpretation of the law in the guilty verdict by the Florence court. Meredith Kercher, was found dead in 2007, at the age of 21, in the apartment she shared with American student Knox in Perugia, Italy. Knox and her Italian then-boyfriend Sollecito were initially found guilty of Kercher's murder and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison.

After four years behind bars, the pair were acquitted on appeal and Knox returned to her Washington state hometown.

She has vowed that she will never 'willingly' return to Italy if the verdict is upheld . In July her 30-year-old ex and fellow convict graduated from Verona University after writing a thesis describing how he is innocent of Meredith’s murder. Earlier in the summer, Sollecito gave a press conference in Rome in which he appeared to distance himself from Knox, saying he was 'not a guarantor' for her, adding that he could not be sure if she was with him the whole night when the murder took place.

chatgpt: The high-profile case of Meredith Kercher has taken another turn as it is set to be heard at Italy's highest court of appeal. The British student was tragically stabbed to death in Perugia in 2007, and her death sparked a lengthy legal battle that has continued for over a decade. Initially, Amanda Knox, an American student who was Kercher's roommate, and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were found guilty of the murder in 2009. However, they were later acquitted on appeal in 2011.  In a new twist earlier this year, a Florence court found Knox and Sollecito guilty again. The outcome of this latest ruling has now led the case to be brought before Italy's highest court, which will determine the next steps. If the guilty verdict is upheld by the highest court, Knox could potentially face extradition to Italy to serve her sentence, which is currently set at 28 years in prison. The case has been a long and difficult one for all parties involved, including the Kercher family who have walked the legal path for over a decade. As such, it has been closely followed by the international media and the public at large. Throughout the case, there have been a number of twists and turns, with varying versions of events coming to light. Some have raised questions over the initial investigation and whether Knox and Sollecito were wrongly accused, while others have suggested a cover-up or potential interference in the judicial process. Regardless, the latest ruling has left many wondering what the next steps will be, and whether justice will ultimately be served for Kercher and her family. For Knox and Sollecito, the case has already taken a considerable toll on their lives, with both spending significant time behind bars and enduring a lengthy legal battle. While the latest verdict may be seen as a setback for them, they will have another opportunity to present their case before the highest court, and potentially clear their names once and for all. For the Kercher family, the latest ruling offers a glimmer of hope for closure, with the chance for justice to be delivered for their daughter who was taken from them in such a devastating manner. As the legal battle continues, the case will no doubt continue to garner significant attention from the public and the media alike. Only time will tell what the ultimate outcome will be, and whether justice will ultimately be served for all those affected by the tragic death of Meredith Kercher.
