New polling reveals one in six pawn their possessions, while two in five resort to their credit card to help afford extra costs. These typically are medical and dental expenses or more expensive household bills or car repairs. The results have prompted a campaign aimed at assisting people in financial stress and helping them avoid money struggles  till pay-day and subsequently becoming pay-day lenders, news.com.au reports. Young people have been found most likely to be victims of pay-day lending and then end up  facing high interest rates as high as 160 per cent. Only one in 200 people aged 50 and over have admitted to using a pay-day lender, while one in 20 people aged 18 to 24 turn to a lender in times of financial stress. Money struggles is also higher in country people, compared to city slickers. NAB, who conducted the polling, will be working with Good Shepherd Microfinance on the campaign in attempt to sweep out quick fixes and find a longer solution to help financial stress. 'People who find themselves in difficult financial situations often seek quick fixes such as selling their possessions or getting a high cost pay-day loan,' said Adam Mooney, chief executive of Good Sheperd Microfinance. 'While satisfying the immediate need, these solutions can lead to bigger problems down the track.' He said illness and divorce are the two biggest triggers for financial worries. But new NAB boss Andrew Thorburn believes his bank does not close doors on those in financial troubles. 'As Australians, we pride ourselves on giving people a fair go and at NAB we think that includes having access to fair and affordable finance when you need it,' Mr Thorburn said.

chatgpt: Australians who are facing financial stress are being forced to resort to desperate measures to pay for unexpected expenses, according to a recent survey. The study, conducted by the National Australia Bank (NAB), found that one in six people turn to pawn shops to cover costs, while two in five use their credit cards. The survey also revealed that young people are particularly vulnerable to falling victim to pay-day lenders, with almost one in three borrowing money from these high-interest lenders to make ends meet. To combat the issue of financial stress, NAB has launched a campaign aimed at assisting those who are struggling with their finances. The initiative consists of a range of tools and resources designed to provide practical solutions for people facing money problems. One of the key features of the campaign is a financial wellness check, which allows people to assess their financial situation and receive suggestions on how to manage their money more effectively. In addition, the bank has partnered with financial counselling organizations to provide free support and advice to those who need it. The NAB campaign also aims to raise awareness of the dangers of pay-day lending and promote alternatives to these high-interest loans. The bank is encouraging people to consider other options, such as applying for a lower interest personal loan or credit card, or seeking assistance from a financial counsellor. According to NAB's Director of Customer Experience, Rachel Slade, the campaign is focused on providing support to those who are struggling financially. "We know that financial stress can have a significant impact on people's lives, which is why we are committed to helping our customers overcome these challenges," she said. The NAB campaign has already received praise from consumer advocates, who welcome any initiative that helps people manage their money more effectively. However, some experts warn that more needs to be done to tackle the root causes of financial stress, such as rising living costs and stagnant wages. Overall, the NAB campaign provides a much-needed lifeline for those who are struggling with their finances. With the number of Australians facing financial stress continuing to grow, initiatives like this are essential in ensuring that people are given the support they need to get back on track.
