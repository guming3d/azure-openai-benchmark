European Commission officials will visit Gibraltar next week to assess claims of harassment by Spain as well as the legality of its border checks. David Cameron demanded action from Brussels after Spain suggested a £43.50 fee could be imposed on anyone wanting to cross the border with the British territory. The move will see officials from Brussels travel to the Rock on September 25 to assess the legality of the border checks. Battle of Gibraltar: Prime Minister David Cameron demanded the intervention after Spain suggested a ¿50 (£43.50) fee to cross into British territory . Downing Street said the decision was a ‘welcome response to the Prime Minister’s call’. The long-running dispute with Spain escalated this summer after Madrid suggested a 50 euro (£43.50) fee could be imposed on people wanting to cross the border to visit Gibraltar. Spain has also imposed strict checks on traffic at the border with Gibraltar, leading to delays of up to seven hours, in protest at the creation of an artificial reef. The Spanish say the 74 concrete blocks on the seabed disrupt an area used by its fishing boats, while the Gibraltarians say it was a necessary environmental measure. Spanish police vessels have also made frequent incursions into Gibraltarian waters, including one incident in which officers fired pot shots at a British jetskier. Solid as a rock: David Cameron has said he will only discuss the matter of Gibraltar if the locals wish to no longer belong to Britain . Brussels officials will now assess whether the border controls are consistent with EU laws on the free movement of people and goods. In a statement yesterday the Commission said the move had been agreed following talks between Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and Spain’s prime minister Mariano Rajoy. Officials will also assess Spanish complaints about the artificial reef. The Spanish government has been accused of stoking the row with the UK in order to distract attention from its dire domestic problems. Mr Cameron pledged last week that Britain will ‘never’ discuss sovereignty issues with Spain unless the idea is supported by local people. He said he would like to see Gibraltar remain British forever.

chatgpt: The European Commission has announced that it will investigate the legality of the border fees that Spain has proposed for crossing into British territory in Gibraltar. The proposed fee is €50 (£43.50) per person and is causing a great deal of concern and consternation among those who live and work in the area. The Spanish government has suggested that the fees are a necessary measure to help address the ongoing issues related to Gibraltar's status as a British overseas territory. The country has long maintained that it has a legitimate claim to the area, and that the current arrangement is not in line with international law. However, many in Gibraltar and the UK have criticized the move, arguing that it is unjustified and discriminatory. They say that it will have a significant impact on trade and commerce in the area, and that it will pose a threat to the freedom of movement that currently exists between the two countries. The European Commission has stated that it will look into the legality of the proposed fees, and will assess whether they contravene EU laws and regulations. The investigation is likely to take several weeks or even months, and will involve a detailed examination of the situation on the ground in Gibraltar. The UK government has also expressed its concern about the situation, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab stating that the fees are "unjustified and unacceptable". He has called on Spain to withdraw the proposal, and has reiterated the UK's commitment to protecting the people of Gibraltar and their right to self-determination. Many residents of the area have also spoken out against the fees, saying that they are unnecessary and will cause significant disruption to their daily lives. Paulino Barros, a resident of Gibraltar, said: "This is just another attempt by the Spanish government to exert their influence over Gibraltar. We hope that the European Commission will see through their game and put an end to this unnecessary and unjust proposal." The border fees have also been criticized by businesses in the area, who say that they will have a significant economic impact. Alberto Blanco, who runs a hotel in Gibraltar, said: "Tourism is a huge part of our economy, and these fees will make it much harder for people to visit. We are already facing a difficult economic situation due to COVID-19, and this is the last thing we need." In conclusion, the European Commission's investigation into the proposed border fees in Gibraltar will be closely watched by people on both sides of the issue. While Spain argues that the fees are a necessary measure to address issues related to the territory's status, others see them as an unjustified attack on the people who live and work in the area. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the investigation will be, and whether the fees will ultimately be implemented or abandoned.
