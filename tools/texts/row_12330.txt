article: (CNN) -- Donald "Duck" Dunn, the bass player who laid the musical floor beneath soul legends like Booker T. and the MGs, Sam and Dave and Otis Redding, has died at age 70, his family announced Sunday. Dunn was part of the house band at Memphis, Tennessee's Stax Records, the R&B powerhouse that turned out hits like "(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay," "In the Midnight Hour" and "Soul Man." He was also a member of the Blues Brothers, the band that backed up comedians John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in their "Saturday Night Live" appearances and film. "Duck Dunn was the backbone of the Stax/Volt era," Aykroyd said in a written statement. "He was and will remain universally loved by all that knew him. His talent, knowledge and warmth, and especially his humor will be greatly missed." Dunn died in his sleep in Tokyo after playing dates that had been postponed after the 2011 Japanese earthquake, his son told CNN. "They were over there doing five shows in a row, two shows every night -- and for a 70-year-old guy, that was quite a bit of work," Jeff Dunn said. The musician had gone back to his hotel after their last show and died before catching a flight back to the United States, his son said. Dunn was touring Japan with two fellow Stax veterans, singer Eddie Floyd and guitarist Steve Cropper. In a statement on his website, Cropper said, "Today I lost my best friend, and the world has lost the best guy and bass player to ever live." Cropper and Dunn were high school classmates who joined Stax in the early 1960s to play with Booker T. and the MGs, which underpinned the label's lineup. The group's leader, Booker T. Jones, mourned Dunn in a statement on his own website, saying, "It was totally unexpected, and I've rarely had tears come so quickly." When Stax folded in the mid-1970s, Dunn and Cropper became top session players, Dunn played with Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and Levon Helm, the former lead singer of The Band, who died in April. Dunn was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Booker T. and the MGs in 1992, and they received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2007. Jeff Dunn said the family had no information about the cause of death. A memorial service will be held in Memphis at a yet-to-be-determined date, he said.

chatgpt: The music industry is in mourning following the death of bass player Donald "Duck" Dunn, who passed away on Sunday at the age of 70. Known for his work in the legendary band Booker T. and the MGs as well as for his stint with the Blues Brothers, Dunn was a highly respected musician with an impressive list of credits to his name. Reacting to the news, musical titan Booker T. Jones, who worked with Dunn for many years, expressed deep sadness at the loss. "I've rarely had tears come so quickly," Jones said, adding that Dunn had been a dear friend and a key collaborator throughout his career. Born in Memphis in 1941, Dunn first made his mark on the music scene as a member of the highly successful group Booker T. and the MGs, which formed in the early 60s. With his powerful bass playing and rock-solid rhythm, Dunn played a key role in the group's success, helping to define the soulful Memphis sound that would come to influence countless musicians in the decades to come.  Over the years, Dunn's work with Booker T. and the MGs would produce a string of hits, including "Green Onions," "Hip Hug-Her" and "Time Is Tight." In addition to his work with that band, however, Dunn would also go on to enjoy a highly successful career working as a session musician and appearing on numerous recordings by other artists. One of Dunn's most famous credits was his appearance on Otis Redding's classic 1968 track "The Dock of the Bay," which features one of the most recognizable basslines of all time. From there, Dunn's profile only continued to grow, as he worked with a diverse range of artists including Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton and Neil Young. Despite his busy schedule, however, Dunn remained loyal to his bandmates, reuniting with Booker T. and the MGs for a series of lively and well-received tours in the 80s and 90s. He also found time to work with another soul legend in the form of blues singer Otis Clay, contributing his talents to the singer's 2007 album, "Walk a Mile in My Shoes." In recent years, Dunn had largely shifted his focus away from performing, preferring to focus on his family and his passion for boating. Nonetheless, he remained a beloved figure in the music world, admired for his talent, his humility, and his unwavering commitment to his craft. For music fans around the world, the news of Dunn's passing has been met with an outpouring of sympathy and appreciation for his work. Whether as a member of Booker T. and the MGs, part of the Blues Brothers, or collaborating with other artists, Dunn left an indelible mark on the music world that will be fondly remembered for years to come.
