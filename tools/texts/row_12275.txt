Martin committed a similar crime on a train platform in January 2013. He was convicted by a judge last month of one 2013 robbery and then pleaded guilty to the othe robbery.

chatgpt: Pierre D. Martin, 32, has been convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 22 years in prison, thanks in large part to facial recognition technology utilized by the Chicago Police Department. He is the first person to be arrested and convicted using the technology, which was purchased by the department last year for a hefty $5.4 million. Martin's crimes took place on the evening of February 17th, when he entered a local convenience store and threatened the store clerk with a firearm. He made off with $500 in cash and a number of lottery tickets before fleeing the scene. The store's security cameras captured his image, but the low quality footage didn't offer a clear identification.  Luckily for the police department, the new facial recognition technology was able to match Martin's face with a mugshot in their database, leading to his subsequent arrest. The jury found him guilty of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon and he was sentenced to 22 years in prison.  The Chicago Police Department is understandably enthusiastic about the success of their facial recognition program. The new technology has the potential to revolutionize law enforcement and make identifying criminals much easier. Police officials say they are confident that their purchase was worth the $5.4 million price tag. However, not everyone is enthusiastic about the new technology. Some have raised concerns about privacy and civil liberties, arguing that facial recognition databases could be used for more nefarious purposes in the future. Regardless of these concerns, it seems that facial recognition technology is here to stay. In any case, Pierre D. Martin and his criminal activities have come to an end thanks to the new technology. His arrest and conviction will serve as a warning to other potential criminals that the law enforcement powers of facial recognition are not to be taken lightly.
