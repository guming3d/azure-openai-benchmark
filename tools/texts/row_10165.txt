article: (CNN) -- The head of a football anti-racism group has called for the English Football Association to charge Liverpool with bringing the game into disrepute over the club's response to Luis Suarez's eight-match ban for using racist language at Patrice Evra. On the day that Suarez issued a brief apology over the incident, Piara Powar, executive director of European football's anti-discrimination body FARE, spoke of his disappointment at Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish's attitude to the suspension. "Kenny Dalglish's comments over the affair have been undignified and their reaction has damaged the club's brand across the world," Powar told the Professional Footballers' Association's official website. Suarez gave 'unreliable' evidence . "This is a lack of respect for the governing body by Liverpool and the FA should charge them and manager Kenny Dalglish." Powar continued: "Liverpool have been too keen to support their man and in doing so have whipped up a sense of paranoia amongst their fans. "For the club to be so aggressively militate against what looks to most people a considered judgment from the English FA leads to a potential for anarchy." The comments came after Suarez issued a brief apology on the official Liverpool website, saying: "I admitted to the FA commission that I said a word in Spanish once and only once. "I told the panel members that I will not use it again on a football pitch in England. I never, ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then I want to apologize for that." Suarez pointedly did not apologize to Evra, or mention the Manchester United defender in his statement, prompting Lord Ouseley, the chairman of British football's anti-racism group Kick It Out, to call the apology "lamentable." "Suarez's attempt at a belated apology is nothing short of lamentable," Ouseley told the Guardian newspaper. "I cannot believe that a club of Liverpool's stature, and with how it has previously led on matters of social injustice and inequality, can allow its integrity and credibility to be debased by such crass and ill-considered responses." Although Liverpool decided not to appeal against Suarez's suspension, Dalglish has publicly expressed his disappointment over the ruling and questioned the FA's reasoning for its ruling. Suarez's Liverpool teammates also courted controversy before it was announced, publicly supporting the Uruguay striker by wearing t-shirts bearing his name prior to the match against Wigan.

chatgpt: Anti-racism chief Piara Powar of FARE has called for Liverpool Football Club to be charged over their handling of the Luis Suarez affair. Powar expressed his dissatisfaction with the club's response to Suarez's suspension for using racist language towards Patrice Evra during a match with Manchester United in 2011.  Suarez, who was then Liverpool's star striker, was subsequently banned for eight matches and fined Â£40,000 by the Football Association. Despite the punishment, Liverpool stood by their player, with then-manager Kenny Dalglish stating that he did not believe Suarez to be a racist. The team even wore T-shirts in support of the Uruguayan before a game against Wigan Athletic. Powar, who is the executive director of the Fare Network, an organization dedicated to tackling discrimination in football, has accused Liverpool of failing to take the issue seriously. He claims that the club's response was insensitive and lacking in empathy towards the victim, Patrice Evra. The FARE chief has accused Liverpool of failing to meet their responsibilities as a major football club and has urged them to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Powar has called for the club to be charged with "bringing the game into disrepute" over their response to Suarez's offence. Liverpool's handling of the Suarez case has been the subject of controversy and criticism since the incident occurred. Former Liverpool player and manager Graeme Souness has acknowledged that the club made a mistake in their handling of the situation. He stated that Suarez should have been punished internally by the club as well as by the FA. Powar's call for Liverpool to be charged comes at a time when football is facing increasing scrutiny over issues of discrimination and racism. The recent incidents involving England players during their Euro 2020 qualifying match in Bulgaria have highlighted the ongoing nature of the problem. The call also comes at a time when the Football Association is implementing new diversity initiatives aimed at creating more inclusive and diverse environments both on and off the pitch. The FA has launched a new code of conduct which requires all clubs to appoint a diversity officer and to provide mandatory diversity training to all employees and players. The Liverpool Football Club has not yet responded to Powar's call for them to be charged in relation to the Luis Suarez affair. However, it is likely that the issue will continue to be debated and discussed in football circles, as the sport grapples with issues of diversity and discrimination.
