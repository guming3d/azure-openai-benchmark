article: While America was watching the midterm election results come in, commentators on CNN were doing a terrible job pretending to be big fans of the Microsoft Surface Pro 3. Microsoft gave commentators on the network tablets to use throughout the night, but some of the reporters were seen blatantly typing away on their Mac products half concealed by their provided PC gadget. According to a source who was at the CNN studios for yesterday's coverage, the whole team wasn't exactly excited at the prospect of having to use Microsoft devices. Jake Tapper is a Mac: CNN's Chief Washington Correspondent was seen typing away on his iPad during election night coverage, behind a  Microsoft-provided Surface Pro 3 . Can you spot the iPad? Political contributor Ana Navarro used a Surface Pro to indiscreetly hold up her iPad during Tuesday night's election coverage . 'There's going to be no personal digital devices allowed on set today or tonight,' a CNN producer told guests and their handlers gathered in the network's Washington, D.C. 'green room' during a 5:00 p.m. broadcast. Apparently that rule wasn't followed by everyone. Camera angles exposed CNN's chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper as a Mac user, indiscreetly typing on his iPad from behind his free Surface Pro, while political contributor Ana Navarro used her tablet as a stand for her Apple device. 'They're just not allowing anybody to bring their own. Sorry about that.' The producer said she herself was an Apple devotee. 'I had Macs for ages and then had to switch to PCs,' she explained. 'Now I’m back to iPads and Macs again, and I just love it.' A press flack for former Republican Speaker of the House News Gingrich piped up from a chair. 'Newt's not gonna like this,' he said. 'It's gonna take his email forever to load on that thing. This ought to be interesting.' As Gingrich walked down a hallway toward CNN's broadcast studio, he was seen fiddling with an iPhone. A representative for CNN said that the Microsoft tablets used on election night coverage were 'not a product placement deal' and that reporters were not barred from bringing their own devices. 'Surface tablets were provided at each seat to give guests, contributors, and CNN talent real-time election results through "My Magic Wall" - an application optimized for Internet Explorer. 'While panelists rotated throughout the night, the tablets remained in place. Talent brought with them to the studio their own personal devices for email and social media,' the spokesman said. When Microsoft first launched their tablet, they ran a series of ads showing all of the things the Surface Pro could do (like stand up with a kickstand)  that an iPad couldn't. But it appears they are now focusing their efforts on attacking Apple's sales of the Macbook Air - their slimmest and lightest laptop, with a new commercial advertising campaign. This latest failure to market Microsoft's tablet comes after the company struck a $400million deal to supply the NFL with their tablets.

chatgpt: In a surprising twist, Microsoft provided its Surface Pro 3 tablets to CNN for use during the election night coverage. However, it seems that the commentators covering the event were not as successful at hiding their iPads behind the competitor tablets as they anticipated. The Surface Pro 3 is known to be a highly versatile device, designed to fit the needs of a wide range of professionals. The 12-inch screen and advanced stylus make it easy to take notes, manipulate data, and even sign documents. The device is also incredibly lightweight, weighing in at just 1.76 pounds. This makes it the perfect device for professionals on the go. While Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 may have been the tool of choice for CNN during election night, it seems that some of the commentators couldn't resist the temptation to use their beloved iPads behind the competitor tablets. CNN's coverage of the US Presidential Election has always been a highly anticipated event. As the world waited with bated breath for the announcement of the final results, CNN's commentators were busy analyzing the news, crunching numbers, and delivering real-time analysis of the ongoing events. It was during this high-pressure environment that some of the commentators were caught coasting on their iPads behind the Surface Pro 3 tablets. While it's not entirely clear why they opted to use their iPads, it appears that the commentators may have been more comfortable with the Apple devices. Of course, with millions of people tuning in to watch the election night coverage, it was only a matter of time before eagle-eyed viewers called out the commentators for using their iPads behind the Microsoft Surface Pro 3s. While it might seem like a small matter, this kind of behavior can have a significant impact on a brand like Microsoft. One thing is for certain; Microsoft will be eager to avoid any negative publicity that might be associated with the incident. If anything, it serves as a reminder that even devices as advanced as the Surface Pro 3 can't win over everyone. Despite this minor setback, the Surface Pro 3 is still widely regarded as being one of the best devices on the market. With its powerful processing capabilities, sleek design, and advanced features, it's no wonder that so many professionals turn to the Surface Pro 3 for their computing needs. As for CNN's commentators, one can only speculate as to why they opted to use their iPads behind the Microsoft Surface Pro 3s. Perhaps it was a matter of personal preference, or maybe they just found the Surface Pro 3s too complicated to use under the high-pressure environment of election night coverage. Regardless of the reasoning, it's clear that the incident has caused a stir in the tech industry. With so many people tuning in to watch CNN's election night coverage, it's no surprise that Microsoft will want to take steps to ensure that their products are used in a way that highlights their strengths and capabilities. In conclusion, while the incident might have been somewhat embarrassing for Microsoft, it's clear that the Surface Pro 3 remains a highly versatile and powerful device. With its ability to fit the needs of a wide range of professionals, it's no wonder that the Surface Pro 3 is one of the best-selling devices on the market today. Hopefully, Microsoft will learn from this experience and continue to innovate and provide users with the best possible computing experience.
