Mr Morgans, who is originally from Cheshire, says that from a young age he always loved being outdoors and admiring wildlife.

'But my camera has taken me to some magnificent places and there is no better place to improve your photography than out in the field. 'My biggest inspiration is photographing wildlife in harsh environments and this winter I will be spending three weeks on a new project in Norway - photographing musk ox during the winter.'
