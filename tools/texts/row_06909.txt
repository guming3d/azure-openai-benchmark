article: California has become the first state in the US to pass a law designed to define when 'yes means yes' to prevent sexual assaults. The bill was signed by California Governor Jerry Brown yesterday and will adopt requirements for colleges to follow when investigating sexual assault reports. The legislation says silence or lack of resistance do not constitute consent, and that someone who is drunk, drugged, unconscious or asleep cannot grant consent. The bill designed to define when 'yes means yes' to prevent sexual assaults was signed by California Governor Jerry Brown (pictured) yesterday . States and universities across the US are under pressure to change how they deal with sexual assault reports. Campus sexual assault victims and women's advocacy groups delivered petitions to Gov Brown's office a fortnight ago urging him to sign the bill. Senator Kevin de Leon, who represents Los Angeles, said the legislation will change how college campuses in California look in to sexual assaults. Rather than using the refrain 'no means no,' the definition of consent under the bill requires 'an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.' He said: 'With one in five women on college campuses experiencing sexual assault, it is high time the conversation regarding sexual assault be shifted to one of prevention, justice, and healing.' Lawmakers say consent can be nonverbal, and universities with similar policies have outlined examples as a nod of the head or moving in closer to the person. Advocates for victims of sexual assault supported the change as one that will provide consistency across campuses and challenge the notion that victims must have resisted assault to have valid complaints. The bill requires training for faculty reviewing complaints so victims are not asked inappropriate questions when filing complaints. The bill also requires access to counselling, health care services and other resources. Speaking out: Handmade signs decrying rape decorate tents set at an evening to raise awareness of sexual assault at Occidental College in Los Angeles, which is one of the colleges affected by the bill . When lawmakers were considering the bill, critics said it was overreaching and could put universities in murky legal waters. Some Republicans in the Assembly questioned whether statewide legislation was an appropriate venue to define sexual consent between two people. There was no opposition from Republicans in the state Senate. Gordon Finley, an adviser to the National Coalition for Men, wrote an editorial asking Gov Brown not to sign the bill. He argued that 'this campus rape crusade bill' presumed the guilt of the accused. The bill, called SB967, applies to all California post-secondary schools, public and private, that receive state money for student financial aid. The California State University and University of California systems are backing the legislation after adopting similar consent standards this year. University of California President Janet Napolitano recently announced the system will voluntarily establish an independent advocate to support sexual assault victims on every campus.

chatgpt: California has become the first state in the US to pass a law aimed at preventing sexual assaults. The legislation, referred to as the ‘Yes means Yes’ bill, is designed to redefine when consent is given during sexual activity. The bill requires an "affirmative, conscious, voluntary agreement" from all parties engaging in sexual behavior. The legislation states that someone who is drunk, drugged or asleep cannot grant consent. The proposed law also makes it clear that non-verbal signals, such as a nod of the head or leaning in, can also signal consent. The new law applies specifically to all California post-secondary schools that receive state funding. Anyone found guilty of violating the law, will be ineligible for state-funded student aid. Supporters of the bill have praised its potential to change the culture around consent, and to create safer environments for students. They argue that it is necessary to shift the burden of evidence in sexual assault cases, which previously lay with the victim, to the accused. “ ‘Yes means Yes’ means we support clear, explicit and affirmative consent for sexual activity,” said Assemblyman Das Williams of Santa Barbara, who authored the bill. In a recent op-ed in the LA Times, Williams argued that California’s new law provides a “clear set of guidelines” for schools to follow. “For the first time, we have clarity around what it means to have affirmative consent,” Williams wrote. “This clarity will empower victims, while ensuring perpetrators face consequences.” However, critics of the bill have argued that it could put universities in murky legal waters and presumptions of guilt. They contend that the definition of consent is too broad and could be problematic in practice. “This bill does not create clear standards but instead creates a sweeping mandate,” warned California Senator Jim Nielsen. The opposition has also criticized the legislation for ignoring the fact that consent may be given non-verbally and subtly, and that some people may have difficulty interpreting body language. Despite the criticism, several other states have already begun examining similar legislation, including New York, Illinois and Massachusetts. Furthermore, universities across the nation are adopting similar policies to improve campus safety. In a statement released by the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, “although many state laws and university policies address affirmative consent, California has become the first state to recognize this standard for all post-secondary students.” Whether the law will have its intended effect remains to be seen. However, it serves as a clear message from the state of California about the importance of consent in sexual activity.
