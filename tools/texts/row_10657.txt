A French fast food chain has revealed a promotional snack which really has gone to the Dark Side, a Star Wars-inspired burger with completely black buns. The burger chain Quick cooked up the black-looking bun - named Dark Vador - to tie in with the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in 3D.

chatgpt: French fast food chain, Quick, has announced the launch of a new meal which has been named after one of the most notorious characters in Star Wars, Darth Vader. The meal, dubbed the "Dark Vador" meal, has been launched ahead of the release of the latest Star Wars film, Rogue One; A Star Wars Story. 
Quick, a subsidiary of the BURGER KINGÂ® Group, operates fast food restaurants in over 20 countries across Europe, Asia and Africa. The French chain has revealed that the new meal will consist of a black bun, a beef patty, melted cheddar cheese and fried onions, all of which will be served with a side of chips and a drink. Quick has been known to offer limited edition meals named after various fictional characters from TV shows, movies and comic books. In the past, the fast food chain has introduced meals named after Superman, Batman, and the Smurfs, which have all garnered a lot of attention from customers. The announcement of the "Dark Vador" meal has created a buzz among Star Wars fans who are excited to try the new product. A spokesperson for Quick said: "We are thrilled to introduce the "Dark Vador" meal to our customers. We are confident that this meal will be a hit among Star Wars fans and we can't wait for them to try it." The use of themed meals has become increasingly popular as fast food chains seek to keep their offerings fresh and exciting. McDonald's, for example, has partnered with several popular TV shows and movies in recent years, to introduce limited edition meals. The fast food chain's 2016 "Angry Birds" meal, which was named after the popular mobile game, was a huge success. The "Dark Vador" meal is expected to be available at Quick outlets in France, Belgium and Luxembourg until January 1st, 2017. Quick has not yet confirmed whether the meal will be introduced in other countries. The new Star Wars invasion has already begun across the globe as fans eagerly anticipate the arrival of the new film. This is not the first time that a Star Wars film has created a buzz in the fast food world. In 1977, Burger King introduced a range of Star Wars themed glasses that proved to be a huge success. Quick is hoping that the new meal will be as popular as its predecessors and the initial response suggests that it will be a massive hit among fans. It is expected that the "Dark Vador" meal will leave customers feeling satisfied with the delicious combination of flavors that it offers.
