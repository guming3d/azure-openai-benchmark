article: (CNN)James Rodriguez won the Puskas Award for the best goal of 2014, but was the Colombian's strike -- which came in front of thousands at Rio's Maracana stadium, with millions around the world watching on TV -- really the year's best effort? Rodriguez was gracious enough to say that Stephanie Roche's fabulous volley, which took second place at FIFA's glitzy ceremony Monday, just might have trumped his goal against Uruguay at the World Cup. Fewer than 100 people were there when Roche collected the ball with her back to goal, flicked it over her head and crashed it home while playing for Peamount United against Wexford Youths in a National League game on a gray afternoon in Ireland. Nevertheless, her brilliant goal -- filmed by chance -- beat Robin van Persie's flying header for Holland against Spain at the World Cup into third place. Victorious Real Madrid forward Rodriguez hailed Roche's effort as "a golazo" and told reporters: "The pity is that only one can win." He wasn't the only one to voice such sentiments, with Italy legend Alessandro del Piero describing her as the "moral winner." "She is great," Del Piero added. "She needs to score another one for next year. That is what I would say to her." The award, voted for by the public, saw Roche take 33% of the vote, with winner Rodriguez on 42% and Van Persie some way back on 11%. The 25-year-old Republic of Ireland international striker, currently playing for French club ASPTT Albi, said she was disappointed not to have scooped the ultimate prize. "Being a footballer, I wanted to win," she explained. "When you have people telling you it's such a great goal -- people who know a lot about football -- it gave me the hope that I could win it. "But the achievement of getting here is fantastic, and it is something that I will remember forever. Right now it's a little bit raw, but James is a great player and he deserves congratulations."

"But I saw that goal and it's very, very good. I'm happy for her." Roche's goal was a true moment of brilliance. She received a high ball and expertly controlled it with her left foot.

Roche's success in the Puskas Award is a testament to her skill and hard work, as well as the power of social media.
