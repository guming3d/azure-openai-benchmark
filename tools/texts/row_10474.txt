chatgpt: A tablet was among the items stolen during a recent break-in at a house in the village of Newton Burgoland, Leicestershire. The burglary took place in broad daylight, prompting concern among local residents. The tablet's owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, was not at home when the break-in occurred. However, they were able to view the burglar remotely thanks to the device's camera. The image was automatically streamed to the owner's iPhone, allowing them to identify the perpetrator and provide the police with a clear image of the suspect. The device's GPS was also used to track its whereabouts after the break-in. However, the tablet's location was not found, and it is feared that the thief may have sold it on. Speaking to reporters, the victim said they were grateful for the technology that allowed them to catch the thief. They also expressed concern about the safety of their community in light of the recent break-in.
