article: Washington (CNN) -- Fueled by a close call on a runway two years ago involving a U.S. senator, general aviation pilots will soon have increased leverage when facing FAA disciplinary action under a bill awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. The legislation was spearheaded by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, whose own piloting incident led to increased scrutiny by the Federal Aviation Administration. Inhofe, an experienced pilot with more than 10,000 flying hours, faced an FAA investigation after landing his private plane on a closed runway, sending ground workers scrambling for safety. In the October 2010 incident, the investigators said the runway was clearly marked with a large "X" indicating it was closed. Additionally, a notice warning pilots the runway was closed had been issued. Such notices, called NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen), are supposed to be checked by all pilots prior to departure. Inhofe said he didn't check for FAA warnings. Supporters of the "Pilot's Bill of Rights" say the new measure passed by the House and Senate gives general aviation pilots the ability to fight charges levied against them by FAA officials. Highlights of the bill include: . -- Allowing pilots to appeal National Transportation Safety Board rulings in federal district court. Previously, pilots could only appeal FAA findings to an NTSB administrative law judge. -- Requiring the FAA to inform pilots when they're being investigated and notify them that any response by the pilot can be used as evidence against them. -- Forcing the FAA to share all evidence with the pilot before any enforcement action is enacted. -- Requiring the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the FAA's medical certification process. Pilots have argued that current FAA medical forms are easily misunderstood, resulting in those who are under investigation being accused of falsifying the documents. "This bill remedies many of the most serious deficiencies in the relationship between general aviation and the FAA, and ensures that pilots are, like everyone else, treated in a fair and equitable manner by the justice system," Inhofe said after the bill passed by voice vote in the House. Pilot advocacy groups lauded the news. "This is a landmark bill for general aviation, and protecting GA pilots' freedom to fly," said Lorraine Howerton, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association vice president of legislative affairs, said on the AOPA's website. Inhofe told the Washington Post at the time, "I called the [Federal Aviation Administration] when I landed to tell them what had happened" and to see if there was any problem ... Since there was no accident, there appeared to be no significant problem." Pilot rescued after U.S. jet crash in Japan . GAO investigators: Some student pilots in U.S. illegally .

chatgpt: Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, has introduced legislation aimed at increasing accountability and fairness in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). This comes after Inhofe faced scrutiny from the FAA in 2013 when he landed his private plane on a closed runway. Under the proposed bill, all pilots would be given the right to appeal NTSB rulings in federal district court. This would provide pilots with an opportunity to dispute NTSB actions, which have previously been final and unappealable. "This legislation is about protecting the rights of pilots and ensuring that the NTSB is held accountable for its actions," stated Inhofe. "Pilots deserve a fair and transparent appeals process, and this bill will provide just that." The bill also includes a provision that would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a review of the FAA's medical certification process. This process, which determines a pilot's fitness to fly, has been a topic of concern for pilots and the aviation industry. A review by the GAO would provide insight into the effectiveness and fairness of this process. Inhofe's legislation has received support from the aviation industry. Many pilots believe that the FAA and NTSB have too much power and are not held accountable for their actions. "Having the ability to appeal an NTSB ruling is essential to ensuring that pilots are treated fairly," said Mark Baker, President and CEO of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. "This bill will give pilots the opportunity to dispute NTSB actions and hold the agency accountable." Inhofe's legislation comes at a time when the aviation industry is facing increased scrutiny. In recent years, there have been multiple high-profile incidents involving airplane crashes and near misses. Many experts believe that increased oversight and accountability is necessary to ensure the safety of pilots and passengers alike. The bill is currently being considered by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. If passed, it would provide pilots with additional rights and help to ensure that the NTSB is held accountable for its actions. Overall, Inhofe's legislation has been received positively by the aviation industry. Many believe that it will provide pilots with the protections they need and help to ensure that the FAA and NTSB are held accountable for their actions. It remains to be seen whether the bill will be passed, but it is clear that Inhofe's efforts have put a spotlight on issues that are of great importance to pilots and the aviation industry as a whole.
