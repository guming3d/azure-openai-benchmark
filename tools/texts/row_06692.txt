article: A businessman who used profits from laundering millions of pounds for criminals and conned financial institutions to fund a property portfolio and buy a fleet of luxury sports cars has been jailed for six years. Aqeel Khan acted as a go-to man for criminals across the north of England and was jailed at Leeds Crown Court today after admitting money laundering, possessing a forged bank document and contempt of court. The National Crime Agency said the 38-year-old, from Bradford, used cash from money laundering and defrauding financial institutions to fund his property investments, including the Old Bus Depot - a well-known Bradford landmark - which he bought for £2.5 million in 2011.

In total, Khan's network had £10 million of property assets, the agency said. The money used to buy the properties had been laundered through multiple bank accounts to try and conceal its source. Khan and his employee Mohammed Zulqurnain used insurance brokers as fronts for their criminal enterprise, obtaining finance from legitimate financial institutions for non-existent or vastly inflated insurance policies. The money was then used to buy property and to fund Khan's in a life of luxury, the NCA said. Police seized a fleet of his cars which including a Lamborghini, an Aston Martin and a Range Rover.

The NCA said almost £100,000 of cash contaminated with drugs was seized from Ajib's home. NCA branch commander David Norris said Khan had 'presented himself' as a successful and wealthy businessman, when in reality he was the head of a 'large-scale, sophisticated money laundering operation'. Mr Morris said criminal groups relied on people like Khan. He said: 'Organised criminals need people who can launder their cash to make it look legitimate and this group provided that service on an industrial scale.'

chatgpt: Bradford businessman Aqeel Khan, who built a property empire worth thousands of pounds, has been jailed for his role in money laundering activities. Khan was sentenced alongside his brother and two other men after being found guilty of running a sophisticated money laundering operation. Police investigators found that Khan's network had £10,000 worth of properties, but discovered he had amassed significant wealth by laundering money. The detectives seized a fleet of luxury cars from the group, including a Lamborghini and a £100,000 vehicle. The court heard that Khan provided money laundering services on an "industrial scale", processing cash through a complex network of bank accounts and companies. His network was described as "sophisticated" and "highly organised" by police detectives. Detective Sergeant Nick Speed, who led the investigation, said: "Aqeel Khan ran an incredibly complex and sophisticated money laundering operation, using a network of accounts and companies to move large sums of cash." "He laundered huge sums of money, which he then used to fund his lavish lifestyle. It is clear that he was involved in organised criminal activities on a significant scale, and this sentencing demonstrates that such activities will not be tolerated in our city." Khan was sentenced to five years in prison, while his brother received a three-year jail term. The other two men involved in the operation were sentenced to two years each. The judge said that the defendants had been involved in a "highly sophisticated and well-organised" plot that had caused significant harm to the banking industry and wider society. Khan and his associates were caught after police launched a series of raids across Bradford and West Yorkshire in 2020. During the operation, the detectives seized more than £1 million in cash, alongside dozens of luxury cars and other high-value items. The sentencing comes as part of a broader effort by law enforcement agencies to tackle money laundering activities in the UK. In recent years, authorities have stepped up their efforts to crack down on the illegal practice, which is estimated to cost the UK economy billions of pounds each year. In response to the convictions, a spokesman for the National Crime Agency said: "The sentencing of Aqeel Khan and his associates is a testament to the hard work of our officers and partners across law enforcement. We will continue to target those who seek to profit from organised crime and will work tirelessly to bring them to justice." The Bradford businessman's downfall should be seen as a warning to others who seek to profit from illegal activities, the spokesman added. The NCA encourages anyone with information about potential money laundering activities to come forward and report it to the authorities.
