chatgpt: A 26-year-old man is under investigation by police after a Facebook group called "What happened to Jamie Bulger was f****** hilarious" was discovered. The group, which had around 4,000 members, had been sharing jokes and memes about the murder of two-year-old James Bulger in 1993. The man was arrested after police seized his laptop and other electronic devices during a raid on his home. He is currently being questioned by detectives from Merseyside Police. The discovery of the Facebook group has outraged the mother of James Bulger, Denise Fergus. She called the members of the group "sickos" and accused them of not knowing or caring about the difference between right and wrong. In a statement, Fergus said: "These sickos don’t know or care about the difference between right and wrong. They have no empathy for the pain James’s family have had to endure for the past 28 years. It’s sickening that people find the murder of a little boy funny." The murder of James Bulger is one of the most infamous crimes in British history. In 1993, he was abducted from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, by two 10-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. They took him to a railway line, where they tortured and killed him. The case shocked the nation and led to a widespread debate about the age of criminal responsibility. Venables and Thompson were tried and found guilty of murder, becoming the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of such a crime in over 250 years. They were initially sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure – the equivalent of an adult life sentence – but this was later reduced to eight years. Both were released on licence in 2001, but Venables has been jailed twice since then for possessing child pornography. The discovery of the Facebook group has sparked outrage on social media, with many people calling for the man responsible to be punished. Some have also criticised Facebook for allowing the group to exist. A spokesperson for Facebook said: "We do not allow content that praises, supports or represents acts of violence or harm. We have removed this group and are investigating the matter." The investigation into the man responsible for the group is ongoing. Merseyside Police have urged anyone with information to come forward. The case has once again raised questions about the role of social media in spreading hate speech and offensive content. While platforms like Facebook have taken steps to crack down on such content, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect victims and their families from online abuse.
