article: Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is proposing rules to govern the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate, a potentially explosive substance that was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and reportedly was a component in the July bomb attack on a government building in Oslo, Norway. The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced proposed rules for an Ammonium Nitrate Security Program that would affect anyone who buys at least 25 pounds of the material. Those who want to buy or sell ammonium nitrate would be required to register with the federal government and their names would be run against the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database of known or suspected terrorists. "In today's ever-evolving threat environment, we must continually reinforce the security of substances, such as ammonium nitrate, which can be used for legitimate purposes or exploited by terrorists," Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement on the proposal. Napolitano said the government wants to secure potentially dangerous amounts of the chemical while not hampering legitimate use. Ammonium nitrate is commonly used in farm and landscaping fertilizers as well as in already-regulated commercial explosives for construction and mining. Under the new program, those who sell the chemical would be required to keep their records and report any instances of theft or loss within 24 hours of discovery. The 200-page proposal for the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program has been posted on the Federal Register and the public now has 120 days to comment. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program already regulates facilities that possess more than 2,000 pounds of fertilizer-grade ammonium nitrate or 400 pounds of the explosives grade of the material, according a Department of Homeland Security official. In addition, in recent years, sellers and the government have participated in voluntary programs to protect ammonium nitrate. In 1995, Timothy McVeigh rented a Ryder truck and filled it with ammonium nitrate and fuel oil to construct a vehicle bomb he then used to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. The blast killed 168 people.

chatgpt: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has recently revealed its desire to implement tighter control on the sale of ammonium nitrate. This is because the chemical is highly versatile and can be used for various legitimate purposes, but it can also be abused by terrorists for explosive purposes.  According to the DHS Secretary, Janet Napolitano, "Ammonium nitrate is one of the most widely used chemicals in the United States, with more than 4 million pounds sold each year." However, she also pointed out that "the same ingredient used in fertilizer can be exploited by terrorists to create bombs," which presents a grave security threat to the country.  To address this issue, the DHS has proposed a new rule that would require individuals or businesses who wish to buy or sell more than 25 pounds of ammonium nitrate to register with the government. The DHS has also suggested that sellers should be required to keep a record of sales, and that buyers should be screened against terror watchlists.  This move has received support from experts in the field of counterterrorism, who have long argued for stricter regulations on the sale of ammonium nitrate. In fact, the US has been vulnerable to attacks using this chemical for some time now. The deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history, the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, involved a truck bomb that was largely constructed using ammonium nitrate. The proposed measures have also been welcomed by industry members. The Fertilizer Institute, an industry trade group, stated that "providing a secure environment for the manufacturing, handling, storage, and transportation" of ammonium nitrate is a top priority for the industry. Moreover, the DHS maintains that the proposed rule would not place undue burdens on businesses that legitimately use ammonium nitrate, such as in the production of fertilizer. "The rule is intended to ensure that ammonium nitrate is not diverted for malicious purposes, while at the same time allowing industry to continue to operate safely and efficiently," Napolitano added. In conclusion, the proposed rule by the DHS seeks to balance the need for necessary security measures against the desire to keep legitimate businesses running smoothly. It is a small but important step towards tightening control over the sale of ammonium nitrate and mitigating the risks of terrorist attacks on US soil.
