chatgpt: Mido, the former Egyptian international football player, has been sacked by his club Zamalek after only seven months in charge. This comes as a surprise to many, as Mido had an impressive career as a player in both the Premier League and other top European leagues, including Ajax, Roma, and Barnsley. Mido's career as a coach began in 2013 when he took charge of the Belgian club Lierse. After a successful stint there, he moved on to coach Zamalek in July 2020, but he has failed to live up to expectations. The decision to terminate Mido's contract was made by the Zamalek Board of Directors following a disappointing run of results. Mido's team had lost four of their last six games, including a humiliating defeat to Al-Ahly in the Egyptian Super Cup final. The news of Mido's dismissal has come as a shock to many fans, who had hoped that the former Tottenham and Middlesbrough striker would be able to bring success to Zamalek. However, the club's management felt that a change was necessary to get back on track. Although Mido's tenure at Zamalek may have been brief, his accomplishments as a player are quite notable. In his time at Ajax, he established himself as one of Europe's most promising forwards, scoring 21 goals in 41 appearances. He also helped Roma to a second-place finish in Serie A during his time with the club. Mido's time in the Premier League with Middlesbrough and Tottenham was also memorable. He scored 16 goals in 37 appearances for Boro and 11 goals in 27 appearances for Spurs. Overall, Mido's dismissal from Zamalek may have come as a surprise, but his achievements as a player cannot be denied. Football fans around the world will undoubtedly keep an eye on his future career moves, whether it be as a coach or a commentator.
