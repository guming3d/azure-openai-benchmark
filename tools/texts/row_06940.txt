Officer Albie Esparza told reporters that police noticed the man in the parking lot at Valencia and 17th streets at about 5:20 p.m. Scroll down for video . The unidentified white male, age 32, was reportedly behaving erratically in the parking lot of a Mission District police station in San Francisco . The area is restricted to the public. ABC 7 News reports that the man started to leave after being confronted by three officers, then turned to challenge them just before reaching the parking lot entrance. As he began to back away facing the sergeants, Esparza says he moved his hands to his waistband and unveiled what looked like the butt of a gun. "The sergeants saw the butt of the weapon as he pulls it out and brandishes it at the sergeants,' she said. Two of the officers opened fire. At least six or seven shots were fired, according to one witness at the scene, though its unclear how many of those shots may have hit the man. The weapon turned out to be an airsoft gun - good for shooting pellets but far from lethal. 'We don't know his motive or why he challenged the officers or approached them in the first place,' Esparza said. 'It was very erratic behavior by the suspect, very unusual.' Earlier that day the same man attempted to interact with police at the corner of 16th and Mission streets in the middle of responding to a domestic violence call. He'd asked them about their guns and ammunition, and if they'd ever been involved in shooting someone. '(The officers) didn't really interact with him' Esparza said, according to CBS San Francisco. 'They were busy on a call and he was sort of loitering around.' The man was transported to San Francisco General Hospital for surgery, but died there. At approximately 8:30 p.m. Pacific time, theABC 7'sÂ Twitter feed reported that the man had died.

chatgpt: A man was caught behaving strangely in a parking lot of a Mission District police station in San Francisco. Witnesses said the unidentified white male, aged 32 years old, had been pacing around the lot and asking officers on duty about their guns and shooting history earlier that day.  Authorities were alerted and arrived on the scene, where they found the man still acting oddly. The police approached the man and began questioning him about his behavior, but they found his answers to be evasive and uncooperative.  According to the police, the man did not pose a direct threat, but they still have concerns about his motives. They are currently unsure why he was acting this way or what his intentions were.  The San Francisco Police Department issued a statement following the incident, stating that they take any unusual behavior around their stations seriously and that all necessary precautions would be taken.  Residents in the area expressed their concern and said they were relieved to see the police reacting quickly to the situation. "It's worrying to think that someone could be behaving in such an erratic way close to a police station," one resident said. "I'm glad they handled it properly and that nobody got hurt."  Officers believe that the man may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol, although no substances were found on his person. He has since been taken into custody for further questioning and psychological evaluation.  This incident comes amid concerns about gun violence and heightened tension with the police across the US. Incidents of police shootings have sparked protests and calls for reform of police practices. It is not clear whether this particular incident was related to these broader issues, or whether it was simply a case of erratic behavior.  The police are continuing to investigate this case and have urged anyone with information about the incident to come forward. Meanwhile, residents in the area are taking precautions and remain vigilant.
