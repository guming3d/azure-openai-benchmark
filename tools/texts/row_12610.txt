article: By . Zoe Szathmary . The names of alleged student rapists at Columbia University have been shared by students in on-campus bathrooms - less than a month after 23 students collectively filed federal complaints against the university for mishandling sexual assault cases. Four students' names were written inside a Hamilton Hall bathroom stall and leaked to the Columbia Lion last Thursday by a tipster. The paper says that those names were listed in 'four distinct styles of handwriting, which suggests multiple authors.' Scroll down for video . List: The names of four alleged student rapists appeared inside a Hamilton Hall bathroom at Columbia University, pictured . The alleged rapists' names were quickly removed by facilities staff, who deemed it 'graffiti,' according to the report. However, the same names were found written in a Lerner Hall bathroom stall on Monday that appeared to be written by only one person, the Lion reports. Though a tipster sent in an image of the list at 5:30pm, the names had been removed within the hour. Less than 24 hours later, an identical list of alleged rapists' names appeared inside women's bathrooms on both the second and sixth floors of Butler Hall, the Lion reports. The sixth floor Butler Hall list was reportedly written in the same silver marker as the Lerner Hall list. As of this writing, the names are reportedly visible in the sixth-floor stall.

Flyers of the rapists' names were also distributed in toilet paper containers and photos of them were leaked to Jezebel. The flyers list one 'serial rapist,' as well as three rapists 'found "responsible" by the University.' The students include 'a musician, a prominent writer for a campus publication, and a varsity athlete' and are current students, Jezebel says. Jezebel's information coincides with a statement that campus news site Bwog released Monday, which says a member of their editorial staff agreed to resign over allegations. 'On May 7, allegations that a member of our staff had violated Columbia University’s Gender Based Misconduct policy were brought to our attention by an anonymous tip,' it says. 'As a reiteration of our continued work against rape culture, we have taken steps to ensure that the makeup of Bwog’s staff, without question, reflects this. Accordingly, we asked this staffer to permanently and immediately resign from their position, and they agreed.' The lists come just weeks after 23 Columbia and Barnard students filed a 100-page federal complaint against the University on April 24, citing Title IX, Title II and Clery Act violations, the Columbia Spectator reported at the time. In the wake of the allegations, nearly 100 faculty and staff members signed a letter on Bwog that supported the students' complaints.

chatgpt: In a shocking discovery, the names of alleged student rapists have been circulating among students in bathrooms at Hamilton, Lerner, and Butler Halls in Columbia University. The accused allegedly include a musician, a prominent writer for a campus publication, and a varsity athlete. These lists have been circulating for an undetermined amount of time and are allegedly current students at the Ivy League institution. These revelations come just weeks after 23 Columbia and Barnard students collectively filed federal complaints against Columbia for mishandling sexual assault cases. The complaints accused the university of failing to appropriately investigate or sanction perpetrators of sexual misconduct on campus. The emergence of the alleged rapists’ names in informal student networks underscores the depth of Columbia’s sexual assault problem. The lists that are being passed around show the names of men believed to be sexual assaulters with the accompanying message, “Don’t let your friends be their next victim.” President of Sexual Violence Response and the Title IX Office, Marjory Fisher, expressed deep concern regarding the lists. “The creation and circulation of any such list would defeat the objective of protecting our community,” she said in a statement. Fisher went on to address the issue of sexual assault on campus, stating that Columbia has a “zero-tolerance policy” for sexual misconduct and harassment. She urged victims to come forward and use the resources available to them, including confidential counseling. Columbia has a history of not fully addressing its sexual assault problem. In 2013, then-student Emma Sulkowicz began carrying her mattress around campus to protest the university's handling of her sexual assault case. Her activism helped to launch the national conversation on campus sexual assault. The recent complaints against Columbia by 23 students have led to a settlement agreement in which the university will hire an independent investigator to review approximately 500 sexual assault cases dating back to August 2013. The agreement also includes changes to Columbia’s sexual assault policies and procedures such as providing timely access to accommodations for survivors and a review of its Title IX and Sexual Respect and Community Citizenship Initiative offices. However, the emergence of these alleged lists indicates there is still a long way to go for Columbia to truly address its sexual assault problem. The university has yet to comment on the latest development. The circulation of these lists highlights the need for a more comprehensive and systemic solution to Columbia’s sexual assault problem. It is unacceptable for students to feel the need to create and circulate informal lists to protect themselves from alleged perpetrators on campus. The university must take stronger action to prevent sexual assault and support survivors in order to create a safe and secure campus environment for all students.
