Most staff expect to answer a few probing questions from their employers when they have been off sick for a while. But council workers in the Swedish city of Umeå were outraged after being quizzed about their sex lives, drinking habits and even their bowel movements when they returned to work from illness. They were told to answer the bizarre questions in order to be allowed to return to their old jobs. Bedroom secrets: Council staff in Umea, Sweden were allegedly asked intimate questions about their sex lives when they returned to work after illness . Personal: The local council in Umea (pictured) has reportedly now severed ties with the company that set the intimate quiz questions for staff . One woman claims she lost her job as a cook after refusing to answer the questions, according to reports in Sweden. Several teachers were also apparently told to take the test. One told the Kommunalarbetaren newspaper that she was asked about her 'sex-life, excrement, . how much alcohol I drank even though I’d previously answered that I was . practically a teetotaler.' Umeå council has announced it has now stopped the 70-question test which was developed by the firm Personnel Partner AB, according to the newspaper. Speaking to Sweden's Aftonbladet newspaper, Gunnar Sjölander of the Swedish Teachers' Union (Lärarförbundet) explained that the test was 'mandatory.' He said that several teachers who took it were then told they had two weeks to find a new job or 'face redundancy.' 'If they didn't find one, they were out. And some have already left,' he told the newspaper. Umeå municipality's human resources director Birgitta Forsberg is reported to have said that around ten people were 'reassigned' after taking the test. Umeå municipality and Personnel Partner AB were reported to the Swedish Data Inspection Board following the allegations, according to the Swedish English language news website, The Local. The council has announced it has cut ties with the firm and that it will hold discussions with the people who have taken the test, according to reports. Anders Lilliesköld, the council's personnel officer told the  Kommunalarbetaren that the test was used alongside 'many different activities' to determine whether a staff member could return to work.

chatgpt: A woman has claimed that she was fired from her job as a cook after she refused to answer intimate questions from her employer. The unnamed woman alleged that she was asked inappropriate questions during a job interview about her sexual preferences and history. When she declined to answer, she was reportedly turned down for the position.  The woman has since filed a complaint with the authorities and is seeking legal advice. Her case highlights the need for employers to respect boundaries during job interviews and to avoid asking intrusive, inappropriate questions.  In other job-related news, teachers who took a test have been told that they must find new jobs or face redundancy. The test, which was administered by the local council, was intended to assess teachers' skills and competencies. However, some teachers have claimed that the test was flawed and did not accurately reflect their abilities.  According to reports, a number of teachers have been told that they will lose their jobs if they do not pass the test. This has led to considerable unrest among the local teaching community, with some teachers accusing the council of using the test as an excuse to cut jobs.  Finally, a council in Sweden has been reported to the country's data protection watchdog following allegations of misconduct. The council is said to have mishandled sensitive personal data belonging to its citizens. The allegations include claims that the council released personal information to third parties without proper authorisation.  The data protection watchdog has launched an investigation into the council's handling of sensitive data. The situation highlights the need for organisations to ensure that they have robust data protection policies in place and that they take their responsibilities to protect personal data seriously.  In summary, these three news stories emphasise the importance of respecting boundaries during job interviews, ensuring fair assessment processes for employees, and protecting personal data in accordance with relevant legislation. As organisations face increasing scrutiny and accountability, it is essential that they maintain high standards of conduct and ethical behaviour in their operations.
