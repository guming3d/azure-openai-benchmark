chatgpt: Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso, who recently announced his decision to join German giants Bayern Munich, has taken a dig at Manchester United during his farewell message to outgoing teammate Angel Di Maria. The Argentine winger is set to complete a record-breaking £60 million move to Old Trafford, making him the most expensive acquisition in the history of English football. In his message, Alonso referenced Di Maria's "brilliant display" in last season's UEFA Champions League final in Lisbon, where he helped steer his team to a memorable victory over bitter rivals Atletico Madrid. This was seen as a subtle jibe at United, who finished seventh in the Premier League last term and failed to qualify for Europe's elite club competition. Earlier on Sunday, Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti confirmed that Di Maria had already bid farewell to his teammates and club staff at training, thus paving the way for his move to United to go ahead. The move is expected to be finalised in the coming days, subject to a successful medical. The news has generated plenty of excitement among United fans, who have been waiting for a major signing ever since the exit of legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson over a year ago. And with Di Maria's impressive performances for Real Madrid last season, in which he scored 11 goals and provided 26 assists in all competitions, the 26-year-old is widely regarded as the player who can finally bring the good times back to Old Trafford. However, despite the optimism surrounding Di Maria's arrival, there are some United fans who are not convinced that the Argentine is the right fit for the club. They point to his lack of physical strength and defensive abilities, as well as his tendency to drift out of games for long periods, as reasons why he may struggle to adapt to the Premier League. But whatever the outcome, the signing of Di Maria is a clear signal of intent from United manager Louis Van Gaal, who is determined to restore the club to its former glory. And with the addition of other new faces such as Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw, United fans will be hoping that the team can once again challenge for major honours both domestically and in Europe. Meanwhile, back in Madrid, Di Maria's soon-to-be former teammate Marcelo took to Twitter to bid the winger adieu. "Good luck @AngelDiMariaJM, you deserve everything you want," Marcelo wrote. "We'll miss you a lot." It seems clear that the Argentine will be missed by his teammates and fans alike, but all eyes will now be on him to see whether he can replicate his stunning performances in a United shirt. The stage is set for Di Maria to make history and cement his legacy as one of the greatest players in the game today.
