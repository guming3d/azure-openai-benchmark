article: (CNN) -- The president of the Russian republic of Tatarstan declared Monday a day of mourning as crews continued to look for bodies in the wreckage of a Russian jetliner that crashed on landing a day earlier. All 50 people on board, including the son of Tatarstan regional President Rustam Minnikhanov, died in the crash in Tatarstan's capital, Kazan. Closed-circuit video, aired on Russian media outlets, shows the plane vertical to the ground as it crashes in the darkness, creating a large fireball and a wide fire on the ground. The victims ranged in age from 13 to 87, according to a list of names the airline posted on its website. Among them was Lt. Gen. Alexander Antonov, the regional chief of Russia's Federal Security Service, and a British national. "Not all the bodies have been located," Deputy Emergency Situation Situations Minister Vladimir Stepanov told local media Monday morning. "The main work will be completed today." Officials do not know why Tatarstan Airlines flight 363 crashed. Authorities say they have confiscated documents and fuel samples from Tatarstan Airlines. Part of the answer may lie in the Boeing 737's flight and data recorders. Russian officials say they've found the flight recorders, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said Monday. Russia's Interstate Commerce Committee reports that the recorders' container was seriously damaged, the news agency said, but they've been sent to Moscow and could provide some information by Tuesday. Boeing is sending a team to assist with technical aspects of the investigation, the company said in a written statement that also offered its condolences to the families of the victims. The plane, carrying 44 passengers and a crew of six, took off from Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport, about 700 kilometers (435 miles) west of Kazan. The pilot tried to land once before the plane crashed on the second attempt, officials said. The jet was 23 years old and had been in service with at least eight airlines, including Air France, Uganda Airlines and Bulgaria Air, according to aviation industry websites. In a November 2012 flight, it was forced to cut short a flight to Moscow and return to Kazan after losing cabin pressure, according to the website AeroInside. Russia has tried to improve its checkered reputation for air safety in recent years. In 2011, then-President Dmitry Medvedev grounded two classes of Soviet-era aircraft after a pair of crashes that killed more than 90 people, including a charter plane crash that killed an entire professional hockey team. Medvedev said Russia would have to upgrade its aircraft fleet, step up safety standards and radically cut the number of airlines. 4 die in Bahamas plane crash . Plane crashes in Bolivia, killing 8 .

chatgpt: Boeing has dispatched a technical team to assist in the investigation following the crash of a Russian passenger plane that was carrying 44 passengers and a crew of six. The plane crashed in a remote region of Siberia on Sunday. Russian media has aired footage of the plane in a vertical dive as it crashed into the ground. The flight recorders have been found and could provide important data for the investigation, according to a news agency report released on Monday. The recorders could help investigators piece together the moments leading up to the crash and the possible causes of the accident. The Russian authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the crash, which occurred during a flight from the Siberian city of Surgut to the regional capital of Irkutsk. The jet was operated by the Russian airline UTair. The crash has sparked concern throughout the aviation industry, prompting many to wonder whether there were any safety issues with the aircraft or the airline itself. UTair has not released any official statement regarding the crash. Boeing's technical assistance team is expected to work with Russian investigators to help determine the cause of the crash. It is not yet clear what specific technical expertise the team will bring to the investigation. Air safety experts have noted that the crash occurred under unusual circumstances. According to reports, the plane was flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters before it began rapidly descending in a vertical dive. The plane crashed into the ground just minutes later, killing all 50 people on board. The crash is the latest in a string of recent plane accidents that have raised concerns about air safety. Earlier this year, a Boeing 737 MAX plane crashed in Ethiopia, killing 157 people. The crash prompted widespread scrutiny of the plane's design and led to the grounding of the entire fleet worldwide. Boeing has faced intense criticism in the wake of the MAX crash, with some accusing the company of prioritizing profits over safety. The company has since worked to address the issues with the MAX and has implemented a number of new safety measures. The cause of the Russian plane crash remains unknown, and officials have cautioned against speculation until a full investigation can be conducted. The investigation is likely to take several months, during which time the aviation industry will be closely watching for any new developments. Meanwhile, the families of those killed in the crash are left grieving and seeking answers about what happened to their loved ones. The tragedy serves as a sobering reminder of the risks inherent in air travel and the importance of ensuring that every possible precaution is taken to keep passengers safe.
