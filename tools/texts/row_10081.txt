article: An empty fridge is the worst thing to come home to after a relaxing holiday or a flight across several time zones. But for those who don't have the energy or time to stop by a supermarket with luggage in tow, a new service is popping up at airports. With an eye on a small but emerging market, retailers are taking advantage of weary travellers’ hectic schedules by launching click-and-collect services that allow holidaymakers to order groceries from abroad and pick them up when they land at the airport. Special delivery: Finnish grocery chain HOK-Elanto has set up click-and-collect lockers at Helsinki Airport . Airport grocery collection points are a growing trend in Europe and  Waitrose has announced plans to set up its own refrigerated lockers at long-stay car parks at London Gatwick Airport. The convenient system is incredibly simple to use – holidaymakers place an order on their smartphone or another device before flying home and, using a code sent to their mobile after paying, retrieve the delivered items without having to divert to a store. London Underground and Network Rail have both announced plans to turn their stations into pickup points for a host of different retailers, from Sainsbury’s to New Look. Last week, Finnish grocery store chain HOK-Elanto and e-commerce firm Digital Foodie launched the helpful service for travellers or employees at Helsinki Airport. An empty fridge is the worst thing to come home to after a relaxing holiday or a long-haul flight . HOK-Elanto’s pickup point is located in the arrivals hall and it operates almost around the clock six days a week, although it is located next to a store that sells fruit and vegetables and other items. Customers are charged a pickup fee of €5 (£3.90) and must give at least three hours’ notice when submitting an order. Each compartment has its own refrigerator or freezer and is opened with a code sent via text message. Land and go: Waitrose has announced plans to offer click-and-collect lockers at London Gatwick Airport . Jukka Ranua, e-commerce manager of HOK-Elanto, said in a statement: ‘With approximately 42,000 passengers arriving daily to Helsinki Airport we know the new pickup service will appeal to many busy travellers.’ Digital Foodie chief executive Kalle Koutajoki added: ‘Our goal is to ease consumers’ chores by offering a tool for more convenient shopping. Coming home from a holiday or work trip is essentially easier without the added hassle of returning to an empty fridge.’ Dutch grocery store chain Albert Heijn became a European pioneer of the service when it set up lockers at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport last year.

chatgpt: Waitrose to Offer Online Grocery Pickup Service at Gatwick Airport Waitrose has announced that it will offer an online grocery pickup service at Gatwick Airport beginning this summer, allowing holidaymakers to place orders online and pick them up upon arrival at the airport. The popular UK grocery chain will use the new service to cater to holidaymakers looking for healthy and nutritious food options while they travel. The new service, called Waitrose Rapid, will allow customers to place their order online up to 24 hours before they fly. Once the order is received, customers will receive a unique code via text message to unlock the delivery locker at the airport. The pickup fee for the service will be free for orders over £60, while orders below that amount will incur a £5 charge. According to reports, Waitrose will be working with Gatwick's logistics partner, DHL, to manage the service. Customers will be able to choose from a selection of pre-packed food options, including sandwiches, salads, snacks, and drinks, as well as other essentials such as toiletries and baby products. The new online grocery pickup service is part of Waitrose's larger effort to expand its online presence and cater to customers' changing preferences. The company, which has traditionally focused on in-store shopping, has been ramping up its online offerings in recent years, including introducing a range of delivery options such as same-day delivery and click-and-collect. Waitrose's move into the airport grocery pickup market is not entirely unique, with similar services already available in other parts of the world. In Finland, for example, grocery chain HOK-Elanto offers a similar service at Helsinki Airport, allowing customers to pick up pre-ordered groceries after they land. The service costs a €5 (£3.90) pickup fee. While the online grocery pickup service may be appealing to some flyers, the convenience may come at a cost. Critics have raised concerns about the impact of such services on small businesses and independent retailers, who may not have the resources to compete with larger grocery chains. Despite these concerns, Waitrose is optimistic about the potential of its new online grocery pickup service, which it says will make it easier for customers to access healthy and nutritious food options while travelling. "Waitrose Rapid is all about convenience for holidaymakers, providing a great range of products for those who want to fill up their cupboards before they depart, as well as those who simply want a meal or snack for the flight," said Simon Burdess, director of commercial operations at Waitrose & Partners. The new service is set to launch at Gatwick Airport this summer, with plans to expand to other airports in the UK in the coming months.
