article: By . Victoria Woollaston . Twitter is a hive of opinion, news and GIFs but sometimes even the most interesting people can tweet during events or about certain topics that annoy their followers. In the not-so-distant future, these users will be able to mute irritating or boring tweets temporarily, rather than blocking the account completely. The feature is reportedly being trialled on mobile devices at the same time CEO Dick Costolo hinted at introducing a ‘whisper mode’ for private conversations. Reports emerged today Twitter is also trialling a mute option on its apps. Users said they spotted the feature on iOS and Android devices as well as Tweetdeck, pictured. The tool lets people silence users temporarily, but does not block them from sending notifications and direct messages . On Twitter, any user can be blocked. This means the blocked user can't see the tweets of the person who has blocked them, and can't send them replies or direct messages. With the mute button, users can be effectively hidden temporarily. This means muted people can still tweet and message the user, but their tweets are hidden from the timeline. The 'whisper mode', on the other hand, will work like direct messages for groups of people, rather than one-on-one conversations. Costolo made the comments during an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week. ‘There are frequently public conversations that you would like to grab hold of and take into whisper mode. Being able to move fluidly between that public conversation and the private conversation is something we’ll make simpler.’ Private conversations are already possible using direct messages (DMs), but these only apply to one-on-one discussions. Whisper mode would effectively be a group version of DMs. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, pictured, made the comments during an interview with Bloomberg. He said the site was looking at introducing a 'whisper mode' that would let groups of Twitter users to talk in private - similar to direct messages but for more people . Meanwhile, the mute button started appearing across iOS and Android devices on the official Twitter app, as well as Tweetdeck, earlier today. Users have been tweeting screenshots of the tool, that lets users silence specific tweeters in a timeline. It only appears to have been rolled out to a select few. The main difference between the mute tool and the block function is that notifications and direct messages from muted users will still appear. Twitter constantly experiments and rolls out features that don't always end up becoming permanent features. When asked about Twitter testing, Costolo said: 'In our latest iOS or Android apps, there are well over 100 experiments running in each of those apps.'

chatgpt: Twitter CEO, Dick Costolo, made headlines this week by announcing that the social media giant is considering implementing a new feature called "whisper mode." Speaking in a television interview, Costolo explained that the feature would allow groups of Twitter users to communicate with each other privately. This is a surprising move from the typically open forum of Twitter, and could potentially have a significant impact on how people use the platform. The idea of having a private messaging system within Twitter is not new. In fact, many users have been asking for such a feature for years. However, the addition of a "whisper mode" takes this one step further. Rather than simply being able to send private messages to one person, this feature would allow users to have group conversations that are completely hidden from the public eye. The potential uses for "whisper mode" are vast, and could include anything from private group chats between friends and family members, to secret discussions between business partners or colleagues. It could even be used by politicians and other public figures who want to communicate behind the scenes without the world watching. However, some have raised concerns about the potential for abuse of such a feature. For example, it could be used by cyberbullies to coordinate their attacks on a victim, or by terrorists to plan attacks. Twitter will need to carefully consider the potential risks and take steps to prevent such misuse. Alongside the announcement of "whisper mode," reports have emerged that Twitter is also in the process of testing a new "mute tool." This feature would enable users to silence other users temporarily. While there is already a "block" feature in place, the "mute" tool would allow users to avoid seeing tweets from particular users without actually blocking them altogether. This is a useful feature for those who find certain users irritating or offensive, but don't necessarily want to cut them off completely. It's also good news for celebrities and public figures who are constantly bombarded with tweets from fans and followers. By muting certain users, they can filter out the noise and focus on the tweets that matter most to them. At this stage, it's not clear when either of these features will be rolled out to the wider public. However, the fact that they are even being considered shows that Twitter is committed to staying ahead of the curve when it comes to social media innovation. As the platform continues to evolve, it's likely that we'll see more exciting new features and tools being introduced in the months and years to come.
