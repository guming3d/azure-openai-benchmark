However, there's been a rise in the number of people unhappy with their appearance when taking selfies or pictures in general. In an effort to combat this problem, Dr Neetu Nirdosh has seen an 85% rise in clients wanting selfie surgery. Selfie surgery, is a cosmetic treatment that aims to increase the appearance of the patient's face when taking a selfie. These treatments have become increasingly popular in recent years, as people seek to look their best in all aspects of their lives. Various treatments are offered by Dr Neetu Nirdosh, including fillers, Botox, and non-surgical nose jobs, which are the most popular treatments. Women, in particular, feel under increasing pressure to look good in selfies, as social media has become an integral part of their lives. Dr Neetu Nirdosh points out that many women are drawn into taking selfies, and become self-conscious of their appearance. As such, the pressure to look good is often overwhelming. While many people are fascinated by the trend of taking selfies, the concerns over the trend continue to increase. Social media has been known to negatively impact the mental health of those who use it, with many people feeling inadequate by comparing their appearance to that of others. As Dr Neetu Nirdosh explains, “People are becoming more conscious of their looks due to the increasing prominence of social media.” The pressure to look good in selfies has become an increasingly important issue, with celebrities frequently endorsing cosmetic treatments. Dr Neetu Nirdosh notes that people have always been attracted to celebrity endorsements, and the same applies to cosmetic treatments. They often want to look like their favorite stars. Dr. Neetu Nirdosh adds that while there has been an exponential increase in the number of individuals seeking surgery for selfies, the number of men interested remains low. She believes that it’s because women are more accepting of their faces, and as such, they are more likely to go for the treatment. Despite the enormous pressure, experts warn against the possible risk of excessive surgery. They believe that overindulgence will lead to serious issues concerning mental health. However, Dr Neetu Nirdosh assures that her procedures are safe, with minimal downtime or recovery time. Overall, the trend of selfie surgery has become increasingly popular, with many women drawn to the idea of looking their best in a selfie. Dr Neetu Nirdosh's 85% rise in patients wanting the treatment is proof of the increasing importance of appearance in our society. While cosmetic treatments have been around for decades, the trend of selfie surgery is one of the most recent developments in the cosmetic industry, and it looks like it is here to stay.
