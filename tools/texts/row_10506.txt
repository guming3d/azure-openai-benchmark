chatgpt: Arsenal midfielder, Jack Wilshere, has praised the preparation of Roy Hodgson following England's disappointing exit from the World Cup. Despite only managing to score two goals in three games, Wilshere claimed that England were 'excellent going forward'. Speaking to the media, Wilshere said: "I thought Roy Hodgson's preparation was perfect. We were ready for every game and we played some good football. I think we were excellent going forward, we created a lot of chances and played some exciting football." Despite England's positive performances in the attacking third, a few individual mistakes ultimately cost Hodgson's men. Wilshere acknowledged this and took responsibility for the team's shortcomings. "We made a few individual mistakes that cost us, but that's football. We win as a team and lose as a team. We need to learn from our mistakes and move forward. We're all disappointed, but we're already focusing on the next tournament." With the retirements of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, Wilshere is confident that England can enter a new era and build a team that can compete on the international stage. "It's always difficult when you lose experienced players like Steven and Frank, but it's also an opportunity for some of the younger players to step up and show what they can do. We have some talented players coming through the ranks and we're all looking forward to the future." Wilshere's optimism for the future was echoed by Hodgson, who insisted that he was building a team capable of challenging for major honours. "We have a good team here and we're building for the future. We'll learn from this experience and come back stronger. We're not far away and we'll continue to work hard and improve." Despite the disappointment of an early exit, England can take heart from their performances in Brazil. With a crop of talented young players coming through the ranks, the future looks bright for the Three Lions.
