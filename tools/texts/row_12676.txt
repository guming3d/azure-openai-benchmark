Ebro is a global producer of rice, pasta and sauces with a large international footprint -- its home Spanish market accounts for just 7% of its turnover. "The war between the different currencies is an alarming situation," said CEO Antonio Hern치ndez, "we are still in a weak recovery; we need to export goods outside." "We cannot afford to have a higher euro, in fact it's quite the opposite," he added. The company has offset sluggish demand in Europe by expanding into higher growth markets that include Morocco, Egypt and Thailand. This year it will venture into India.

Most recently Ebro acquired a 25% stake in Riso Scotti for $23.6 million -- it's the leading risotto rice brand in Italy. "We have a kind of matrix in which we try to grow," said Hern치ndez. "The first idea is go where we are not yet, and the second is to enlarge the activities that we do." To that end Ebro is branching out from its main dried foods business to frozen foods, particularly popular in North America, and fresh foods which is growing fast in France.

Hern치ndez ensures managers are hired locally when they enter new territories to utilise their understanding of the market demands. Back home in Spain labour market reforms are being implemented; businesses have more flexibility hiring temporary staff and salaries for new-hires can be lower, but they are having little impact on established Spanish businesses like Ebro. "It could even be a problem for competition," said Hern치ndez, "a newcomer into the industry can now hire staff at lower levels." Despite this, Ebro's sales increased in Spain in 2012, suggesting that the domestic appetite for branded food is finally returning.

chatgpt: Ebro, a leading global producer of rice, pasta, and sauces, has been making strategic moves to offset sluggish demand in Europe. The company has been expanding into higher growth markets, and its most recent acquisition is a 25% stake in Riso Scotti for $23.6 million. This acquisition is a part of Ebro's long-term strategy to strengthen its presence in the rice market, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in the food industry. Riso Scotti is a well-established Italian brand that specializes in producing high-quality rice, which complements Ebro's existing portfolio. This will not only help Ebro expand its footprint in Italy, but it will also provide access to new markets in Asia and North America. Ebro has a large international footprint, with a strong presence in Europe and the Americas. However, the company has been struggling due to the sluggish demand in Europe. The acquisition of Riso Scotti is a strategic move to diversify its revenue streams and expand into higher growth markets. The acquisition is also a part of Ebro's strategy to seize the opportunities arising from changing consumer preferences. Consumers are increasingly shifting towards healthier food choices, and rice is a popular alternative to carbohydrate-rich foods such as bread and potatoes. Ebro is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend, with its diverse portfolio of rice, pasta, and sauce products. The acquisition of Riso Scotti is a win-win situation for both companies. Ebro will benefit from Riso Scotti's expertise in the rice market, while Riso Scotti will be able to leverage Ebro's global distribution network to expand its reach. In conclusion, Ebro's acquisition of a 25% stake in Riso Scotti is a strategic move to diversify its revenue streams and expand its presence in the rice market. With its international footprint and diverse portfolio, Ebro is well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities arising from changing consumer preferences. The acquisition is a testament to Ebro's commitment to growth and innovation in the food industry.
