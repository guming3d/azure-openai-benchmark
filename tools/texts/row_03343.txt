article: Police in Spain are investigating the death of a nativity donkey which collapsed after being sat on by a heavyset man. The five-month-old donkey was being held in a pen which was not meant to be accessed by the public for a Christmas fair in the town of Lucena in Cordoba. But one visitor  climbed over the fence and sat on the fragile animal's back to have his picture taken, while grinning and posing for the camera. The photo of the portly man grinning as he poses on the donkey - which later died - has been widely shared on social media, where animal lovers have reacted with outrage and called on the town hall to take action . Two days later, residents noticed that the donkey, named Platero, was barely able to stand, and he was taken to a local vet. The animal was then urgently transferred to a specialist clinic, but due to the severity of his internal injuries he had to be put down. The photograph of the portly man grinning as he poses on the donkey has since been widely shared on social media, where animal lovers have reacted with outrage and called for the town hall to take action. Two animal rights organisations, Asociación de Defensa del Borrico (Adebo) and the Círculo Animalista de Podemos Lucena reported the incident to the police. The donkey was being used in a nativity scene in the town of Lucena in Cordoba, Spain . 'The donkey was literally squashed by a man,' they said in their complaint. 'The man tried to pose 'galloping,' with his almost 150kg of weight on the fragile body of the animal, squashing it to death.' Police have asked a vet to determine the cause of the donkey's death, and the town hall has said it will take legal action if it is found that the man sitting on the animal's back is responsible. The charities say they are repulsed and outraged and will move 'heaven and earth' to have the man prosecuted if it is proved that the man's weight killed the donkey. Traditional nativity scenes, known as 'belenes', are found across towns and cities Spain in the lead-up to Christmas, and often include live animals such as sheep and donkeys.

chatgpt: A tragic incident has occurred in the town of Lucena in Cordoba, Spain. A five-month-old donkey that was serving as a festive attraction at a local Christmas fair was injured by an overweight man who climbed into its pen and sat on its back. The event took place on December 6th, and two days later, the donkey began struggling to stand and eventually had to be put down. Unfortunately, the photo of the man sitting on the donkey's back has been widely shared on social media. The image shows the man grinning as he poses for the camera, unwilling to comprehend the gravity of his actions. The animal, already under stress from the commotion of the fair, must have felt threatened and intimidated when the man sat on its back. The incident has sparked outrage among animal welfare groups and individuals, who are urging authorities to take action against the man who harmed the innocent animal. Donkeys are gentle animals and must be treated with the utmost care and respect. The fact that such an incident occurred at a Christmas fair, where the focus should be on spreading joy and kindness, is doubly disheartening. The person responsible for the animal's untimely death must be held accountable for his actions. Such cruelty towards animals must not be tolerated or ignored. It sends a dangerous message that animals can be treated as mere objects, rather than living beings that deserve our protection and care. Many people are also questioning the role of fairs and attractions that use animals as entertainment. While it is understandable that such events are a tradition and a source of income for some, it is crucial to ensure that the animals involved are well taken care of and not put in harm's way. Perhaps it is time to reevaluate the use of animals in entertainment and consider alternatives that are ethical and sustainable. In summary, the death of the young donkey at the Christmas fair in Lucena has sparked widespread outrage and raised important questions about animal welfare and the use of animals in entertainment. We can only hope that the authorities take the necessary steps to hold the person responsible accountable for his actions and prevent such an incident from happening in the future.
