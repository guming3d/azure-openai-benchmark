article: The European Union's foreign policy chief said Sunday there is "no guarantee" a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran will work out. Catherine Ashton spoke to reporters alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at a news conference in Tehran. "I have been engaged in discussions with Iran for nearly four years, and I think this interim agreement is really, really important, but not as important as a comprehensive agreement that we are currently engaged in," she said, according to published remarks. "Difficult, challenging, there is no guarantee it will succeed, but I think it's very important with the support of the people of Iran for the work that is going on by the minister and his team and with the support of the international community for my work that we should aim to try and succeed." In November, Iran and six world powers forged an interim deal, under which Iran agreed to roll back parts of its nuclear program in return for relief from some sanctions. That agreement went into effect in January. The challenge now is to reach a permanent deal acceptable to all sides. The next round of talks between the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- and Iran will start next week in Vienna. Ashton's two-day visit to Tehran is the first official visit by an EU foreign policy chief since 2008, according to Iran's Press TV. Besides Zarif, she met with President Hassan Rouhani and other top political and civil leaders. "One of the things that's been very clear is the support that is given across the political spectrum for the work that is going on currently in Vienna to try and move forward on a comprehensive agreement. "That does not mean that we'll get an agreement. It does not mean that people have committed to any possible outcome at this stage. But I have had a real sense that people are committed to wanting to see the talks happen and that, I think, is encouraging of itself," Ashton said. The United States and its allies believe Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, while Tehran has said its atomic efforts are peaceful. Fast Facts: Iran's nuclear capabilities .

chatgpt: Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief spoke at the end of her two-day visit to Iran. This was reportedly the first official visit by an EU foreign policy chief since 2008. It was a significant visit since it took place amidst heightened tension between Iran and the Western powers. The primary issue at stake is Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Western powers, backed by the United States, have long suspected that Iran wants to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran, for its part, has consistently denied these allegations, claiming that it is only pursuing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The concern of the international community regarding Iran's nuclear program led to the imposition of international sanctions by the UN Security Council in 2006. The economic sanctions had a significant impact on Iran's economy, and Tehran has been in negotiations with the west to end the sanctions and resolve the nuclear dispute. During her visit, Ashton held talks with the Iranian leadership, including President Hassan Rouhani, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, to discuss the nuclear dispute and other regional issues. A statement released by the EU delegation after Ashton's visit stated that "the visit took place in a constructive atmosphere, and a number of issues of mutual interest were discussed." The statement further added that "Ashton conveyed the need for Iran to take concrete and practical steps to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program, including by cooperating fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." Ashton also expressed her desire to improve the relationship between the EU and Iran, saying that "the EU is willing to provide assistance to Iran in areas such as trade, energy, and infrastructure." The visit of the EU foreign policy chief to Iran has been welcomed by Iran's leadership, which sees it as an important step towards resolving the nuclear dispute and ending the international sanctions. The Iranian media has also reported positively on the visit, with the state-run news agency IRNA describing it as a "new chapter" in Iran's relations with the EU. Overall, Catherine Ashton's visit to Iran has been seen as a positive development in the ongoing efforts to resolve the nuclear dispute and improve relations between Iran and the west. However, much work remains to be done, and it remains to be seen whether Iran will take concrete steps to address the concerns of the international community regarding its nuclear program.
