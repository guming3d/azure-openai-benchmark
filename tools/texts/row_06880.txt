article: We all know how well a beer goes down with a bhuna - but according to Marks and Spencer we should be asking for a wine list when we sit down to a curry. The supermarket has created the three wines to provide customers with authentic pairings for their favourite Indian curries. Produced in India's prestigious Sula . Vineyards, the blends for the red, white and rosé were created in a new . partnership between M&S winemaker Jeneve Williams and Indian . winemaker Ajoy Shaw. Marks and Spencer have created three unique wines especially designed to compliment the spices of the nation's favourite curries . Jeneve Williams said that she was looking for a wine that wouldn't be overpowered by deep Indian flavours. 'My goal . was to bring wines to the UK that can pair authentically with Indian . food. It's tricky to craft a wine that can stand up to such a wealth of . spices and flavours, so Ajoy and I aimed to blend fruit forward, fresh . wines with great varietal expression. 'For . example, the Jewel of Nasik Sauvignon Blanc was created with coconut . milk-based curries in mind, so crispness and citrus fruit flavours were . crucial.' Jewel of Nasik Zinfandel Rosé 2013, £6.99 . Jewel of Nasik Tempranillo Shiraz 2013, £6.99 . Jewel of Nasik Sauvignon Blanc 2013, £6.99 . The Jewel of Nasik Tempranillo Shiraz 2013 has been created to be bold enough to stand up to the spice of a hot rogan josh, and the Jewel of Nasik Zinfandel Rosé 2013 has the fruitiness and aromatic intensity to accompany tandoori chicken . The Nasik region home to the Sula Vineyards, in Maharashtra, west India, is an area known for its torrential storms, with the first two months of the monsoon season seeing an astonishing 513mm of rainfall. The adverse weather conditions have forced winemakers in the area to adopt unusual winemaking practices in their struggle to deal with the five months of intensely heavy rain that could obliterate their crops. The wines are completely authentic having come from the Sula vineyard in western India . Jeneve says that the Indian winemakers take many extra precautions to ensure that their produce is the best quality wine despite the wet weather. 'Winemaking in the face of monsoon season is a unique challenge, but the winemakers here understand the weather and put the vines into dormancy to delay harvest until the dry season in January. 'It's a remarkable feat, and just one example of the effort that goes into producing wines in extreme climates like that of Nasik's.' The M&S Indian wines are on shelves now.
