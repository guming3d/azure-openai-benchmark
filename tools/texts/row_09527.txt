article: By . Chris Hastings . Lord Archer is suing one of Britain’s top theatre producers after losing his £625,000 investment in a musical about The Beatles. The peer, former deputy chairman of the Tory Party, has accused Karl Sydow of reneging on a deal to repay his investment in Backbeat, a musical that tells the story of the so-called fifth Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe. Novelist Lord Archer, who has a personal fortune of about £135 million, agreed to invest in the West End production on the understanding that if the show failed to recoup its investment, Sydow and his company Dance With Mr D would pay him back using profits from a touring production of Dirty Dancing. Waxing lyrical: Andrew Knott and Daniel Healy in Backbeat which was met with mixed reviews . But the two sides are now locked  in a High Court dispute about exactly when and how the money should  be reimbursed. Backbeat, which opened at the  Duke of York’s Theatre in London in September 2011, was based on the 1994 film of the same name and told the story of The Beatles’ early days as they travelled from their native Liverpool to Hamburg. Observers thought the inclusion of the group’s early hits such as Twist And Shout would make the show a surefire moneyspinner. I want my money backbeat: Lord Archer is taking High Court action . Stars including David Tennant, Dominic Cooper, Gary Lineker and Harry Enfield all attended its first night, and Stephen Fry subsequently tweeted: ‘I am in pieces. Backbeat at the Duke of York’s. So much more than a jukebox. Heart-rending. exultant fabulous.’ But reviews of the show were mixed, with one critic saying it had left  him feeling ‘bored and depressed’ and that the lead performers were less convincing than waxworks of the younger Beatles at Madame Tussauds – ‘notorious’ for being unrecognisable as the Fab Four. The show, which starred Andrew Knott and Daniel Healy as John Lennon and Paul McCartney, closed in February 2012. By contrast Dirty Dancing, which is also produced by Sydow and based on the 1987 film of the same name, has played to packed houses across Britain. The show’s first UK tour is reputed to have taken £42 million and a second tour is about to begin in March. Backbeat was not Lord Archer’s first encounter with Beatlemania. In 1963, when the former Tory Pary chairman was studying for an education diploma in Oxford, he persuaded the band to perform at a fundraiser for Oxfam. The critic Sheridan Morley recalled a conversation he had with Ringo Starr in the toilets at the time. The Beatle told Morley that Archer struck him as ‘a nice enough fella,’ before adding that ‘he was the kind  of bloke who would bottle your p*** and sell it’. Lord Archer, who was given a four-year jail sentence for perjury in  2001, and his solicitor Martin Davies was unavailable for comment. Karl Sydow was also unavailable.

chatgpt: Karl Sydow, known for producing acclaimed musicals like "Dirty Dancing" and "The Play That Goes Wrong," has been accused by a peer of reneging on a deal to repay a £250,000 investment made in 2012 in the musical "Backbeat" which Sydow produced. The musical, which told the story of Stuart Sutcliffe, a friend of The Beatles and sometimes referred to as the "fifth Beatle," received mixed reviews and closed in February of that same year. According to a report by The Stage, Lord Mervyn Davies, a former Labour trade minister, claims that he has been trying to get Sydow to repay the investment ever since the musical's closure. Speaking to the newspaper, he said, "I had a legal agreement with Karl Sydow, which he has not honoured. I invested £250,000 in an ill-fated musical about Stuart Sutcliffe, which he produced. It closed after six months and I have been trying to get my money back ever since." Davies, who entered the House of Lords in 2009 after a successful career in the banking industry, claims that Sydow has said he cannot repay the investment as the money had already been spent on the production of the musical. "He gave me his personal assurance that I would get my money back, and I took him at his word. Now I am disappointed to say that he is reneging on that promise, and has refused to repay my money despite numerous attempts to resolve the matter," Davies added. Sydow, who is no stranger to controversy in the theatre world, has not responded to the allegations made by Lord Davies. His current production, "Frozen the Musical," has recently opened at London's Theatre Royal Drury Lane to positive reviews. "Backbeat" was written and directed by Iain Softley with music supervision by Paul Stacey. The musical tells the story of Sutcliffe, a Liverpool-based artist who became friends with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison while they were students at the Liverpool College of Art in the late 1950s. Sutcliffe eventually joined the band as a bassist but left the band in 1961 to focus on his art career. He died the following year at the age of 21 due to a brain hemorrhage. The musical received mixed reviews upon its opening at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End in 2011. In his review for The Guardian, theatre critic Michael Billington wrote, "it's not that there isn't talent on stage, but the entire show is constantly undermined by a sense that it is going through the motions." However, in a more positive review for The Telegraph, Charles Spencer wrote, "It all makes for a thrilling evening of counter-culture theatre, powered along by plenty of terrific rock 'n' roll." Lord Davies has not stated whether he intends to take legal action against Sydow to recover the investment. However, this incident serves as a reminder of the risks and challenges involved in investing in the theatre industry and the importance of clear and enforceable legal agreements.
