article: Uniting nations: A quarter of UK babies have a father born abroad . One in four British babies has a father born in a different country, figures released ahead of Father's Day show. The report shows 171,000 - 24 per cent - of children born in England and Wales in 2011 had a foreign-born father. The main birthplace for foreign fathers is Pakistan, followed by Poland, India and Bangladesh. When both mothers and fathers are taken . into account, almost a third of all babies, 31 per cent, had at least one parent born . abroad, according to the Office for National Statistics. This is a substantial rise on the . figure in 2000, when just 21.2 per cent of babies had at least one . non-British-born father or mother. The statistics also show that some . 131,288 children had two foreign-born parents – 18.1 per cent of the . total number of births in 2011. The figures show that 64.9 per cent of babies born in London in 2011 had either one or two parents born outside the UK. The . next highest percentages were seen in the West Midlands, where 28.7 per . cent had at least one foreign parent; the South East, 27.7 per cent; . and the East of England, which covers counties to the north and east of . the capital, 26.9 per cent. At the other end of the scale, the . figure in the North East was 13.1 per cent, and 14 per cent in Wales. In . Scotland, it was 18.3 per cent. David Green, from the centre-right . think-tank Civitas, said earlier this year: ‘The irresponsible actions of the last . government have played havoc with public services, leading to serious . harm especially in the NHS, and serious harm in the schools system. ‘Maternity . units are in crisis, there are huge pressures on school places, and . housing is under even more pressure that it otherwise would have been.’ Mixed capital: In London, 64.9 per cent of babies born in 2011 had either one or two parents born abroad . A spokesman for the Office for National Statistics said that in 2000, the proportion of babies in England and Wales born to at least one foreign-born parent was 21.2 per cent. Not all births are necessarily to parents who live in Britain permanently, as some could be people who travel to the UK to take advantage of its free NHS. In March, a leading surgeon, Professor Meirion Thomas, said the UK was becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’ as people travel here simply to give birth. Years of high immigration levels have put intolerable pressure on maternity units because the number of births has been  far higher than officials had  predicted. There is currently a shortage of more than 3,000 midwives in the NHS.

chatgpt: According to a recent report, a quarter of babies born in the UK in 2011 had a foreign-born father. This marks a ten per cent rise from 21.12 per cent in 2000, with the figure now standing at 31 per cent. In total, over 130,000 children born in 2011 had two parents born outside the UK. The study, carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), analysed birth registrations in England and Wales over the past two decades. The results were particularly significant for London, where almost three-quarters of babies born in the same year had a foreign-born father. The figures reflect the growing diversity of the UK's population, particularly in urban areas. The findings are also likely to play a part in debates around immigration, which has been a hot topic in the country's politics for several years. In terms of the individual countries of origin, Poland was the most common birthplace for foreign-born fathers. India came in second place, followed by Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. The report also highlighted the impact of age on the likelihood of having a foreign-born father. The percentage of births with a father born outside the UK was highest among mothers aged 35 and over, with over half of babies in this age group having a foreign-born father. The data also revealed an interesting trend when it came to the educational status of the foreign-born fathers. Nearly half of those born outside the UK had a degree-level qualification or above, compared to just over a quarter of UK-born fathers. Overall, the ONS report provides a detailed snapshot of the changing demographics of the UK. With the country increasingly diverse, it's likely that the number of babies born to foreign-born fathers will continue to rise in the coming years. The report has sparked debate about the implications of these figures, particularly in the context of ongoing debates around immigration and national identity. Some have argued that the rise in foreign-born fathers reflects a positive trend of diversity and multiculturalism. Others have expressed concerns about the impact on social cohesion and the potential challenges of integration. Regardless of the political debates, one thing is certain: the UK's population is changing. As the number of babies born to foreign-born fathers continues to rise, it will be interesting to see how the country's society and politics adapt to this new reality.
