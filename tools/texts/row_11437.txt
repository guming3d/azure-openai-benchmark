article: By . Nick Pisa In Rome . Last updated at 4:23 PM on 9th January 2012 . An investigation has been launched after the bodies of dozens of dogs, cats and rabbits were found dumped in an Italian lake. Officials suspect the dogs were bred for illegal fights, but other animals had single knife wounds which some suggest may have been inflicted during a bloody mafia initiation ceremony. There are also fears the dead animals may have been bred for international export to supply labs conducting experiments - in recent years the mafia is said to have made millions from the supply of animals for this reason. Macabre discovery: Some of the dead animals found next to Frezza lake near Naples, Italy. The horde of corpses is believed to be work of a mafia gang called the Camorra . The latest discovery was made at Frezza lake in countryside near Naples, an area traditionally a stronghold of the local mafia known as the Camorra. Vets are carrying out postmortem examinations on the animals - some of which were found in plastic bags that had floated to the surface of the lake - at a specialist centre in Naples and prosecutors are waiting for a full report on the macabre discovery. An initial investigation has revealed that none of the dogs have the compulsory microchip inserted under their skin as Italian law insists which has further fuelled suspicions the animals were bred illegally. Italian animal defence group AIDAA said they had no doubt that the Camorra was behind the grizzly discovery of the corpses and suggested that some had been killed by 'would-be new Camorra members as a sign of their willingness to kill.' Convinced: Lorenzo Croce, president of Italian animal defence group AIDAA, claims there is no doubt the Camorra is behind the massacre . President Lorenzo Croce added: 'We know that the Camorra is running dogfights for illegal gambling and holding dogs in what can only be described as canine concentration camps until they are ready to fight. 'Other animals are also being used in international trafficking for vivisection purposes - we believe that this discovery is just the tip of the iceberg and there are many other dumping sites around the region.' A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Naples said they were aware of the discovery and investigating the find while waiting for official postmortem results. According to AIDAA, dog rackets provide the Camorra with annual profits of between six and seven million euros. Although less well-known than their Sicilian Mafia counterparts, the Camorra have a more blood-thirsty reputation with rival clans happily killing each other for control of lucrative drug cartels. One of the most infamous massacres was in 2008 when six Africans were gunned down in a hail of bullets in a shop near Naples after they tried to muscle in on a Camorra drug route while already this year there have been three Camorra murders in the city.

chatgpt: In a shocking discovery, a number of dogs, cats, and rabbits have been found stuffed inside plastic bags in the outskirts of a small, remote village. The uncanny incident has raised concerns among locals, animal-rights organizations and law enforcement agencies.  The suspicion has fallen on the notorious criminal organization called the Camorra. The Camorra is a powerful criminal network that operates primarily in the Campania region of southern Italy. Their portfolio includes a range of illegal activities, including drug trafficking, illegal waste disposal, and arms smuggling. The group is also infamous for their involvement in animal trafficking, illegal dogfights, and animal-testing labs. According to sources familiar with the matter, the animals that were found in the plastic bags were likely destined for one of the group's illegal canine concentration camps. These camps are reportedly set up by the Camorra to house and train dogs for illegal dogfighting. The source continues to explain that the organization runs one of the largest illegal dogfighting rings in the country.  One of the challenges that law enforcement officials have with tackling these illegal activities head-on is that the Camorra is protected by a network of loyalists and sympathizers who provide them with cover and protection. This makes it difficult for the authorities to infiltrate their networks and expose their activities. In recent years, animal rights activist groups have launched several public demonstrations against the Camorra's treatment of animals. They claim that the Camorra finances several illegal animal testing labs that operate in the region. These labs reportedly use dogs, cats, and rabbits as test subjects to develop new drugs and products. They further allege that the group also participates in illegal bird hunting and selling exotic species on the black market.  The discovery of the animals in plastic bags has rallied the local community, with several citizens demanding an end to these illegal activities. There have been calls for tougher laws to be put in place to regulate animal trafficking and to protect animal rights. The police have launched an investigation and are hopeful of detaining the perpetrators behind this heinous crime.  The Camorra has a long history of controversial practices, and their illegal activities have been linked to various environmental and public health issues. The local authorities continue to express their commitment to cracking down on their illegal activities and bringing them to justice. They have urged citizens to speak out against these practices and report any suspicious activity they may witness related to animal trafficking.  In conclusion, the discovery of the animals in plastic bags has once again put the spotlight on the Camorra and their illegal activities. This is a clear indication that there is still much work that needs to be done to curb their criminal operations, and protect the lives and rights of animals. The authorities and the local community must continue to work together to bring about an end to these unethical practices.
