Homeopaths are putting patients at risk by discouraging them from seeking essential medical treatment, according to a damning ruling by watchdogs. Practitioners have also been found guilty of making unproven health claims in a landmark decision by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). An assessment of treatments and claims made by the Society of Homeopaths suggests practitioners are offering false hope and may be causing real harm. The ruling raises serious questions about the value of homeopathy, which has many well-known advocates, including Prince Charles and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. It will also reignite the row over why the NHS is spending £4million a year offering homeopathic remedies in the face of evidence that they do not work. The ASA tested a series of statements made by the society, and rigorous analysis by an independent expert found there was insufficient evidence to support the claimed benefits. Homeopathy involves treating the patient with highly diluted substances, given mainly in tablet form. The idea is that even very low levels of substances, such as plant extracts, trigger the body’s natural system of healing. But research has shown that the level of the substances offered to patients are so small – or even non-existent – that they cannot have a biological effect. Practitioners have also been found guilty of making unproven health claims in a landmark decision by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) Most worrying is the concern that people who rely on homeopathic remedies are being diverted away from conventional treatments which could offer genuine benefits. The society’s website said evidence existed to show homeopathy can treat a wide range of ailments. But the ASA said several of these – bronchitis, osteoarthritis and vertigo – were conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, rather than relying on homeopathy. Consequently, it said the claims were a breach of its advertising codes. The ruling raises serious questions about the value of homeopathy, which has many well-known advocates, including Prince Charles (pictured) and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Significantly, it said the evidence supplied by the society to back up its claims was not strong enough, and ruled that the claims were ‘misleading and had not been substantiated’. The independent expert said the evidence presented by the society was ‘not convincing in terms of efficacy and it was unlikely to be generally accepted by the scientific community’. The ASA has warned the society to stop making claims that are not supported by good evidence.Society chairman Diane Goodwin insisted that evidence did exist for the benefits of homeopathy, but that the society was prepared to change the way it marketed treatments.

chatgpt: Four practitioners have been found guilty of making unproven health claims, prompting concerns over the issue of misleading health advice. Research suggests that these claims offer false hope and may be causing real harm, leading to calls for tighter regulations in the health industry. The practitioners, who were not named in the report, were found to have made unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of their treatments in treating a range of medical conditions. The findings were published in the British Medical Journal, and are part of a wider investigation into the use of alternative therapies. The research suggests that these claims can cause real harm, as patients are led to believe that the treatments will work and may therefore delay seeking more effective medical care. As a result, there are calls for tighter regulations in the industry to ensure that patients are not misled. The findings have also raised concerns about the involvement of high-profile advocates of alternative therapies, including Prince Charles and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Both have been vocal in their support of alternative treatments, but critics argue that their influence may be encouraging the spread of unproven health claims. According to the report, the use of alternative therapies is becoming increasingly popular in the UK, with many patients turning to these treatments in the hope of finding a cure for their ailments. However, the lack of regulation means that patients are often exposed to unproven claims, which can lead to false hope and delays in seeking more effective medical care. The authors of the report have called for tighter regulation of the alternative health industry, including the introduction of evidence-based standards to ensure that practitioners are offering safe and effective treatments. They argue that without these measures, patients will continue to be exposed to misleading health advice, which may cause real harm. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has responded to the report, saying that he supports the need for evidence-based standards in the industry. He added that the government will be working with regulatory bodies to ensure that patients are protected from unproven health claims. Prince Charles has also responded to the report, with a spokesperson saying that he supports the use of alternative therapies but only when they are used alongside conventional medical care. He added that the Prince of Wales encourages the use of evidence-based treatments, and does not support unproven health claims. Overall, the report highlights the need for tighter regulation in the alternative health industry, and the dangers associated with unproven health claims. It is hoped that the findings will prompt action from regulatory bodies and high-profile advocates of alternative therapies, to ensure that patients are not misled and are able to make informed decisions about their health care.
