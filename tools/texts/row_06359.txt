article: (CNN) -- Samsung says it expects to make a second quarter profit of US$5.9 billion, thanks largely to burgeoning sales of its flagship Galaxy smartphones. The record figure -- a 79% rise from a year earlier -- follows a remarkable first quarter performance, which saw the South Korean technology giant overtake rivals Apple and Nokia as the world's biggest phone vendor with 44.5 million handsets sold. Apple's sales of 35.1 million iPhones in the first quarter helped lead the company to double first quarter profits, while Nokia's 11.9 million sales January through March was almost half as many as the Finnish firm sold during the same period last year, eroding its smartphone market share to 8.2% from 23.5% in 2011. In May, Samsung released its new Galaxy S III phone in Europe and has seen brisk sales, which are expected to top 10 million units in July, according to the company's telecoms chief JK Shin. Analysts agree. "The impact of the Galaxy S III smartphone was maximized thanks to its sole competitor Apple Inc.'s delay in releasing a new product," Shinhan Investment Corp. analyst Kim Young-chan said in a report, quoted by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. "More than six million units of the latest Galaxy phone have been sold since its rollout in late May, with sales likely to top 25 million units in the second half," he added. Kim predicted Samsung would sell a total of 204 million smartphones in 2012. Apple, meanwhile, has still to set a date for its much-anticipated iPhone 5 -- seen by many as the challenger to the Galaxy S III. The California-based tech behemoth is also locked in a lengthy legal challenge with its Korean rival in the courts, with numerous patent infringement cases pending in over 10 different countries. Apple wins ban on two devices: What it means for you . Last week, a U.S. judge suspended sales of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus smartphone just days after issuing a similar ruling against its new Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer. San Jose District Judge Lucy Koh said Apple "has shown a likelihood of establishing both infringement and validity." Samsung is appealing both injunctions. The legal wrangling began in April 2011, when Apple launched a lawsuit accusing the South Korean company of "slavishly" copying the interface and design of the iPhone and iPad in Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Samsung countersued, saying Apple has infringed a number of its wireless patents. Samsung's results will be announced later this month. CNN's Kevin Voigt contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Samsung Electronics, in its recent announcement, said it expects a profit of $5.9 billion for the second quarter of 2021. The South Korean tech giant's impressive earnings are attributed to the robust sales of its smartphones and home appliances, including refrigerators and washing machines. Samsung's operating profit is expected to rise around 53% from a year earlier, as well as surpassing market estimates. According to market research firm Strategy Analytics, Samsung has overtaken both Apple and Nokia as the world's largest phone supplier in the last quarter, gaining ground with its Galaxy S21 series and affordable high-end A-series smartphones. Samsung now commands 23% of the global smartphone market compared to Apple's 15%. Samsung and Apple are also embroiled in multiple patent infringement cases relating to smartphone technology. The battle has been ongoing for almost a decade in various courts around the world. Both companies have been accused of copying each other's ideas and taking intellectual property without proper compensation. Despite this, Samsung seems to have gained an edge over Apple in terms of overall smartphone sales. Experts see Samsung's growth strategy as a mix of aggressive pricing, strong technological innovation and a wide range of products. The company's push towards 5G technology and its foldable screen technology have given Samsung a significant advantage over its competitors. By providing a diverse range of products that cater to different customer needs, Samsung can reach a wider audience. The COVID-19 pandemic has also played a significant role in Samsung's success. As more people work from home, demand for electronics and appliances has surged, providing a boost to Samsung's bottom line. The company has been quick to adapt to the new normal, releasing products tailored to home entertainment and personal productivity. Samsung's recent success is indicative of the company's ability to lead the market by offering innovative products that meet the evolving demands of consumers. The company is on track to surpass its record-breaking profits set in 2017, with analysts predicting that its profit margins are only set to grow in the future. However, Samsung's patent infringement cases with Apple and other competitors remain a crucial challenge that the company must navigate. As Samsung continues to establish itself as one of the most innovative and dominant players in the tech industry, it will be interesting to see the strategies adopted by its competitors to catch up.
