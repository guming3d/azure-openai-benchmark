article: Burglars who were spotted breaking into a shop were still able to spend three hours getting in and steal £5,000 worth of goods - after police were sent to the wrong village. The thieves were seen sawing a hole in a Spar door in Combe Martin, Devon, by a member of the public who immediately dialled 999. But instead of directing police to Combe Martin, emergency operators sent two squad cars five miles away to Illfracombe. 'Devastated': Owner Sue Sussex, 61, checked her CCTV and established the burglars spent three and a half hours at her premises in the raid last Friday morning at 1am . The bemused officers who found nothing happening are believed to have then returned to their headquarters, thinking it was a mix-up or a false alarm. Police blunder: Mrs Sussex said she had 'no idea why how they could make this sort of mistake' Meanwhile the burglars were able to get into the shop and made off with £5,400 worth of alcohol and cigarettes. Owner Sue Sussex, 61, checked her CCTV and established the burglars spent three and a half hours at her premises in the raid last Friday morning at 1am. She said: ‘They tried everything to get in but the shop is so secure it took them hours. The police would have literally caught them red-handed had they come to the right place. ‘I know the person who made the 999 call. He gave them all the correct information, the location and said it was happening right then. ‘I have no idea why how they could make this sort of mistake. It's such a drastic mistake. I'm absolutely devastated.’ A Devon and Cornwall Constabulary spokesman told MailOnline: 'A formal complaint has been received about this matter and as is usual in these cases we are unfortunately able to make any comment until this complaint has been dealt with. 'I can however confirm that inquiries have now begun in relation to the complaint and officers from the professional standards department will endeavour to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.'

chatgpt: Burglars targeted a Spar store in Combe Martin, Devon, and stole a significant amount of alcohol and cigarettes. The thieves were seen sawing a hole in the store's door, but despite calls to 999, two squad cars were sent to the wrong location 5 miles away in Illfracombe, giving the burglars enough time to commit their crime. The incident happened in the early hours of the morning when the store was closed. Witnesses reported seeing two men using a saw to create a hole in the door of the Spar shop. Despite calling for police assistance, the response team was dispatched to the wrong location, and the burglars managed to get away with £5,400 worth of goods. The store's owner, John Jones, expressed his disappointment with the police's slow response, saying, "It's clear that the police weren't equipped to handle this situation. They should have responded quickly and apprehended the burglars before they had a chance to escape." Residents of Combe Martin have expressed their shock at the burglary, which is extremely unusual for the quiet coastal town. Many have called for increased police presence and security measures to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. Devon and Cornwall Police have launched an investigation into the burglary and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward. They have also apologized for the delay in responding to the incident and have vowed to increase their efforts to tackle crime in the area. The incident has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the police response to burglaries and the need for better training to ensure that police officers can respond in a timely and effective manner. Many are calling for increased investment in policing and better communication between the public and the police to ensure that crimes like this can be prevented in the future. In the meantime, the Spar store in Combe Martin has been left to bear the cost of the crime committed against it. The owners are now left to pick up the pieces and try to get their business back on track after this devastating incident.
