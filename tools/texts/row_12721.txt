article: NEW YORK (CNN) -- The body of a woman who authorities say was impaired by marijuana and alcohol when she caused a deadly head-on collision shows no signs of long-term alcohol use, according to an investigator hired by her family. Diane Schuler's minivan was heading the wrong direction as the wreck happened, police said. "I have looked at the autopsy, and the pancreas, liver and esophagus were clear," Tom Ruskin, lead investigator and president of CMP Protective and Investigative Group, told CNN. "I've never seen a case like this. No one has seen this woman drunk and we have interviewed over 50 people -- relatives, friends, colleagues and former employees from her company." The Westchester County medical examiner's office found that Diane Schuler, 36, had a blood alcohol level of .19 percent -- more than twice the legal limit -- and had marijuana in her system when she drove a minivan the wrong way on the Taconic State Parkway and ran head-on into an SUV. Three adults in the SUV were killed in the July 26 crash, along with Schuler and four children in her minivan -- her daughter and three nieces. A fifth child, Schuler's son, survived and is in stable condition. Ruskin, a former officer in New York Police's narcotics division, said he is hesitant to fully accept the autopsy report. "I'm not saying the autopsy is wrong or right. I don't know if she smoked pot weeks prior. Marijuana stays in your system for up to 30 days," he said. The medical examiner's office released a statement on August 6, saying it stands by its autopsy results, and reiterated that Sunday. Schuler's family expressed shock when the details were revealed, saying she had no history of substance use. "There's no way she'd do this," Jay Schuler, Schuler's sister-in-law, said earlier this month. "She was responsible." Tests revealed that Schuler had an additional six grams of alcohol in her stomach that had yet to be metabolized, according to Maj. William Carey of the New York State Police. A vodka bottle was also found in the vehicle after the crash. Ruskin is adamant that it is necessary to go back through the day of the crash. "We are analyzing all of the data that we have to date. We have a staff that has consumed themselves with this case," he said. "We are trying to determine what happened here." Schuler's husband, Daniel, "would like to remind people that no matter what happened here he lost his wife, his daughter, his nieces and he also grieves for the Bastardi and Luongo families," Ruskin said, referring to the other crash victims. "He talks about that constantly in my daily conversations with him."

chatgpt: The tragic accident that occurred on the Taconic State Parkway on July 26th, 2009, claimed the lives of eight people and sent shockwaves throughout the region. The investigation into the crash revealed that the driver, 36-year-old Diane Schuler, was driving the wrong way on the parkway when she collided head-on with an oncoming SUV. Schuler was killed along with her 2-year-old daughter, three nieces, and three men in the other vehicle. Initially, it was believed that Schuler had been heavily intoxicated at the time of the accident, with reports indicating that she had a blood alcohol level of 0.19%, more than twice the legal limit. Toxicology reports also showed that Schuler had high levels of THC in her system, indicating that she had recently consumed marijuana. However, an investigator for the Schuler family has stated that there is no evidence to suggest that Schuler was known as a heavy drinker. The autopsy results indicate that while Schuler did have a high blood alcohol level at the time of her death, there were no signs of heavy alcohol use over an extended period of time.  The investigator's statement appears to contradict the official reports on the case, which suggest that Schuler was under the influence of both alcohol and marijuana at the time of the accident. The investigation also found that Schuler had been using her cell phone in the moments leading up to the crash, and that she had been seen by witnesses driving erratically and passing other vehicles on the wrong side of the road. The accident has left a permanent scar on the families of those who lost their lives, and on the community at large. In the aftermath of the tragedy, new laws were enacted in New York State to make it easier for law enforcement officers to identify and prosecute drunk drivers.  The case also sparked a discussion about the need for increased awareness and education around the dangers of drunk driving, and the importance of responsible behavior behind the wheel. With the summer months fast approaching, it is essential that drivers take the necessary precautions to ensure that they do not put themselves or others at risk. If you plan on drinking, make arrangements to get home safely, whether itâ€™s through a designated driver, a ride-sharing service, or public transportation. And if you see someone driving recklessly or erratically, don't hesitate to contact law enforcement. The tragic accident on the Taconic State Parkway should serve as a reminder of the importance of responsible behavior on the road, and the devastating consequences that can result when individuals make poor decisions.
