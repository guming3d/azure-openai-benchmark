article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan's robust economic recovery this year could put an end to a deflationary spiral that has sapped growth for some 14 years, says the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In its annual economic outlook, the OECD projects Japanese consumer prices will begin rising modestly by the end of this year, with the inflation rate reaching 2.4% by the end of 2014. "Aggressive monetary easing could see deflation give way to moderately positive underlying inflation in Japan," the report said. In recession as recently as last year, Japan's economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5% in the first three months of 2013, much quicker than the 2.7% expected by analysts. The brighter economic outlook stems largely from reform efforts launched by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- a set of policies dubbed "Abenomics." As part of a three-pillar strategy announced in January, Japan has ramped up government spending and the country's central bank is injecting money into the economy on a massive scale. It hopes to bring the inflation rate to 2% and put to an end to a downward drift in consumer prices that has persisted for 14 years, undermining business and consumer confidence in the world's third largest economy. The moves have led to a rally in the Nikkei stock index and a slide in the yen that has made corporate Japan more competitive overseas. Also promised are structural reforms such as increasing the participation of women in the workforce. "Reflecting a determined policy approach, the economic outlook has changed markedly in Japan in recent months," the report said. However, the OECD warned that Japan's economic recovery was "surrounded by uncertainty" given the country's high debt levels, which amount to more than 200% of gross domestic product (GDP). "In Japan, the key risk is that the unsustainable fiscal position will eventually affect financial markets and provoke a crisis of confidence," the report said. "Bringing the debt ratio back to safe levels from its current highs will be exceptionally challenging."

chatgpt: Consumer prices in Japan are expected to start rising later this year, according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This will come as welcome news to the country, which has suffered through a 14-year deflationary spiral where prices have fallen instead of risen. The report also acknowledged the progress made by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who launched reforms that have lifted the economy from a prolonged period of stagnation. Japan has struggled to boost inflation in the face of weak consumer demand and a shrinking population. However, recent economic policies aimed at spurring growth, such as stimulus packages and monetary easing, are starting to bear fruit. The report noted that accommodative monetary policies have helped lift the economy, with exports and investment driving growth. While the signs of economic recovery are positive, the OECD warned that high levels of debt remain an "exceptional challenge" for Japan. The country has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world, which poses a significant risk to the economy in the long-term. The report called for further structural reforms and fiscal consolidation to address this issue and promote sustainable growth. Despite the challenges ahead, the report concludes that overall the Japanese economy is on the right track. The government has implemented necessary reforms to boost productivity and reduce regulatory barriers to trade. Moreover, the rise in consumer prices, which is expected to pick up later this year, will provide a solid foundation for further growth. The report also suggests that Japan is in a favorable position to promote free trade agreements globally and expand its economic footprint. The OECD's report confirms the positive outlook for Japan's economy. An uptick in inflation will support the country's efforts to promote sustainable growth and provide a more stable macroeconomic environment. However, the high levels of debt pose a significant challenge and policymakers must take concrete measures to address it. Overall, Japan is on the path towards a stronger, healthier economy, thanks to Prime Minister Abe's successful revival efforts.
