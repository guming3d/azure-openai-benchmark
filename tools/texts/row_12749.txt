The lioness is fully committed to making sure her cubs have the best life possible. "People love to see the way Kashifa is raising her young ones, it's a true testament to what a mother's love can do," said a spokesperson for the zoo.

In conclusion, Kashifa, the devoted lioness, has proven to be an outstanding mother to her cubs, including Kwasi, whom she adopted after her sister's death.
