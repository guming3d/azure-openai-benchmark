article: (CNN) -- Victims and campaigners from the Bhopal disaster of 1984 have staged a "die-in" outside the UK's sports ministry to protest at the sponsorship role Dow Chemical Company will play in the London 2012 Olympics. The demonstrators object to the International Olympic Committee's 10-year deal with Dow, who in 2001 became owners of the firm that caused one of the worst industrial disasters in India, when nearly 4,000 people were killed by a gas leak at the Union Carbide plant. An estimated 45,000 others were said to be affected by the emission of poisonous gas at the site in Bhopal, which has caused cancer, disability and renal failure. The demonstrators want the Indian government to boycott the 2012 Games if the IOC keeps Dow as a sponsor, and said they will continue their protests after the Olympic body insisted their partner was not responsible for the tragedy. The campaigners are lobbying the UK government to rectify what it claims are "transparent errors of moral judgment and legal reasoning" in its failure to remove all support for Dow's sponsorship. India's government has written to the IOC to ask it to drop ties with Dow, while the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has threatened to withdraw from the Games if no action is taken. In a letter to the IOA, Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC, said: "IOC recognizes that the Bhopal tragedy in 1984 was an horrific event for India and the world. "The Olympic Movement sympathizes with the grief of the victims' families and regrets the ongoing suffering people face in the region. "Dow had no connection with the Bhopal tragedy. Dow did not have any ownership stake in Union Carbide until 16 years after the accident and 12 years after the $470 million compensation agreement was approved by the Indian Supreme Court. "We only enter into partnerships with organizations that we believe work in accordance with the values of the Olympic Movement." But with the Indian Supreme Court reviewing the case for a third time, the protestors claimed Dow was engaged in an "unethical refusal to deal with its unresolved legal and moral liabilities in Bhopal." They also claimed Dow are misrepresenting facts and "prolonging the suffering of thousands of people in Bhopal, including that of unborn generations." Officials from the protest group met with representatives from the UK's high commission and handed over a petition complete with 21,000 signatures that asked for Dow to be dropped as an Olympic sponsor.

chatgpt: A group of Indian protestors gathered outside the UK government offices in London to raise their voices against a sponsorship deal signed by the Dow Chemical Company for the 2012 Olympic Games. The protestors, who are angry at the decision, claim that Dow was involved in avoiding liability for the Bhopal tragedy of 1984. In 2010, the Dow Chemical Company, which is an American multinational chemical corporation, signed a ten-year Olympic contract for the London 2012 Games to provide a wrap for the Olympic stadium. However, the Indian group has raised questions pointing to the fact that Union Carbide, a subsidiary of Dow, owned and operated the pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, which experienced a gas leak tragedy in 1984 that killed thousands. The protestors argue that the company bears the responsibility for the incident, and hence cannot be an appropriate sponsor for an event that upholds the Olympic spirit of harmony and global cooperation. They claim that Dow has not taken adequate steps to address the issue or compensate the victims. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), however, has stood by the decision, saying it sympathizes with the demonstrators' position, but defends the deal, stating that Dow has no liability in the Bhopal tragedy as the legal case was settled with the Indian Government over ten years ago. The protests come amidst rising concern and disquiet around the world regarding corporate responsibility, and the Indian group's views on this sponsorship deal will only add fuel to the fire. Corporate accountability has become a significant issue in recent years as companies have to decide whether to focus only on making profits or balancing the interest of sustainable development and environmental and social impacts. Many critics have raised concerns about the ability of corporations and multinational companies to evade their responsibility and accountability by hiding behind legalities and political influence. Amid rising public pressure, the IOC has directed its sponsors to adhere to strict rules about responsible conduct. However, the Indian group says that Dow's sponsorship for the Olympics send the wrong message to the world about the standards and ethics that govern the event, which is meant to be a beacon of hope and unity for all nations. In conclusion, the Olympic Games are an iconic sports event that brings people from different cultures together under the inspiration and spirit of the Olympics. The current protest against Dow's sponsorship deal for the 2012 Games is indicative of the rising demand for corporate accountability and responsibility. The IOC needs to find ways to address the challenge posed by the actions or inactions of its sponsors that might undermine its goodwill and public trust, and compromise the values it seeks to promote.
