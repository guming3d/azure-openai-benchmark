New Yorkers have one of the longest commutes in the nation, according to a new report. The study by the nonprofit Partnership for New York City found that commuters in the Big Apple spend an average 48 minutes getting to and from work. That's nearly 23 minutes longer than the average commute in the U.S., according to U.S.Census figures. The sheer magnitude of people flowing in and out of Manhattan every day is largely to blame for the city's lengthy commute. Commuters wait for their trains to be called at Penn Station in New York. A study by the nonprofit Partnership for New York City found that commuters in the Big Apple spend an average 48 minutes getting to and from work . New Yorkers wait in traffic as they head into Manhattan from Brooklyn. Manhattan doubles its population every work day with 1.5 million commuters . The borough doubles its population every work day with 1.5 million commuters - which is more than the populations of Phoenix, Dallas and San Francisco combined, the report points out. More than one third of those commuters are traveling from other states, while the majority come from the other four boroughs. By comparison, roughly 150,000 commuters travel between Queens and Brooklyn every day. That's a much smaller number than the amount traveling to and from Manhattan, but it's more than enough to clog the bus, train, and especially road routes between the two boroughs. The report says more than half of commuters between Brooklyn and Queens have to drive because of 'limited' public transit options. To ease congestion along those routes, the report recommends increasing bus service between the two boroughs. The report also recommends that new businesses consider locating in boroughs outside of Manhattan. Brooklyn has seen a 24 percent increase in the number of people who both live and work there over the past decade thanks to a boom in new businesses there. Similarly, the Bronx has seen a 28 percent jump in the number of people who commute there for work. 'But the borough still has a lot to do before becoming a jobs center,' the report notes. 'For every one person who commutes into the Bronx for work, four people commute out, indicating a lack of job opportunities.' The Partnership for New York City describes itself as a 'nonprofit membership organization comprised of a select group of two hundred CEOs from New York City's top corporate, investment and entreprenurial firms.' The organization says its goal is to stimulate the city's economy by contributing directly to jobs programs and serving disadvantaged communities.

chatgpt: The Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit organization, recently released a report that sheds light on the daily commuting habits of New Yorkers. According to the report, the average commute time for New Yorkers is 48 minutes. This statistic may not come as a surprise to many city residents who spend countless hours stuck in traffic or on overcrowded trains and buses. Manhattan, the city's most densely populated borough, doubles its population every workday with 1.5 million commuters, which is more than the populations of Phoenix, Dallas, and San Francisco combined. This influx of people puts a strain on the city's infrastructure and adds to the already congested roads and public transportation systems. While some commuters travel from other boroughs into Manhattan for work, many also travel between Queens and Brooklyn, two of the city's outer boroughs. Roughly 150,000 commuters make this daily commute, and shockingly, more than half of them drive. This is concerning given the city's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions and promote sustainable transportation options. Over the past decade, Brooklyn has seen a 24 percent increase in the number of people who both live and work there. This can be attributed to the borough's growing job market, affordable housing options, and trendy neighborhoods that attract young professionals. However, this increase also brings its own set of challenges, including increased traffic and strain on public services. The Bronx has also seen a significant increase in the number of people commuting to work there. The report shows a 28 percent jump in the past decade, likely due to the borough's own growing job market as well as its close proximity to Manhattan. Overall, the report shines a light on the challenges that come with New York City's daily commute. While the city has made strides in promoting sustainable transportation options, including expanding bike lanes and increasing subway service, there is still much work to be done to improve the city's transportation infrastructure and reduce commute times. Additionally, the report highlights the importance of investing in outer borough job markets to reduce the need for long commutes into Manhattan. This can be done by promoting small businesses and offering tax incentives to companies that open up shop in the outer boroughs. Overall, the Partnership for New York City's report offers valuable insights into the city's commuting habits and serves as a call to action for city officials and lawmakers to address the challenges that come with a city of 8 million people.
