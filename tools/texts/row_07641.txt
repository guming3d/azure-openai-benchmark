article: By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A pair of Canadian fighter jets were forced to escort a flight full of holidaymakers back to Toronto after two drunk women disrupted the Cuba-bound flight and made threats against the plane. The two passengers, believed to be in their 20s, drank a large amount of duty free alcohol in the toilet, before setting off the smoke alarms by lighting a cigarette and getting in a fight. They ended up making threats against the plane, which were 'considered non-credible given their condition'. A Sunwing plane similar to the one diverted back to Toronto after two drunk women made threats against it . The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled two CF-18 fighter jets from Bagotsville, Quebec as a 'precautionary measure', diverting the Sunwing Flight 656 back to Toronto. A flight headed to Paris out of Miami had to be diverted to Logan Airport in Boston last night because of an unruly passenger interfering with flight crew. American Airlines Flight 62 flew out at around 6.40pm and was headed for Charles de Gaulle, but was back on the ground in Boston by 10pm. Massachusetts Port Authority said state police arrested a man and charged him with interfering with a flight crew. No one was injured. Sunwing said in a statement that it was 'reported that the passengers consumed a significant quantity of their duty free alcohol purchase in the lavatory and lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke detector alarm,' NBC News reported. They then 'proceeded to get into a physical altercation with each other and made a threat against the aircraft, which was considered non-credible given their condition.' NORAD said in a statement: 'Once the aircraft was safely on the ground, the Canadian fighters returned to their home base.' The flight headed out for a second time with a new  crew to Varadero via Manzanillo, Cuba last night. Sunwing had a similar problem at the end of last month, when another flight from Toronto had to return while en-route to Panama after threats from a passenger.

chatgpt: Sunwing Flight 656 was forced to make an emergency landing on Wednesday after two female passengers set off the smoke alarm with their cigarettes and got into a physical altercation mid-air. The flight was headed to Cuba from Toronto with 189 passengers on board. The incident took place shortly after the flight took off from Toronto, and the smoke alarm alerted the flight crew. Upon investigation, it was discovered that two female passengers were smoking in the lavatory which caused the alarm to go off. The situation quickly escalated when the women got into a physical fight, causing a disturbance on the flight. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was then promptly called in, which led to the scrambling of two fighter jets to escort Sunwing Flight 656 back to Toronto. Upon landing, the two women, aged 25 and 26 were arrested and charged with smoking on board an aircraft and endangering the safety of the flight. The flight was later rescheduled to take off that night with a new flight crew, much to the relief of the passengers. However, this was not the only aircraft that faced a disturbance on Wednesday. American Airlines Flight 63 from Miami to Paris was also forced to make an emergency landing in Ireland due to an unruly passenger on board. The passenger was reportedly drunk and was causing a disturbance, which led to the diversion of the flight. “We take safety seriously, and our priority is always the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew,” said the airline in a statement. The airline also commended the crew on their quick response and cooperation with authorities. Incidents such as these highlight the importance of adhering to safety protocols and regulations while flying. Smoking on board is strictly prohibited, and passengers who engage in such behavior not only risk legal repercussions but also endanger the safety of the flight and put other passengers in harm's way. In conclusion, while the passengers and flight crew of Sunwing Flight 656 and American Airlines Flight 63 may have faced a stressful situation, they can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing that they are safe and that proper measures were taken to ensure their safety. This serves as a reminder to all passengers to adhere to safety regulations and to report any suspicious or disruptive behavior to the flight crew immediately.
