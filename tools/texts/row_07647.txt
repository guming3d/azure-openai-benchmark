chatgpt: Actor Ralph Fiennes has revealed that he met with producers in the 1990s for the chance to play James Bond, but was ultimately not given the role. Fiennes implied that it was a mutual decision between himself and the producers. The actor currently stars in the franchise as M, the head of MI6, alongside Daniel Craig. Speaking during an interview with The Telegraph, Fiennes said, "I did have a meeting with [producer] Barbara Broccoli and [producer] Michael Wilson in the '90s sometime - at the point where they were looking for new Bond. Pierce Brosnan had not taken over, and I was strongly considered for it."  Despite being in the running for the iconic role, Fiennes said that not getting the part was ultimately for the best. "I went on a long holiday and pondered it, and I thought it might be a bit of a poisoned chalice," he said. "I think that's what I felt. And I think Pierce [Brosnan] did a brilliant job."  Brosnan was ultimately chosen to succeed Timothy Dalton as Bond in 1995. He went on to star in four films over the course of his tenure, before being replaced by Daniel Craig in 2006. Craig has since starred in five Bond films, with the upcoming "No Time to Die" set to be his final outing in the role. For his part, Fiennes has become a staple of the Bond franchise in his role as M. He first appeared in the series in 2012's "Skyfall," before reprising the role in both "Spectre" and the upcoming "No Time to Die."  While he may not have played Bond himself, Fiennes said he has enjoyed being a part of the franchise nonetheless. "I'm very blessed to have the role of M in the current incarnation of Bond," he said. "I love being part of it, and I love working with Daniel [Craig] and the whole team. It's a great pleasure." Despite not getting the chance to play Bond himself, Fiennes said he had no regrets about how things turned out. "I don't regret not doing it," he said. "I really don't. I think Pierce did a fantastic job with it, and I'm really happy to be part of it in another way."
