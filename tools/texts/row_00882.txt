article: (CNN) -- The NFL referees union formally ratified Saturday a contract with the league that had been agreed upon earlier this week. The approval marks an official end to the lockout, said spokesman Greg Aiello of the National Football League. Even before the formal vote, the officials returned to work in Thursday night's game in Baltimore between the Ravens and the Cleveland Browns. The Ravens won, 23-16. The new eight-year contract -- the longest ever for officials, according to the NFL -- gives the union referees a pay bump from $149,000 a year in 2011 to $173,000 in 2013. The pay will rise to $205,000 by 2019. Real refs return to cheers . The agreement keeps their pension program in place for five years. The contract allows the NFL to hire some officials on a year-round basis and hire additional referees so they can be trained. This season's use of replacement referees climaxed in a furor over a botched call that allowed the Seattle Seahawks to walk away with a 14-12 victory against the Green Bay Packers in a nationally televised game Monday night. In what became a widely mocked symbol of the quality of officiating by the replacements, a photo from that game shows two officials in the end zone displaying competing signals: one indicating a touchdown, the other an interception. The result generated intense and immediate criticism of the league. Even President Barack Obama weighed in Tuesday urging a quick resolution. On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was "very pleased" with the preliminary resolution. For NFL officials, it's a side job that requires a lot of work . Commissioner Roger Goodell said he was not surprised by the outcry about the Monday night game. The league acknowledged Tuesday that the Packers should have won, but allowed the result of the game to stand. The return of the league's regular referees won't put an end to controversial calls, said retired NFL player Tiki Barber. But it will raise the respect level between coaches and players and officials, Barber said. "There's still going to be arguing with referees," he said. "They're still going to make bad calls. But now we're going to know that it's coming from a base of knowledge. These guys know what they're talking about and they're going to have an argument for why they do what they do on the field." Lessons for NFL fans . CNN's Jason Durand and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The NFL referees are back, and they're here to stay. After reaching an agreement with the National Football League (NFL), the referees returned to work in Thursday night's game. On Saturday, the ratification of the deal was a formality, as an eight-year contract was established. This is the longest contract in NFL history. One of the key highlights of the agreement is that the union refs' salaries will significantly increase. From a salary of $149,000 in 2001, it will rise to $173,000 in 2013. It will eventually top out at $205,000 by 2019. This is a significant increase from their previous contract, which saw their salaries increase at a much slower rate. Another important clause in the new contract is that the league will be permitted to hire additional referees to be trained. This is a necessary step because, currently, there are not enough qualified referees to cover all of the games. The addition of new referees could be a significant factor in ensuring that all games are officiated correctly. The new contract will also ensure that the NFL will be able to retain their newest referees, who are often lured away by college football programs. The new contract will allow the NFL to offer these referees a more attractive pay package, which should encourage them to stay with the league. The deal also includes some significant improvements to the refs' healthcare plans. The previous contract had a significant gap in coverage, which left some refs without proper healthcare. The new contract will ensure that all referees have access to a high-quality healthcare plan. Overall, the new agreement is seen as a significant win for the referees' union. They were able to secure a substantial increase in their salaries, as well as additional coverage for their healthcare. Furthermore, the addition of new referees will ensure that all games are officiated fairly. The NFL has been facing an increasing number of issues relating to the quality of officiating in recent years. The new deal with the referees' union is a significant step in addressing these concerns. It is hoped that the new referees will be better trained and that the players will have more confidence in the officials. In conclusion, the new contract agreement between the NFL and the referees' union is a significant win for both parties. The referees will receive a substantial increase in pay, while the league will be able to attract and retain more qualified referees. This should lead to more consistent and fair officiating, which will ultimately benefit the players and the fans alike.
