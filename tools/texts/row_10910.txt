article: (CNN) -- Hollywood loves a cash cow, and Heidi Murkoff's pregnancy bible surely qualifies. It spent more than a decade on The New York Times' best-seller lists, and there are some 17 million copies in print. So what if there's no story? There's a name -- and as all parents know, that's a major achievement in itself. So, what to expect from "What to Expect When You're Expecting" -- the movie? Like other recent "concept" films, those cynical date movies -- "Valentine's Day" and "New Year's Eve" for instance -- the film wears a celebrity-studded thong to cover any perceived shortcomings in the script department. They come in all shapes and sizes, new and old. Kids your kids will know like Anna Kendrick, and Chace Crawford, TV personalities like "Glee's" Matthew Morrison and Cheryl Cole (playing herself) rubbing shoulders with inescapable media magnets like Chris Rock and Jennifer Lopez. We even get celebrities playing celebrities: Cameron Diaz as motivational weight-loss guru/dance show winner Jules, Elizabeth Banks as baby store owner/nursery book author Wendy, Dennis Quaid as Wendy's overbearing father-in-law, an ex-NASCAR champ, Ramsey. These aren't people you meet in my neighborhood, but types we know well from talk shows and supermarket tabloids, and see, here's the point, when it comes to obstetrics, they're just like you and me: anxious, nauseous, excited, and at the mercy of the fates. Screenwriters Shauna Cross and Heather Hach hop between half a dozen couples, most of them residents of Atlanta, and each allocated a representative pregnancy issue. Holly and Alex (Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro) are adopting a Kenyan baby, but he's getting cold feet and she's losing her best-paid gig. Rival food cart chefs Rosie and Marco (Kendrick and Crawford) get pregnant on their first date, and don't know if they're ready to remake "Knocked Up" so soon. Meanwhile Wendy wants everything to be just perfect but isn't prepared for the gas. ... The jokes are feeble and the conflicts never transcend sitcom material -- in other words, "What to Expect When You're Expecting" is entirely predictable and not a little redundant. The days when the movies would discreetly close the door when a woman went into labor ("Hot water, and lots of it!") are long gone. It's been nearly 30 years since Murkoff's book was first published, and there's hardly an aspect of pregnancy that hasn't been channeled into Hollywood clichÃ©. Which isn't to deny there's something reassuring about seeing other people going through this stuff one more time. Perhaps the saddest aspect of what is largely, admittedly, an inoffensive and anodyne enterprise, is the sad spectacle of Rock and chums wheeling strollers through the park in the service of lame gags about baby-whipped dads. As far as we've come, it would seem that half the world's parents are still little more than a laughingstock. Final word: not worth the sitter.

chatgpt: The movie "What to Expect When You're Expecting" is an adaptation of Heidi Murkoff's bestselling pregnancy guidebook, but according to film reviewer Tom Charity, the cinematic version falls short. In his review, Charity notes that the film's attempts at humor lack imagination and that the conflicts depicted are too shallow to resonate with audiences. The movie follows five couples as they navigate the ups and downs of pregnancy, from the early stages of planning to the chaotic moments of labor and delivery. The star-studded cast includes Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, and Anna Kendrick, among others. With such a talented ensemble, one might expect a movie that is both entertaining and insightful. However, Charity's review suggests otherwise. Charity writes that the film's attempts at humor wither due to their lack of originality. The jokes in "What to Expect When You're Expecting" are "feeble" and never manage to rise above the level of sitcom material. This is particularly frustrating given the movie's potential. "Pregnancy can be a rich source of humor," Charity writes, "but this film squanders that opportunity." In addition, Charity notes that the conflicts in the movie are disappointingly shallow. Rather than exploring the complex emotional landscape of pregnancy and childbirth, the film opts for easy, predictable scenarios that fail to resonate with viewers. "What to Expect When You're Expecting" is, according to Charity, "entirely predictable." Despite the film's shortcomings, Charity does acknowledge some of its strengths. The cast, for one, is talented and does its best with the material it's given. In addition, the movie's depiction of the physical realities of pregnancy and childbirth is notable for its honesty. Charity writes that the film "doesn't shy away from the less glamorous aspects of pregnancy," and that this frankness is refreshing. Ultimately, however, Charity's review suggests that "What to Expect When You're Expecting" falls short of its potential. The movie has all the ingredients for a smart, engaging exploration of pregnancy and parenthood, but it fails to rise above the level of a forgettable romantic comedy. For audiences hoping for a witty and insightful depiction of the joys and challenges of having a baby, "What to Expect When You're Expecting" may prove disappointing.
