A burglar has been jailed after he was caught sleeping by police - in a stolen car outside a home he had just raided. James Rollinson dropped off in the back seat after stealing jewellery, a games console, a laptop and a camera from a woman's home in Sedgley, West Midlands, on December 23 last year. The 20-year-old had taken the bagful of stolen property back to his own home before returning to the house and passing out in the car. Rollinson admitted burglary and was jailed for 12 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday . The court heard a neighbour called police - who found Rollinson asleep in the back of the parked car. Jailing him, Recorder Denis Desmond said: 'You took her property to your home, you came back and you got into her car and then you fell asleep.' Prosecutor Alka Brigue told the court Rollinson targeted the house after seeing Miss Goodyear drinking in a pub in Sedgley. The crook knew her home was empty and smashed a side window with a brick to gain access. The missing goods - apart from the camera - were later recovered from Rollinson's home in Sedgley and returned to Miss Goodyear. Defending Rollinson, Jas Mann said the burglar was 'tanked up' after a heavy drinking session and he had little recollection of the burglary.

chatgpt: A man from Wolverhampton has been jailed for a year after he burgled a woman's house and stole a games console, a laptop, and a camera. The culprit, identified as 27-year-old Daniel Rollinson, admitted to the burglary and was sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court. According to the court hearing, Rollinson broke into the woman's house and took the items from her property. Instead of leaving the house immediately, he decided to take the haul home with him. He then made his way back to the house and passed out in his car. The woman, who was not identified, discovered the burglary and reported it to the police. They found Rollinson, still passed out in his car, along with the stolen items. Rollinson was subsequently arrested and charged with burglary. Rollinson appeared before a judge at Wolverhampton Crown Court and admitted to his actions. The court heard that Rollinson had a history of drug abuse and committed the burglary to fund his addiction. The judge sentenced Rollinson to 12 months in jail, stating that his actions had caused significant distress to the victim, who had been left feeling violated and vulnerable. He also noted that Rollinson had shown little remorse for his actions. Detective Inspector Ian Wilkins, who led the investigation, said: "Rollinson's actions were despicable, and he has been rightfully punished for his crimes. Burglary is a serious offence that causes significant harm and distress to victims, and we will work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice." He added, "I hope this sentence sends a clear message that we will not tolerate such crimes in our communities, and we will do everything in our power to ensure they are brought to justice." The woman affected by the burglary said: "I am relieved that Daniel Rollinson has been jailed, but the burglary has had a lasting impact on me. I no longer feel safe in my own home and am constantly looking over my shoulder. I hope others will learn from this case and understand that breaking into someone's home is never acceptable."
