article: (CNN) -- A South Boston priest has been placed on administrative leave after his arrest on child pornography charges, which allegedly involved the use of a parish rectory computer. Rev. Andrew Urbaniak, pastor of Our Lady of Czestochowa, is barred from functioning as a priest and was arraigned Wednesday after detectives uncovered pornographic images of young girls on his computer. The children are thought to be between the ages of 8 and 10, police said. When detectives entered the rectory on Tuesday, they apparently found the computer was in the process of downloading material from a peer-to-peer network, according to prosecutors. The nature of that material is not clear. Urbaniak, 39, was arrested Tuesday afternoon after a two-month police investigation of peer-to-peer networks, which involved state troopers assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. He is charged with one count of possession of child pornography and one count of distributing images of a child in the nude. During the investigation, authorities said they noticed files with names that included phrases such as "pre-teen," "young," "little," "pedo," "pedofilia" and "lolitas." The files were hosted by a computer that was eventually linked to the computer at the Dorchester Avenue rectory, authorities said. "These charges are serious, and they are especially disturbing given the defendant's position of trust," said Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley. "They reflect sexually explicit images of very young girls who are, legally and morally, incapable of consenting to such exploitation." Urbaniak is being held on $10,000 cash bail. Once released, he is required to wear a GPS monitoring device, surrender his passport, be barred from Internet use and have no contact with children younger than 16. Urbaniak has not been charged with enticing a child, and no victims have come forward. His attorney, Jeffrey Denner, said it is their "intention to assess and obtain all the evidence." "The whole situation is very disquieting and very saddening," he added. "We are obviously treating it with the gravity and respect it deserves."

chatgpt: A priest has been arraigned after being arrested for possessing pornographic images of young girls on his computer. Andrew Urbaniak, a South Boston priest, is currently on administrative leave from his position. Urbaniak was not allowed to function as a priest once the allegations were made, and now faces legal consequences. Detectives had uncovered the images during their investigation, which led to the arrest of Urbaniak. The police have not disclosed any further details about the images and how many were found on his computer, but the seriousness of the offense is not to be ignored. Urbaniak was arraigned on Wednesday, and his attorney could not be immediately reached for comment. It is still unclear what legal action will be taken against Urbaniak and how this could affect his career as a priest. This is certainly concerning news for the Catholic Church, which has faced numerous scandals regarding the sexual misconduct of priests in recent years. It is unclear whether Urbaniak had any prior history or suspicion of this type of behavior, but this incident shines a spotlight on a larger issue within the institution. Despite the seriousness of these allegations, it is important to remember that this behavior is not representative of the vast majority of priests or members of the Church. The vast majority of priests are dedicated to their faith and serve their communities with compassion and kindness. This incident highlights the need for increased vigilance and monitoring within the Church to ensure that individuals who engage in this type of behavior are held accountable for their actions. This is not only necessary for the protection of minors but also for maintaining the integrity of the Catholic Church. The case against Urbaniak is ongoing, and further details may emerge in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen what the legal consequences for Urbaniak will ultimately be, but the damage to his reputation and that of the Catholic Church has already been done.
