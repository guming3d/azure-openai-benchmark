When Helen Williams settled into the sauna at her local leisure centre for her  weekly session,  she was hoping it would help her relax. Instead, she found herself  getting all steamed up – over an influx of nudists. An astonished Mrs Williams, 54, watched in bewilderment as she was surrounded by naked men and women from a naturist club. Furious: Norman Williams, and his wife Helen, whose session in the sauna at Chepstow Leisure Centre was interrupted by a group of 40 local nudists . First, two naked bathers climbed into the sauna alongside her. Then, when she headed to the changing room to get away from them, she found yet more in there. Bosses at the council-run leisure centre have now apologised after admitting the nudists should not have been able to mix with regular customers. Mrs Williams’ husband Norman, 70, said: ‘She went in as normal to the gym and swimming pool for her regularly weekly session. ‘She was then in the sauna when men and women came in with no clothes on at all. ‘They were all in the swimming pool as well. Helen went into the changing room to get away but there were naked men and women in there as well. ‘She changed quickly and came home. I was furious – what if there were children about?’ Mr Williams phoned the leisure centre in Chepstow, South Wales, to complain and was told his wife had accidentally witnessed a regular meeting of 40 local naturists. Leisure centre spokesman Ian Saunders said: ‘We have two sauna areas, one downstairs and one upstairs. The naturist group privately hire the swimming pool each Friday evening and use the upstairs sauna area to change. Astonished: A spokesman for the council-run sauna in Chepstow, South Wales, said that the group had privately hired the sauna where Mrs Williams 'unfortunately' found herself . ‘Unfortunately a lady booked a sauna and found herself in the upper sauna area. ‘Usually our staff clear the public from the areas used by the naturist group. ‘We are naturally very disappointed that on this occasion the lady concerned was left in the sauna as the group entered. ‘This is the first problem we have encountered in 25 years that the club has hired the pool. We have apologised to the lady concerned and wish to assure the public that we will look into this incident.’ But Mr Williams added: ‘My wife didn’t know whether it was a culture thing. It’s a place for public use. We’re not going there again.’ Mrs Williams is originally from China, and married her husband, who she met through friends, in the city of Xi’an in 2008. Many sports facilities in Britain hold naturist swimming sessions – with the World Naturist Swimming Championships taking place at a Rugby leisure centre in 2009.

chatgpt: A woman from Chepstow, South Wales, had a shocking experience when she visited a council-run center for a relaxing soak in the sauna. Helen Williams, 54, was taking a bath when two nude strangers from a local nudist group entered the sauna beside her, leaving her utterly astonished. Mrs. Williams' husband phoned the center soon after the incident to report the unusual encounter. To their surprise, the staff informed her husband that there were no misconducts regarding the incident. Instead, they told him that his wife had accidentally stumbled upon a meeting of 40 naturists at the center. According to the center staff, the sauna was not exclusively reserved for the group, but the group was indeed using it at the time of Mrs. Williams' visit. The staff also clarified that the gym and the sauna were both labeled as "mixed" and "unclothed" facilities, and customers were made aware of this policy before booking. Mrs. Williams expressed her disbelief and displeasure regarding the incident. She claimed that she had not been informed beforehand about the naturist group's meeting and had no intention of deliberately encountering them. She further added that she felt violated by the sudden appearance of two naked strangers next to her in the sauna. The local naturist group maintains that they have been using the center's facilities for their meets for several years and had never encountered any complaints or problems until now. They claimed that they were, in fact, exercising their right to enjoy the facilities without any clothes on and that the center staff had been fully informed about their group's plans to meet. The incident has sparked a debate among residents of Chepstow and neighboring areas, with some supporting the naturist group's right to practice their beliefs and use the facilities without clothes on. At the same time, others voiced their disgust and disbelief at the idea of "mixed" facilities and the potential for encountering strangers while bathing or exercising. The council has yet to release any official statement regarding the incident or the centers' policies on mixed facilities. However, a spokesperson from the council has promised to investigate the matter thoroughly and ensure that customers are adequately informed about the facilities and their intended usage. Meanwhile, Mrs. Williams has reportedly been traumatized by the incident and is seeking an apology from the council and the naturist group. She also expressed her desire to see clearer guidelines and signage posted around the center's facilities to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. In conclusion, the unexpected encounter between Mrs. Williams and the naturist group has raised questions about privacy, consent, and the appropriate use of mixed facilities. It remains to be seen how the council will address these issues and ensure that all customers feel safe and comfortable while using the center's facilities.
