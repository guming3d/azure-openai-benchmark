article: (CNN) -- It has appeared repeatedly on Venezuelan state television, government ads, and the even the president's Twitter account. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has a new populist slogan. Chavez, who recently admitted he is battling cancer, is no longer using the slogan that defined his first decade in power: "patria, socialismo o muerte" (motherland, socialism, or death). He has now changed it for one that is markedly more optimistic. Since he returned from Cuba earlier this month after undergoing cancer treatment that included a surgery, Chavez has been using the slogan "viviremos y venceremos" -- we will live and we will come out victorious. The 56-year-old socialist leader has also been noticeably more focused on topics that center on life rather than revolution and socialism. Earlier this week he attended Mass at a Caracas military academy and took Holy Communion while his supporters prayed for his health. Thursday morning, Chavez wrote on his twitter account, @chavezcandanga, "Good morning, happy World! Good morning, to Living! I sing to you from my barracks. I play the trumpet and start my battle. We will live and we will come out victorious!!!" In a phone interview aired by the Venezuelan state channel VTV Wednesday, Chavez revealed to the audience that the tumor found in his pelvic area was "the size of a baseball." He also said that the second phase of his treatment includes "an organ by organ evaluation" and that he may need radiation or chemotherapy later on. Chavez spent almost a month in Cuba for the initial phase of his cancer treatment, which included surgery. The opposition repeatedly called for Chavez to name a temporary head of government in his absence. Now that he's back, Chavez says he's under 24-hour medical supervision, but made it clear that he's still calling the shots. "I am in my barracks, but still commanding," he said.

Chavez's new slogan, "Chavez Vive, La Lucha Sigue," translates to "Chavez Lives, The Struggle Continues." The new slogan was first seen on posters throughout Venezuela and has since been adopted by Chavez's supporters and followers. The abandonment of his previous slogan, "Patria, Socialismo o Muerte," meaning "Homeland, Socialism or Death," is a significant departure for Chavez, who has been known for his fiery and often controversial speeches throughout his presidency. The old slogan was infused into Venezuela's politics and culture, being prominently displayed on buildings, memorials, and even on official government documents.
