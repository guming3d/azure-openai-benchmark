article: If Liverpool were to continue in their current vein of form for the remainder of the season, they might only just avoid relegation. Brendan Rodgers' side have averaged just 1.16 points per game in the 2014-15 Premier League, which puts them on course to earn 44 points. That kind of tally would have put them just 11 points outside the drop zone last season, and eight outside it the year before. Steven Gerrard and Liverpool have averaged just 1.16 points per game in the current Premier League season . Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool side have lost their last four games in all competitions . However, given that 40 points is seen as the 'magic' marker for team down the bottom, it could be more uncomfortable for Rodgers' men if they don't buck up their ideas.Â . If Liverpool are hoping to make the top four again this campaign, they need to win roughly 2.5 points per game for the rest of the season - a feat they didn't even manage last year when they had the free-scoring Luis Suarez. Similarly, Arsenal could be set for their first mid-table finish since 1995 if performances don't improve. The Gunners' current points per game rate is 1.41, which would give them a total of 53.5. That figure would have earned them ninth place last season. If Arsenal's form were to continue as it was they would finish ninth based on last season's points totals . Arsenal have had some reasonable patches this season but have failed to turn that into points . Arsene Wenger's side might need to win roughly 2.3 points per game if they want their customary Champions League spot. One team that can afford to be pleased with their performances, though, is Chelsea. Jose Mourinho's side are currently picking up a staggering 2.6 points per game.Â . If they carry on at that rate they will end the season on 98.8 points, which would break the current Premier League record. Even if Manchester City were to win as many points as they did last year (86), at this rate Chelsea would still be champions by Easter. Jose Mourinho will be delighted with how his Chelsea side have performed so far this season . If Chelsea's form continues they will likely have the Premier League won by Easter .

chatgpt: The English Premier League season is heating up, with thrilling matches and unexpected results. However, the latest news from the top teams has sent shockwaves through the football world. According to experts, Liverpool's recent decline in form could see them face a relegation fight, while Arsenal's uninspiring performances are likely to condemn them to a mid-table finish. Meanwhile, Chelsea is on track to become Premier League champions by mid-April. Liverpool, who won the Premier League title last season after a 30-year wait, have struggled to replicate their success this term. The Reds have already lost six games in the league and currently sit in sixth place. However, their recent form has been particularly worrying. They have lost four out of their last five matches and have failed to score in their last three outings. If Liverpool's form continues to decline, they could be in danger of slipping out of the top half of the table, and even find themselves in a relegation battle. Another team that is struggling this season is Arsenal. The Gunners have been inconsistent throughout the campaign, and their performances have left a lot to be desired. They currently sit in tenth place, with just five wins from their 14 league games. Experts predict that Arsenal will finish mid-table if they don't improve their form soon. In contrast, Chelsea is enjoying a fantastic season under manager Frank Lampard. The Blues have won eight out of their last nine league games, and as a result, they sit in third place, just two points behind leaders Tottenham Hotspur. However, Chelsea's title credentials will be tested in the coming weeks. They face tough fixtures against Everton, Wolves, and Arsenal before the end of the year. But if they can navigate these games successfully, Chelsea could become champions by mid-April. The Premier League is known for its unpredictability, and it's still early days in the season. However, the recent form of Liverpool, Arsenal, and Chelsea has given fans plenty to talk about. Liverpool's decline is particularly concerning, and the team will need to find a way to turn things around quickly. Arsenal, on the other hand, need to start winning games consistently if they are to challenge for a European spot. Chelsea, meanwhile, will be hoping to maintain their impressive run of form and claim the Premier League trophy for the first time since 2017.
