chatgpt: Blackpool FC, also known as the Seasiders, have announced that they have appointed a new manager following their time without a permanent leader since January. They have welcomed José Riga, who previously left Charlton Athletic after just two months at the end of last season. Riga, who is originally from Belgium, has agreed to a one-year rolling contract with the club. This marks his return to the job since managing Charlton in the 2014-2015 season. He also has prior experience managing Standard Liege and the Belgian U21 national team. "I am happy to be here and start a new adventure," said Riga in a statement. "Blackpool is a big club with great potential, and I am looking forward to working with everyone to create a successful team and get results on the pitch." Blackpool's search for a new manager has been long and extensive since Simon Grayson departed from the club. The team has been managed by Terry McPhillips during the interim period. However, the club was in need of a more permanent solution to stabilize the team. Riga's appointment comes at a critical time for the Seasiders as they prepare to compete in the upcoming EFL League One season. The club has struggled in recent years, finishing in 10th place last season. Fans hope that Riga's leadership and experience will bring a much-needed change of fortunes and lead the Seasiders to success. "We are extremely excited to welcome José to our football club," said Simon Sadler, Blackpool's owner. "He has a proven track record of success throughout his career and his experience will be important for us as we look to progress and compete in EFL League One. We believe he is the right man to lead us forward." In conclusion, the Seasiders' appointment of José Riga as their new manager comes as a welcome relief for fans after a prolonged search for a permanent solution. His experience and leadership skills will be critical for Blackpool as they look to progress in the upcoming season and revive their fortunes in the EFL League One.
