article: The hospital trust accused of a cover-up over cancer treatment has the worst waiting times figures in the country, it has emerged. Police are probing Colchester Hospital University over claims staff concealed how long it took to treat sufferers. Since details of the scandal emerged last month, it has gone from being officially one of the best for cancer waiting times to the worst, and could be fined tens of thousands of pounds. Only 93 per cent of patients were treated within 31 days of being seen by a doctor at the trust's hospital in Colchester . National targets say at least 95 per cent of cancer patients should be treated within 31 days of a doctor deciding the most suitable option. But at Colchester just 93 per cent of patients were treated in this time frame meaning 22 were made to wait longer in the last three months alone. And before the probe was launched the trust claimed 98 per cent had treatment within this time putting it amongst the top 30 in the country. The trust is now expected to be fined by the NHS regional body - North Essex Clinical Commissioning Group - which could be in the region of tens of thousands of pounds. Meanwhile the trust’s £165,000-a-year chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts has again refused to resign insisting he was spearheading a culture of openness. Dr Gordon Coutts, Chief Executive of the hospital, has again refused to resign . Speaking yesterday, he added: ‘I do my very best to live up to those values - to be open, to be available and to be visible around the trust. ‘We have to create a culture where people can speak up. It takes a lot of courage. ‘We need to be better at listening to concerns and encouraging people to raise them.’ If Essex Police find enough evidence of criminal wrongdoing, staff could face jail. The probe was launched after whistleblowers told the Care Quality Commission they were being bullied by senior managers to change waiting times figures. Some patients were being made to wait four months for life-saving treatment and the hospital faced being heavily fined for missing these targets. And former staff at the trust have told how Dr Coutts made their life hell and presided over a culture obsessed with meeting targets. His personal assistant Mandy Tapfield is said to have recently quit after 28 years at the hospital, claiming her ‘life was made hell’. The 56-year-old, who was his executive PA until last month, claims she left because she could no longer tolerate Dr Coutts’s demands.

chatgpt: Essex police have launched an investigation into Colchester Hospital University over its failure to treat patients within a reasonable time frame. According to reports, only 93% of patients are seeing a doctor within a month of their initial visit. This delay in treatment has been blamed on senior managers who allegedly bullied staff members into changing their waiting figures. The hospital trust's CEO, Chris Houtts, has come under increased pressure to step down from his role following these revelations. However, Houtts has remained steadfast in his refusal to do so, denying all allegations of wrongdoing. The problems at Colchester Hospital University are just the latest in a series of issues affecting NHS trusts across the country. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of underfunding, understaffing, and inadequate resources, which have all contributed to a decline in the quality of patient care. In response to the investigation, a spokesperson for Colchester Hospital University said: "We take these allegations very seriously and are fully cooperating with the police investigation. The trust is committed to providing the highest standard of care possible to our patients." The investigation comes at a time when NHS trusts across the UK are under increasing scrutiny. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of poor patient outcomes, inadequate resources, and a lack of transparency in decision making. All of these issues have taken their toll on the morale of NHS staff, who are often overworked and underpaid. Despite these challenges, however, there are still many doctors, nurses, and support staff who remain dedicated to their patients and committed to providing the best possible care. These individuals work tirelessly day in and day out, often in difficult and challenging circumstances, to ensure that those in need receive the help and support they require. As the investigation into Colchester Hospital University continues, it is important that the trust takes this opportunity to reassess its practices and policies to ensure that they are in line with best practices and that patients receive the highest standards of care possible. With the backing of the NHS and the support of the local community, there is hope that the trust can emerge from this investigation stronger, more transparent, and better equipped to meet the needs of its patients in the future.
