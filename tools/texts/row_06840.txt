article: (CNN) -- Three Delaware day care workers were arrested after police got hold of a "disturbing" and "shocking" cell phone video that, authorities say, shows two toddlers taking part in a fight the workers had organized. Police said Tuesday that they arrested Tiana Harris, 19; Estefania Myers, 21; and Lisa Parker, 47, who have been charged with assault, reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and conspiracy. On Saturday, authorities responded to an unrelated incident and a person whom police would not identify showed them video of the 3-year-old boys fighting in March. The toddlers were not seriously injured, but they were "clearly hurting each other," said Dover Police Capt. Tim Stump. Authorities have not released the video but say one day care worker said "No pinching, only punching" after one of the boys complained that the other had pinched him. The video purportedly shows seven other children seated in the room with their backs to the fighting, according to police. "It's not like they didn't know what was going on, and they were just encouraging them to continue," Stump said. "One of the children attempted to run, but one of the teachers pushes him back into the fray. "We are looking into the possibility that this was not the first time it happened, but it appears to be isolated, and it seems the administration was in the dark about this," he added. Police made the arrests Monday and addressed the incident that evening with parents and guardians of the children who attended the day care center. A spokesman for the state Division of Family Services said the agency dispatched an institutional abuse investigator to work with Dover police during their investigation. "Depending on our findings, these women could be prohibited from working in the public sector, especially with children or senior citizens," agency spokesman Joseph Smack said, adding that all three women had passed background checks before their employment at the center. "It's rare to see a case like this where the staff encouraged this type of behavior," Smack said. Calls to the day care center were not returned, though police say the company's business license has been suspended. The three suspects and their attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment. Police said the women have posted $10,000 bail and are awaiting trial. More from CNN Justice .

Tiana Harris, a 19-year-old employee at the center along with Estefania Myers, 21, and Lisa Parker, 47, have all been charged with assault, reckless endangering, and child endangerment. Details are still emerging, but reports suggest that the incident in question took place at the hands of Harris, who allegedly physically abused a two-year-old child in her care. However, both Myers and Parker are being held responsible for their failure to intervene and prevent the abuse from occurring. Authorities were alerted of the situation by fellow employees at the day care center, who reportedly witnessed the disturbing scene unfolding. The child in question has since been removed from the center and is said to be safe and well. The news of the incident has understandably sent shockwaves through the local community, with parents of children attending the center expressing their disbelief and horror at the alleged abuse. Local law enforcement officials have urged anyone with information about the incident to come forward and assist with the ongoing investigations. The center in question has yet to release a statement addressing the matter, with attempts to reach out for comment going unanswered. It remains unclear whether or not the center will face any repercussions for the alleged negligence on behalf of the employees. Reactions to the news of the arrests have been mixed, with some expressing sympathy for the accused and questioning the circumstances surrounding the incident. Others have condemned the actions of those involved and have called for stricter regulations around the process of hiring and training employees within child care centers. The three individuals are currently being held in custody, pending further investigation and trial. If the charges against them are proven to be true, they could potentially face lengthy prison sentences. As the investigations into this shocking incident continue, authorities have urged all parents with children in day care centers to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious behavior or misconduct immediately. The well-being and safety of our children should always be a top priority, and incidents such as this serve as a sobering reminder of the need for constant vigilance and accountability.
