chatgpt: Manchester United is reportedly planning a series of high-profile, big-money friendlies around the world in the likely event of missing out on European qualification. The club stands to lose a whopping £20m if they fail to make it to the Champions League next season, a major hit that the team's top brass is preemptively trying to counteract with an aggressive global outreach. The plan, according to sources close to the club, is to organize exhibition matches in various parts of the world, aimed at boosting the club's global brand and attracting new fans. The United hierarchy believes that there is significant untapped potential in several key markets, including the Middle East, America, and India. Manchester United has long been one of the world's most popular and successful football clubs, with a global fan base that extends far beyond its home country of England. However, despite the team's longstanding popularity, there is still more work to be done in terms of reaching new fans and building the club's brand in developing markets. One potential avenue for growth that the club is reportedly exploring is the Middle East, where high-profile soccer exhibitions featuring top European teams have proven highly successful in the past. Manchester United was paid a reported £2m for playing a friendly in Saudi Arabia back in January 2008, an early indication of the financial potential of regionally-targeted exhibition matches. Another market that the club is keen to explore is America, where soccer's popularity has been steadily growing in recent years. Manchester United has made several trips to the United States in the past, playing in major cities like New York and Chicago in exhibition matches that drew large crowds and generated significant buzz. India, with its massive population and burgeoning middle class, is also seen as a potential growth market for Manchester United. While football has yet to achieve the same level of popularity in India as it has in other parts of the world, the country's growing youth soccer scene and increasing fan interest make it a potentially lucrative terrain for the club to explore. Of course, while the potential financial benefits of these exhibition matches are significant, there are certainly risks involved as well. Organizing such extensive tours involves significant travel and logistical challenges, and there is always the possibility that the team could suffer injuries or other setbacks during the matches themselves. Nevertheless, for Manchester United, the benefits of a successful global outreach program far outweigh the potential risks. With £20m at stake in terms of lost Champions League revenue, the club's top executives are doubling down on their efforts to reach new fans and build their brand around the world. Expect to see Manchester United playing exhibition matches in some surprising new markets in the years to come - win or lose in Europe.
