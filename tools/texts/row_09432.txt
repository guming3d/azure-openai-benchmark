article: (CNN) -- Discovery Channel has canceled its planned live coverage of the May 11 jump off Mount Everest by a California daredevil in his wingsuit, the U.S. cable network announced. It was unclear Monday night whether climber and parachutist Joby Ogwyn still planned to leap off the top of the world's highest peak after his guides died in last week's avalanche that killed 13 people. At first, the stuntman told his fans on Facebook that he was sticking with his plans even though his Sherpas were killed. Ogwyn wrote Sunday that he and his team "are staying on the mountain to honor our friends and complete our project." But the post appeared to have been deleted Monday. Friday's avalanche was the single deadliest incident on Everest. Three other people were missing and at least half a dozen were hurt in the slide, which occurred just above a base camp more than 20,000 feet above sea level. All 50-plus climbers engulfed in the slide were Nepalese locals and Sherpas who were taking food and supplies to base camps on the the 29,000-foot peak, authorities reported. Ogwyn reported afterward that he was safe and mourned his lost team. "These men were the salt of the Earth. Far better men than me. My heart is broken," he wrote. On Sunday afternoon, the Discovery Channel announced it was pulling the plug on its planned live coverage of Ogwyn's jump "in light of the overwhelming tragedy" and out of respect for the families of the dead. "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the whole Sherpa community," the network said in a written statement. Ogwyn's father told CNN that his son was aware of Discovery's decision. Ogwyn, who has scaled Everest years ago, planned to hurl himself off the mountain in a wingsuit -- a flying squirrel-like outfit that allows skilled jumpers to glide long distances before deploying a parachute for a safe landing. He used one to fly past the mountain on a 2010 test flight. "I'm hoping to be up there for a while and enjoy the flight," he told CNN in March. "This will be a chance of a lifetime for me. I won't probably have it again." Nepal's Sherpas have been guiding climbers up Everest for six decades. The avalanche occurred at the busiest time of year, when would-be climbers arrive to acclimate themselves to thin air of the Himalayas. Before Friday, the worst accident on Everest was in 1996, when eight climbers disappeared in a storm. It was documented in the book and film "Into Thin Air." Though hundreds of climbers now reach the summit each year, about 1% of those who attempt it die -- "and as a workplace safety statistic, that's pretty much off the charts," Outside magazine Senior Editor Grayson Schaffer told CNN.

chatgpt: Discovery Channel has announced the cancellation of the highly anticipated live event, the Mount Everest jump, in order to honor the memories of the Sherpas that lost their lives on the mountain last week. The decision was made to respect the families of the Sherpas and to pay respect to the tragic incident. The lead athlete, Joby Ogwyn, had previously indicated on his Facebook page that he wanted to move forward with the jump, despite the recent tragedy. However, that post has since been removed, and the current decision indicates that everyone involved in the event believes that it is important to remember and pay homage to the lives lost. The Sherpas were responsible for assisting the team in setting up their equipment and carrying their supplies throughout the perilous journey. They were revered and admired by both the climbers and the local community. Ogwyn himself mourned the loss, and said that the Sherpas were "far better men than me". The jump was set to take place on May 11th, and would have been one of the most daring feats in human history. Ogwyn had planned to leap from the highest point on the mountain and land on a specialized landing zone. The event was being televised by Discovery Channel, and was poised to be one of the highest-rated live events in history. However, the decision to cancel the event was made out of respect for the fallen Sherpas and their families. The network stated that they felt it was important to honor and pay tribute to the brave men that lost their lives in the incident. The move was met with positive response from many people around the world, as they felt it was a respectful and appropriate decision. The Mount Everest jump was just one of many daring stunts that Ogwyn had performed during his career. He has previously set world records for many death-defying feats, and had hoped to add another feather in his cap with this latest stunt. However, the current situation has prompted him to put his ambition aside and recognize the importance of the situation at hand. The cancellation of the event has drawn attention to the safety of athletes and Sherpas alike on Mount Everest. The recent tragedy highlighted the dangers that climbers face on the mountain, and the importance of safety measures in such expeditions. While the cancellation of the live event was a disappointment for many, it helped bring attention to the safety concerns of those who make the climb and the need to prioritize safety. In light of the cancellations, Discovery Channel has reiterated their commitment to safety when filming events on Mount Everest. They stated that they will continue to evaluate their safety protocols and work to mitigate risks when filming future events. The decision to cancel the Mount Everest jump was a difficult one for everyone involved, however, it was ultimately the right decision to honor the lives of the Sherpas that were tragically lost. The network's decision to prioritize safety is a reminder that all expeditions require proper planning and safety measures to ensure the safety of all parties involved.
