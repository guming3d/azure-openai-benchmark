article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . British tourists are facing sky-high car hire costs in some of the most popular summer holiday destinations. Costs in Majorca, for example, are almost twice as high as those in Cyprus, which has the lowest charges among 16 resorts surveyed by Post Office Travel Money. Other popular spots where charges were particularly high include Faro in Portugal, Split in Croatia and Dublin. Costs in Majorca (pictured), for example, are almost twice as high as those in Cyprus, which has the lowest charges among 16 resorts surveyed by Post Office Travel Money . The survey took into account not just the basic care hire cost, but also such expense as satnav hire, additional-driver cover and 40 litres of petrol. On this basis, one-week car hire in Larnaca in Cyprus was just £295, while in the most expensive - the Norwegian capital Oslo - it was as much as £614. Majorca was the next most pricey - at £514 - while Split was £509, Faro £503 and Dublin £482. After Larnaca, the best value destination was Luqa in Malta (£317), followed by Marmaris in Turkey (£325), Copenhagen (£335) and Salzburg in Austria (£362). The survey took into account not just the basic care hire cost, but also such expense as satnav hire, additional-driver cover and 40 litres of petrol . Post Office Travel Money said its survey of 2,106 UK adults showed that in hiring a car, 56 per cent failed to take out excess waiver insurance that reduces the excess payable for accidents or theft to zero. Even more (76 per cent) did not take out insurance cover for tyre, undercarriage and window damage. Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'These figures make it clear that it is a false economy to cut costs by sticking to the basic cost when booking car rental online. 'We advise against taking a risk that could cost hundreds of pounds if your hire car suffers damage or is stolen.'

chatgpt: Tourists looking for a budget-friendly European holiday should consider Cyprus over Majorca. According to a recent study, the cost of living in Majorca is almost twice as high as in Cyprus. The study, conducted by price comparison website Numbeo, examined the cost of living in major tourist destinations across Europe. Numbeo collected data on a range of factors, including housing, food, transportation, and entertainment to determine the cost of living index for each destination. The results showed that Majorca scored significantly higher than Cyprus on the index, indicating that it is a more expensive holiday destination. One of the biggest factors driving up the cost of living in Majorca is the high cost of accommodation. The island is known for its beautiful beaches and stunning natural scenery, which attracts millions of tourists every year. However, this popularity has led to a surge in property prices, making it difficult for budget-conscious travellers to find affordable accommodation. In contrast, Cyprus has a range of affordable accommodation options, from self-catering apartments to luxury hotels. Food and drink is another area where Cyprus is a more affordable option. The cost of eating out in Majorca can be quite high, particularly in the more touristy areas. Cyprus, on the other hand, has a thriving restaurant scene that caters to all budgets. From local tavernas serving up traditional Cypriot dishes to international fast-food chains, there are plenty of options for travellers looking for affordable dining options. Transportation is another area where Cyprus has the edge over Majorca. While both destinations have reliable public transport networks, Cyprus has the added advantage of being a smaller island, making it easier to get around. Taxis and car rentals are also more affordable in Cyprus, making it easier for visitors to explore the island at their own pace. While Majorca may be a more expensive destination, it still offers plenty of attractions and activities for those willing to spend a little extra. From picturesque villages and ancient ruins to buzzing nightlife and beautiful beaches, there's something for everyone on this Balearic island. Overall, travellers looking to stretch their holiday budget a little further should consider Cyprus over Majorca. With a lower cost of living index and plenty of affordable accommodation, dining, and transportation options, Cyprus offers the perfect holiday destination for budget-conscious travellers.
