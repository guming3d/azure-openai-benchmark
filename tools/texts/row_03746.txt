A controversial marketing stunt in which homeless people were paid to act as walking wifi hotspots at a festival appears to have paid off - after they used the money to find housing. Branding agency BBH-Labs gave a mobile a 4G MiFi device to each participant and paid them $50 a day to walk around the SXSW music and technology festival in Austin, Texas, with t-shirts saying 'I'm a 4G hotspot'. It was suggested users paid $2 for every 15 minutes and the homeless could keep all the donations. The controversial stunt was piloted at SXSW with homeless people paid to walk around wearing t-shirts like this . Clarence was one of the homeless people paid $20 a day plus any donations he was given to offer people a wifi service . The daring ploy, named Homeless Hotspots, was condemned by some as 'dystopian', 'shameful' and 'patronizing' last year - but yesterday it was claimed all the homeless people have since used the money they earned to find a house. The participants had MiFi devices similar to this strapped to them which would provide wifi internet access to people on the move at the SXSW festival . According to Front Steps, the Austin homeless shelter that helped BBH Labs run the project, 11 of the 13 participants in the event used the money, sometimes more than $600, to put security deposits down on apartments in Austin. All of them now have housing, Jennifer Denton of Front Steps said. She told ABC News that although there had been controversy during the 2012 festival, the outcome was worth it. 'There was a lot of discussion at the outset, when the program began, about whether it was taking advantage of the individuals. But the individuals participating were really grateful for the opportunity to be productive and earn a wage, and it had this sustainable result,' Denton said. The homeless people stood beside conference goers to provide internet via the MiFi devices which connect to the internet via the 4G phone network and offer web access via a wifi network. The idea was spotted by a New York Times reporter, and swiftly caused outcry. Technology magazine Wired described the stunt as 'dystopian'. Tim Carmody wrote that homeless were turned into 'not just walking, talking hotspots, but walking, talking billboards for a program that doesn't care anything at all about them or their future.' British brand strategist Luke Scheybeler lambasted the idea as 'shameful, hideous, patronising and dehumanising'. Dusty White told ABC News at the time: 'I've swallowed my pride, at first I was a bit embarrassed about it. But being homeless has given me a different outlook about people.'

chatgpt: Last year, a controversial project known as 'Homeless Hotspots' was piloted at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas. Participants in the project carried a 4G device and wore a t-shirt with the words 'I'm a 4G hotspot' printed on it. The project was described by New York agency BBH-Labs as a 'charitable experiment', but it was also lambasted by some as 'dystopian', 'shameful' and 'patronizing' at the time. The project received a mixed reaction from the public, with many people questioning whether it was ethical to use homeless people as Wi-Fi hotspots. However, the project did have some positive outcomes. According to a local charity, all 13 of the homeless people who participated in the project have since found housing. The 'Homeless Hotspots' project was designed to raise awareness about the issue of homelessness and to provide a unique way for people to connect to the internet at SXSW. The project was staffed by homeless people, who were paid a small fee for their participation. All of the money that was earned from the project was donated to a local charity that works with the homeless community. Many people were critical of the project, with some suggesting that it was inhumane to use homeless people as Wi-Fi hotspots. Others argued that the project was patronizing and exploitative, and that it did nothing to address the root causes of homelessness. Despite the controversy surrounding the project, there were also many supporters who felt that it was a creative way to raise awareness about an important social issue. In the end, the 'Homeless Hotspots' project did have a positive impact on the lives of the homeless people who participated in it. By providing them with a paid opportunity to work, the project helped to improve their financial situation and gave them a sense of purpose. Additionally, the fact that all of the participants were able to find housing highlights the importance of taking a holistic approach to addressing homelessness. Overall, the 'Homeless Hotspots' project was a controversial but thought-provoking initiative that shed light on the challenges facing homeless communities. While some criticized the project for being exploitative and patronizing, it had a positive outcome for those who participated, and it helped to raise awareness about an important social issue.
