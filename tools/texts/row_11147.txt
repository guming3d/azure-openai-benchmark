chatgpt: Four people were injured and the director of a movie about Gregg Allman fell onto the tracks when a freight train unexpectedly passed by the movie set. The incident occurred on Thursday in Wayne County, Georgia where the film "Midnight Rider" was being shot.  According to sources, the crew was filming a scene on a trestle bridge for the movie about the life of the Allman Brothers Band founding member Gregg Allman, when a freight train appeared. Reports suggest that the crew was not expecting the train to pass by as they had only been given permission to film on the tracks for a limited period of time.  As the train approached, the movie props began to fly into the air, injuring four people. The director of the movie, Randall Miller, tried to clear the set from the rails but fell onto the tracks in the process. Miller was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was treated for his injuries.  The other injured crew members were also taken to a hospital in the area for medical care. The injuries suffered by the crew were not believed to be life threatening, but it is unclear at this time what the extent of their injuries were.  Production for "Midnight Rider" has been halted as the investigation into the accident is ongoing. In a statement provided after the incident, the production company said "We are deeply saddened by the loss of our crew members and the injuries sustained by our cast and crew today. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families at this time."  On Friday, a spokeswoman for the production company announced that the film's release date had been postponed, citing the need for additional time to gather all the necessary information and ensure the safety of the cast and crew before proceeding with the production.  This is not the first time a movie production has been involved in an accident. In 1982, Vic Morrow and two child actors were killed on the set of "Twilight Zone: The Movie" when a helicopter crashed during filming. In 1993, Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, was killed on the set of "The Crow" when he was accidentally shot by a prop gun.  The incident at the "Midnight Rider" set is a reminder of the danger associated with movie productions and the importance of safety protocols in the industry. As the investigation into this accident continues, it is hoped that the appropriate measures will be taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
