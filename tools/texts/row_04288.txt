chatgpt: An emergency court motion was filed by the Lorain County Bar Association detailing allegations against Michael Fine, a 57-year-old attorney. The motion revealed claims made by two women, identified as Jane Doe and Jane Doe 2, who accuse Fine of using hypnosis to manipulate them into touching him or having orgasms. These allegations have left Fine's former clients feeling "sickened" by the thought that their attorney would use their vulnerable situations, such as going through a divorce or child custody battle, as an opportunity to prey on them. One of the Jane Does described a scenario where Fine allegedly hypnotized her during a meeting in his office, telling her that he wanted to "improve their attorney-client relationship." The woman claimed that the hypnosis made her feel "like a puppet on a string," and that Fine instructed her to touch him before having an orgasm in his presence. The other Jane Doe alleged that Fine hypnotized her during a meeting at her home. She claimed that he directed her to touch him and fondled her while she was in a trance-like state. The woman also stated that Fine made a comment about how he could help her case if she was "nice to him." In response to these allegations, the Lorain County Bar Association has suspended Fine's law license, and Ohio's Supreme Court is currently investigating the matter. Fine has denied the accusations, but the court motion stated that both Jane Does' accounts were "remarkably similar." This isn't the first time Fine has faced disciplinary action. In 2002, he was suspended for two years after being found guilty of commingling client funds in his law practice. He was also reprimanded in 2006 for practicing law without a license. The news of Fine's alleged misconduct has sparked outrage among the legal community, with many calling for stricter regulations to prevent attorneys from using their positions of power to manipulate and prey on vulnerable clients. This case serves as a reminder that it is crucial for clients to be aware of their legal rights and to research the attorneys they choose to represent them thoroughly. It is also a reminder that the legal profession must hold attorneys accountable for their actions and ensure that they use their power and influence ethically. As for Fine, he will face an uncertain future as he awaits the outcome of the Supreme Court investigation. For his alleged victims, the road to healing and justice may be a long and difficult one, but their bravery in coming forward may help prevent others from falling victim to similar abuses of power.
