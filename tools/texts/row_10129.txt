Mighty Wings will be returning to a McDonald's near you - though not necessarily due to popular demand. McDonald's began stockpiling chicken wings earlier this year for its Mighty Wings promotion which debuted on September 9. But the spicy wings didn't fly out of stores, and now the company has 10 million pounds of Mighty Wings in cold storage. In a flap: McDonald's franchisees must participate in another Mighty Wings promotion after the first failed to offload the stockpile of chicken wings . McDonald's media relations executive Lisa McComb said in a statement: 'We're bringing back Mighty Wings - stay tuned.' Before the wings were launched in September, the company released a statement explaining: 'With the introduction of Mighty Wings, McDonaldâ€™s is bringing the popularity and fun of chicken wings to customers seeking any time and any reason to enjoy them.' Customers, however, did not take to the Mighty Wings, and the company still has 20 per cent of its original supply of chicken wings left. According to the Wall Street Journal, McDonald's franchisees have been told they must participate in another Mighty Wings promotion or pay for the excess inventory. Fowl play: Many customers felt the wings were priced too highly at $1 per wing . McDonald's CEO Don Thompson has acknowledged that one reason the wings didn't sell well was that the price was 'not the most competitive.' The wings were priced at $2.99 for three - well above competitor KFC's pricing of five wings for $3.99. Many customers baulked at paying a dollar per wing at the fast food chain, where they can purchase a whole burger for the same price. The Wall Street Journal reports that franchisees commented on the problem in a survey in October while the promotion was running. Winging it: The company will roll out the promotion around the country soon . 'Mighty Wings are proving once again that we canâ€™t sell premium items in large numbers because we still have the Dollar Menu,' one franchisee said in the anonymous survey. The higher prices came after McDonald's began buying up big in the chicken wing market, driving prices up and necessitating a higher price point for the company to make its margin. Critics have also noted that the breaded and fried wings were too spicy to appeal to the McDonald's customer. When Mighty Wings land at McDonald's outlets again soon, they will be priced more competitively.

chatgpt: McDonald’s, the fast food giant, is preparing to relaunch its much-maligned Mighty Wings promotion in a bid to clear its stockpile of over 10 million pounds of chicken wings. The food chain originally ran the promotion from September through to November, but it was less than successful, and it ended in a glut of leftover wings which have since been languishing in cold storage until they can be sold off. The Mighty Wings were criticized for being several things: too expensive, too spicy, and simply not very good. Despite early excitement over the new promotion, which cost just under $1 per wing, it seems that customers just weren’t interested in shelling out that much money for something that they found either too hot or too tough. Now, however, McDonald’s is hoping second time’s a charm, as they prepare to reintroduce the Mighty Wings for another run. With the wings still in cold storage, it may seem like a better bet for the fast food chain than simply throwing them out. Speaking to reporters, a spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “We have a lot of leftover Mighty Wings that we need to sell, so we’re going to be relaunching the promotion in the near future. We’re hoping that customers will give it another chance, and that we can clear our inventory.” The spokesperson refused to be drawn on the original cost of the wings, but it seems likely that they will be discounted in some way this time around in a bid to entice customers. Fast food chains around the world are always looking for the next big thing to draw in customers, but with so many options out there, it can be difficult to get it right. McDonald’s has a history of successful limited-run promotions, including the famous McRib sandwich, but not everything can be a winner. Some customers, however, are excited about the return of the Mighty Wings, despite the initial negative reception. “I’m excited to see the Mighty Wings back on the menu,” said one avid McDonald’s fan. “I didn’t get a chance to try them last time, so I’m looking forward to giving them a go.” Others, however, are less enthused. “I tried them the first time around and wasn’t impressed,” said another customer. “I won’t be rushing out to try them again.” It remains to be seen how successful the relaunch of the Mighty Wings will be, but one thing is for sure: McDonald’s is certainly hoping to avoid another glut of leftover wings this time around.
