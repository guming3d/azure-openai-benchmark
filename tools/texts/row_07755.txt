article: (CNN) -- A friend of accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is expected to plead guilty Thursday to charges in connection with removing a backpack and computer from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the Boston Marathon bombing. Dias Kadyrbayev will be changing his plea in a federal courtroom Thursday, his lawyer, Robert Stahl, told CNN, adding that he'll have more to say after the hearing. The charges stem from actions after bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 200 were injured. Kadyrbayev is charged with four counts including obstructing justice and conspiracy for allegedly throwing Tsarnaev's backpack into a dumpster after discovering it contained fireworks with gunpowder, and removing a jar of Vaseline and a computer thumb drive. The backpack was later recovered at a landfill by investigators. Kadrybayev, a Kazakh national, also allegedly took Tsarnaev's computer to his off-campus apartment, where the FBI later seized it. In July, Kadyrbayev's roommate Azamat Tazhayakov was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction charges in the same case and has filed an appeal. He faces up to 25 years in prison at his sentencing in October. In that case, prosecutors told jurors Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev: "i think they got his brother," hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another. The friends recognized the Tsarnaev brothers after authorities released video and still photos asking for the public's helping finding the two men in the aftermath of the bombings, prosecutors said. Kadyrbayev told his friends that he believed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev "used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect," an indictment against him reads. The government said Tsarnaev texted Kadyrbayev after the bombings and told him he could go to his dorm room and take what he wanted. Kadyrbayev showed that text to Tazhayakov, the government alleged.

chatgpt: On Thursday, Dias Kadyrbayev, a friend of accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is expected to plead guilty to charges of obstructing justice and conspiracy. Kadyrbayev is being charged with the removal of a backpack and computer from Tsarnaev’s dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, where Tsarnaev had been a student. The backpack and computer are believed to have contained evidence of Tsarnaev’s involvement in the Boston Marathon Bombing, which killed three people and injured hundreds in 2013. The items were later found in a landfill. According to court documents, Kadyrbayev and another friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, went to Tsarnaev’s room three days after the bombing and removed the backpack and computer. They allegedly did so at Tsarnaev’s request, after Tsarnaev sent them a text message urging them to “go to my room and take what’s there.” Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were both charged in 2013 with obstructing justice and conspiracy. Tazhayakov was found guilty and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Kadyrbayev’s trial has been delayed several times, and he is now expected to plead guilty. The charges against Kadyrbayev stem from his actions immediately following the bombing, but also from his subsequent lying to investigators about his involvement. According to court documents, Kadyrbayev initially told investigators that he and Tazhayakov went to Tsarnaev’s room merely to remove a marijuana pipe and some other items they thought might get Tsarnaev in trouble. Kadyrbayev was a student at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth at the time of the bombing, and Tsarnaev was one of his close friends. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are both from Kazakhstan and were in the United States on student visas. The Boston Marathon Bombing was one of the most high-profile terrorist attacks in recent years. The two brothers accused of carrying out the attack, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, killed four people and injured more than 200 in the bombing and subsequent manhunt. Tamerlan was killed in a confrontation with police, while Dzhokhar is currently awaiting trial in federal court.
