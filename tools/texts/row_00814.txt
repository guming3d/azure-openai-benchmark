article: (CNN) -- Euro 2012 is almost upon us and Europe's finest footballers will be marked men -- in more ways than one. The tournament will decide which is the continent's top football team, but it will also showcase a tapestry of tattoos -- the body art that has become the chosen mode of self-expression for any self-respecting footballer. Euro 2012: By the numbers . "I don't think footballers are too different from other members of their generation -- except, of course, they have a lot more money," says Ellis Cashmore, professor of Culture, Media and Sport at England's Staffordshire University. "They're also people who have an awful lot of time on their hands. What do they do after training in the morning? Play on their PlayStations, shop for new cars? Or stop by the tattoo parlor and wile away a few hours?" he told CNN. Footballers are on display to the world, with a global audience of millions expected to tune in for the June 8-July 1 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. But rather than a desire to distinguish themselves from the crowd, Cashmore believes getting a tattoo is more footballers wanting to fit in with his peers. "The majority of tattoo-wearers decorate their bodies because is it voguish, almost a membership to the Y-generation," said the academic, who is conducting research into how people view the future of Britain. "It's less a desire to stand out, more an eagerness to blend in. As I said before, it functions as a permanent bodily membership card." Cashmore says there is no one type of person who is more likely to get a tattoo than another, because different people have varying reasons for deciding to get ink done. "There's no single impulse," he said. "I have a friend who approaches tattoos like a collector: one he had carved in LA, one from Tokyo, Stockholm and other points on the world map. "Others commemorate the birth of children, weddings or other notable days. Or their affiliation: my gym is in West Bromwich and West Bromwich Albion tattoos are abundant. "At my gym, there is hardly anyone under the age of 45 -- and a few older -- without some tribal marks on their arms." Cashmore thinks the apparent rise in people getting tattoos is closely linked to the importance that modern society places on the body and personal grooming. "We care and tend for our bodies now in a way that would have been regarded as obsessive as recently as 15 years ago," he said. "Think about the rising number of cosmetic surgery procedures in the UK, the money we spend on grooming products (especially male), the time we spend in the hairdressers, at the gym, tanning salons. "We depilate (the removal of hair), oil, and pierce our bodies -- not for any specific function, but just because we are narcissists."

chatgpt: The eagerly-anticipated European football championship, Euro 2012, is set to kick off on Friday June 9, with Poland taking on Greece in the opening game of the tournament in Warsaw. The event is being jointly hosted by Poland and Ukraine, and is expected to draw massive crowds and worldwide interest from football fans. Aside from the fierce competition on the field, a number of the tournament's star players will be sporting some eye-catching and extravagant tattoos. From Cristiano Ronaldo's back-spanning angelic figure to Sergio Ramos' full-sleeve artwork, these tattoos are an integral part of the players' identity and self-expression. Academic Ellis Cashmore, who has extensively researched football culture, believes that the popularity of tattoos among footballers is driven by a desire to blend in with their colleagues. In a sport where conformity is key, tattoos provide a means for players to differentiate themselves and showcase their personal style and identity. However, the trend has not been without its controversies. Some fans and critics argue that the excessive tattoos are attention-seeking and distract from the players' skills, while others question the appropriateness of visible tattoos in a family-friendly setting. Despite the controversy, there is no denying that tattoos have become an integral part of many players' public personas. Leading the pack is Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, whose large back tattoo is a sprawling angelic figure. The design, which features wings and a sword, has been interpreted by some fans as a symbol of Ronaldo's ambition and desire to succeed on the field. Meanwhile, Spain's Sergio Ramos is famous for his extensive full-sleeve tattoo, which features a combination of religious and tribal symbols. The tattoo is said to reflect his identity as a proud Andalusian, as well as his Catholic faith. Other notable tattoos include England striker Wayne Rooney's 'Just Enough Education to Perform' design, which he had done as a tribute to his favourite album by the Welsh rock group Stereophonics. Rooney's tattoos also include the names of his children and his wife, Coleen. In addition to the stars of the game, many young players are also starting to adopt the trend of sporting elaborate tattoos. For many, tattoos represent a rite of passage, a sign that they have truly arrived on the professional football scene. However, the trend has not been without criticism. Critics have argued that players should focus on their skills on the field, rather than their appearance, while some have even gone as far as to suggest that excessive tattoos could be a hindrance to a player's career. Despite these concerns, it seems that tattoos are here to stay in the world of football. With more and more players adding to their body art, tattoos will continue to be a visible part of the sport's culture, both on and off the field. As the excitement of Euro 2012 builds, fans around the world will be eagerly waiting to see what new designs and tattoos their favourite players will reveal. With so much talent, skill and personality on display, it's already shaping up to be an unforgettable tournament.
