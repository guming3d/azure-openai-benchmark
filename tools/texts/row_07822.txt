Snowy, a Great Dane owned by Brandon and Aimie Terry, gave birth to the puppies just three weeks ago. The couple said they were shocked by the arrival of such a large litter and are now hoping to find homes for the puppies before Christmas. Snowy's litter is an impressive one, with the total number coming in at just one shy of the state record. While the puppies are cute and playful, the Terrys say they are looking for responsible pet owners who can provide the care and attention that the puppies will need.  For the Terrys, the arrival of Snowy's puppies is a joyous occasion, but it has also been a time of hard work and dedication. Brandon and Aimie have been busy caring for the puppies around the clock, ensuring that they are fed, warm, and comfortable.

For the Terrys, finding responsible owners who can accommodate for their size and energy is critical. They want to ensure that each puppy goes to a loving home where they will receive the care and attention that they need. "We want to make sure that these puppies are placed with owners who are committed to their wellbeing," said Brandon. "They are a big breed, but they are also incredibly loving and loyal. We know that they will make amazing pets." With Christmas just around the corner, the Terrys are hoping to find homes for all of the puppies before the holiday arrives. They want each of the puppies to have a loving family to spend their first Christmas with. "We are looking for owners who are committed to these puppies for life," said Aimie. "We want to find them all homes before Christmas so that they can begin their new lives with loving families." For anyone interested in adopting one of Snowy's puppies, the Terrys are asking that they reach out to them directly. They want to ensure that each puppy gets the loving home that they deserve.
