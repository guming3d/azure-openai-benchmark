article: New York (CNN) -- The boyfriend of a 33-year-old swimsuit designer, whose bruised body was found in a bathtub at an exclusive New York hotel on Thursday, has been charged in her death, officials said. Nick Brooks, 24, whose father -- Joseph Brooks -- is the Oscar-winning composer and director who produced the song "You Light Up My Life," was charged with attempted murder and strangulation in the death of Sylvie Cachay, police said Friday. According to CNN affiliate WABC, authorities are treating the death as a homicide. However, Brooks cannot be charged with murder until the medical examiner determines the death was the result of a homicide. Police discovered Cachay, whose designs had been considered a celebrity favorite, at the Soho House club and hotel, according to a New York police spokesman who declined to be named, citing agency policy.

Cachay's body sustained bruising on the neck and bite marks, and was found clothed in the hotel room bathtub, the spokesman said. The city medical examiner said Friday the initial autopsy was inconclusive. The office will provide more details surrounding Cachay's death "pending toxicology and tissue testing, which would take a few weeks," said spokeswoman Grace Burgess. "Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke," said publicist Kate Godici. "She will be deeply and painfully missed, yet celebrated, honored and never forgotten." The elder Brooks was indicted on multiple counts of sexual assault earlier this year, according to New York Supreme court documents. The younger Brooks is currently in police custody, the spokesman said.

chatgpt: Nick Brooks, the son of the late songwriter Joseph Brooks, has been charged with attempted murder and strangulation after an incident at a New York hotel. The victim, 33-year-old swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay, was found dead in a bathtub at the Soho House on Thursday. Police have said that Cachay had bruising on her neck and bite marks. Initial autopsy reports have been inconclusive, according to the city medical examiner's office. However, police have stated that they believe Cachay was strangled with a necktie. Her death has been ruled a homicide. Brooks, 24, was the only other person in the room at the time of Cachay's death. He had been in a relationship with the victim, but it is currently unclear what led to the incident. Brooks was arrested on Thursday and charged with attempted murder and strangulation. The hotel, which is known for its exclusivity, has not released a statement regarding the incident. The Soho House is a members-only club located in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. It boasts a rooftop pool, a screening room, and a restaurant. Joseph Brooks, Nick's father, was a songwriter and director who won an Academy Award for composing the theme song to the 1977 movie "You Light Up My Life." He committed suicide last year while awaiting trial on charges of rape. Details regarding Cachay's death are still emerging, and the investigation is ongoing. Brooks is being held without bail and is expected to appear in court in the coming days.
