YouTube is successfully transforming into a full-blown web TV service - site users are staying 60 per cent longer than they did a year ago. The average time spent watching video on Google video sites is now 418.2 minutes per user, per month, according to Comscore data.

chatgpt: According to new figures from Comscore, website users are now spending an average of 418 minutes per month on the site - a 60% increase compared to figures from the same period last year. The surge in usage comes shortly after the platform's relaunch, which saw the site become more TV-like in its offerings. The move appears to have paid off, with subscriptions to the site's various channels increasing by a substantial 50%. It's clear that the pivot towards a more TV-like model has won over both new and existing users, who are now spending increasingly long periods of time on the site each month. Comscore's data reveals that the number of users accessing the site each month has also risen, with a total of 1.2 million users counted over the course of the reported period. However, it's the increase in usage time that represents the most striking finding from these new figures. The site's management team have spoken out in response to the numbers, describing them as a validation of the changes made during the relaunch phase. These changes were intended to make the platform a more compelling destination for users who are looking for high-quality video content. Key changes during the relaunch included the introduction of a number of new channels, which are now proving particularly popular among users. The site's subscription model has also been updated, offering affordable pricing and more attractive options for users. The site's success in increasing its user base and usage figures will undoubtedly be welcome news for its management team, who plan to continue investing in the platform in the coming months. With the site now occupying a key position in the crowded online media landscape, there is a clear opportunity for it to become an even more significant player in the industry. Of course, the site's success will depend on its continued ability to provide high-quality, engaging video content to its users. The management team has been keen to emphasize that this remains their top priority, and that they are investing heavily in hiring top-tier talent across all areas of the business. As the site continues to evolve and expand, it seems inevitable that its influence will grow. With millions of users now accessing the platform each month, and with usage figures continuing to rise, the site is on track to become one of the dominant forces in the online video space.
