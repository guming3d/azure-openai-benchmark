Al-Wefaq, Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party, said the teen was killed when he was hit by bird pellets shot by Bahraini security forces. Police officer Mohammed Asif died late Thursday after he was hit by a "projectile" thrown by a group of protesters, according to Bahrain's interior ministry. Major-General Tariq Hassan, chief of public security, said an investigation has been launched to find those responsible.

Two years ago, on February 14, protests began with many demanding political reforms and greater freedoms in the Sunni-ruled, Shiite majority nation.

But demonstrations in Bahrain failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state. The crackdown was backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In November of that year, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report critical of authorities' reactions to the protests. The independent commission, set up by the king, concluded that the police had used excessive force and torture in their response to the protests in Sunni-ruled, Shiite-majority country. Abuse of detainees in the crackdown included beatings with metal pipes and batons, and threats of rape and electrocution, according to Mahmoud Cherif Bassiouni, the commission chairman. The report recommended reforms to the country's law and better training of its security forces, as well as other measures. CNN's Saad Abedine and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Bahrain authorities are currently investigating the death of a teenager, whose cause of death is still unknown. According to reports, the opposition group claims that the Bahraini security forces were responsible for the teen's death. The boy's body was found on Wednesday, just a day before the second anniversary of major unrest in Bahrain. These events, which began in 2011, were sparked by demands for political reforms and greater freedom in the country. The opposition group, which is believed to be closely linked to the protesters of 2011, condemned the death and called for an end to the excessive use of force by the authorities. They claimed that the teenager was killed by the Bahraini security forces, who are notorious for their violent tactics against political dissidents. The Bahraini government has not commented on the teenager's death directly, but an official statement was released by the Ministry of Interior, which said that they were investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident. The statement reaffirmed the government's commitment to protecting the safety of all citizens and residents in the country. The incident has raised concerns among human rights groups, who have called for an independent investigation into the teenager's death. Amnesty International issued a statement, saying that the incident was "troubling" and that the authorities must ensure that the investigation is thorough and impartial. This latest incident comes just a day before the second anniversary of major unrest in Bahrain. The 2011 protests marked a significant turning point in the country's history, with demands for political reforms and greater freedom from a segment of Bahrain's population. The government's response to the protests was heavily criticized by human rights groups, who accused the government of using excessive force to suppress dissent. Since then, the situation in Bahrain has remained tense, with sporadic outbreaks of violence and clashes between protesters and security forces. As the investigation into the teenager's death continues, there are fears that the incident could further escalate tensions in the country. The situation remains in flux, as protesters gear up to mark the second anniversary of the 2011 unrest.
