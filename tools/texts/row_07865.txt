article: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An anti-drone activist and journalist from Pakistan is missing after being abducted from his home, his lawyer said Monday. Kareem Khan was seized from his home in Rawalpindi on the night of February 5th, according to attorney Shazad Akbar. He was picked up by 20 men, some of them dressed in police uniforms, Akbar said. "Kareem Khan was my first client in 2010 against U.S. drone strikes in the tribal areas of Pakistan," Shahzad told CNN Monday. Shahzad said he lodged a complaint with local police but they denied having picked him up. Khan hails from the tribal area of North Waziristan. He was due to travel to Europe this week to speak to German, Dutch and British parliamentarians about his personal experience with drone strikes, according to Reprieve, a UK-based charity that provides legal support to prisoners unable to pay for it themselves. Khan was also involved in legal proceedings against the Pakistani government concerning its failure to investigate the deaths of his son and brother in a drone strike, the charity said on its website. "We are very worried about Mr Khan's safety," writes Clare Algar, executive director of Reprieve. "He is a crucial witness to the dangers of the CIA's covert drone programme, and has simply sought justice for the death of his son and brother through peaceful, legal routes." Khan spoke to CNN in December 2010 about the airstrike a year earlier that had targeted his home in Machikhel, a village in North Waziristan. Khan said the missiles killed his 35-year-old brother, a teacher with a master's degree in English literature; his 18 year-old son, and several others. He filed a $500 million lawsuit against the U.S. government. Khan was one of the first people to raise awareness about drone strikes, said Noor Behram, a journalist based in North Waziristan. He said it was a great setback that he had disappeared just before he could raise the issue on an international forum during his Europe trip. Behram said a protest against what describes as Khan's arrest would be held Tuesday at the press club in the town of Miranshah. Muhammad Saleem reported the story from Islamabad, Chandrika Narayan reported and wrote the story from Atlanta .

chatgpt: In a shocking development, Kareem Khan, a noted Pakistani anti-drone campaigner, was reportedly taken into custody from his home by unidentified individuals, according to his lawyer. The circumstances surrounding the seizure of Khan remain unclear at this stage. Kahn, who has been a critic of the United States' use of drone strikes in Pakistan, has been actively campaigning against these attacks. His brother and son were reportedly killed in a drone strike in 2009, which has been a driving force behind his efforts to end their use. Khan was due to travel to Europe this week to speak with parliamentarians about these drone strikes and the impact they have had on the people and communities of Pakistan. It is unclear if his arrest is related to his planned trip. The international community has been quick to condemn the arrest of Khan. Human rights organizations have described it as an attack on free speech and the right to dissent. They have called on the Pakistani authorities to release Khan immediately and without charge. The use of drone strikes in Pakistan has been a controversial issue for a number of years. While the United States has argued that these strikes are aimed at targeting militants and terrorists, there have been several instances where civilians have been killed or injured. The use of drone strikes has also been criticized as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. Khan's arrest is likely to reignite the debate about the use of drone strikes in Pakistan and the impact they have had on the lives of ordinary people. It is also likely to raise questions about the safety of those who speak out against the use of drones and the possible consequences they may face. Khan's lawyer has indicated that his client is being held incommunicado, which has raised concerns about his safety and well-being. The authorities have not commented on the arrest, indicating that it may be linked to an ongoing investigation. Many of Khan's supporters have taken to social media to demand his release and to express their solidarity with him. The news of his arrest has sparked protests in different parts of the country. As details about Khan's arrest become clearer, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this is a worrying development for those who value free speech and the right to dissent. The international community will be watching closely to see how the Pakistani authorities respond to calls for Khan's release and to ensure that the rights of all individuals are protected.
