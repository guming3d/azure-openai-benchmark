article: Nathan Redmond is ready to lead the England Under-21s push for Euro 2015 after being toughened up by the rough and tumble of life in the Championship. The Norwich City winger will be a key player when Gareth Southgate’s squad go head-to-head over two legs with Croatia for a place in the Czech Republic, starting at Molineux. Redmond, 20, has been thriving at Norwich and insists he has no regrets after seeing moves to Stoke or West Ham fail to materialise in the summer, as he says the experience of life outside the Barclays Premier League has been invaluable to his development. Nathan Redmond said life in the Championship means he has gotten used to being roughed up on the pitch . ‘I’m finding myself with four men on me at times,’ says Redmond. ‘I expect to be targeted during games or getting a kick every now and then. It’s toughened me up a bit. I can accept a bit of a kick or a nudge in the back now. ‘It helps when we go away to places like Moldova (last month) as you know what’s coming from the foreign players, who like to stamp on your toes or elbow in the back.’ Redmond is accustomed to rough treatment from his early days at Birmingham City. ‘I was only 15 and getting rattled about by Roger Johnson and Stephen Carr,’ he recalls. ‘There was Barry Ferguson and Lee Bowyer too. It was a scary group really. I’d be running over to training and think ‘‘Oh no. . .’’ Gareth Southgate's side will face Croatia in a play-off to reach the Under 21 European Championships in 2015 . ‘Stephen Carr would smash me from the first minute and said he wouldn’t stop until I learned to deal with it...I haven’t had it easy but it has really helped.’ Redmond has become a fixture in the side under Southgate and says there is a desire among the group not to let a run of nine wins from 10 games in the group stages go to waste. ‘Playing for your country is a big honour for everyone involved, so it’s spurred us on,’ says Redmond. ‘Now I want to qualify for these finals and come up against some of the best teams and win it.’ Redmond joined Norwich from Birmingham when the Canaries were in the Premier League .

chatgpt: The England Under 21s will take on Croatia in a crucial play-off match for a spot in Euro 2015. The match will be held at Molineux stadium, Wolverhampton, and both sides are expected to bring their best game. One player who has been in excellent form for England's under 21s is Nathan Redmond. The midfielder, who plays for Norwich City in the Championship, believes playing in the lower league has helped to make him tougher. Redmond has been known as a talented player with excellent dribbling skills, but he admitted that his physical game needed work. This was something that was addressed by his former Birmingham City teammates, Roger Johnson and Stephen Carr, who were eager to help him develop his game. "They used to rough-house me quite a lot," Redmond said in a recent interview. "I had to learn how to deal with it and get stronger." The 21-year-old is now determined to make a difference in the play-off match against Croatia. England have been in good form, winning their last three matches, and Redmond is confident that they can come out on top. "We've been playing well, and we're ready for this challenge," he said. "Croatia will be tough, but we're prepared." The match will be a huge test for the England side, who will be looking to qualify for their fifth consecutive European Championship. It is also an opportunity for Gareth Southgate's team to prove that they can compete against the best in Europe. Southgate has been impressed with Redmond's development in the past year, and he is hoping that the midfielder can perform on the big stage. "Nathan has been outstanding for us," Southgate said. "He's come on leaps and bounds in the last few months, and we're hoping that he can make a difference against Croatia." The England under 21s will need to be at their best against Croatia. The Croatian side has plenty of quality, and they will be looking to make it to the European Championship themselves. However, with players like Nathan Redmond in the side, England will be confident that they can get the job done. The match promises to be an exciting affair, and fans at Molineux will be hoping that England can come out on top. There's no doubt that Nathan Redmond will be one of the key players to watch, and if he can continue his impressive form, England could be celebrating a place in the Euro 2015 finals.
