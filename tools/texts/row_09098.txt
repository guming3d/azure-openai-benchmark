Unrepentant: Joanne Caplis was ordered to carry out 80 hours unpaid work after a trial, but appeared to mock the sentence on Facebook . A shameless thief who stole from a charity publicly mocked the soft sentence she was given on Facebook. Shopworker Joanne Caplis, 43, was ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work for taking £50 from Shopmobility which provides scooters for disabled clients. But within hours of leaving court she posted on her profile: '80 hours community service ha bloody ha.' Caplis - who still protests her innocence - then used offensive language to describe her former employer. She defiantly refused to apologise today and claimed she was poking fun at the system rather than scoffing at the leniency of her sentence. She said: 'I am not sorry because I have not done anything wrong. I posted on Facebook "ha bloody ha" because I think it is ridiculous.' Caplis, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, worked at the charity’s branch in Wigan where bosses spotted irregularities with the accounts. She pleaded not guilty to fraud by altering banking spreadsheets but was found guilty of the two charges at Wigan Magistrates Court. She was given a community order and told to pay £50 compensation with a £60 victim surcharge. David Eccles, general manager of Shopmobility, said: 'I have known Joanne for more than 15 years. 'She was a volunteer and then became a part-time paid employee. 'We noticed the inaccuracies by chance and found proof she stole £50. We all knew it could only be one person who could have done it. Today Caplis insisted she was innocent and was making fun of the system that found her guilty rather than scoffing at the leniency of her sentence . 'There was only one paid employee who did the banking on those particular days. We sacked her on the spot and her reaction was disbelief. 'We feel really disappointed and hurt that someone we trusted had done this. Our clients - people from Wigan and Leigh - trusted her. They were all friends and she has let us all down. 'We don’t have a lot of cash and we are struggling. In a week we probably take between £200 and £300, so taking money makes it even harder.' Caplis claimed: 'I never hid anything from anyone. I went to see a solicitor about the way bosses sacked me, as they did not follow protocol. 'The only reason there is no tribunal is because I couldn’t afford it. 'I feel so angry about it. I have been there 18 years and my former partner, Gary Kay, who is the father of my son, was the chairman there before he died 11 years ago, aged 53. 'We did quite a bit of fund-raising.'

chatgpt: Joanne Caplis, a 43-year-old woman, has been found guilty of stealing £50 from a mobility charity. The charity provides assistance and support to the elderly and disabled individuals in the community. Caplis has caused significant damage to the charity's operations, and there are concerns that more funds may have been stolen under her watch.  During the trial, Caplis made a rather strange argument. She claimed that she was not mocking the sentence itself, but rather the legal system that had charged her with theft. She stated that she had not done anything wrong and therefore felt no remorse for her actions.  Former colleagues and associates of Caplis were taken aback by her brazenness. One of her former bosses expressed deep disappointment and hurt over her actions. They highlighted that Caplis was a trusted member of the charity and that stealing funds meant that less support could be provided to those in need.  The court heard that Caplis had access to the charity's safe, where the £50 had gone missing from. The funds were meant to be used to purchase supplies for the elderly and disabled clients supported by the charity. It was also revealed that over several months, the charity had seen a gradual decline in their funding.  The prosecutor in the case expressed concern that Caplis may have taken more funds than what had been discovered. He urged the court to take this into account when imposing a sentence. There was also concern that Caplis may try to access other funds, given her experience with the charity's financial operations.  However, Caplis remained adamant that she had not taken any more funds, stating that she was a victim of a conspiracy aimed at discrediting her. She dismissed the evidence presented against her as circumstantial and stated that she was being targeted unfairly.  The judge, who presided over the case, highlighted her lack of remorse and the impact her actions had on the charity. He stated that her crimes were reprehensible and that she had shown no indication that she understood the gravity of what she had done. The judge also said that he would take into account the possibility that more funds may have been misappropriated when deciding on an appropriate sentence.  After a brief recess, the judge announced his decision. Joanne Caplis was sentenced to six months behind bars, and her actions were widely condemned by the court. The prosecutor welcomed the verdict and praised the charity for its efforts to ensure justice was served. He also expressed hope that this case would act as a deterrent to others who may be considering stealing from charities.  In conclusion, Joanne Caplis's actions were a significant breach of trust, and they have had a harmful impact on the mobility charity she worked for. Her lack of remorse and the unusual defense she put forward during the trial highlight the dangers of arrogance and indifference concerning unethical behavior. The sentence imposed on her demonstrates that justice will be served, and the public can trust that those who misuse charity funds will face the consequences of their actions.
