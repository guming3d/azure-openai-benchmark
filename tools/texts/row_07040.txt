He said: 'My kids love Halloween and beg to start decorating the house and carving pumpkins from about October 1. 'Obviously cut pumpkins only last a couple of days so I carved a small one to keep them quiet. 'I thought we could have a bit of fun with it making it hover spookily in the back garden.

Mr Eliis and the squirrels have become a web sensation after he posted dozens of unusual scenes with them in his garden. And his latest work is proving just as popular in the build up to Halloween. He said it takes hours - and occasionally days - to capture the shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take up the exact stance needed.
