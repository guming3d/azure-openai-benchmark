article: A Japanese lingerie brand has created a bra that can only be removed when its wearer is experiencing ‘true love’. The underwear comes with a heart rate monitor that syncs with a mobile phone app which automatically unhooks the bra when the wearer’s pulse hits its so-called ‘True Love Rate’. Manufacturer Ravijour insists the bra will not continually burst open whenever its wearer goes for a jog however, as it says the app can recognise the difference between a heart rate increase caused by exercise, and a sharp spike brought about by romantic excitement. Innovative: The underwear comes with a heart rate monitor that synchs with a mobile phone app which automatically unhooks the bra when the wearer's pulse hits its so-called 'True Love Rate' The bra works by monitoring heart rate increases specifically caused by hormone levels secreted by the adrenal medulla – the gland that releases adrenalin into the bloodstream. The bra’s in-built heart monitor reacts to any increase in the wearer’s pulse rate by sending a signal to the mobile phone app via Bluetooth. The app then monitors the changes for a few minutes to try to work out exactly what caused the increase, and when the level reaches its ‘True Love Rate’, the bra literally bursts open.

chatgpt: Japanese lingerie manufacturer Ravijour has launched a unique bra that only unfastens when the wearer's pulse hits a certain level, which they call the "True Love Rate".  The company has utilized technology to develop an app that works by monitoring the wearer's heart rate. The app is synced with the bra and when the wearer's heart rate is elevated, the bra loosens and releases its clasp, allowing the wearer to fully embrace their romantic moment with their partner.  But the bra is not just a gimmick or a playful invention. It is intended to revolutionize the world of intimate apparel by promoting and enhancing sexual consent. The bra ensures that the wearer's romantic moments are initiated only when both partners' heart rates are elevated and they are both physically and emotionally ready to engage in intimacy.  According to Ravijour, the bra is designed to differentiate between the wearer's normal heart rate and a heart rate that is elevated due to physical activity such as exercise. The app is calibrated to measure heart rate variability, which is a measure of the variation in time between successive heartbeats.  The bra may also have implications for sexual assault prevention. With rising concerns about non-consensual sex and the #MeToo movement, the True Love Rate bra could be seen as a tool for promoting sexual consent and preventing sexual assault. While the technology used in the bra and accompanying app is still in its early stages, it could potentially be developed further to detect and prevent non-consensual sexual activity.  However, some critics have expressed concern about the implications of such a technology. The bra could raise questions about the role of consent in intimate relationships, and whether it should rely on heart rate measurements rather than verbal communication. It may also put pressure on individuals to always be in the mood for sex or to perform physically perfect in intimate moments.  Despite these concerns, Ravijour's True Love Rate bra represents a significant step in the evolution of intimate apparel. The technology could be integrated into other forms of clothing or accessories, making it easier for individuals to gauge their partner's readiness for intimacy, and ultimately promoting healthy, consensual and safe sexual experiences.
