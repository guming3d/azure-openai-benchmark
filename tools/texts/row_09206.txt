chatgpt: Dozens of descendants of former presidential candidate Mitt Romney's great-grandfather, who fled to Mexico to escape anti-polygamy laws, reportedly still live in the country more than a century later.  According to recent reports, the Romneys' polygamous roots can be traced back to Miles Romney, a prominent figure in the early days of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Miles was a strong believer in polygamy, the practice of taking multiple wives, which was common among early Mormon pioneers.  However, polygamy was outlawed by the U.S. government in the late 1800s, leading many Mormons to flee the country in search of new homes where they could freely practice their beliefs. In 1886, Miles Romney moved with his wives and children to Colonia Dublán, a Mormon settlement in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.  Miles' great-grandson, Mitt Romney, became a prominent politician in the United States, serving as the Governor of Massachusetts and later as a U.S. senator from Utah. However, many of his distant cousins remained in Mexico and have been living there ever since. Despite the fact that polygamy is still illegal in Mexico, the Romneys who stayed have reportedly been able to practice their faith and maintain their family traditions. Many of them continue to live in the Colonia Dublán area, where they have established a close-knit community that includes several generations of Romney descendants.  Some members of the family have even achieved success in politics and business in Mexico. For example, Leopoldo Romandia, a distant cousin of Mitt's, has served as a state representative and mayor in the nearby town of Casas Grandes.  While the Romneys' polygamous roots may be controversial, their story is a reminder of the challenges faced by minority religious groups in the United States. The Romneys' decision to move to Mexico and continue practicing their faith was a bold move that allowed them to maintain their traditions in a new land.  Today, their descendants are proud of their family history and the sacrifices made by their ancestors to preserve their way of life. While some may criticize their beliefs and practices, the Romneys continue to thrive as a community in Mexico and serve as a testament to the resilience of human culture and tradition.
