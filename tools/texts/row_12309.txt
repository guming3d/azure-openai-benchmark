The villagers claimed that they had informed the forest department but its personnel took too long to get to the site and they had no other choice but to kill the leopard to prevent further attacks by the animal. Assam has seen a rise in animal attacks on people over the past few years, and the people who once revered the animals have started to kill them out of anger and fear. There are no official statistics on the death of leopards at the hands of human beings, but unofficial reports put the figure at around 70 between 2005 and 2011, according to The Indian Express. The highest number of leopards killed was in 2008, with Aaranyak, a leading wildlife NGO putting the toll that year at 29. In 2011, seven leopards were killed in Dibrugarh alone. One of the victims of the leopard suffered serious facial injuries. He was in his home at the time of the attack . In March at least eight people were injured when two leopards in Kamrup attacked them in a field. Villagers killed one and the other escaped. 'Leopards are indeed under severe threat across the state. Increasing conflict between people and wild animals, more particularly leopards, has become a major problem, especially with a section of the people violently retaliating, causing injury and even death to the animals,' said SP Singh, state chief conservator of forests (wildlife). In 2012 the department mounted a media campaign to generate awareness against killing or causing harm to leopards. The authorities have asked people to immediately inform the forest department when they see a wild animal outside a sanctuary or national park instead of trying to attack it.

chatgpt: A terrifying incident occurred in a small village located in the state of Assam in India. A wild animal, suspected to be a leopard, had sneaked into a house and savaged three members of a family. The attack left them with serious injuries and prompted the villagers to take matters into their own hands. According to locals, the attack occurred in the middle of the night when the family members were fast asleep inside their house. The ferocious animal broke into the house and attacked the sleeping family members, leaving them with terrible injuries. The victims were immediately rushed to the hospital, where they received medical attention. Meanwhile, the villagers formed a hunting party to capture the wild animal. The group found the leopard in a nearby forest and managed to capture it after a lengthy and dangerous chase. They subdued it by roping it to a tree and attacked it with sticks and stones. The brutal attack on the leopard sparked outrage among animal activists who expressed concern over the animal's welfare. Many residents of the village, however, defended the villagers' actions, saying that capturing and killing the animal was the only way to prevent further attacks on humans. Speaking on the incident, a senior forest official said that they are investigating the matter and will take appropriate action against those who were responsible for hunting and injuring the animal. He also urged the villagers to be cautious and take measures to prevent such incidents in the future. Leopard attacks are not uncommon in Assam, where habitat encroachment and deforestation have forced wild animals to venture into human settlements in search of food. In the past, similar incidents have been reported from other parts of the state, prompting authorities to launch awareness campaigns to educate people about wildlife conservation. The incident has once again highlighted the need for stricter measures to safeguard the habitat of wild animals and prevent human-animal conflicts. It's crucial that people living in wildlife-rich areas take proactive steps to minimize their impact on the environment and avoid conflicts with wild animals. While the villagers must be applauded for their bravery in capturing the wild animal, it's also essential that they avoid taking matters into their own hands and leave the handling of dangerous animals to the authorities. The government must also work towards providing better resources to manage human-wildlife conflicts and preserving the habitat of endangered species.
