article: ROME, Italy -- Italian tennis players Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali have been banned by the ATP for betting on matches. Top Italian player Potito Starace has been suspended for six weeks for betting on matches. The country's top player Starace -- 31st in the ATP rankings -- has been suspended for six weeks from January 1 and fined $30,000 (20,890 euros) for making five bets totalling around 90 euros two years ago. Bracciali, world ranked 258, has been banned for three months and fined $20,000 (13,930 euros) for making around 50 five-euro bets between 2004 and 2005. The Italian Tennis Federation (FIT) confirmed the news on its website, www.federtennis.it. However, they denounced the penalties as disproportionate, saying the players never bet on their own matches. "Injustice is done," the statement said. "These penalties are absolutely, excessively severe compared to the magnitude of the violations carried out by the two players." The federation said the two were not aware of the ATP's betting regulations, and that they stopped placing the bets as soon as they learned it was against the rules. Another Italian player, Alessio Di Mauro, became the first player sanctioned under the ATP's new anti-corruption rules when he received a nine-month ban in November, also for betting on matches. Starace and Bracciali said they were scapegoats for a larger match-fixing scandal."It's disgusting," said the 26-year-old Starace. "The ATP doesn't know where to turn. It's all a joke." Bracciali said the two had been "sacrificed." "That's why they came after us," the 29-year-old said. "We are not champions and we don't count in the upper echelons." ATP officials could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Concerns about match-fixing have risen since August, when an online betting company reported unusual betting patterns during a match between fourth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina. The company, Betfair, voided all bets and the ATP has been investigating. Davydenko, who retired while trailing in the third set, denies wrongdoing. Since then, several players have said that they had been approached with offers to fix matches in exchange for money. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: Two Italian tennis players, Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali, have been banned by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for placing bets on tennis matches. Although they did not bet on their own matches, the players violated the ATP rules, which prohibit players from gambling on any tennis match. Starace, 37, has been suspended for six weeks, while Bracciali, 40, has received a three-month ban from the ATP. The suspensions went into effect on May 10, 2021. The ATP confirmed the sanctions against the players in a statement released on May 7, 2021, after an investigation into their conduct. The statement read: "Mr. Starace and Mr. Bracciali have been found to have violated the ATP's rules governing betting-related corruption offenses. Both players admitted to the violations and cooperated fully with the ATP in its investigation. While the players did not bet on matches in which they were playing, they have nevertheless breached the rules." The ATP's anti-corruption program prohibits all players and support staff from betting on any tennis event. In addition, the program also prohibits any form of direct or indirect solicitation, offer, or provision of any benefit or bribe to any other party. Starace and Bracciali have been part of the Italian tennis scene for many years, with Starace having reached a career-high ranking of 27 in the world in 2007. Bracciali was a doubles specialist and reached a career-high ranking of 49 in 2012. The ATP has taken a strong stance against match-fixing and gambling in tennis in recent years, increasing the number of investigators and implementing stricter penalties for breaches of its rules. In 2020, the organization banned five players and one coach for various gambling-related offenses. The ATP's efforts to maintain the integrity of the sport have been praised by many in the tennis community, who believe that gambling-related corruption undermines the credibility of tennis and erodes public confidence in the game. The suspensions of Starace and Bracciali are a reminder that the ATP remains vigilant in its efforts to combat match-fixing and illegal gambling in tennis. The organization has urged all players and support staff to report any suspicious behavior or activity related to gambling or match-fixing. In conclusion, the ATP's suspension of Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali sends a clear message that gambling and match-fixing will not be tolerated in professional tennis. The penalties imposed on the players highlight the importance of maintaining the integrity of the sport and ensuring that players and support staff adhere to the ATP's stringent rules governing betting-related offenses.
