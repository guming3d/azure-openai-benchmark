chatgpt: Former Liverpool player and current football pundit Steve Nicol has criticized Arsenal's star signing, Alexis Sanchez, after his performance against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Nicol described Sanchez's performance as "awful" and criticized the Chilean's delivery as "horrendous".  Sanchez, who was signed from Barcelona for £30 million this summer, has been seen as a key player for Arsenal this season. However, his performance against Crystal Palace was poor and he was unable to have a significant impact on the game.  Nicol, who played for Liverpool for 13 years and won multiple trophies during his time at the club, was particularly disappointed with Sanchez's delivery. He argued that the quality of the Chilean's crosses and corners was not good enough for a player of his caliber.  Nicol was not the only one to criticize Sanchez's performance. Many fans and football pundits took to social media to voice their disappointment with the Chilean's display at Selhurst Park.  Despite the criticism, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger defended Sanchez, saying that the forward was suffering from fatigue after a long international break with Chile. Wenger pointed out that Sanchez had played in two World Cup qualifier matches and had to travel a long distance before joining up with the Arsenal squad.  Wenger also highlighted Sanchez's overall contribution to the team, praising his work-rate and defensive contribution. However, the Frenchman did admit that there was room for improvement in the forward's attacking play.  The Arsenal boss will be hoping that Sanchez can bounce back from his disappointing performance against Crystal Palace and help the team secure a crucial victory in their next game against Everton. The Gunners currently sit fourth in the Premier League table, two points behind leaders Manchester City.  In conclusion, Steve Nicol's criticism of Alexis Sanchez's performance has brought the Chilean's display into the spotlight. Despite Arsene Wenger's defense, Sanchez will have to prove himself in Arsenal's upcoming matches if he wants to maintain his status as a key player for the North London club.
