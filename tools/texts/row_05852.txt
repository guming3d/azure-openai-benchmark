chatgpt: Lancashire firefighters are warning the public to be extra vigilant when it comes to cooking after three separate blazes occurred in just three weeks. The cause was both unusual and unexpected – sugar on Eccles cakes, a traditional delicacy in the region. While it might not seem like a common cause of fires, the sugar on Eccles cakes can indeed catch fire if overheated. Eccles cakes are small round pastries, filled with currants and raisins, and traditionally topped with a sprinkling of sugar. The high sugar content means they are particularly susceptible to catching fire if left unattended for too long. Firefighters responded to the first of three incidents three weeks ago, after a home baker left a batch of Eccles cakes in the oven for too long. The sugar topping caught alight, quickly spreading flames throughout the oven and the surrounding kitchen. The homeowners were luckily able to quickly extinguish the flames and a disaster was averted.  The second incident occurred just two weeks later in a semi-detached house in Warton. This time the cakes were being heated in a microwave, a decision the owner would really come to regret. Upon opening the door, he found the cake had erupted into flames, with thick black smoke billowing out and filling the whole house. The fire brigade quickly arrived on the scene and extinguished the flames, but the damage had already been done – the kitchen was ruined, and the homeowner had a lucky escape. The most recent incident was even more serious, occurring just a week later in a commercial bakery in Lytham. By this point, the fire service had become increasingly concerned by the trend of fires caused by Eccles cakes. They were quick to respond, with a fleet of fire engines arriving at the scene promptly. The bakery was in the middle of production when the fire broke out, and while the fire service quickly contained it, they struggled to get it under control. The sugar topping had been left unattended and had caught fire, spreading rapidly throughout the bakery. The fire service worked hard to extinguish the flames, but the building suffered significant damage, and the bakery was closed for the foreseeable future.  While none of these incidents caused any fatalities, they serve as a stark reminder of the importance of being alert when cooking, even with microwave use. The chairman of Lancashire's Fire and Rescue service, Simon Mayor, spoke to the Lancashire Telegraph about the dangers of sugar, warning that people should be watching their food even when cooking in a microwave. He added that it is essential always to follow cooking instructions and be wary of leaving any cooking unattended, especially foods high in sugar, like Eccles cakes. Mayor urged the public to take heed of the fire service's warnings and to take the appropriate precautions to avoid such incidents occurring in the future. Despite the seriousness of the incidents, Lancashire firefighters hope that by raising awareness, they can prevent others from making the same mistakes. It is clear that people must always be alert while cooking, regardless of whether they are using an oven, stove, or microwave. Ultimately, it could mean the difference between a small kitchen fire and a devastating disaster.
