article: (CNN) -- Shows at SeaWorld in San Diego, California, are expected to resume on schedule Wednesday, a day after a 12-year-old male killer whale died. The whale showed signs of being ill only on Monday, the park announced. The cause of death for Sumar won't be known until a necropsy is complete, SeaWorld said. Results may not be known for several weeks. "It's a very sad day," spokesman Dave Koontz told CNN on Tuesday. "He was a great young killer whale. He was sharp." Sumar, who weighed about 5,000 pounds, had been at SeaWorld San Diego since 2001, coming from an Ohio park. He was one of seven killer whales at SeaWorld and was able to exhibit about 100 "behaviors," Koontz said. The killer whale had no medical history or problems with behavior, the spokesman said, adding that there was no evidence of communicable disease. "He had a great disposition." "Trainers had noticed that Sumar was acting lethargic yesterday [Monday] afternoon. Park veterinarians began a regimen of antibiotics to help try to stabilize his condition while they attempted to determine the cause of his illness," a SeaWorld statement said. "His condition worsened today and a decision was made to cancel the 12:30 p.m. Shamu show, so that trainers and veterinarians could continue to devote their full attention to Sumar. Despite these efforts, Sumar did not survive." Orlando, Florida-based SeaWorld was recently fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one classified as willful, after an animal trainer was killed by a whale in Orlando in February. SeaWorld, which also has a location in San Antonio, Texas, said it would contest the violations. The last killer whale to die at the San Diego venue was Splash, who was sickly when SeaWorld adopted him. He was nursed back to health and lived 15 years until 2005. No public memorial for Sumar has been planned, although fans will be able to comment on the park's Facebook page, Koontz said.

chatgpt: In a tragic incident, a killer whale named Sumar died at SeaWorld in San Diego on Monday. The 12-year-old male orca had been showing signs of lethargy for a few days before his death, according to park officials. Sumar was born in captivity and had spent his entire life at SeaWorld. In recent months, he had been performing in "Orca Encounter," a show that showcases the natural behaviors of killer whales in a more educational manner, rather than having them do tricks. On Monday, Sumar's behavior became increasingly concerning, and park veterinarians and trainers were called in to evaluate him. Despite their efforts, Sumar passed away that afternoon. Sumar's death comes amidst ongoing controversy surrounding the treatment of orcas in captivity. In recent years, several documentaries have shed light on the negative effects of keeping these highly intelligent creatures in small tanks and forcing them to perform. SeaWorld has faced significant backlash from animal rights activists and the public, leading to a decline in attendance and a shift in the park's focus towards more educational experiences rather than entertainment. In response to Sumar's death, SeaWorld issued a statement expressing their sadness and offering condolences to their team members who had worked closely with the orca. "Sumar was a beloved member of the SeaWorld family, and his passing has deeply affected all of us," the statement read. "Our veterinarians and animal care team worked tirelessly to offer him the best possible care, but unfortunately, his condition deteriorated rapidly. We will conduct a thorough review to understand what happened and whether any changes need to be made to our protocols." According to SeaWorld officials, Sumar had exhibited around 100 "behaviors" during his time at the park. However, animal rights organizations argue that this number is insignificant compared to the vast array of natural behaviors that orcas display in the wild. Sumar's death serves as a reminder of the ongoing debate over the ethics of keeping orcas in captivity and the need to find more humane solutions for these incredible creatures.
