article: (CNN) -- He's used to making waves in the pool, but Ryan Lochte has caused a few ripples of excitement on social media after tweeting out a photo of himself in front of what he claims was 10,000 calories worth of food, including piles of chicken and asparagus. It's not clear whether the five-time Olympic gold medalist was about to tuck into the food in one sitting, but eating what amounts to around four times the recommended daily calorie intake for an adult male would not be unusual for someone like Lochte, says a leading sports nutritionist. "It's quite a lot of food!" Lewis James, a lecturer in nutrition at the UK's Loughborough University, told CNN. "I would expect someone like Ryan Lochte to have 10,000 calories in a day but in one meal it sounds like quite a lot." Lochte, who turns 30 at the beginning of August, isn't the first swimmer to reveal a gargantuan appetite. His former U.S. swimming teammate Michael Phelps once famously claimed to consume 12,000 calories a day, before later saying it was a myth. Swimmers' grueling training schedules, combined with their larger bodies, mean they require many more calories than most other top athletes, James says. "Generally, if you look at athletes, most of the guys that are larger don't do so much exercise," he explains. "The guys that tend to do a lot of exercise and have a lot of hours of training tend to be smaller. Look at the typical Tour (de France) cyclist -- they are somewhere between 60-75 kilos, most of those guys. "So they are doing an awful lot of activity but their body weight is a lot lower, so they have less weight to sustain essentially," he adds. "During a day on the Tour de France, you'd perhaps expect total energy expenditure to be between 6,000-7,000 calories for most of the cyclists." Unlike Tour riders, who can top up their energy reserves with energy bars and fluids en route, swimmers can't do the same, explains James. "People like Ryan would be training for very long periods at a time, (meaning) they have long periods of their days when they don't get any food in at all." "You've got someone who has a higher requirement (for calories) but technically has less hours to consume that requirement because he's in a pool for three to four hours a day." You are what you eat, so the saying goes, and it seems athletes are only going to be as good as their last meal. "Everyone should be working hard to make sure they have got the appropriate diet for their sport or their event, making sure they are well fed and have consumed the right nutrients at the right times so that we can really maximize performance," James says. "Messing your diet up or not eating properly in a lot of events can really impair your performance." Read more: Olympic athletes' extreme eating habits .

chatgpt: Five-time Olympic champion swimmer and world record holder, Michael Phelps, recently tweeted a photo of his 10,000-calorie meal, which left many people shocked and bewildered. The meal included three fried-egg sandwiches, a five-egg omelet, three sugar-coated slices of French toast, a bowl of grits, two cups of coffee, and a whopping 12 pancakes. While Phelps' meal may seem excessive, elite swimmers require such high calorie intake due to their size and the grueling training schedule they endure. According to Dr. Dan Benardot, a professor of nutrition at Georgia State University, Phelps' daily intake during the height of his Olympic training was around 12,000 calories. But not all athletes require such a high calorie intake to sustain their performance. UK nutrition expert, Lewis James, pointed out that most endurance athletes are much smaller in size than swimmers and have a different physical makeup. "Messing up your diet can really impair performance, so it's important to get it right," he added. A well-balanced and carefully planned diet is crucial for athletes to perform at their best. Endurance athletes, such as long-distance runners, require a diet that is high in carbohydrates, while strength athletes, such as weightlifters, require a diet that is high in protein. For swimmers like Phelps, a high-calorie diet is needed to fuel the energy demands of their intense training schedule. However, not all high-calorie foods are created equal. A diet rich in processed foods, such as the fast-food options that Phelps consumed in his 10,000-calorie meal, can lead to inflammation and other health issues. Instead, athletes are advised to consume nutrient-dense foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats. In addition to a proper diet, athletes must also stay hydrated. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, decreased cognitive function, and a decrease in performance. Athletes are advised to drink water throughout the day and to replenish electrolytes lost during exercise with sports drinks or coconut water. As for Phelps, he has retired from competitive swimming but remains an advocate for proper nutrition and fitness. In 2017, he launched the Michael Phelps Foundation, which aims to promote healthy and active lifestyles for children. In conclusion, while Phelps' 10,000-calorie meal may seem excessive, it was necessary for his sport and his intense training schedule. However, it's crucial for athletes to consume a well-balanced diet that is tailored to their individual needs to achieve peak performance. Both diet and hydration play an important role in an athlete's overall health and performance, and it's important for athletes to prioritize both to achieve their goals.
