article: (CNN) -- Note to self: When soliciting for drugs on Twitter, try a direct message. Facing another boring day at work, a Toronto car repair shop worker decided some weed would be just the thing to make the day fly by. Instead of reaching out by phone or walking to his friendly neighborhood drug dealer, the user, using the handle @Sunith_DB8R, tweeted that he needed a joint delivered to his workplace in Vaughan, just north of Toronto. Opinions on marijuana reaching tipping point . The York Regional Police, @YRP, caught a whiff of the request and enthusiastically -- perhaps too enthusiastically -- responded with, "Awesome! Can we come too?" You can imagine what happens next. The police forwarded the tweet to an account for a man listed on the board of directors for the repair shop chain. But it didn't end there. When oversharing online can get you arrested . The exchange was retweeted thousands of times. At one point it was a top trend in Toronto that Tuesday. The tweeter then tried a couple of different tactics. First, defiance. "Never knew weed smokers are more wanted in society than shooters & rapists. Big smh to all of y'all," said one tweet. Then, retreat. "People really think I'm serious with my tweets? MANNNNNNNN." Finally, shame. "Can't lie, stupid move but would y'all have noticed that tweet if YRP didn't retweet it?" Since the tweeter named the company, Mr. Lube, and the intersection where his shop was, the chain got involved. "Thank you to the York Regional Police for your help and great work. The matter has now been handled," it said in a tweet. Handled? "Just got the call of termination," tweeted the worker later that afternoon. Make that, the ex-worker. Canadian broadcaster CTV reached out to the manager of the repair shop, who said "there was an employee here by that name; he no longer works for us." The York Regional Police explained in a later tweet, "If you shouted on a busy street corner about illegal activity & we drove by, we'd intervene. Think of Twitter as a virtual street corner." And one final volley from the social media-savvy department. "At the end an interesting day, a reminder to our tweeps: the Internet is a public forum #tweetsafe #tweetclassy #imagineyourmamareadingit" Lesson learned? Probably. The next day, the man deleted his account. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report .

The situation quickly spiraled out of control and the man found himself at the center of a media frenzy. According to the police, they stumbled upon the tweet by chance. The tweet read “Anybody in Lakewood know where I can get some weed? There might be a free bowl in it for you!” The police replied to the tweet, “Sure, we’d be happy to help you find some weed. Can we come too?” This response quickly went viral and was widely shared on social media. The man soon found himself at the center of a media storm, with many outlets covering his story. The attention proved too much for his employer, who decided to terminate his contract.

The situation highlights the dangers of posting sensitive or controversial information online. Many people are unaware of the potential consequences of their social media activity, and do not think twice before posting potentially incriminating information. The man’s ordeal serves as a cautionary tale for anyone who uses social media. Despite this, many people continue to use Twitter and other social media platforms to post about illegal activities. In some cases, these posts have led to arrests and other legal consequences. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly using social media to monitor criminal activity, and are often successful in catching offenders. The man’s story has also raised questions about the legality of marijuana use in Colorado. Although recreational use of marijuana is legal in the state, there are still restrictions on its use and sale. Many people have criticized the state’s lax attitude towards marijuana, arguing that it has resulted in increased drug use and related criminal activity. Overall, the man’s experience serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of social media, and the need to be cautious when posting sensitive information online. Despite the many benefits of social media, it is important to remember that anything posted online can be traced back to the author, potentially with severe consequences.
