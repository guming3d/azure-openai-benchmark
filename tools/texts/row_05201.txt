article: A disabled former soldier said he felt 'like a dog' after being thrown out of a gastro-pub for trying to sell poppies. Patrick Tobin, who left service with a disability pension after fighting in Northern Ireland, was trying to raise money for Royal British Legion when he visited Garden Bar and Grill in Kensington, west London. The 76-year-old was about to approach customers when bar staff refused him entry, leaving him 'humiliated'. Humiliated: Patrick Tobin said he was made to feel 'like a dog' after being thrown out of the pub in Kensington where he was trying to raise money for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal . 'I was going into the garden, he barred my way. He didn't want me to go out there,' the veteran said. 'He boxed me off and wouldn't let me go down. I'm disgusted about it.' Mr Tobin, who has been selling poppies in the area every year for decades, was given no choice but to leave the pub in embarrassment. 'I was humiliated. I felt like a dog, I was absolutely gobsmacked.' Local residents who have seen Mr Tobin collecting on behalf of the charity for years were horrified by the exchange. Zohra Hussain, who works in a local shop near said: 'It is an important part of life here. They do it every year. It’s bad, we feel bad. 'It is unusual for an area like this.' One local serviceman who did not want to be named added: 'This is Britain, poppies are part and parcel of Britain. 'It’s a disgrace.' Outraged customers have taken to the pub's Facebook page in complaint. The pub's manager said the incident was down to a staff member's poor grasp of English and has donated £40 to the charity since . 'Most of the families living here had a family member go to war. I hope the company and all the staff have poppies on and make a large donation to the poppy appeal,' Tracey Anthony wrote. John Mitchell added: 'Shame on you. One of your staff has put shame on your company. 'Poppies are a part of UK heritage, and your company is in the UK so your staff should have respect.' Bardi Berisha, the bar's manager, put the incident down to staff members' poor grasp of English. 'To be clear the Garden bar has always proudly supported the poppy appeal every year and this year in no different. 'If Mr Poppy man would like to return, I will personally buy all his poppies,' he said. Mr Berisha added he had donated £40 to Royal British Legion since the incident.

chatgpt: A 76-year-old veteran was left humiliated after being thrown out of the Garden Bar and Grill in Kensington, west London while collecting money for the Royal British Legion, a charity that supports British armed forces veterans and their families. Patrick Tobin had been standing outside the pub with a charity box, raising money for the cause, when he was approached by the bar's manager who asked him to leave. Tobin was confused, as he had previously been given permission to collect money outside the pub, and had even been given a power outlet to charge his mobile phone. "The manager came out and said 'can you leave please? We don't want beggars'," Tobin recounted. "I said, 'I'm not a beggar, I'm collecting for the Royal British Legion'. He said, 'I don't care, can you leave?' I said, 'I don't understand why you're asking me to leave, I've been here before'. And he said, 'if you don't leave, I'll call the police'." Tobin was shaken by the encounter, feeling embarrassed and humiliated in front of passersby on the busy London street. He posted about the incident on social media, which quickly gained attention and backlash from members of the public. The Garden Bar and Grill has since issued an apology to Tobin and made a £40 donation to the charity. "We are deeply sorry for the way Mr Tobin was treated," the pub's statement read. "Our staff should have recognised his charitable efforts and welcomed him with open arms. The manager involved has been reprimanded, and we have made a donation to the charity to express our regret." Tobin expressed his gratitude for the donation, but still feels hurt by the way he was treated. "I just want people to be aware of how we're treated," he said. "I'm not the only person who's collecting for charity. Anybody could be humiliated like I was." The Royal British Legion also released a statement, expressing their support for Tobin and their disappointment in the pub's treatment of him. "It is a sad reflection on our society when someone who is volunteering their time and energy in support of the armed forces community is treated in such a way," the statement read. "We thank Mr Tobin for his dedication to our cause, and we hope that this incident will not deter others from raising funds for us in the future." The incident has sparked a conversation about the treatment of charity collectors in public spaces, with many calling for more respect and recognition for the hard work that they do. Tobin's experience serves as a reminder that even those who have dedicated their lives to serving their country can still be subject to discrimination and mistreatment.
