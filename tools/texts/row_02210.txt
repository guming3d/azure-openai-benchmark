article: Prototype: Scientists have developed a 'smart bra' which can measure the wearer¿s mood to help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss . They are already used to lift, boost and enhance – but it seems bras  could soon be doing something else for women’s figures. Scientists have developed a ‘smart bra’ which can measure the wearer’s mood to help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss. Not only does the bra warn the wearer when she might be prone to reaching for food, but it gives her tips to help resist the impulse. MC Schraefel, a professor in computer science and human performance design from the University of Southampton, has helped to design the bra which is fitted with sensors which monitor heart and skin activity. The data from the prototype device is . analysed by a smartphone app which can highlight when ‘emotional eating’ is most likely to occur and offer advice to the wearer. The app then provides suggestions, such as carrying out calming breathing exercises, to reduce the user’s stress levels. Professor Schraefel said: ‘Emotional states, habitual practices, like snacking in front of the TV or grabbing  a cookie when stressed, often go undetected by us – that’s the nature of habits – but they have real effects on our wellbeing. ‘Our work in this project, while early, shows that there is potential to design interactive technologies to work with us, to help us develop both awareness of our state, and offer options we’ve decided we’d rather take, to build new practices and support our wellbeing.’ The bra is a result of a study called Food And Mood: Just-in-Time Support For Emotional Eating, written by researchers from the University of Southampton, Microsoft Research and the University of Rochester in New York, United States. The study set out to develop an intervention which is triggered before someone reaches for food as a means of emotional support. It suggested the smart bra and matching apps as possible solutions.

chatgpt: Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed a new kind of bra that not only provides support but can also monitor and assess the wearer's mood. The newly developed undergarment, called "Bra", has sensors that are embedded in the fabric and monitor the wearer's emotional state. The Bra is designed to help users overcome emotional eating habits, by alerting them when they might be prone to reaching for food. The sensors are able to detect changes in the body that are associated with specific emotional states, and provide users with real-time feedback. The feedback can help the wearer understand how their emotions impact their eating habits and help them to develop healthy coping mechanisms. Researchers believe the Bra could potentially help individuals improve their overall health and wellbeing. Emotional eating is a common issue and is often linked to stress and anxiety. By providing users with an understanding of their emotional triggers, the Bra could help them to avoid overeating and develop healthy habits. The Bra is currently still in development, but the researchers behind the project are confident that it will be ready for commercial release soon. They envision the Bra being used not only as a tool for personal health, but also as a way for healthcare providers to monitor the mood and wellbeing of their patients. This new technology represents a significant breakthrough in the development of wearable health monitoring devices. The Bra is the first of its kind to incorporate mood-detecting sensors into an item of clothing. While the concept of mood-tracking technology has been around for some time, the integration of such technology into clothing is a unique innovation. The new Bra will become part of a growing number of health tracking technologies that are being developed to help individuals improve their wellbeing. Wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, are already being used to monitor physical activity, sleep patterns, and heart rate. Some companies are also developing devices that can track and monitor mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. In conclusion, the new Bra from the University of Southampton is a game-changing technology, which could help individuals improve their overall health and wellbeing. With its sensors that measure the wearer's mood and provide real-time feedback, the Bra has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach emotional eating and improve our understanding of how emotions impact our health.
