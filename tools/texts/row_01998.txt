article: It's been some battle - with some glorious moments along the way - but the ultimate race between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo may soon be coming to an end. The world's best two players have been going head-to-head to break Raul's all-time Champions League goal record - which stands at a whopping 71. Messi has to be the firm favourite to overtake Raul first by sheer virtue of the fact that his Barcelona side take on Apoel Nicosia the night before Real Madrid play Basle later this month, and he is also one goal ahead of his rival.

Messi drew level with the Real Madrid legend Raul having scored a double in Barcelona's 2-0 win against Ajax on Wednesday night. The Barcelona star  reached the total - despite playing 52 fewer games. Ronaldo had a chance to to equal Raul's record before Messi as he was named in the Madrid side who faced a makeshift Liverpool side a day earlier. But Karim Benzema scored the only goal of the game as 29-year-old Ronaldo drew a blank. Real and Barcelona have already safely booked their passage through to the last 16 of the Champions League so the attention turns to Raul's record in the next round of fixtures for the Spanish giants. Ronaldo, who recently won the Golden Shoe, has also taken 147 games more to score 400 career goals, with Messi reaching the same total in just 506 games. However, the former Manchester United forward only took 140 games to score 150 La Liga goals, whereas it took Messi 203 games to reach that tally. Whatever happens it is set to be a truly remarkable climax to this latest duel between the two, but if Messi does set a new all-time Champions League scoring record before Ronaldo, the debate will still rage on as to who is the greatest of the two.

chatgpt: Lionel Messi has equalled Raul's all-time Champions League goal-scoring record of 71 goals with a brace against Ajax on Wednesday night. The Barcelona forward's double took his Champions League goal tally to 71, the same as Raul, who scored all of his goals for Real Madrid across 16 seasons in the competition. Messi has reached the landmark in just eight seasons, an incredible achievement that underlines his status as one of the greatest players of all time. Messi's first goal against Ajax came in the second half when he skilfully dribbled past a couple of defenders before slotting the ball home. His second goal was a tap-in from close range after a shot from Ivan Rakitic hit the post. The double took Messi's tally to four goals in this season's Champions League campaign. Messi's record-equalling feat comes just a day after Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo failed to find the back of the net against Liverpool in a goalless draw at Anfield. Ronaldo, who has scored 70 Champions League goals, one fewer than Messi and Raul, had a frustrating night as Liverpool's defence held firm to secure a point. Barcelona's next Champions League fixture is against Apoel Nicosia a day before Real Madrid's clash with Basle in the next round of matches. Given Messi's current form, it is highly likely that he will break the record and become the all-time highest goal-scorer in the competition before Ronaldo has a chance to catch up. But Ronaldo will be determined to reclaim the record and prove that he is still one of the best players in the world. Messi has had a sensational start to the season, having scored 14 goals in just 11 appearances in all competitions. He has been in dominant form for Barcelona and has helped them to the top of La Liga with a five-point lead over second-placed Real Madrid. Messi's partnership with Luis Suarez and Neymar has been deadly for the opposition as they have scored a combined 23 goals or more this season. Fans and pundits alike have been in awe of Messi's achievements and have hailed him as one of the best football players of all time. His ability to score incredible goals from all angles and distances, his exceptional dribbling skills, and his vision and passing range have made him a joy to watch on the field. As Messi approaches the all-time Champions League goal-scoring record, he looks set to cement his place as one of the greatest football players of all time. His sharpness in front of the goal and incredible work rate have helped Barcelona to numerous domestic and European titles over the years. Fans around the world will be eagerly anticipating his next milestone on his ongoing journey to greatness.
