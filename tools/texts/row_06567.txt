Giant pandas are considered critically endangered in the wild, and breeding them in captivity has proved difficult, especially in Washington. Zoo scientists have made numerous attempts to artificially inseminate its female panda because the pair failed to breed naturally. The new birth has given zoo scientists renewed confidence in the Washington pandas' ability to help grow the panda species. Last year, Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub, but it died after six days because its lungs hadn't fully developed and weren't sending enough oxygen to its liver. The zoo's first panda couple, Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing, had five cubs during the 1980s, though none lived more than a few days.

chatgpt: The Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C. has named its newest panda cub Bao Bao, which means "treasure" or "precious" in English. The 100-day-old panda was given the name following a public online vote. The Zoo first announced the birth of the giant panda cub in August, which was welcomed by animal lovers with great excitement. According to officials, the birth was a success and the cub was in good health. Since then, she has been closely monitored by zoo staff. The name Bao Bao was chosen by the public during a five-day online voting period. More than 100,000 people cast their vote for the name, which was selected from five different options. The other names included Ling Hua, Long Yun, Mulan and Zhen Bao. The name Bao Bao reflects the significance of the panda cub's birth for the National Zoo and all lovers of the endangered species. According to the zoo, giant pandas are classified as a "vulnerable" species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with only approximately 1,800 left in the wild. "We are delighted that so many people participated in the naming of our new panda cub," said Dennis Kelly, director of the National Zoo. "The name Bao Bao symbolizes not only the treasure setting she represents for the Smithsonian and the people of the United States, but also reinforces the importance of pandas to conservation efforts around the world." The panda cub's mother, Mei Xiang, also gave birth to another panda cub in 2012 named Bei Bei, whose name means "precious treasure" in Chinese. The two panda siblings have been attracting large crowds of visitors to the National Zoo since their births. The National Zoo has been a leader in giant panda conservation, with its breeding program helping to increase the population in captivity. The zoo has been working with the Chinese government to breed and study pandas since the 1970s. Bao Bao's naming ceremony was held on December 1, and it was attended by zoo officials, Chinese dignitaries, and members of the public. A traditional Chinese ribbon dance was performed in celebration of the occasion. The panda cub is expected to remain at the National Zoo until she is four years old, at which point she will be returned to China to join the breeding program. Until then, animal lovers can visit Bao Bao and her siblings at the National Zoo, where they can observe the adorable cubs playing and eating bamboo. In conclusion, the naming of Bao Bao is a significant event for the National Zoo and panda conservation efforts around the world. With her name reflecting the importance of these precious animals, Bao Bao is sure to bring joy to visitors at the National Zoo for years to come.
