article: (CNN) -- Tod Purvis and his brother Justin knew that they were going blind. Both had been diagnosed with choroideremia, a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive vision loss and eventually leads to complete blindness. So six years ago, the brothers went on a road trip across the United States. A documentary about their journey, "Driving Blind," was released this year after winning awards at independent film festivals in 2013. On the documentary's website, the filmmakers had this to say: . "We started filming under the impression that Tod and Justin had at least half of their eyesight left. It is revealed at the end that their eyesight was much much worse, and in truth the trip or film would have never happened had we knew they would in fact be driving blind. Justin was declared legally blind at the conclusion of the trip." Child goes on 'bucket list' trip before he goes blind . Tod Purvis took to the Internet community Reddit on Sunday to conduct an AMA (Ask Me Anything) about their trip, the documentary and choroideremia. The most beautiful place they visited? Devil's Tower in Wyoming, Purvis said. The second? Glacier Park in Montana. "We took the trip to put the memories in our brain where we could always call them up even if we completely lost our sight," Purvis posted. Choroideremia affects approximately 1 in every 50,000 people, according to the Choroideremia Research Foundation. It primarily occurs in males and starts in early childhood. It is caused by a gene mutation and is passed on to children via the X chromosome, according to the National Institutes of Health. "Without the protein produced by the CHM gene, pigment cells in the retina of the eye slowly stop working, then die off," according to NLO, a center for eye research at the University of Oxford. "As the disease progresses, the surviving retina gradually shrinks in size, reducing vision." Purvis said that his sight is down to about 50% but had difficulty describing what losing it was like to Reddit users. "It's hard to describe nothing. It's not black, it's like if you were looking through a tunnel, and the walls of the tunnel were made of mirrors and it reflected what was at the end of the tunnel." Purvis wrapped up the AMA after more than 600 comments, never wavering from the documentary's main message: . "No matter what your situation ... live your life to the fullest."

chatgpt: Brothers Tod and Justin Purvis were diagnosed with choroideremia, a genetic eye disorder that gradually causes blindness in males. Knowing that their eyesight would eventually diminish, the brothers decided to embark on a road trip across the United States. This road trip was captured on film, and the resulting documentary, "Driving Blind," has been released this year. Choroideremia is a rare eye condition that affects roughly one in 50,000 people. It progressively causes the loss of vision, beginning with peripheral and night vision and eventually leading to complete blindness. Tod and Justin Purvis knew that they would lose their sight due to their diagnosis, but rather than let the prospect of blindness hold them back, they decided to go on a journey across America. Their trip was documented in "Driving Blind," which chronicles their journey as their vision slowly deteriorated. The film shows the brothers traveling across the country, visiting national parks, meeting new people, and experiencing all that America has to offer. The film takes on a melancholic and introspective tone as the brothers reflect on their disease and the future that lies ahead. They candidly discuss the challenges they will face, and the emotions they grapple with as their vision slowly fades away. "Driving Blind" has been received positively by audiences and critics alike, with many praising the film's honest portrayal of the brothers' journey. The authenticity of the film comes from the fact that it was mostly self-funded, and the brothers operated the camera themselves. It captures the slow and inevitable process of losing one's sight, and the raw emotions that come with that experience. The release of "Driving Blind" has also raised awareness about choroideremia and the challenges faced by people living with the condition. The Purvis brothers have become advocates for the disease, speaking at events and fundraisers to raise funds and awareness. The documentary's message is that even with a diagnosis like choroideremia, people can still lead fulfilling and adventurous lives. In conclusion, "Driving Blind" is a heartwarming and poignant documentary that follows the journey of two brothers as they come to terms with their choroideremia diagnosis. Through their road trip across the United States, they experienced all that life has to offer, despite the inevitability of their condition. The release of the film has increased awareness about choroideremia and serves as a testament to the human spirit and the perseverance of those living with the condition.
