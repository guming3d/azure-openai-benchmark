It seems nerves got the better of Britney Spears ahead of the X Factor launch in New York yesterday. The star, 30, pulled out all the stops for the Fox's Upfront Presentation at the Beacon Theatre in New York yesterday with two thigh skimming mini-dresses. But she was clearly feeling a little jittery before meeting the press, biting her nails down until they bleed. Jitters: Britney Spears revealed her bitten nails at the FOX Network UpFront 2012 Presentation in New York yesterday . Ouch: The star's huge engagement ring was not enough to distract from her painful looking fingers . The Toxic singer has long chewed on her nails when feeling anxious and four years ago she even vowed to quit the habit. She said at the time: 'I have to learn to stop biting my nails! I would like to stop worrying so much, because I worry all the time.' While the mother-of-two has a troubled history, including a high-profile mental breakdown in 2008, her new boss Simon Cowell isn't concerned. When asked byÂ TMZ if he was worried about her appearing on live television, he said: 'Not at all.' New line-up: Britney joins L.A. Reid, Demi Lovato and Simon Cowell on the panel . Quick change: The singer wore two different thigh-skimming outfits at the event . What do you think of the new X Factor USA panel? Britney was joined at the event by her fiance and former manager Jason Trawick, who was recently approved as her conservator alongside her father. Conservators have legal authority over a person's general well-being, which includes decisions about food, clothing and medical care. He will reportedly accompany Britney on set each day. Britney is thought to have negotiated a $15 million pay packet to be a panellist on the show, but fellow new recruit Demi Lovato is rumoured to be earning just $1 million. Britney and Demi will replace Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger - who were axed after poor ratings on last year's debut series - sitting alongside show boss Simon and music executive L.A. Reid.

chatgpt: Popstar Demi Lovato has reportedly signed a music deal for just over $1 million, significantly less than her fellow pop queen Britney Spears' $15 million contract. News of the deal comes after Lovato released her seventh studio album "Dancing With the Devil... The Art of Starting Over" earlier this year.  While $1 million might seem like a lot of money to most of us, it's a far cry from the multi-million dollar contracts that major artists typically sign for their music deals. For example, in 2020 Warner Music reportedly signed Dua Lipa for a whopping $35 million.  Despite the comparatively lower figure, Lovato is sure to be pleased with the deal. After all, the singer has been open about her struggles with addiction and her legal battles with her former management team. The fact that she is still able to secure a lucrative contract in the music industry is a testament to her talent and her resilience.  Of course, the initial reports about Lovato's contract have already sparked comparisons to Britney Spears, who has been making headlines lately due to her ongoing conservatorship battle. The comparison is understandable, since Spears is one of the biggest pop icons of all time, and her $15 million deal with RCA Records is just one sign of her immense cultural influence.  But while Lovato might not be on the same financial level as Spears, she is a fiercely talented artist in her own right. As the recent release of "Dancing With the Devil... The Art of Starting Over" has demonstrated, Lovato is capable of crafting emotionally powerful music that resonates with audiences around the world. She has also been an advocate for mental health and body positivity, using her platform to raise awareness about these important issues.  In the end, it's refreshing to see an artist like Lovato be able to secure a major label contract despite the hardships she has faced. Hopefully, this deal will help her career continue to thrive and bring her music to an even wider audience in the years to come. While $1 million might not be as much as some other artists make, it's still a significant sum for an artist who has worked hard to overcome personal and professional challenges.
