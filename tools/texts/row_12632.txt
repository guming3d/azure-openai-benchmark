The incident is the latest in a spate of copycat attacks in which young women have been beaten and stripped in a humiliating punishment for attracting the wrong man's affection. Sometimes the attackers are the wives of the men and at other times jilted former girlfriends who have either spotted their rival by chance, or else laid in wait and ambushed her outside homes or work. Scroll down for video . The woman desperately tries to hold on to her top as one of her fierce attackers moves in to rip it away . And most shocking is the fact that passers-by in almost every case do absolutely nothing - apparently believing the punishment of a woman who has an affair is justified, even if the person accusing her is a rival.

At one point the young woman appears to give up trying to hold her tattered clothing and fights back, but has no chance against her three ruthless tormentors. Passers-by again refused to intervene after the three attackers shouted that the victim was a marriage breaker. They screamed that she deserved to be punished as they subjected to her to the ordeal, which lasted several minutes. At one point the victim, topless by this point, attempts to fight off her attackers but she is knocked back to the ground again after being overpowered and outnumbered . Locals on social media website Weibo, where the video was shared, have criticised the three women for their violent behaviour . But most of those who witnessed the event in daylight either ignored it or simply stood by and watched. One online commentator wrote: 'Who gives them the right to decide? 'For all we know the women attacking could be the mistress in the woman on the ground the wife!' The platform-wearing victim remains hunched on the floor as one her tormentors swings back a stiletto to land another kick .
