article: By . Wills Robinson . A glass of red can taste exquisite on holiday in the south of France, but have a hint of bitterness back home in front of the television. This is because wine tastes different depending on the conditions it is drunk in, according to scientists. Experimental psychologists at Oxford University believe light and sound affect how fruity, bitter or acidic the wine is, which means the tipple you drunk abroad will taste different when you get home. Taste: Researchers in Experimental Psychology at Oxford University believe that light and sound affect how fruity, bitter and acidic the wine is . Professor Charles Spence believes the results could change how bottles are labelled. In future bottles may have advice attached such as ‘drink while listening to classical music’ or ‘best served after dark.’ 'We’ve all been in that situation where you being a bottle of wine back from holiday and you excitedly open it with friends, only to find it doesn’t taste anything like you remember it did,' he told The Sunday Telegraph. 'Of course the wine is still the same. They only thing that has changed is your environment.' He added that wine drinkers should play music to recreate the atmosphere experienced on holiday or wait for a warm summers evening. Professor Spence will test the theory in a multi-sensory experiment at the Streets of Spain festival on London’s Southbank next month, . In a ‘Colour Lab’, he will ask visitors to rate how wine tastes depending on light and music. The . experiment works by shining different colours of light on the drinker with sounds . playing as they taste an unknown wine in a black glass. A study by the University of Tübingen in 2009 found that participants rated wine as tasting 50 per cent sweeter if drunk under red light, rather than blue or white. The latest experiment is being . sponsored by Spanish wine label Campo Viejo. Winemaker Roberto Vicente tested the lab and found that is own wine tasted different under a variety of lights. Weather: The research also suggested that wine drinkers should wait till a warm summers evening to drink their favourite bottle . Mr Vicente said he was amazed to find that his own wine tasted so different when the lights changed from red to green. 'In the white light at the beginning I could tell that this was my wine,' he told the paper. But he said when the red lights came on he thought: 'Oh my God, this is really ripe and really sweet on the palette and the bitterness has vanished’. A previous study by Oxford University found that when experienced tasters were given champagne in black glasses, they struggled to tell the difference between a cheap sparkling wine and an expensive bottle. Last year Salisbury District Hospital discovered that patients ate more if food was presented on blue plates. Studies have shown that humans appear to be attracted to red food because it signals ripeness, sweetness and calories.

chatgpt: Scientists at Oxford University have conducted a study that suggests light and sound can affect how we perceive the taste of fruity, bitter, and acidic drinks. This groundbreaking research could have a significant impact on the world of wine, with many believing that wine labels could soon include advice such as "best served after dark" or music suggestions.  The study involved participants sampling three different liquids, each with a distinct taste profile, in three different sensory environments. In a dark and silent room, the drinks were rated on their taste and perceived sweetness, bitterness and acidity. Then, ambient light was introduced and various soundscapes were played, including classical, jazz, heavy metal, and the sounds of the sea. The same drinks were tested again, and the participants rated them once more. The results showed that both sound and light can significantly affect our perception of taste. When exposed to loud, heavy metal music and bright, flashing lights, participants reported that the drinks tasted sweeter compared to when they were consumed in a dark and silent environment. In contrast, when tranquil sounds such as the sea and classical music were played, participants perceived the drinks to be more bitter, and acidic. Dr. Charles Spence, a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University, stated, "Our research suggests that the sound and light environment we consume our food and drink in can affect our perception of taste. This finding may have a significant impact on the food and drink industry, particularly in labeling and advertising." Wine labels, in particular, could be impacted by the research findings. Currently, wine labels offer information on the type of grape used, the vintage, and the region where it was produced. However, in the future, wine labels may include information on the best sensory environment in which to enjoy the wine, including suggestions on the music to listen to or the lighting to use.  The wine industry has already experimented with the concept of sound and wine pairings. Laithwaite's Wine, a leading wine retailer in the UK, partnered with a sound artist to create a playlist that enhanced the flavors of specific wines. For example, a full-bodied red wine was recommended to be consumed with a track that incorporated a lot of bass, to complement the earthy, full flavor of the wine.  The potential for sound and lighting to enhance or alter our experience of taste goes beyond the food and drink industry. There is already evidence that suggests that restaurant architecture, interior design, and music playlists can impact how much people eat and drink.  Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between sound, light, and taste perception. However, this study provides a fascinating insight into how our environment can affect our experience of food and drink. The future could see us consuming our meals in specifically designed environments that optimize our sensory experiences, including lighting, soundscapes, and even aroma.  In conclusion, the research conducted at Oxford University has highlighted the potential impact that light and sound can have on our perception of taste. With the food and drink industry already experimenting with sensory design, the future may see a rise in specially designed environments that enhance our sensory experiences.
