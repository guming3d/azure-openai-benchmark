Oz and students from the medical staff on the show ran to the accident, but by the time they arrived, paramedics were already on the scene assisting the injured tourist, according to Sullivan. A good Samaritan walking by was able to use his belt as a tourniquet until paramedics arrived, according to Sullivan. "David Justino, a plumber from New York, took action, removing his belt and using it as a tourniquet," Oz said in a Facebook post. "My prayers are with the victim for a speedy recovery." He posted a photo of himself and Justino on Facebook. Oz told CNN affiliate PIX11 that when he arrived, the belt had been tied to the woman's leg and he was just trying to tighten it to stop the bleeding.
