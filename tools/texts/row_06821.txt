article: (CNN) -- The show went on. One day after police say Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend and then himself, the team faced off against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, as scheduled. Immediately after the apparent murder-suicide, there had been some question as to whether the game would happen. It did, though a moment of silence was held before play got under way, and the mood at Arrowhead Stadium was somber. "I think they made the right decision to play the game because you got to continue on. Life goes on. It's a tough decision, but I think they made the right decision," said Mark Mendenhall, a long-time Chiefs fan. Mike Beisner, another fan, said he felt there wasn't really a right or wrong choice. "I think either way, the fans would have supported the decision. I think the league would have supported it," he said. The Chiefs beat the Panthers 27-21, a welcome boost to the struggling team's record, now 2-10. After the game, Chiefs Coach Romeo Crennel spoke to his players in the locker room, congratulating them on their win and for sticking together. "Really good, you overcame a lot. You stuck together as a team like we talked about -- helped each other," he said. "Family and friends, you relied on those people. You relied on your faith to help get you through this, and we got through it." "The win was a really good win," Crennel said. So far, police have said little about what happened Saturday. What is known, they say, is that linebacker Belcher, 25, killed his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, 22, before turning the gun on himself just outside the front door of the Chiefs' practice facility. He and Perkins left behind a 3-month-old daughter. Before Saturday, Belcher's name had never come up with police, nor had officers ever been called to the residence where the first shooting occurred. But later, they learned the football player and his late girlfriend "had been arguing," including "before the shooting occurred," said police spokesman Darin Snapp. Belcher, a 6-foot-2, 228-pound left-inside linebacker, spent all four of his NFL seasons with the Chiefs, who signed him as a free agent out of college. In all, he played in 59 games, including 44 starts. Belcher was from West Babylon, New York. He played for the University of Maine Black Bears, where he started in all 45 games of his four-year career. Asked about the apparent murder-suicide, Jo Brown, another Chiefs fan, described the situation simply as sad. "It's sad for that little baby," she said. In a separate weekend incident, an employee of the Cleveland Browns organization killed himself, authorities in Cleveland said. Eric Eucker was a member of the groundskeeping staff, "a good friend and colleague, and an outstanding employee," said team spokesman Neal Gulkis. NFL launches help line for current, former players .

chatgpt: Kansas City Chiefs coach Romeo Crennel congratulated his players on their victory over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, but also acknowledged that the team has "overcome a lot" in recent days. The shocking news of linebacker Jovan Belcher's murder-suicide left the entire organization reeling, and the team's players took the field just 24 hours after the tragic event. Before the game, a moment of silence was held for Belcher's girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, as well as victims of domestic violence everywhere. Police say that Belcher shot Perkins at their home in the early hours of Saturday morning, before driving to the Chiefs' facility and committing suicide in front of Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli. Belcher and Perkins shared a 3-month-old daughter, who is now left without parents. The shocking and senseless tragedy has left the NFL community stunned, and brought the issue of domestic violence into the spotlight once again. The Chiefs, who had lost eight of their previous nine games, came together in the wake of the tragedy and put together a solid performance against the Panthers. Quarterback Brady Quinn, who had not started a game since 2009, threw for 201 yards and two touchdowns, while running back Jamaal Charles rushed for 127 yards and a score. After the game, Crennel praised his team for their resilience in the face of adversity. "They showed they're human beings first, and football players second," he said. "They came together and they played for each other." Crennel also addressed the tragedy directly, expressing his sympathy for the families involved. "My prayers go out to the family of Kasandra Perkins," he said. "They lost a loved one, and that's always tough. And then Jovan, as a member of our family, we lost him too." The issue of domestic violence has been a problem in the NFL for years, with several high-profile cases in recent seasons. In 2007, Pro Bowl defensive back Adam "Pacman" Jones was suspended for the entire season after multiple run-ins with the law, including a shooting at a strip club that left one man paralyzed. More recently, former wide receiver Chad Johnson (formerly Chad Ochocinco) was arrested last year for allegedly head-butting his wife. The incident led to Johnson's release from the Miami Dolphins, and ultimately ended his NFL career. The Belcher tragedy has once again raised questions about the league's policies on domestic violence, and whether or not enough is being done to prevent these types of incidents. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement on the matter, calling it "an unimaginable tragedy" and pledging the league's support for the victims and their families. The Chiefs, meanwhile, are left to pick up the pieces and move on from the personal tragedy that has rocked their organization. "I'm proud of the way they handled everything," Crennel said of his players. "It's not easy to deal with something like this, but they showed their character and their heart today."
