article: Clever and high-achieving people are more jealous than their under-achieving peers, according to new research, and this is especially the case with women. A study from Roanoke College in Virginia found that the higher a student's grades, the more prone they were to feelings of romantic 'Facebook jealousy' - jealous feelings caused by Facebook posts made by, or sent to, their sexual partner. The researchers concluded that this was because high-achievers are perfectionists and when they think their partner is cheating on them, this desire for perfection is disrupted. U.S. researchers have discovered that intelligent people are more likely to suffer from 'Facebook jealousy' - jealous feelings caused by Facebook messages sent to their sexual partner. This is because high-achievers are perfectionists and any perceived infidelity makes them feel out of control . Facebook has begun rolling out its Graph Search to English-speaking users. Graph Search lets users find specific information about their friends. For example, users can search for friends in London who are vegetarians, friends of friends who like yoga or photos of friends or boyfriends from a certain month or year. The tool was launched in January to a select number of users and engineers. It is now being launched to everyone whose language is set to U.S. English. Participants in the study were asked to imagine different hypothetical Facebook scenarios. These included seeing ambiguous messages on their partner's Facebook from a person of the opposite sex, such as 'What are you up to later?' They were then asked how seeing those messages would make them feel. The researchers additionally tested whether jealousy levels increased when emoticons were used after the messages. These included smiley and winking faces. According to the results, women suffered from much higher levels of 'Facebook jealousy' than men. Adding a winking emoticon was found to have no effect on women's jealousy levels, while men became more jealous when an emoticon was used, compared to when no emoticon was present. The researchers then compared the results to each participants individual grade point average (GPA) score. According to the results, women suffered from much higher levels of 'Facebook jealousy' than men. But men became more jealous when messages were following by emoticons, such as winking faces . Those who showed higher levels of jealousy were also found to have higher GPAs. Study researcher Denise Friedman, an associate professor of psychology at Roanoke College in Salem, told Live Science: 'Students with higher GPAs are often more conscientious, show greater self-control and tend to be perfectionistic.' 'Perceived infidelity likely upsets their attempts at perfection across the board.' 'Evolutionary work suggests men are more jealous of sexual infidelity, while women are more jealous of emotional infidelity,' continued Friedman . 'The winking emoticon was most likely perceived as flirtatious, perhaps even sexually suggestive, which may explain why men were more jealous in this condition.' The full findings will be published this summer.

chatgpt: According to a recent study, the more intelligent someone is, the more likely they are to feel jealous about Facebook messages sent to their partner. This phenomenon, known as "Facebook jealousy," affects both men and women, but in different ways. The study found that women are more prone to jealousy than men when it comes to Facebook messages. Additionally, men are more likely to feel jealous when emoticons are used in messages. The study suggests that this difference may be due to women being more relational and emotional, and men being more visual and concrete. The researchers conclude that more intelligent people are more prone to Facebook jealousy because they are often perfectionists who strive for control in all areas of their lives. Facebook messages can make them feel out of control, triggering feelings of jealousy and insecurity. In the study, participants were asked to rate their feelings of jealousy and insecurity after reading a series of Facebook messages between their partner and a friend of the opposite sex. The participants also completed tests of intelligence and personality. Interestingly, the study found that intelligence was not related to overall levels of jealousy, but rather to the specific trigger of Facebook messages. This suggests that the relationship between intelligence and jealousy is complex and nuanced. The researchers suggest that understanding this relationship can help people better manage their feelings of jealousy and insecurity. For example, people who are prone to Facebook jealousy may benefit from limiting their exposure to Facebook messages or changing their mindset to view the messages as harmless. The study has important implications for our understanding of the intersection between technology and psychology. As social media continues to play an increasingly important role in our lives, it is important to understand how it can affect our emotions and well-being. Overall, the study suggests that more intelligent people may be particularly vulnerable to Facebook jealousy, but that there are ways to manage these feelings. By understanding the complex relationship between intelligence and jealousy, we can help people lead happier, healthier lives both online and offline.
