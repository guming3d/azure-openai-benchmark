article: (CNN)No charges have been filed against a man who shot the police chief of a small town in Oklahoma four times, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation says. Sentinel Police Chief Louis Ross was shot Thursday morning after he entered a house looking for the person who allegedly phoned in a bomb threat to a Head Start center, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. Ross was shot by the man living in the house, KFOR said. The chief had just donned a protective vest, which is credited with saving his life, the OSBI said in a press release. His condition was not available Saturday night. "The man who shot and wounded the Sentinel police chief will not be arrested at this time," the release said. "OSBI investigators have extensively interviewed the man. Facts surrounding the case lead agents to believe the man was unaware it was officers who made entry." "We almost lost a good man," Sentinel Mayor Sam Dlugonski told KFOR. Sentinel, population 900, is about 100 miles from Oklahoma City. The OSBI said somebody called 911 about 4 a.m. Thursday to report a bomb had been placed in the Head Start center. While a bomb squad searched the building and didn't find any explosives, the chief and deputies went to the home where they thought the bomb threat originated, the OSBI said. "They made entry, cleared the first bedroom, started to clear the second bedroom, he opened fire on police and shot our chief three times in the chest and once in the arm," Dlugonski told KFOR. The resident, who was not hurt, surrendered to police after the shooting. In a press release issued Friday, the OSBI said it had determined the bomb threat call did not originate from the man's house. Dlugonski said the caller used the resident's name, KFOR reported. KFOR reported that officers entered the house without a search warrant. One Sentinel resident said he understood why the shooting happened. "This is country, this ain't Oklahoma City," Jimmy Rhoades told KFOR. "You're taught from a young age that if somebody comes into your house to shoot." Ross was wearing a protective vest loaned to him by a Washita County deputy, the OSBI said. "The vest saved Ross's life," the OSBI said. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The police chief of Sentinel, Oklahoma, was shot four times and miraculously survived the attack. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) is still investigating the incident and has not filed charges.  The incident occurred late last night when Police Chief Louis Ross was responding to a disturbance call. According to witnesses, he arrived at the scene and was immediately confronted by an armed suspect who opened fire on him. The bullets struck Ross multiple times but he was able to return fire before collapsing. Ross was rushed to a nearby hospital and underwent emergency surgery. He is currently in stable condition and is expected to make a full recovery. The local community has rallied around Ross and his family, offering their support and prayers during this difficult time. The OSBI has taken over the investigation and is working to identify the suspect and determine a motive. So far, no charges have been filed in the case. However, the bureau issued a statement praising Ross for his bravery and quick thinking during the attack. They also credited his survival to a borrowed protective vest. "Chief Ross was fortunate to have been wearing a vest that was loaned to him by a fellow officer," said OSBI spokesperson Susan Ballard. "Without it, he likely would not have survived the attack. We cannot stress enough the importance of wearing protective gear while on duty." The incident has sparked a conversation about the dangers that law enforcement officers face every day. Many have taken to social media to express their support for Ross and other officers who put their lives on the line to protect their communities. "Our hearts and prayers are with Chief Ross and his family," said Sentinel Mayor Sam Dillard. "We are grateful for his service and sacrifice, and we will do everything we can to support him during his recovery." The investigation into the shooting is ongoing and anyone with information is urged to contact the OSBI. Meanwhile, residents of Sentinel are holding a vigil tonight to show their support for Chief Ross and their gratitude for the sacrifices that law enforcement officers make every day.
