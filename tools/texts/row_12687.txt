Bresnan may also have been able to pass on some local knowledge about the Bellerive Oval pitch, just as Flintoff was invited to do when England played at the Gabba - home of the all-rounder's Brisbane Heat side. But while Flintoff is well and truly part of England's past, Bresnan still harbours hopes of a recall. An experienced player in all three formats, Bresnan has fallen down the pecking order since undergoing surgery on an elbow injury. But with a packed 2015 schedule only just beginning, he will have been hopeful of making an impression on head coach Peter Moores, who has yet to select him since returning to the job. Andrew Flintoff joined the camp to pass on his experience to the younger members of the England team .

chatgpt: Former England all-rounder, Tim Bresnan, participated in fielding drills during his teamâ€™s training session on Thursday. The 29-year-old cricketer has been out of the national team since his last appearance at the World Twenty20 in March this year. Despite this setback, Bresnan remains hopeful of an England recall and is pushing himself to excel in every opportunity he gets. Bresnan was known as a valuable team player during his time with the national side, impressing with both bat and ball. However, injuries have hindered his performances in the recent years. He is currently playing County cricket for Yorkshire, where he has been performing consistently, picking up wickets and contributing with the bat. Speaking to the media after the training session, Bresnan expressed his gratitude to be a part of the team's preparations. He acknowledged his experience and hoped that it could be an advantage in his bid to regain his place in the national squad. Bresnan also expressed his confidence in his current form and hoped that his performances for Yorkshire would be enough to catch the selectors' attention. England currently has a well-rounded team, with a mix of seasoned veterans and talented youngsters. Bresnan's addition to the team would certainly add another level of experience and depth to the bowling attack. However, competition for places in the team is fierce, with many young players vying for a spot in the playing eleven. Despite the challenge ahead, Bresnan continues to remain driven and focused. He knows that a lot of hard work is required, but with his determination and skills, he remains hopeful of a return to the England squad. Cricket fans around the world would certainly love to see Bresnan in action again, breaking through the opposition's batting line-up with his exceptional bowling skills.
