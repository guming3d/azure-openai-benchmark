chatgpt: Norwich City Football Club's board of directors have taken responsibility for the club's relegation from the English Premier League in the 2020-21 season. The club, which finished at the bottom of the table, has now announced plans to name a new manager within a week in a bid to revive its fortunes. The Canaries' board has admitted that the club's poor performance on the field was due to a lack of effort and commitment from the players, as well as poor management decisions that were made throughout the season. In a statement released by the club, the board apologised to the fans and supporters for the club's relegation. "We are extremely sorry that we were unable to keep the club in the Premier League this season. We accept full responsibility for the team's poor performance on the field and acknowledge the need to take swift action to address the situation," the statement read. The statement also announced that the club was in the process of finalising a shortlist of candidates to be the new manager of the team.

We are committed to finding the right person who can take Norwich City back to the Premier League as soon as possible," the statement added. Several names have been linked with the role of the new manager, among them Malky Mackay and Gianfranco Zola.
