article: The iPhone may just put the 'I' in phone as a new study reveals that those who left their devices behind for even a few minutes felt a 'lessening of self.' A study from the University of Missouri called 'The Extended iSelf: The Impact of iPhone Separation on Cognition, Emotion, and Physiology,' found that being separated from the iPhone can lead to 'physiological anxiety' and 'poor cognitive performance.' The study published on Thursday in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication surveyed 40 iPhone using subjects from three different journalism courses. Scroll down for video . I miss my iPhone: The iPhone may just put the 'I' in phone as a new study reveals that those who left their devices behind for even a few minutes felt a 'lessening of self' The group was meant to be representative of students at a large university. CBS reports that during the first experiment members of the study were told to sit in a room and complete a puzzle while they still were in possession of their phone. They were then instructed to complete a second puzzle but were told that their phone was causing Bluetooth interference and would need to temporarily be confiscated. While subjects were completing the puzzle, the researchers called their phones and the subjects were able to hear it but did not know where it was nor were they allowed to answer it. During the study the researchers conducting the study took note of participant’s heart rate and blood pressure. A release published by the researchers said that when the subjects were separated from their phones their anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure increased and they were less able to complete the puzzle. Researchers wrote that people should avoid being separated from their technology at all costs, especially during an important task. 'iPhone users avoid parting with their phones during daily situations that involve a great deal of attention,' said the release. Russell Clayton who worked on the study said that  people in the study who were separated from their phones had debilitating separation anxiety. 'Our advice would be to carry your iPhone with you but to silence your phone during cognitively demanding tasks (i.e., work, meetings, exams, etc) in order to avoid any potential distractions that may reduce your attention throughout the day,' Clayton told The Huffington Post.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by the University of Missouri has revealed that separation from iPhones can have a significant impact on individuals' cognitive, emotional, and physiological responses. The study, titled 'The Extended iSelf: The Impact of iPhone Separation on Cognition, Emotion, and Physiology,' aimed to investigate the consequences of being separated from a widely-used mobile device for an extended period of time. Forty subjects were recruited for the study and were initially scheduled to complete two separate puzzles consecutively. During the second puzzle, however, participants were asked to hand over their iPhones, which were then confiscated. The researchers then monitored the participants' physiological responses while they completed the second puzzle. The results of the study were striking. Participants' self-reported anxiety levels were found to increase significantly when their iPhones were confiscated, suggesting that individuals experience an elevated level of distress when separated from their devices. Moreover, their cognitive performance was found to decline when separated from their iPhones, with participants performing worse on the second puzzle than they had on the first. The study highlights the potential negative impacts of over-reliance on mobile devices such as the iPhone. According to Dr. Russel Clayton, one of the authors of the study, "Our findings suggest that iPhone users' cognitive performance may be impacted when they are separated from the device even for a short period of time. Additionally, participants also reported higher levels of anxiety and a decrease in physiological responses." These results come as no surprise, given the widespread popularity and usage of mobile devices in modern society. The iPhone, in particular, has become an integral part of daily life for millions of people around the world. From communication to entertainment, the device serves a multitude of purposes and has become an extension of many individuals' identities. Furthermore, the study suggests that mobile phone addiction is a real phenomenon that warrants further investigation. With the increasing dependence on mobile devices, concerns are arising about individuals' abilities to manage their usage in a healthy and balanced way. The study adds to the growing body of literature on this topic and highlights the need for continued research in this area. In conclusion, the University of Missouri's study sheds light on the impact of iPhone separation on individuals' cognitive, emotional, and physiological functions. The findings indicate that separation from an iPhone can lead to elevated levels of anxiety and decreased cognitive performance. The research highlights the need for further investigation into mobile phone addiction and the potential negative consequences associated with excessive usage.
