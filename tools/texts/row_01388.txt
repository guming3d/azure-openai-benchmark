article: (CNN) -- The Brazilian National Council of Justice, which oversees the nation's judiciary, passed a resolution Tuesday that denies notaries the right to refuse to perform same-sex marriages. In Brazil, notaries officiate marriages and civil unions. Recently, 12 Brazilian states began allowing same-sex couples to marry or convert their civil unions into marriages. However, since the Supreme Court does not carry legislative powers, it was up to each notary to officiate at their discretion, and many refused, citing the lack of law. Same sex marriage: Who will legalize next? Joaquim Barbosa, president of the Council of Justice, said in the decision that notaries cannot continue to refuse to "perform a civil wedding or the conversion of a stable civil union into a marriage between persons of the same sex." Barbosa, who also presides over the Supreme Court, says the resolution merely follows the transformation of society. "Our society goes through many changes, and the National Council of Justice cannot be indifferent to them," he said. Civil unions between same-sex couples have been recognized in Brazil since 2011, after the Supreme Court ruled that the same rights and rules that apply to "stable unions" of heterosexual couples would apply to same-sex couples, including the right to joint declaration of income tax, pension, inheritance and property sharing. People in same-sex unions are also allowed to extend health benefits to their partners, following the same rules applied to heterosexual couples. Brazilian lawmakers have debated same-sex marriage, but in most cases, the bills introduced have not progressed through Congress. Brazilian neighbors Uruguay and Argentina are the only other two countries in Latin America that have laws allowing same-sex couples to marry.

chatgpt: Brazil's Council of Justice has issued a resolution that requires notaries to officiate same-sex marriages and civil unions. This comes after years of notaries refusing to perform such ceremonies, citing a lack of legal framework. Now, with the new resolution in place, Brazil's LGBTQ+ community can enjoy greater legal protections and rights. Notaries in Brazil have long been responsible for conducting marriages and civil unions, and until recently, they have been able to refuse to perform such ceremonies. This has been a source of frustration for many, particularly LGBTQ+ couples who have faced discrimination and a lack of legal protections. But now, with the new resolution, notaries must conduct the ceremonies regardless of the sexual orientation of the couple. The resolution was welcomed by many LGBTQ+ advocates and rights groups. Council of Justice President, Justice Humberto Martins, said that the resolution reflects changes in society and is a positive move towards greater equality and respect for human rights in Brazil. He added that the resolution is a step forward in the fight against discrimination and inequality. Brazil is one of the most populous and culturally diverse countries in the world. And, while there have been positive developments in recent years for LGBTQ+ rights, discrimination continues to be a problem. But with this new resolution, the country is taking an important step towards greater inclusivity. The resolution is expected to have a significant impact on the lives of LGBTQ+ people in Brazil. It will provide them with legal protections and rights that were previously denied to them. And, with the support of the Council of Justice, it is clear that Brazil is moving in the right direction when it comes to respecting the rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation.
