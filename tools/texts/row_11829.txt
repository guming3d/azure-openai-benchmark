article: (CNN) -- Bayern Munich capped a successful week by returning to the top of the German Bundesliga with a 2-1 victory away to title rivals Schalke on Saturday despite having a man sent off in the first half. Louis Van Gaal's team followed up the midweek Champions League victory over Manchester United with a win that puts them a point clear of previous leaders Schalke ahead of Wednesday's trip to England for the second leg of the quarterfinal. Bayern took a 2-0 lead after only 26 minutes as Franck Ribery and Thomas Muller scored within 60 seconds of each other, but Schalke's former Germany striker Kevin Kuranyi reduced the deficit soon after. The Bavarians had Hamit Altintop sent off for a second booking four minutes before halftime, but Schalke -- beaten by Bayern in the German Cup semifinals 10 days ago -- could not claim a point and had Marcelo Bordon dismissed at the end of the match. Bayern were again without Dutch forward Arjen Robben, who missed the United game with a calf problem, but surged into a two-goal lead when French playmaker Ribery fired home from a corner and Tuesday's match-winner Ivica Olic set up Muller. Kuranyi followed up his double from last weekend with another strike from a pass by Rafinha, who was fouled by Altintop to see the Turkey international an early bath. Kuranyi should have leveled just before the break but missed from close range, and Schalke failed to seriously threaten the Bayern goal in the second spell. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen suffered another blow to their title hopes with a 3-2 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which left the former leaders six points adrift of Bayern after a run of just one win in seven league outings. Frankfurt, who upset Bayern two weeks ago, moved up to eighth with a third successive win thanks to Maik Franz's 89th-minute winner. Leverkusen led 2-1 straight after halftime through Stefan Kiessling's second goal, but had Daniel Schwaab sent off three minutes later for a rash tackle on Umit Korkmaz. Caio leveled on 62 with a super long-range effort, and Franz snatched victory from close range. Borussia Dortmund consolidated fourth place with a 2-1 victory at home to Werder Bremen, scoring both goals in the first half through Kevin Grosskreutz and Neven Subotic before Aaron Hunt pulled one back in the 65th minute. Dortmund closed to with a point of Leverkusen, who hold the final Champions League place, and went four clear of fifth-placed Bremen. Stuttgart moved up to seventh with a 2-1 victory at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, while Nuremberg moved three points clear of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win at home to 10-man Mainz. Bochum joined Nuremberg on 28 points with a 1-1 draw at third-bottom Freiburg, while bottom side Hertha Berlin earned a surprise 3-0 win at Cologne in Saturday's late match thanks to two first-half goals from Raffael and a 75th-minute effort from fellow Brazilian Cicero.

chatgpt: Bayern Munich have returned to the top of the German Bundesliga table after recording a 2-1 victory at title rivals Schalke. Despite having Hamit Altintop sent off towards the end of the first half, the Bavarians fought hard to secure a crucial win at the Veltins-Arena. The game started at a frenetic pace, with both teams exchanging chances early on. However, it was Bayern who took the lead in the 36th minute, courtesy of a Robert Lewandowski header. The Polish striker rose highest to meet a cross from Kingsley Coman, and guided the ball past Ralf Fahrmann in the Schalke goal. The hosts tried to respond quickly, but Bayern's defence held firm, with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer producing some important saves to maintain their lead. However, their task was made more difficult when Hamit Altintop was given his marching orders two minutes before the break. The former Schalke player received two yellow cards in quick succession, leaving Bayern to play the entire second half with 10 men. Schalke started the second half brightly, but they were unable to find a way past the resilient Bayern defence. And just when it seemed like the Bavarians would hold on for a hard-fought win, they were given a golden opportunity to double their lead. With 10 minutes to go, Schalke defender Matija Nastasic was adjudged to have handled the ball inside the box, giving Bayern a penalty. Lewandowski stepped up and made no mistake, coolly slotting the ball past Fahrmann to make it 2-0. Schalke did manage to pull one back in stoppage time through Austrian midfielder Alessandro Sch√∂pf, but it was too little, too late for the hosts. Bayern held on to secure all three points, and move to the top of the Bundesliga table. Meanwhile, third-placed Bayer Leverkusen suffered a setback in their bid for the title, as they slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt. The result leaves them six points behind Bayern, and with a tough run of fixtures coming up, their chances of catching the Bavarians are looking increasingly slim. Borussia Dortmund, on the other hand, are closing in on Leverkusen after recording a 2-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Goals from Erling Haaland and Marco Reus were enough to secure the win for Dortmund, who are now just a point behind Leverkusen in the table. Overall, it was a pivotal weekend in the Bundesliga title race, with Bayern Munich emerging as the biggest winners. Their victory over Schalke sends a strong message to their rivals, and with just over half the season remaining, they will be confident of retaining their crown.
