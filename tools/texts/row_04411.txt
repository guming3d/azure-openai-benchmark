But for diver Tony Neal there’s one inspiring picture that has well and truly got under his skin. The underwater photographer so liked an image taken of him swimming over a wreck that he endured more than 30 hours of extreme agony to have the image recreated in stunning detail on his back. The picture, taken by fellow underwater photographer Alex Mustard, shows Mr Neal hovering above the sunken Royal Navy submarine  HMS E49 during a trip to the Shetlands in 2011. The E49 sank after hitting a mine in March 1917. There were no survivors. Underwater photographer Tony Neal was photographed by Alex Mustard above the wreck of the submarine E49 during a trip to the Shetlands in 2011. Tony has spent two years having the image recreated as a tattoo by artist Kirsty Peake, spending around 30 hours under the needle as the ink was added . Diver: Tony Neal (pictured) wanted the tattoo as a reminder of the dive and as a tribute to his father, John . Mr Neal, from Northampton, had the scene recreated in amazing detail by tattoo artist Kirsty Peake and ‘framed’ in an outline of an  oxygen tank. It took Kirsty several sessions spread over two years to complete the amazing blue and green tattoo. Mr Neal wanted it both to remember the dive and as a memorial to his dying father John, a former police officer. He said: ‘My dad had just found out he had cancer when I was about to go diving in the Shetlands, but he insisted I continue. When he saw Alex’s beautiful photograph of me in a diving magazine, his whole face lit up. Sadly he died last Christmas, aged 63, but the tattoo will always remind me of him.’ Mr Neal admitted the process had been ‘excruciatingly painful’. The blue ink was inserted into his skin with a ‘magnum’  tattoo needle – 49 points bunched together. He added: ‘I am glad to have done it, but I have no plans to have another one.’

chatgpt: In dedication to his father, Tony Neal got a tattoo of a significant image that holds a special memory for both of them. The tattoo is a replica of a picture taken when Mr. Neal swam over a wreck near the Shetlands. As a lover of tattoos, Mr. Neal resolved to have the design tattooed on his back, as a permanent reminder of the pleasant memories he shared with his father. Mr. Neal, who is originally from the Shetlands, fought through 30 solid hours of excruciating pain, laying still while the artist perfected the design. The tattoo, which is a replica of the wreck picture, was designed carefully to the last intricate detail. It was composed using different shades of black ink to simulate the feeling of being underwater, giving the tattoo a realistic look. Describing the process, Mr. Neal said that he desired to immortalize the memory of his father in a way that would make it almost as though he were still present. "I wanted something I would look at every day and feel like he was with me, even though he is not around anymore." He went further to say, "It was difficult, but worth it at the end, I love it so much because my father also loved tattoos. He always wanted to get one, but never did." While tattoos are a common sight these days, the story of Mr. Neal's tattoos brings to light the significance of tattoos as a way of keeping memories and cherished moments alive. It goes beyond artistic creativity, and in some cases, it serves as a way of anchoring remembrances to the wearer. The cost of tattooing can range from affordable to expensive, depending on the image's size and complexity. However, for Mr. Neal, the cost was not a barrier; having his father's memory with him forever was worth every penny spent. Tattoo artists are artists in their right, as perfecting a client's design takes time and dedication. Despite being a painful process, tattoo enthusiasts like Mr. Neal are continually sacrificing hours to perfect their desired designs. In conclusion, Mr. Neal's act of tattooing a replica of a picture in memory of his father is not only an act of love but a reminder of how we share memories with loved ones even beyond their presence. The tattoo will serve not just as an artwork on his back but as a way of preserving the memory of his father.
