article: (CNN)Kevin Kane's love affair with Ireland began in 2000, when he and his then-fiancee piggybacked on a trip with his brothers and their wives. The 39-year-old financial adviser from Havertown, Pennsylvania, has been back six times since, taking his now wife, brothers and mother on various trips that spanned nearly every county in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ahead of St. Patrick's Day, Kane and other CNN readers shared their best memories and photos from mesmerizing visits to the Emerald Isle. The green and rugged Dingle Peninsula, in the southwest of Ireland, is Kane's favorite destination, he wrote, though "the Glens of Antrim are spectacular in November, the Ring of Kerry cannot be described adequately by James Joyce himself on a clear day in June, and the vibrancy of Galway and Westport are enough to recharge the soul as you wander joyfully from Tobercurry to Ennis." Kane offered a few tips for the first-time visitor: . Don't be overly ambitious on your first trip. "Pick a few towns to stay in and do several days in each. One-hundred miles between towns is not a two-hour drive as you might expect. If there are no major motorways, it could easily become a harrowing four-hour trip for the novice European driver." Talk to the locals in pubs. "Ask questions, don't fake a brogue, and listen to the suggestions they are sure to make about what to see in that immediate area. The Irish are fiercely parochial and love to show off their town's hidden secrets to tourists." Do something off the beaten path. "Take a ferry out to an island to walk around a bit, find an Abbey ruin in a field to explore, take a flask of Jameson and hike up a mountain. Get lost in what Ireland is, and has to offer." In summary, Kane said: "Keep your itinerary reasonable, soak up every minute you are there, and make notes for your next trip, for you will surely be returning. It's that kind of place." 29 beach photos that will make you drool . 11 ways to make the most of Hawaii . What are your Ireland travel tips?

chatgpt: CNN readers have shared their favorite views of Ireland, providing valuable insight for travelers planning their next venture to the land of leprechauns and rolling green hills. The Ring of Kerry, the Dingle Peninsula, and the Northern coast have emerged as the top destinations not to be missed. The Ring of Kerry is a 179 km route that takes visitors on a journey through picturesque landscapes, breathtaking mountains, and rugged coastlines. It is an essential attraction that captures the true essence of Ireland's natural beauty. Along the route, visitors can explore the charming villages, ancient ruins, and traditional pubs. One CNN reader recommended driving the route in a counter-clockwise direction, starting from Killarney to avoid getting stuck behind tour buses. The Dingle Peninsula is another must-see destination steeped in history and rugged beauty. The area boasts unspoiled beaches, rugged cliffs, and verdant countryside. CNN readers recommended taking a boat tour to explore the coastline or hiking the trails of the peninsula. They also recommended visiting the town of Dingle, famous for its music, seafood, and lively pubs. Another favorite location is the Northern coast, with its vast landscapes, impressive cliffs, and stunning beaches. The Giant's Causeway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the region's notable attractions. The hexagonal rock formations are a wonder of the natural world and a testament to Ireland's geological history. Visitors should also make sure to visit Dunluce Castle, which sits atop a dramatic cliff edge overlooking the sea. "Make notes for your next trip -- you will surely be returning," said Kevin Kane, summing up the experiences of many CNN readers. With so much to see and do in Ireland, it's no wonder that visitors often find themselves returning time and time again. From exploring ancient ruins to indulging in traditional cuisine, Ireland has something to offer everyone. Travelers should note that visiting in the shoulder season (between March and May or September and November) can offer a more relaxed experience, with fewer crowds and better weather. In conclusion, Ireland is a gem of a destination, and CNN readers have spoken. The Ring of Kerry, Dingle Peninsula, and Northern coast are three of the top locations not to be missed. Taking a drive along the Ring of Kerry, exploring the rugged beauty of the Dingle Peninsula, and experiencing the epic landscape of the Northern coast will leave any traveler wanting to return time and time again.
