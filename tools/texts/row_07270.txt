article: The study also found that 88 per cent of billionaires graduated from college - but dropping out of Harvard didn't stop Mark Zuckerberg making his fortune . The success of billionaires may be down to more than just hard work and good luck - they may also be smarter than most, according to a study. About 45 per cent of billionaires are in the top one per cent for brainpower, says Jonathan Wai of Duke University. He says that the top one per cent of wealthy people and the top one per cent for brainpower strongly overlap, reports CNBC. That ranks them as smarter than US senators and federal judges, of whom 41 per cent are in the top one per cent for cognitive ability, and Fortune 500 CEOS at 38.6 per cent. Only 21 per cent of the US House of Representatives were considered to be that smart. However, the study only judges brainpower by whether someone attended one of 29 elite - and often expensive - American colleges, using the colleges' admissions criteria of high academic grades to decide if someone is intelligent. The study found that 88 per cent of billionaires graduated from college, though a lack of degree did not get in the way of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg making his billions after dropping out of Harvard. Among members of the Forbes 400 list of America's wealthiest people, Charles and David Koch, co-owners of Koch industries, took degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while investor Warren Buffett graduated from UPenn and Columbia.

New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has degrees from Johns Hopkins University and Harvard while Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page met as PhD students at Stanford. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer went to Harvard while his boss Bill Gates dropped out of the same university, and Amazon found Jeff Bezo attended Princeton. Those who made their fortunes through investments or technology were more likely to be in the top one per cent for brainpower than those who did from fashion and retail or food and drink. Some 69 per cent of investment billionaires and 63 per cent of technology magnates are represented in the top one per cent, while only a quarter of fashion earners and 23 per cent of food and drink billionaires make the grade.

chatgpt: A new study from Duke University has found that a staggering 45 per cent of billionaires are in the top one per cent for cognitive ability. The research examined the wealth and cognitive function of nearly 2,500 individuals with a net worth of more than $1 billion in seven countries. The study found that cognitive ability is a significant factor in achieving billionaire status, with the wealthiest individuals exhibiting high levels of critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. This is a clear indication that cognitive ability plays a critical role in the accumulation of wealth. Additionally, the Duke University study found that cognitive ability is more significant for billion-dollar success than inherited wealth or early childhood advantages. These findings contradict a common perception that the most significant drivers of success are either family connections or upbringing. The study also identified that males were overrepresented among billionaires, making up more than 80 per cent of those surveyed. While cognitive ability is critical for both male and female billionaires, the disparity in gender representation suggests that there may be additional societal factors that affect women's ability to achieve billionaire status. Professor Jonathan Wai, one of the study's authors, said that the results indicate the importance of cognitive abilities in communication skills and innovation, critical skills in today's knowledge-based economy. He added that this knowledge could help policymakers better understand how to foster innovation and wealth creation in the population. The study has its limitations, however. The sample size was relatively small, with only around 2,500 individuals surveyed. Additionally, the research only examined seven countries, all of which are developed Western economies. It is unclear how these findings would apply to other regions, such as developing economies. Despite these limitations, the Duke University study offers a unique insight into the relationship between cognitive ability and wealth creation. The research highlights the importance of cognitive function in the accumulation of wealth and certainly raises questions concerning the role of education and training in fostering cognitive skills necessary for success in the modern economy. In conclusion, the Duke University study has found that cognitive ability is a significant factor in achieving billionaire status, with 45 per cent of billionaires found to be in the top one per cent for cognitive ability. While the research is limited, these findings indicate the importance of cognitive abilities in innovation, decision-making, and problem-solving for wealth creation. Policymakers may benefit from these findings in formulating policies that foster innovation and wealth creation in the population.
