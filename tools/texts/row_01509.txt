article: LONDON, England -- Football will pay its tribute to the legend of Manchester United's Busby Babes on Wednesday in moments of remembrance on the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. A memorial stone recalls the place of the Munich air disaster in Kirchtrudering near Munich. Eight players lost their lives on February 6, 1958, when Flight 609 ZU crashed on the third attempt to take off after re-fuelling in Germany as United returned from knocking Red Star Belgrade out of the European Cup. Sir Matt Busby's side, back-to-back English champions and well positioned for a hat-trick attempt, were arguably on course to become the best United team. The United players killed at Munich were Geoff Bent, aged 25, Roger Byrne(28), Eddie Colman (21),  Mark Jones (24), David Pegg (22), Tommy Taylor (26), Liam Whelan (22) and 21-year-old Duncan Edwards who died in hospital 15 days after the crash. They and the other 15 people who lost their lives will be remembered with a commemorative service at Old Trafford while a short ceremony, organised by supporters, will also take place at the memorial site in Kirchtrudering, on the outskirts of Munich. In keeping with tradition, United supporters will also gather under the memorial plaque at Old Trafford where the clock is fixed at the exact time of the final fateful take-off attempt. Later in the day, a minute's silence will take place ahead of England's friendly with Switzerland at Wembley as a further mark of respect. As he bows his head during this week's Munich commemorations, survivor  Harry Gregg's mind will understandably flash back to that snow-laden runway, but only briefly. The 75-year-old Ulsterman prefers not to remember the afternoon he lost so many friends among the victims, but instead the days when the dream of the 'Busby babes' was still vibrant and alive. Goalkeeper Gregg, hailed a hero in the wake of the crash after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors, is adamant those are the times which always burn brightest in his memory. "I was part of something that was a very, very beautiful thing at that time," said Gregg, who cost United a record 23,000 pounds sterling when he joined from Doncaster Rovers two months before the disaster. "I'll always be proud of that. The fact there's going to be a minute's silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people I played with, but one must remember as well there were other people on board that aircraft, a lot more people. "I want the minute's silence to be over and then I want to remember the happy times, that's what I want the world to remember, that's what I want the families to remember." E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: Football Pays Tribute on 50th Anniversary of Munich Air Disaster Today marks the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, a tragedy that will never be forgotten in the world of football. On this day in 1958, a plane carrying the Manchester United football team crashed on take-off after refuelling in Munich. A total of 23 people onboard were killed, including eight members of the United team. The team was returning from a European Cup tie in Belgrade, having reached the semi-finals of the competition. The plane had stopped in Munich to refuel and take on food supplies, but bad weather conditions made it difficult for the plane to take off. As the aircraft attempted to take off, it failed to gain enough speed and crashed into a nearby house. The impact was so severe, it caused the plane to break into two pieces. Many of those onboard were badly injured, and eight members of the Manchester United team died as a result of the accident. The tragedy sent shock waves through the world of football and beyond, with tributes pouring in from across the globe. The football world paid their respects to those who lost their lives in the accident. Many teams and clubs held a minute's silence in honour of the team and their families. Across Manchester, United supporters paid tribute to their fallen heroes. A memorial service was held at Old Trafford to mark the occasion, with players from different eras attending to pay their respects. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who was a player at the time of the disaster, said, "The Munich air disaster was one of the darkest days in the history of football. We will never forget the legacy of those who were lost on that day, and they will always be remembered as heroes of our great club." The legacy of the Munich air disaster still lives on today, with the team and its supporters continuing to commemorate those who lost their lives. The team and club staff who survived the accident worked tirelessly to rebuild the team in the aftermath of the tragedy, and the team eventually went on to win the European Cup a decade later. Fifty years on, the football world is once again paying tribute to those who lost their lives in the Munich air disaster. The world of football will never forget the tragedy that occurred on that fateful day, and we will always remember the legacy of those who gave their lives for the beautiful game.
