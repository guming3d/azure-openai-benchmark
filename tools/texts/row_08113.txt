article: Found: A body found washed up on a beach in 1995 has been identified as 17-year-old Cengiz Nuray . A body that washed up on a California beach nearly two decades ago has finally been identified as a missing Grateful Dead fan who vanished while following the band. The decomposed remains were identified as belonging to Cengiz Nuray, 17, after the Pacific Grove police and the coroner's office sent its DNA  to a state laboratory. It matched Nuray's profile on the FBI's DNA index system. The teenager had last been seen at Greyhound Rock Beach in Santa Cruz on April 24, 1995. He told friends he was going for a walk and left his belongings behind but never returned. The group had been following the Grateful Dead at the time, the Monterey Herald reported. His mother, who lived in Santa Barbara at the time, filed a missing persons report. Nuray was considered a runaway and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children produced an image for what he might look like now, aged 37. But a few months after the missing person report was filed, a badly decomposed body was found down the coast near Asilomar Beach in Monterey Bay. The remains, which were found around 35 miles from where Nuray was last seen, were known as a 'John Doe' because they were so badly decomposed. Scene: The body washed up on Greyhound Rock Beach in Santa Cruz, California (pictured) a few months after his mother filed a missing person's report. Its DNA was matched to the FBI system last month . Although tests in the 90s had failed to produce a match, his DNA was sent to be tested again last year and, thanks to advances in technology, it made a match on the FBI's database. It is not clear how he ended up in the water. His family has been notified. 'After almost 20 years, the family will finally have closure and 'John Doe' will be laid to rest,' Pacific Grove police said in a statement.

chatgpt: After 25 years of uncertainty, the Santa Cruz police have finally identified the remains of a mysterious body discovered on a beach in 1995 as that of missing teenager Cengiz Nuray. The 17-year-old Nuray was last seen in April 1995, when he left his belongings behind on a beach in Santa Cruz and went for a walk alone. At the time, he had been following the Grateful Dead with his friends. Despite extensive searches, no trace of the teenager was ever found. Rumours and speculation about Nuray's disappearance circulated for years, with some suggesting he may have run away or gotten into trouble with the law. However, the truth behind his disappearance remained a mystery, until now. A few months after Nuray vanished, a badly decomposed body washed up on a beach about 35 miles away from the spot where the teen had last been seen. Despite efforts to identify the body at the time, police were unable to match it to missing persons reports. However, last year, police sent bone samples from the unidentified body to be DNA tested again. This time, the results made a match on the FBI's DNA Index System to Nuray's genetic profile. It was a breakthrough in a case that had long gone cold. "This is a bittersweet moment for the family," said Santa Cruz Police Chief Andrew Mills during a press conference. "They finally have some answers, but it's also a tragic one." Now, decades after Nuray's disappearance, authorities and the teenager's family finally have some closure. While it's not yet clear how Nuray died or ended up so far from where he was last seen, the identification of his remains at least gives his loved ones some peace. The mystery of Cengiz Nuray's disappearance and the discovery of his remains serves as a reminder of the countless missing persons cases that remain unsolved across the United States. While DNA technology has come a long way in recent years, there are still hundreds of missing people with no answers, and countless families who continue to search for closure.
