article: By . Associated Press . Jan Harding (left) nearly died after ingesting a lye-laced iced tea earlier this month. However, she made a miraculous recovery and was released from the hospital on Saturday . A Utah woman who nearly died after unknowingly drinking iced tea mixed with chemicals has been released from a Salt Lake City hospital. Jan Harding, 67, was released Saturday morning, University of Utah Health Care spokeswoman Marissa Villasenor said Sunday. Harding is now recovering at home after making progress during the last week that is 'nothing short of miraculous,' family attorney Paxton Guymon said in an email Sunday. Harding must still undergo tests and procedures to determine any long-term complications, Guymon said. 'The family sincerely appreciates all of the support and prayers from everyone who has followed her story,' he said. Harding has been slowly improving since August 10, when she drank a single sip of sweetened iced tea at Dickey's Barbecue in South Jordan, a Salt Lake City suburb. An industrial cleaning solution mixed into the tea caused deep, ulcerated burns in Harding's esophagus. On Thursday, her husband, Jim Harding, told reporters that his wife has had nightmares about the moment that made her say, 'I think I drank acid.' Jim Harding, 66, said he's focused on his wife's recovery and not criminal charges or lawsuits. Salt Lake County prosecutors are reviewing a police investigation and have not announced if charges will be filed. Authorities have said a restaurant employee unintentionally put the heavy-duty cleaner lye in a sugar bag, and another worker mistakenly mixed it into the iced tea dispenser. Lye, which looks like sugar, is an odorless chemical used for degreasing deep fryers. Harding's husband Jim spoke at a press conference last week, to give an update about his wife's condition .

Jan Harding was the first one to drink from the chemically laced batch of tea, and no one else was harmed. The Dallas-based Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants Inc. has said the incident was isolated and unprecedented in the chain's 73-year history. After investigating, Guyman said last week that had discovered another lye incident at the South Jordan restaurant in July. An employee at the South Jordan restaurant burned herself when she stuck her finger in a sugar container and licked it to test for the chemical cleaner, he said. The employee's tongue began bleeding and blistering. She quit on August 9, the day before Harding was burned, Guymon said. Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants has not commented on the new allegations.

The woman, Jan Harding, had ordered iced tea at the restaurant, which contained a de-greaser chemical known as lye, instead of sugar. It was discovered that the deep-fryer cleaner was stored in a sugar container that had a similar texture, leading to the mistake. When Harding took a sip of the iced tea, she immediately felt a burning sensation in her throat and mouth. Harding was rushed to the hospital and was in critical condition for some time. She suffered severe burns in her throat and had to undergo surgery to repair the damage caused by the chemical. However, after a few days of treatment and care, Harding was able to make an amazing recovery. The woman was discharged from the hospital on Saturday, and her family expressed relief and gratitude for the support they received during the ordeal. They thanked the doctors and nurses who treated Harding, and also expressed their disappointment in the restaurant's management for their negligence.
