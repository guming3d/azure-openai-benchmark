Father-of-two Marc Osborn, from Sydney, now faces dismissal from the New South Wales Police force after being found guilty of three counts of 'filming a private act for sexual gratification' this week. The court in Sydney heard Osborn had bought a clock with a hidden camera on eBay and recorded the women without their knowledge. He then showed the films to his colleagues at the police station. Osborn, 42, who has admitted filming himself having sex with three women, told the court that he only showed the videos to colleagues to prove 'the old man's still got it', Australia's Daily Telegraph reported. The most explicit parts of the videos were downloaded onto his iPad and his phone and in one he could be seen winking to the camera. The woman who testified against him said she trusted him because he was a police officer.

chatgpt: New South Wales Police officer, Marc Osborn, could face dismissal following an internal inquiry found him guilty of three counts of 'filming a private act for sexual gratification'. The officer was also accused of dating up to 33 women at the same time and having sex with a woman while on duty. The internal inquiry, which lasted for several months, revealed that Osborn had engaged in inappropriate behavior while on duty as a police officer. It was discovered that he had engaged in sexual activity with a woman while on duty, which is a clear violation of the code of conduct for police officers. Additionally, the inquiry found that Osborn had filmed private acts for his own sexual gratification, which is a criminal offense under Australian law. The officer's actions were discovered after a woman came forward and reported him to the police. During the inquiry, it was also revealed that Osborn had dated up to 33 women at the same time, which is a clear abuse of power and inappropriate behavior for a police officer. The officer used his position of authority to manipulate and control the women he was involved with, which is unacceptable for anyone working in law enforcement. The police service has stated that they take these allegations very seriously and are committed to upholding high standards of behavior for their officers. They have emphasized that officers who break the law or engage in inappropriate behavior will be held accountable for their actions. In response to the findings of the inquiry, Osborn has been suspended from duty and will face a disciplinary panel to determine his fate. The panel will decide whether he should be dismissed from the police service or whether he can be reinstated with conditions. The case has sparked outrage among many women's rights groups, who have called for a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior in the workplace. They have urged the police service to take action to ensure that officers are held accountable for their actions and that women who are affected by their behavior receive appropriate support. The case serves as a reminder that those who are entrusted with power and authority must use it responsibly and with respect for others. The actions of Marc Osborn have damaged the reputation of the police service and have caused harm to those who have been affected by his behavior. It is now up to the disciplinary panel to ensure that justice is served and that the appropriate action is taken.
