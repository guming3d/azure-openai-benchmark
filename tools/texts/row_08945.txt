AS and Marca both splashed on Real Madrid all but giving up the La Liga title against Valladolid . Variation on a theme! Both Mundo Deportivo and Sport covered the development but with a Barca angle . And that, argue AS, is an unbridgeable gap. 'Adios Liga' reads their splash headline, while they claim Valladolid were able to get back into the game thanks to the exhaustion of Real. Marca simply went with 'Madrid derails, leaving the league to Atletico or Barcelona.' 'I'm upset with the team,' Xabi Alonso said afterwards. 'They are moments that can not be repeated.' Mundo Deportivo points out that the title is now incredibly in Barca's hands. Winners! L'Equipe had Paris Saint-Germain as Ligue 1 champions as their main story on Thursday while Juventus' transfer targets Alexis Sanchez and Nani were hot topics of discussion in Tuttosport . There is some good news for Ancelotti, though. Ronaldo was taken off purely as a precaution and should be fit for the Champions League final in Lisbon later this month. Over in France, Paris Saint-Germain were once again crowned Ligue 1 - even after losing against Rennes, while new Clermont Foot manager Helena Costa is handed a big blurb.

chatgpt: It's a tough time to be a fan of Real Madrid as Spanish newspapers are declaring that their chances of winning La Liga are over. With just six games to go, they are currently third in the table, four points behind second-placed Atletico Madrid and a staggering 16 points behind their arch-rivals Barcelona. Despite having a game in hand, it seems highly unlikely that they will be able to close the gap and take the title. This will come as a major blow to the club and their supporters, who had high hopes at the start of the season. Despite the best efforts of Cristiano Ronaldo and others, they have struggled to maintain the consistency required to compete at the highest level. They have suffered multiple defeats and been held to several frustrating draws, leaving them stranded in third place. Meanwhile, over in Italy, Juventus are said to be tracking two potential targets for the summer transfer window. Portuguese winger Nani, who is currently on loan at Lazio from Valencia, is believed to be on their wishlist. The 31-year-old has impressed in his short spell in Italy, with several goals and assists to his name. He could provide valuable support to the likes of Paulo Dybala and Cristiano Ronaldo in the Juventus attack. The other player being linked with the Turin club is Alexis Sanchez, who has had a disappointing season at Manchester United. The Chilean forward has struggled for form and fitness, and has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer. Juventus are reportedly interested in his services, and could offer him a chance to revive his career in a new environment. It remains to be seen whether either of these deals will come to fruition, but Juventus are clearly looking for ways to strengthen their squad ahead of another assault on the Serie A title next season. As for Real Madrid, they will have to regroup and come back stronger next year if they hope to challenge for La Liga again.
