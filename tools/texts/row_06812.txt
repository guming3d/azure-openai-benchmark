article: Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations met in Indonesia on Saturday for a two-day summit expected to focus on efforts to achieve economic integration by 2015. The meeting started under the cloud of security issues such as the Thai-Cambodia border conflict. Indonesia, which chairs the summit this year, has been trying to mediate talks between Thailand and Cambodia in their dispute over the ancient Preah Vihear temple. Renewed fighting in the area has prompted displacement of thousands on both sides. Fighting along the turbulent border has raged since last month as the two sides accuse each other of trying to seize ancient temples. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged member nations to promote peace. "We realize that to ensure peaceful and stable east Asia region, we must ensure stability and security in the region," he said in his opening speech. "History recalls that as one of the pioneers of regional integration in the world, ASEAN was established based on the strong desire to establish peace, building consensus, promoting stability through regional cooperation and integration." Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa met separately with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts on Friday. Last month, both nations agreed to the deployment of an Indonesian observer team to the disputed area, but have not agreed on conditions set by either country. There are no indications so far that the leaders of both nations will meet on the sidelines of the summit. Other issues expected to be discussed is Myanmar's bid to host the summit in 2016, two years before its turn to assume the chairmanship. Human Rights Watch urged ASEAN leaders to reject the proposal. "Rewarding Burma with ASEAN's chairmanship after it staged sham elections and still holds 2,000 political prisoners would be an embarrassment for the region," said Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. "ASEAN leaders need to decide if they will let Burma demote ASEAN to the laughingstock of intergovernmental forums." Myanmar was formerly known as Burma. The regional group rotates the chairmanship every year among its members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. International pressure forced Myanmar to skip its turn in 2005. Yudhoyono also stressed the need for ASEAN leaders to address the challenges of food and energy security. "We must give serious attention and take concrete measures to address the soaring of food prices and world energy, which in turn will negatively affect the prosperity of our people," he said. "History shows that the rise of food and energy prices usually caused the increase in the number of people living in poverty."

chatgpt: The 35th annual ASEAN Summit has officially commenced on Saturday with Indonesia at the helm. This year's summit is being held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo kicked off the summit urging member nations to promote peace in the region amidst ongoing conflict between Thailand and Cambodia over the ancient Preah Vihear temple.  Indonesia has been playing a key role in trying to mediate talks between the two nations in an effort to resolve the long-standing border dispute. The conflict has been ongoing for over a decade and has resulted in several clashes over the years. The Preah Vihear temple lies on the border of Thailand and Cambodia, with both nations laying claim to the ancient site. President Widodo, in his opening remarks, emphasized the importance of good relationships among nations in ASEAN. He stated that "the peace, stability, and prosperity of each member country are inseparable from the peace, stability, and prosperity of the region as a whole." Several key issues are on the agenda for the summit, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the rehabilitation of the region's economy. Members will also discuss matters of regional security, sustainable development, maritime issues, and the situation in Myanmar following the recent coup. In light of the pandemic, the summit has been scaled down significantly, with physical meetings limited to a minimum. The meetings are being held via video conferencing to ensure the safety of all involved. The ASEAN Summit provides an excellent platform for Southeast Asian leaders to discuss the challenges facing the region and explore ways to tackle them collectively. The ASEAN community is made up of ten countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Laos, Myanmar, and Brunei. In summary, Indonesia has taken up the responsibility of chairing this year's ASEAN Summit and is pushing for peace talks between Thailand and Cambodia, calling for better relationships among member nations. The ongoing border dispute over the Preah Vihear temple remains a key agenda item for the summit, alongside matters pertinent to the region's sustainable development. The virtual summit has provided an opportunity for the region's leaders to come together despite the pandemic, to explore ways to promote peace, security, and prosperity in Southeast Asia.
