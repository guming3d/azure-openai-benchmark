article: (CNN) -- Japan's government is to allow some residents around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant to return to their homes to live for the first time since the March, 2011 disaster. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated and a 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone declared around the plant after a devastating earthquake and tsunami triggered a reactor meltdown -- the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986 -- causing high levels of radioactive contamination. Once bustling communities in this pocket of eastern Japan were turned into ghost towns. Google Street View maps Fukushima nuclear ghost town . But on April 1, some 350 people from the Miyakoji district of Tamura city will be allowed to head back to their homes permanently, according to the country's Reconstruction Agency. Some 31,000 people could eventually return home, it added. The government says about 138,000 Fukushima residents are still living in temporary accommodation. At a meeting Sunday, Miyakoji residents were told that radiation contamination levels had lowered sufficiently for their return to the area -- though some voiced concern over existing radiation levels despite decontamination efforts around some communities.

Officials have said they would like to get radiation exposure down to one millisievert a year. Fukushima leaks . The containment effort at the wrecked Fukushima-Daichi plant has been beset by problems, with regular reports of leaks of contaminated material. Last week, an estimated 100 metric tons of highly contaminated water flowed over a barrier around a containment tank and is being absorbed into the ground, plant operators, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), said in a statement -- though it denied there was any leakage into the nearby Pacific Ocean. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government vowed to step in to deal with the toxic water crisis at the plant that caused concern in Japan and abroad about the scale of the problem faced by TEPCO. The leak reported Thursday is one of the largest since TEPCO reported last summer that about 300 tons of radioactive water had leaked from a tank.

chatgpt: After being displaced from their homes for nearly a decade, 350 residents of the Miyakoji district in Tamura city have been given the green light to return home. The townspeople had been forced to evacuate their homes after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011, causing damage to the nearby Fukushima nuclear power plant and creating a 20-kilometer exclusion zone around it. The Japanese government has been working steadily to clean up and decontaminate the area in the intervening years, and it has finally determined that conditions in the Miyakoji district are safe for residents to return. However, many residents remain concerned about radiation levels, despite assurances from the government that decontamination efforts have been successful. The decision to allow residents to return home was not made lightly. The government has conducted extensive surveys and tests to ensure that radiation levels are within acceptable limits. The residents will also be provided with radiation meters to monitor their exposure levels. But even with these precautions, some residents remain understandably anxious. Many have been living in temporary housing for years, and the prospect of returning home is both exciting and daunting. Rebuilding their lives and their community will be a significant challenge, but it is a challenge that the people of the Miyakoji district are prepared to face. The return of residents to the Miyakoji district is a significant milestone in Japan's ongoing effort to recover from the 2011 disaster. The government has committed billions of dollars to clean up the contaminated areas around the Fukushima plant, and progress has been steady but slow. The return of these 350 residents is a sign that Japan is making progress toward a full recovery. However, it is important to remember that there is still much work to be done. The cleanup efforts around the Fukushima plant are far from complete, and many people who were displaced by the disaster are still waiting to return home. The government must continue to prioritize their needs, and ensure that they are able to rebuild their lives in safety and security. The return of the residents of Miyakoji is also a reminder of the ongoing risks that nuclear power plants pose. The disaster at Fukushima was a sobering reminder of the potential dangers of nuclear energy, and it is important that we continue to work toward cleaner, safer energy sources. In the meantime, the people of the Miyakoji district will continue to persevere, as they work to rebuild their community and their lives. Their story is a testament to the strength and resilience of the human spirit, even in the face of unimaginable hardship.
