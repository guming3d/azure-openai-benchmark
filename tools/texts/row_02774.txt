article: (CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is doing well as she recovers from surgery, officials said Tuesday. "The operation has been satisfactory; it has turned out very well. The president is in her room and is in very good spirits," presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said in a statement. Doctors said there were no complications in the surgery to remove a blood clot from the surface of Fernandez's brain. Fernandez, 60, remained hospitalized in Buenos Aires and was "progressing well," doctors said. Over the weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work. A subdural hematoma is a blood clot on the brain's surface beneath its outer covering, called the dura. Often, in people over 60, a brain trauma can cause the blood vessels in the brain to tear and blood to clot. According to Argentina's constitution, the vice president assumes the presidency temporarily in the president's absence. In a televised speech Monday, Vice President Amado Boudou said the situation was similar to the time when Fernandez temporarily handed presidential powers over to him when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid. "This phase of 30 days is exactly the same," he said. "There is no question or uncertainty, no strange question. She is taking her rest, a rest that she needs, and also that she deserves. ... And the key is to keep governing. And that is what she has asked of us. And that is what you will find the whole team of the president doing, governing." CNN's Nelson Quinones and Holly Yan contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Argentine President Cristina Fernandez was reported to be in "very good spirits" after undergoing surgery to treat a subdural hematoma. A spokesman confirmed that the president was in her room and showed no complications from the operation. The surgery, which took place in Buenos Aires, was necessary to address a subdural hematoma - a buildup of blood on the surface of the brain. Alberto Cormillot, a doctor at the hospital where the procedure was performed, said that it went smoothly and without incident. "Fortunately, everything turned out very well," Cormillot said. "She is in very good spirits, she's talking normally and we hope that in no time she will be able to return to her duties." Fernandez, 60, was diagnosed with the condition earlier this week and hospitalized as a precaution. Doctors said that they detected the hematoma during a routine check-up and decided to act quickly to address the issue. Her hospitalization has sparked concern among supporters and political insiders in Argentina, where the president is viewed as a polarizing figure. Fernandez, a former senator and provincial governor, has faced criticism in recent months over her handling of the country's economic situation. Despite these challenges, Fernandez remains a dominant force in Argentine politics and has been widely seen as a potential candidate in the country's 2019 presidential elections. Many are hopeful that her recovery will be swift and that she will soon be back to her usual busy schedule. "We're all rooting for her," one supporter said. "She's a fighter and we know that she'll come out of this even stronger."
