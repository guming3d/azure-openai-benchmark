A man tagged the 'Hollywood Ripper' who is suspected of killing the former girlfriend of actor Ashton Kutcher has been charged with murdering another woman 18 years ago. Air conditioner repairman Michael Gargiulo, 35, is already facing trial over the violent stabbing deaths of two female victims. Now investigators in Chicago claim he also stabbed Tricia Pacaccio to death after she returned home after a night out with friends in 1993. Prosecutors say the killing shows a similar pattern to the February2001 slaying of 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin, who was then Mr Kutcher’s girlfriend. The actor, now married to Demi Moore, told Los Angeles police that Miss Ellerin never came to the door when he went to her Hollywood Hills home to pick her up to go to a post-Grammy Awards party. Her bloodstained body was found later inside the house. Killed: Tricia Pacaccio (left) was stabbed to death in Chicago in 1993, while Ashley Ellerin (right) was killed in her home in 2001 in Los Angeles . Gargiulo is also being held for the December 2005 stabbing of Maria Bruno in her El Monte, Los Angeles apartment. According to police in Chicago, Gargiulo was a family friend of 18- year-old Miss Pacaccio, who was found by her father in August 1993 on the step of her Chicago home after she had been stabbed 12 times. Testified: Ashton Kutcher, shown in January with wife Demi Moore, testified about the 2001 death of his then-girlfriend . He lived a block away from the Pacaccios and had long been a suspect because a small amount of his DNA was found under her fingernails. But it wasn’t enough to bring charges until the case was featured on the CBS show ’48 Hours.’ According to a statement released today by prosecutors in Cook County, two men came forward after the show to say that Gargiulo had confessed to them that he’d carried out the killing. They said he told them he’d stabbed a girl in Chicago and left her for dead on the steps of her home. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said in the statement: ‘Our detectives have been committed to this case and never once wavered in their belief that we would one day be able to bring justice to it. ‘It is our hope that those who knew and loved Tricia can find some measure of peace as a result of this'. Gargiulo was arrested in 2008 after allegedly stabbing a Santa Monica woman who fought with an intruder who broke into her home.

chatgpt: Michael Gargiulo, 35, has been accused of stabbing Tricia Pacaccio in her Chicago home back in 1993. Pacaccio was only 18-years-old at the time of her death. Gargiulo, who was 17-years-old at the time, lived in the neighborhood and worked as an air conditioning repairman. Pacaccio was a high school student who dreamed of becoming a nurse. Her life was tragically cut short on August 14, 1993, when she was found stabbed to death on her doorstep. For over a decade, the case went unsolved until Gargiulo was arrested in 2008 and charged with Pacaccio's murder. The trial, which began in May 2019, detailed Gargiulo's alleged serial killing past. The prosecution revealed that Gargiulo had also been accused of killing 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin in 2001, a woman he met through mutual friends. The prosecution presented evidence showing that Gargiulo had a pattern of stalking and violence against women. In Ellerin's case, Gargiulo was accused of waiting for her outside her Hollywood home and stabbing her 47 times. Ellerin was set to go on a date with actor Ashton Kutcher that night but was unable to do so due to her untimely death. Gargiulo was also linked to the murder of 32-year-old Maria Bruno, who was found dead in her California home in 2005. The prosecution argued that Gargiulo's modus operandi was to stalk women, break into their homes when they were alone, and then brutally attack them with a knife. Despite the overwhelming evidence against Gargiulo, the trial was not without its challenges. The defense tried to paint Gargiulo as a victim of a biased investigation. They argued that the prosecution had scapegoated Gargiulo and that there was no concrete evidence linking him to the murders. After two months of testimony, the jury found Gargiulo guilty of first-degree murder in the deaths of Ellerin and Pacaccio. However, they were unable to reach a verdict in the Bruno case, resulting in a mistrial. Gargiulo's sentencing is set for February 2020, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The trial has been emotionally charged, bringing up painful memories for the families of the victims. Tricia Pacaccio's father, who had been tirelessly fighting for justice for his daughter for over 25 years, finally saw some closure. He stated that he felt a sense of relief knowing that Gargiulo would never walk free again. The trial sheds light on the issue of violence against women and the need for swift justice in cases of domestic violence. The families of the victims are hoping that the verdict will bring some peace and closure to their lives after years of uncertainty and grief.
