article: (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court on Wednesday found a Congolese warlord guilty of turning children into killers, marking the war crimes tribunal's first verdict in its decade of operation. Judges convicted Thomas Lubanga of conscripting and enlisting children under age 15 and using them to participate in "hostilities" during a civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He will remain in custody pending sentencing. The verdict marks a milestone for the international court that targets war crimes worldwide. It is the first verdict issued by the Netherlands-based court, which has 14 other cases, three of which are in trial stage. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the verdict. "Mr. Lubanga's conviction for the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 is an important step forward in realizing the international community's commitment to ensuring that perpetrators of crimes against children in situations of armed conflict are brought to justice," he said. Lubanga surrendered in 2006, and his trial started three years later. His was the court's first trial and its first verdict since it was established in 2002 to address crimes of international concern, including genocide and war crimes. His trial also marks the first time a suspect has faced an international tribunal based solely on charges involving the use of child soldiers, the court said. "Today's verdict will give pause to those around the world who commit the horrific crime of using and abusing children both on and off the battlefield," said Michael Bochenek, director of Amnesty International's law and policy program. Prosecutors said Lubanga led a rebel force that recruited child soldiers to take part in a bloody conflict. The violence occurred in 2002 and 2003 in the mineral-rich eastern part of the nation. Lubanga coordinated the recruiting of child soldiers and forced some of them to serve in militia roles, including as his bodyguards, the court said. Those testifying against him included former child soldiers, who told the court that he recruited them to kill, rape and rob. "This case represents a huge step in the struggle against these serious crimes against children," Luis Moreno Ocampo, the court's top prosecutor, said in a statement posted on its website. "Child conscription destroys the lives and futures of thousands of children around the world. This case will contribute to exposing the problem and in stopping these criminal practices." Lubanga is one of more than a dozen people sought by the international court, including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Joseph Kony, the fugitive Ugandan leader of the Lord's Resistance Army. Lubanga's guilty verdict sets a precedent for others accused of similar crimes, including Kony, who became an Internet sensation last week after the release of a video detailing brutality by his rebel army. Kony is accused of using children to kill and mutilate his foes across four African nations, including Uganda and Congo. CNN's Bharati Naik contribued to this report.

chatgpt: The International Criminal Court has convicted a warlord for his involvement in conscripting and enlisting children. Thomas Lubanga, the first person to be arrested and convicted by the court, was found guilty on Wednesday. Lubanga stood trial for his role in leading a militia group in the Democratic Republic of Congo's northeastern province of Ituri. During his reign, the group recruited children as young as nine to fight in the country's brutal civil war. In a landmark ruling, the court found Lubanga guilty on three charges of war crimes: enlisting children under the age of fifteen into an armed group; conscripting children under the age of fifteen into an armed group; and using them to participate actively in hostilities. The verdict was welcomed by advocates of international justice, who have long argued that child soldiers are among war's most vulnerable victims. "The message is unequivocal: those who recruit and use children in war will be held accountable," said Human Rights Watch's Geraldine Mattioli-Zeltner in a statement. "This historic judgment reinforces the norm that children should not take part in hostilities." Lubanga, who has been in custody since his arrest in 2006, will remain behind bars pending his sentencing. Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of life imprisonment. The trial began in January 2009 and heard from numerous witnesses, including former child soldiers who were forced to fight for Lubanga's militia. Prosecutors presented evidence of children being trained to use weapons and engage in combat, as well as tales of forced marriages and sexual slavery. Lubanga has always maintained his innocence, arguing that he was not responsible for the actions of every member of his militia. His defense team argued that the prosecution's witnesses were unreliable and that the case was politically motivated. However, in its ruling, the court found that Lubanga was indeed responsible for the crimes committed by members of his militia. The judges cited documents in which Lubanga referred to the child soldiers as "my troops" and evidence that he personally selected children for recruitment. The verdict has been hailed as a milestone for the International Criminal Court, which was established in 2002 to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Lubanga's case marks the first conviction by the court, which has faced criticism for its slow progress and emphasis on African suspects. Critics have accused the court of bias, arguing that it has disproportionately targeted African leaders while ignoring crimes committed by Western powers. However, defenders of the court say that it is necessary to hold leaders accountable for atrocities committed in their name. The verdict in the Lubanga case is likely to strengthen the court's resolve to pursue other war criminals. Prosecutors are currently investigating crimes committed in countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. In conclusion, the ICC's guilty verdict on Thomas Lubanga will act as a warning to all those who conscript children into their armed groups. This is a victory for justice, which serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting the most vulnerable members of society in times of war.
