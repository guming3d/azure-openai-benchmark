article: (CNN) -- Slowed, but not daunted, by Antarctic winds topping 100 mph, low visibility and snow, rescuers Saturday pounced on improving weather conditions to move closer to where a plane carrying three Canadians sent out emergency beacon signals. The condition of the three crew members on the Twin Otter operated by Calgary-based Kenn Borek Air Ltd. was not known nearly three days after the flight went missing and rescue attempts began. The plane was flying from the South Pole to an Italian base at Terra Nova Bay, Maritime New Zealand said. "It is difficult to think of a more difficult environment," said Steve Rendle, spokesman for Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand. The beacon stopped working Thursday evening, possibly because the battery had run out, about a day after the plane was reported missing. By then, rescuers had pinpointed the location, but harsh weather has made visual sightings impossible, Rendle said. Winds, for example, reached nearly 105 mph Wednesday. One search aircraft reached a camp about 30 miles from where the beacon sounded. Two helicopters were moving toward the forward base on a glacier Saturday afternoon. A C-130 Hercules aircraft circled the beacon activation site, attempting to make visual contact. "We've got a reasonably positive forecast for that site," Rendle said from Wellington. The missing crew's survival kit includes survival suits, mountain tents and enough food and water for five days. The aircraft is believed to be at a height of 13,000 feet near the top of Mount Elizabeth, part of the rugged Queen Alexandra Range. It is a long distance from any bases in Antarctica. "We would expect them to be with the plane," Rendle said of the crew. "Common sense would dictate you stay with the beacon." Kenn Borek Air Ltd. did not immediately return a message left by CNN on Friday night. In a statement Wednesday, the airline described the flight as overdue. It did not release names of the crew members. According to its website, the airline has one of the largest Twin Otter fleets in the world. "We are best known for our remote polar services utilizing ski-equipped Twin Otter," it said. "KBAL provides a wide range of additional services including medevac, survey, paradrop, float operations, third-party maintenance and overhaul." The Queen Alexandra Range, about 100 miles long, was named by Ernest Shackleton during the British Antarctic expedition in 1907-1909. Peter West, spokesman for the National Science Foundation, which oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, said 24 hours of daylight this time of year should help rescue efforts. CNN's Dave Alsup and Erica Harrington contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The tension is palpable as rescue aircraft move closer to the emergency beacon of a plane that went missing in Antarctica. The plane, carrying three Canadian citizens, was en route from the South Pole to Terra Nova Bay when it failed to arrive at its destination. New Zealand officials have confirmed that the emergency locator on the plane has been activated, triggering a search and rescue mission. The harsh terrain of Antarctica is proving to be a significant challenge for search and rescue teams as they scour the area for any sign of the missing plane. Calling the terrain "inhospitable" seems like an understatement, as teams have to contend with sub-zero temperatures, harsh winds, and barely-visible landmarks. Nevertheless, rescue teams are working tirelessly to locate the plane and its passengers. The missing plane was last seen on November 27th, leaving the South Pole en route to Terra Nova Bay. The planned flight was expected to take around four and a half hours. However, when the plane failed to arrive at its destination, officials were quickly alerted to the situation. The emergency locator on the plane was activated, and search and rescue teams were sent to the area. The search for the missing plane has been a multi-agency effort, with teams from New Zealand, the United States, and Italy all working together. The New Zealand Air Force has been deploying aircraft to search for the missing plane, while other teams have been using ground-based technologies to try and locate the beacon. So far, the search has been challenging, with extremely difficult weather conditions making it hard for search teams to access some areas. Nevertheless, officials remain hopeful that they will be able to locate the missing plane and bring any surviving passengers to safety. In the meantime, the families and loved ones of the missing Canadian passengers are waiting anxiously for news. The Canadian government has been providing updates on the situation, and has assured families that they are doing everything in their power to locate the missing plane. The missing plane is a stark reminder of the dangers of flying in such inhospitable environments. Despite having some of the world's most advanced technologies at their disposal, even search and rescue teams are at the mercy of the terrain and weather when it comes to finding missing planes. Nevertheless, officials remain committed to doing everything they can to locate the missing plane and bring its passengers to safety. As the search for the missing Canadians continues, people around the world are holding their breath in the hope that the rescue teams will find them soon. While the terrain may be inhospitable, hope and perseverance are still very much alive, as the search and rescue teams continue their tireless efforts to locate the missing plane.
