article: (CNN) -- Japan on Tuesday unveiled its largest warship since World War II, an 820-foot-long, 19,500-ton flattop capable of carrying 14 helicopters, according to media reports. The ship, named the Izumo, is classified as a helicopter destroyer, though its flattop design makes it look like an aircraft carrier. But the Japanese Defense Ministry says the ship is not intended to be used as an aircraft carrier and will not be used to launch fighter jets, state broadcaster NHK reported. The launch of the $1.2 billion warship at a Yokohama dockyard comes at a time of increased military tensions between Japan and China over disputed islands in the East China Sea. "The destroyer is aimed at better responding to various contingencies in waters near Japan," NHK reported. China on Tuesday warned Japan against any moves of military expansion, according to a report from Global Times. "We are concerned over Japan's constant expansion of its military equipment. Japan's Asian neighbors and the international community need to be highly vigilant about this trend," the Global Times quoted the Chinese Defense Ministry as saying. "Japan should learn from history, adhere to its policy of self-defense and abide by its promise to take the road of peaceful development." Both China and Japan claim sovereignty over the rocky, uninhabited islands between Okinawa and Taiwan, which are near important shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds and possible mineral deposits. They are known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. Last year, the Japanese government bought several of the islands from a private owner, angering Chinese authorities and provoking a spate of sometimes violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in many Chinese cities. Chinese government ships have continued to frequently sail near the islands, engaging in maritime games of cat and mouse with Japanese coast guard vessels. Chinese planes have also flown through the area, prompting Japan to scramble fighter jets. Tuesday's launch also came on the 68th anniversary of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima. Upwards of 60,000 people -- according to various estimates, about one-fifth of Hiroshima's population at the time -- were killed when a U.S. B-29 bomber dropped the bomb on August 6, 1945, . In remembrance ceremonies in Hiroshima on Tuesday, a list of 286,000 atomic bomb victims was presented, NHK reported. In a speech, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called on the Japanese people to always remind the world about the consequences of nuclear war, NHK reported.

chatgpt: Japan has launched an 820-foot-long flattop designed to carry 14 helicopters on the 68th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. The launch of the warship comes at a time of increased tensions with China, which has warned Japan against military expansion.  The $1.3 billion Izumo was unveiled at the Yokohama Shipyard near Tokyo on Wednesday. The vessel is the largest warship Japan has built since the end of World War II, and analysts say it is a clear indication of Japan's desire to increase its military presence in the region.  The Izumo is equipped with anti-submarine warfare capabilities and will be used for a range of missions, including the defense of remote Japanese islands. However, China has expressed concerns over Japan's military expansion, and this latest development is expected to add fuel to the already volatile situation in the region.  Japan's defense ministry has denied that the Izumo is an aircraft carrier and said that it is purely for self-defense purposes. However, China has accused Japan of trying to change the regional balance of power, and has warned that it will respond if Japan continues to expand its military capabilities.  Tensions between Japan and China have been high in recent years, with both countries claiming sovereignty over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. The territorial dispute has led to several maritime incidents, and both sides have accused the other of provocative behavior.  Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has been pushing for a more proactive defense policy, and the launch of the Izumo is seen as a key part of that strategy. However, some have criticized Abe's approach, saying that it is only likely to escalate the situation with China.  The launch of the Izumo on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing is also likely to be controversial. The bombing, which killed an estimated 140,000 people, remains a highly emotive issue in Japan. Some will see the launch of the Izumo on this day as a controversial move that only serves to remind people of the horrors of war.  Despite the criticism, the launch of the Izumo is a clear indication of Japan's determination to increase its military capabilities. Whether this will lead to a more stable or more volatile situation in the region remains to be seen.
