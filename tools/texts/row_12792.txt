article: By . Tara Brady . A couple separated a little boy from his six brothers and sisters because they felt that he 'did not fit into the family', a High Court judge has heard. They decided to live as a 'divided family' with the mother and six children occupying one room and the father and little boy occupying another, Mrs Justice Russell was told. The little boy, now five, was 'largely confined' to a room with a gate placed across the doorway. Judge said the local authority with responsibility for the children was Lancashire County Council (pictured) He shared his father’s meals. Mrs Justice Russell said the little boy must have suffered 'significant emotional harm'. She said the depth of that harm might not become apparent until he was older. Detail of the little boy’s treatment has emerged in a written ruling by the judge following a hearing in a family court in Manchester. She wrote: 'He was seen as the problem and he and the other children must have known it; indeed the older children have said so. Mrs Justice Russell did not identify the couple but said they had lived in the Lancashire towns of Burnley and Blackpool (pictured) 'The emotional harm that this has caused his siblings is significant. The oldest three have expressed guilt and remorse at the way he was treated; they should not have been put in that position.' The judge ruled that all seven children - aged between 13 and three - should be taken into care. In her judgement she wrote: 'The plan of the local authority is not to place the children with permanent adoptive families; this is entirely appropriate given their ages and their close relationships as a sibling group and the need for them to continue to have regular contact with each other. 'The local authority must ensure that they are put in long-term placements where they can develop long-term and secure relationships so as to minimise the disadvantages that are inherent in the care system. 'The children must have regular, frequent and good quality contact which means that proper arrangements must be put in place.' She said all had probably suffered 'significant and long-lasting harm' as a result of their parents’ care. Mrs Justice Russell did not identify the couple but said they had lived in the Lancashire towns of Burnley and Blackpool. And the judge said the local authority with responsibility for the children was Lancashire County Council.

chatgpt: In a shocking case of family separation, a mother and her six children were forced to live in a single room while the father and their little boy, now aged five years old, occupied another room. This "divided family" arrangement was deemed harmful by a judge in a recent court hearing. What's worse, the little boy was limited to a room with a gate placed across the doorway, effectively trapping him in a confined space. The judge presiding over the case stated that the child must have suffered "significant emotional harm" due to the living conditions imposed on him. The case was heard in a county court in the United Kingdom, where the family lived. The judge ruled that the child's welfare had been severely compromised by the arrangement, which prevented him from interacting with his siblings and caused him undue distress. It was reported that the boy's father had been living with him in the separate room since he was eight months old, and that the mother and her other children had been sharing a single room ever since. The situation came to light after an investigation was launched following concerns raised by social services. The judge also noted that the boy had been performing poorly in his development milestones, leading to concerns that his prolonged isolation could have lasting effects on his mental and emotional well-being. The case highlights the importance of ensuring that children's welfare is safeguarded in all situations. The judge in this case emphasized that the living conditions imposed on the family were far from ideal and that arrangements had to be made to ensure that the child's welfare would be protected in future. The child has since been moved to a new home where he can reside with his mother and siblings. While this will undoubtedly be a welcome relief for the family, the case has highlighted the need for better safeguards and measures to prevent family separation and ensure the best interests of children are put first. As for the father, he has been banned from seeing his son until he can demonstrate that he is capable of ensuring his well-being and meeting his emotional, physical and educational needs. The judge has urged the family to work together and identify a suitable arrangement that would allow the child to interact with his extended family in a safe and healthy manner. The case has certainly been a wake-up call to the authorities and the public at large and is a reminder of the importance of supporting families and ensuring that children are protected from harm.
