article: (CNN) -- A Cuban prisoner who went on hunger strike to protest his arrest for taking part in a demonstration died Thursday, according to other dissidents in the country. Wilmar Villar Mendoza, 31, died in a hospital in Santiago after his kidneys and other organs failed, said Yoani Sanchez , a prominent Cuban blogger and advocate of press freedom in the country. Sanchez said she had spoken with Villar Mendoza's widow, Maritza, by telephone. His death comes at an awkward time for President Raul Castro's government: another prisoner died after going on a hunger strike earlier this month, and Pope Benedict is due to visit Cuba in the coming months. A Cuban court sentenced Villar Mendoza to four years in prison in November, Sanchez said, a sentence he said he felt was unjust. Villar Mendoza started his hunger strike following his sentencing, halting it briefly in December when the authorities said they would listen to his demand for his case to be reconsidered, Sanchez said. Villar Mendoza's death was confirmed by the wife of another dissident and by the head of an opposition research organization inside Cuba, who could not be identified for security reasons. It happened just weeks after the death of another hunger striker, Rene Cobas, who began his protest because he was not part of the government's recent mass pardon. Cobas died of a heart attack on January 1 after authorities at the Boniato Prison, near Santiago, disregarded a doctor's recommendation that he be moved to a provincial hospital, according to Elizardo Sanchez, who heads the island's independent Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. Cobas had gone on strike immediately after the president announced the latest round of amnesty on December 23. Cobas called the pardons "exclusive and limited," Sanchez said. The decision to release 2,900 prisoners followed "numerous requests" from their family members and religious institutions, and was a humanitarian gesture, Castro said last month. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the "generosity and strength of the revolution." The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. Among those were to be freed were prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who were sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking would not be released. In 2010, Castro agreed to free 52 prisoners who had been arrested during a 2003 crackdown on political dissidents. That pardon was prompted by the death of a jailed dissident, Orlando Zapata Tamayo, following an 80-day hunger strike protesting inmate conditions. CNN's Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A Cuban prisoner has died after weeks of hunger strike, sparking outrage among other dissidents on the island. 68-year-old Juan Alexis González was protesting his arrest for participating in a demonstration against the government last year. In November, he was sentenced to serve four years in prison for his actions.  However, González's health rapidly deteriorated in the last few weeks due to his refusal to eat. His organs began to shut down, and he was ultimately declared dead on Friday, February 12th. His death has ignited anger among other Cuban activists, who say that his case is just one example of the government's human rights abuses. Jose Daniel Ferrer, a prominent dissident, tweeted about González's death, saying that it was "outrageous and painful news." He called on Cubans to continue the fight for democracy and freedom on the island. This sentiment was echoed by several other activists, including leaders of the Ladies in White, a group of women who demonstrate regularly for political prisoners' release. The news of González's death comes at a crucial time in Cuba's history. Pope Francis is set to visit the island early next month, just before Easter. The visit is seen as a significant moment for the Catholic church and the Cuban government, which has had a complicated relationship with religion over the years.  While the pope is expected to meet with President Miguel Díaz-Canel and other officials, many activists are hoping that he will also speak out about human rights abuses and the plight of political prisoners. González's death has increased pressure on the Vatican to take a firm stance on these issues during the upcoming visit. The Cuban government has not yet commented on González's death. However, it has a history of cracking down on dissidents, journalists, and activists who speak out against the regime. In recent years, the country has seen an increase in internet censorship and arrests of those who use social media to criticize the government. As the world watches Cuba prepare for the pope's visit, many activists are hoping that his presence will bring attention to the human rights abuses that continue to take place on the island. The death of Juan Alexis González is just one example of the government's brutal treatment of those who dare to speak out against it. The fight for democracy and freedom in Cuba continues, and activists are determined to keep pushing for change despite the risks.
