article: By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 02:27 EST, 1 February 2012 . It was a music hall favourite which has since become instantly synonymous with wartime Britain. But while the popularity of 'It's A Long Way To Tipperary' has never been in doubt, two towns are fighting over the exact origin of the First World War classic. A row has erupted between Oldbury, in the West Midlands, and Manchester suburb Stalybridge after both claimed the iconic tune was written on their patch. Iconic: It's A Long Way To Tipperary is well-known and loved as a wartime classic . Both places are planning civic events to mark the 100th anniversary of the inspiring song, but they cannot agree on where its author penned the famous tune. Jack Judge, the song's writer, was a fishmonger who hailed from Oldbury, but it is accepted that he first performed it on Jan 31 1912 at Stalybridge's Grand Theatre. A brass band will belt out the classic in Stalybridge centre, while Oldbury Library will be the venue for a community choir’s rendition of the song. Writer Jack Judge hailed from Oldbury, West Mids, but first performed the song in Stalybridge, Manchester . Historians in Stalybridge are adamant he penned his classic during an extended stint at the theatre, after a fellow artiste wagered five shillings he couldn’t write a winning tune in less than a day. Alan Rose of Stalybridge Local History Society, said in the 1920s, Jack Judge wrote a letter to the Stalybridge Year Book confirming he wrote it while staying at the town’s Newmarket Tavern. A plaque to that effect has since been placed on the pub wall. Yet their Oldbury counterparts insist Jack, born in 1872, wrote the tune - originally entitled It’s A Long Way To Connermara - at home, before taking it on the road when his music hall career took off. Mr Rose said: 'Oldbury is claiming it because he was a resident there, but there is no doubt he wrote it in Stalybridge. There is no doubt in my mind. 'He got himself into a bet with another artiste. He bet five shillings Jack couldn’t write a song in 24 hours, which he did.' That’s news to Oldbury residents who believe Jack crafted his greatest hit on the piano of a local pub. Immortalised: In Tameside, Manchester, there is a statue of Jack Judge (left) alongside a WW1 soldier, while in Oldbury, a library has been named after the music hall songwriter . Dr Terry Daniels, head of Oldbury Local History Society, believes Jack ‘pulled a fast one’. He already had the tune in his pocket when he agreed the bet. 'He was always a betting man and he would steer a conversation to writing songs,' he said. 'There is no doubt he sang It’s A Long Way To Tipperary for the first time in Stalybridge - no one in Olbury disagrees with that. But it was not produced from a blank piece of paper.'

chatgpt: A popular wartime tune, which celebrated its 100th anniversary yesterday, has sparked a territorial claim between two towns in the UK. Oldbury, a town in the West Midlands, and Stalybridge, a town in Manchester, both claim that "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" was written on their patch. The song was composed by Jack Judge, a British songwriter, in 1912. The tune hit international fame when it was picked up by soldiers headed to fight in World War I. The melody of the song is said to have resonated with the soldiers, and soon became a marching song for the troops. "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" continued to be popular even after the war had ended. The tune was adapted by various artists and used in different contexts. Its popularity also inspired several covers and remixes. It remains a well-known tune even today and is often played at sporting events. However, the origins of the song have always been contested. Oldbury claims that the song was written by Jack Judge while he was working in the town's court. According to their version of events, Judge was challenged by some locals to compose a song in under an hour. Judge rose to the challenge and produced "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" in record time. Oldbury maintains that the song was first performed in the town's Grand Theatre. Stalybridge, on the other hand, claims that the song was written in one of its pubs by Judge. The town has several historical records to back up its claim. Judge was known to frequent the local pub, the Stalybridge Buffet Bar, and it is likely that he composed the song there. Despite the argument, neither town can claim exclusive ownership of the song. The song was copyrighted and sold to a music publisher, and it became the property of the public once it was released. The 100th anniversary of the song's composition was celebrated yesterday. Various events were held to pay homage to the tune and its role in the war. Oldbury and Stalybridge both marked the occasion with ceremonies and performances. Despite the disagreement, both towns share a sense of pride in the song's origins. Oldbury and Stalybridge have rich histories, and "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" adds another layer to their story. In the grand scheme of things, where the song was composed is irrelevant. Its enduring legacy is what truly matters. "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" became a symbol of solidarity and hope for soldiers during World War I. It was a reminder of home and the love they left behind. Its continued popularity is a testament to its universal appeal. As we mark the 100th anniversary of the song's composition, let us remember the sacrifice of those who fought in World War I. And let us also celebrate the power of music in bridging divides and uniting people from different places and backgrounds.
