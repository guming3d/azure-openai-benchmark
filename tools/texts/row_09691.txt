article: It may sound like the plot from a desperate Hollywood reboot - but in reality it's far more chilling. The U.S. Navy has developed a state-of-the-art underwater spying machine designed to look and act like a shark - so that it can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions undetected. The drone is five feet long, weighs almost 100lbs and can dive as deep as 300ft while gathering data. Scroll down for video . Drone shark: The GhostSwimmer can dive to 300ft while recording data and transmitting it in real time . As well as resembling a shark the device swims like one, flipping its tail back and forth to navigate waters. The Navy calls it the latest in a series of 'science-fiction-turned-reality' projects to come out of its Silent NEMO experiments for developing unmanned biomimetic vehicles as an underwater fleet, CBS News reports. The word biomimetic refers to human-made devices mimicking biology - in this case the ocean's most feared predator. The autonomous drone is called GhostSwimmer - and the US military hope it will boost the Navy's underwater capability. State-of-the-art: The Navy calls it the latest in a series of 'science-fiction-turned-reality' projects to come out of its Silent NEMO experiments . Michael Rufo, director of the Advanced Systems Group at Boston Engineering that designed GhostSwimmer, said: 'It swims just like a fish does by oscillating its tail fin back and forth. 'GhostSwimmer will allow the Navy to have success during more types of missions while keeping divers and sailors safe.' When it's not hovering just below the surface of the water, the drone can dive to great depths while gathering data on tides, currents, wakes and weather conditions. The machine is able to operate without being controlled - but can also be connected to a laptop by a 500ft tether and be driven from on board a vessel. By doing this, any data collected can be transmitted in real time. It is believed the technology could also replace the bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions the Navy trains to recover equipment and spot underwater mines. Breakthrough: The US military hope it will allow the Navy to carry out of a range of missions while keeping divers and sailors safe .

chatgpt: The United States Navy has introduced a new state-of-the-art underwater drone, dubbed the GhostSwimmer, which can dive to depths of 300ft while transmitting necessary data. The drone, measuring five-foot in length and weighing 100 pounds, is the latest addition to a series of science-fiction-inspired, reality-based projects aimed at keeping sailors out of harm’s way. Boston Engineering, the company that designed the GhostSwimmer, has hailed it as the future of unmanned underwater technology. The drone's advanced capabilities allow it to maneuver through difficult underwater environments and navigate at depths that are beyond human limitations. It can also operate silently, making it an ideal tool for stealth operations.  The GhostSwimmer was initially developed as part of a research project initiated by the Naval Research Laboratory. However, it quickly gained the attention of Navy officials, who saw its potential for critical missions such as intelligence gathering, mine detection and rescue operations. The drone’s unique design is modeled after a tuna fish’s body, allowing it to move through the water in a seamless and natural way, with minimal disturbance to marine environments. The GhostSwimmer is equipped with a range of sensors, including a video camera, which allows it to capture and relay important data back to its operators. The GhostSwimmer's testing has included deployment in waters near Boston where it successfully navigated through tough currents and obstacles that would have posed a challenge to human divers. The Navy has expressed confidence in the GhostSwimmer's ability to operate in varied ocean conditions due to its robust design. While the Navy has other underwater drones in the inventory, the GhostSwimmer is unique in its ability to operate in confined spaces and limited waters. It’s already drawn the attention of Navy officials who plan on using the drone in future missions, allowing them to keep sailors out of harm’s way and operate more stealthily. The GhostSwimmer's development is part of a broader trend of innovation within the Defense Department. Cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, drones, and robotics, are no longer the stuff of science-fiction, but rather they are becoming integral components of modern-day military operations.
