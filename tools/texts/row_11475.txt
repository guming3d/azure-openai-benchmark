article: By . Richard Shears . The coy residents of a small Japanese town have been so shocked by a replica of Michelangelo’s Renaissance sculpture of a naked David that they have called for it to be fitted out in underpants. The 16ft replica of the classic sculpture has been put up in a park in Okuizumo where, standing on a plinth, it towers over everyone visiting the area to use the nearby running track, baseball stadium and tennis courts. It is also close to a children’s play area, which is of added concern to residents who have objected to the statue’s nudity. The 16ft replica of the masterpiece in Okuizumo town government has caused a stir among residents who say its 'nakedness' is scaring children and it should wear underpants . ‘It’s frightening the children and worrying the adults with its nakedness’ said a town official. ‘Several people have asked us to cover it up with underpants.’ The statue, along with a replica of Greek treasure the ‘topless’ Venus de Milo, was presented to the town by a businessman who comes from the area. Both statues were erected in a prominent position in the park and while many residents have appreciated the gift, some have admitted they are worried about the blatant nakedness on display. ‘Some people have told the town’s legislators that toddlers are afraid of the statues because they are so big and they appeared unexpectedly over the summer,’ said Mr Yoji Morinaga, a town official. ‘They are statues of unclothed humans, and such pieces of art work are very rare in our area. ‘Some people apparently said the statues might not be good for their children. 'It’s the first time we have had anything like this in our town. Perhaps people were perplexed.’ Town official Yoki Morinaga says art featuring 'unclothed humans' such as Michelangelo's David, left, and ancient statue Venus de Milo, right, is rare in Japan . And while many locals who live in the mountainside town of fewer than 15,000 residents have welcomed the new cultural additions, some have asked for David to be fitted out with underwear ‘to preserve modesty’, said the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.

chatgpt: Residents in the Japanese town of Okuizumo have raised concerns over a statue that is located near a park. The statue, a replica of the Greek goddess Venus de Milo, has been criticised for its "nakedness" and is said to be scaring local children. The statue was donated to the town by a local businessman, along with another replica of the Venus de Milo, which is also topless. While the statues are considered to be masterpieces of ancient Greek art, some residents in Okuizumo are concerned about their placement. According to local official Yoki Morinaga, art in Japan of "unclothed humans" is rare, and the statues may not be appropriate for a public space. Residents who have raised concerns about the statue say that they are worried about the effect it may have on local children. Many parents have reported that their children are scared of the statue, and some have even avoided the park altogether because of it. One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "I understand that the statue is a work of art, but it is not suitable for a public park where children play. I don't want my children to be scared when they are out having fun." Others have defended the statue, saying that it is an important piece of art and should not be removed. Local artist and writer, Yukihiro Ishii, said: "Art should be respected and appreciated, and not hidden away because some people find it offensive. The statue is a beautiful masterpiece, and I hope it remains in place for everyone to enjoy." In response to the concerns raised by residents, local officials have said that they will consider whether or not the statues should be removed. However, they have also stressed the importance of preserving cultural heritage and promoting art in the town. "We understand that some residents are concerned about the statue, but we must also consider the value of this piece of art," said Yoki Morinaga. "We will take their concerns into account, but ultimately we want to promote art and culture in Okuizumo." The controversy surrounding the Venus de Milo replica has sparked a debate about the role of art in public spaces. While some argue that art should be respected and appreciated, others believe that it should not be displayed in spaces where it may cause offence or discomfort. As the discussion continues, it remains to be seen whether or not the statue will remain in its current location. The controversy has highlighted the importance of respecting cultural heritage and promoting art, while also considering the needs and concerns of local communities.
