article: By . Ryan Gorman . Dead from a snake bite: Timothy Levins died about half an hour after being bitten by a copperhead snake . A Missouri father died Tuesday in front of his young son after being bitten by a copperhead snake. Timothy Levins, 52, was bitten by the poisonous snake while camping with family at Sam A. baker State Park, about 100 miles south of St Louis. Liam Levins, 11, told police his father walked out of their rented cabin, saw the snake, picked it up and it bit him, KFVS reported. He then went back inside the cabin to wash his hands and soon started shaking before passing out on a couch, the boy said, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The incident occurred around 9.00 p.m., and Levins was unresponsive when first responders arrived, sources told the station. Levins had three bites on his hand from the 18-20 inch snake, and he was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead. An autopsy soon revealed that Levins died from anaphylactic shock due to the bite, the coroner said.His death is only the third in state history from a snake bite, KSDK reported. ‘That’s just a horrible thing,’ camper Bonnie Roberts told KFVS. The other snake bite deaths were in 2012 and 1965, a park ranger added. Deadly: A copperhead snake similar to this one bit Levins . Where it happened: Levins picked the snake up off the grass outside this cabin, his son told police . ‘Most of the time when people die from a copperhead bite, which is usually what they say, it’s usually not from the actual bite, it’s because they had a previous medical condition,’ Sara Turner, from the Missouri Department of Conservation, told KFVS. The majority of people bit by the venomous snakes only experience discomfort, and about a quarter of those bites are ‘dry’ – they have no venom, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation. ‘The snake is trying to scare away an intruder, not kill you,’ says the agency’s website. Campers and park officials stressed that the best thing to do if one comes across a copperhead, or any other snake, is to scare it away by making a loud noise – or just run away. Levins is survived by his wife and three children.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck a Missouri family on their camping trip last weekend as Timothy Levins, 52, died after being bitten by a snake. Levins had picked up the snake to show his son, but was bitten three times. Within thirty minutes, Levins had succumbed to the bites. This marks only the third recorded snake bite death in Missouri history, and serves as a tragic reminder of the dangers of handling wild creatures. Levins, who was described as an avid outdoorsman, had been on a camping trip with his family on the banks of the Meramec River. The snake that bit him was identified as a copperhead, a venomous species commonly found in the Midwest. Copperheads are known for their bright copper-colored heads and their camouflaged bodies, which can make them difficult to spot in some environments. First responders were called to the campground shortly after the incident, but were unable to revive Levins. He was later pronounced dead at the scene. Snake bites are relatively rare, but can be fatal in some cases. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are around 7,000 - 8,000 venomous snake bites reported in the United States each year. However, only around five of these bites are fatal. Experts advise that it is important to never approach or try to handle snakes in the wild. While some species may appear docile, they can still pose a danger to humans. It is important to give snakes a wide berth and to alert authorities if one is spotted in or around a populated area. Levins' tragic death serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting wildlife and the potential dangers it can pose. While he lost his life to a rare and unfortunate incident, his memory will undoubtedly live on with his loved ones, who will forever hold dear the memories of their camping trips together out in the beauty of nature.
