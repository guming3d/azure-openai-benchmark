Mrs Barber, 42, said: 'The au pair couldn't speak English too well and was asking for me to speak to the child's mum on the phone. 'I spoke to her mum and told her I was sorry to say this, but her daughter had been in an accident - it was awful.'

Judge Peter Johnson adjourned sentencing for reports, but told Benwell: 'I regard this as a serious matter and you ought to be aware that custody is very much a possibility in this case.' The defendant was released on bail on condition that he remain at his home address, and will appear in court again on December 19.
