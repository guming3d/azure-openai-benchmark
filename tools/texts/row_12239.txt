article: (CNN) -- The drummer for the Scorpions rock band has been sentenced to a month in jail for being drunk, insulting Muslims and lowering his trousers at Dubai International Airport, local media reported. James Kottak, the band's 51-year-old American drummer, admitted to a Dubai court Tuesday that he had been drinking when he landed at the airport on April 3 on a flight from Moscow, court reporters from The National and Gulf News said. The band was on its way to Bahrain for a concert for the Formula One Grand Prix. Witnesses said that Kottak became angry and swore. One passenger services agent is quoted as telling the court that "he was shouting 'non-educated Muslims,' then he went to the office of the head and flashed his middle finger at the passengers." Kottak admitted to drinking but denied making any insulting comments about Muslims and denied flashing his middle finger. A policeman testified that Kottak shouted that he wouldn't travel with a group of Pakistanis and Afghans, saying they "smell," a claim Kottak denied. Witnesses also said Kottak removed his trousers, but his lawyer said he just raised his shirt to show off a tattoo. Kottak's lawyer, named by The National as Hamid al-Khazraji, argued that his client was innocent and that testimony from witnesses was contradictory. Dubai police confirmed the arrest but would not comment on details. Kottak "was arrested at the airport earlier this month after complaints about his behavior. He was then, according to the law, referred to the prosecution department," a Dubai police source told CNN Arabic. The band made its first comment on the incident on its Facebook page Wednesday. "When James Kottak arrived in Dubai at 3. april, he ran into problems at immigrations and got busted. whatever happened is totally out of our control and we don't know any details about it at this point," the post read. Court reporters said Kottak will be deported within days after his jail term ends. The Gulf News described the sentence as "lenient." The United Arab Emirates is a Muslim country, and while some licensed venues serve alcohol, the Government of Dubai Code of Conduct says that "being caught under the effect of alcohol" outside licensed venues, even in light doses, "can lead to a fine or incarceration."

chatgpt: James Kottak, the drummer of rock band The Scorpions, has admitted to a court in Dubai that he had been drinking before a flight. The Scorpions were on their way to Moscow for a concert when the incident occurred at Dubai International Airport. Witnesses claim that Kottak behaved erratically, insulting Muslims, flipping off passengers and even dropping his pants. Kottak has denied the allegations, but the court sentenced him to a month in jail for his behaviour. The drummer is expected to appeal the decision, but in the meantime, he will remain in custody. The incident has caused outrage among many people, with Kottak being accused of disrespecting the culture and values of the Emirates. The United Arab Emirates is known to have strict laws governing alcohol and behaviour, and Kottak’s behaviour has been seen as a breach of these laws. The Scorpions have distanced themselves from Kottak’s actions, stating that they would not tolerate any behaviour that goes against their values and principles. The band has apologised to their fans and the UAE community for any offence caused by their drummer’s actions. This incident is just one of many involving Western tourists in the UAE, with many visitors unaware of the country’s strict laws on alcohol and behaviour. The UAE has been known to punish foreigners harshly for breaking its laws, and Kottak’s case is an example of this. Many people have expressed concern for Kottak’s wellbeing and mental health, with some suggesting that he may be suffering from addiction or mental health issues. Others have called for more support and awareness for tourists visiting the UAE, to help them understand the laws and culture of the country. In the end, Kottak’s actions have landed him in jail and caused embarrassment and offence to many people. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting the customs and laws of the countries we visit, even if they may be different from our own.
