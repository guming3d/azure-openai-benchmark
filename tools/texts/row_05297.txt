Hundreds arrive by boat every month on Lampedusa an Italian-governed island just off the coast of Africa, before being transferred to temporary accommodation on the mainland. As EU funding for the temporary housing has dried up, Italy has been keen for its northern European neighbours to share the burden. The golden handshake of Euro 500 was introduced by the government as an incentive for migrants to leave emergency camps. But the presence of 300 refugees who have set up a make-shift camp behind the Bismarck monument in Hamburg has infuriated Germany.

Although the refugees have no right to work or state support in Germany, Italy seems to have issued them with temporary passes to travel within the Schengen zone free travel area. 'They have no legal right to accommodation or state support and it would be irresponsible to give them false hope,' Hamburg Social Affairs Minister Detlef Scheele, told Die Welt. 'There is no alternative other than for them to go where they can work and have the legal right to reside, be it Italy or their home country' he added. Hundreds arrive by boat every month.

chatgpt: As Europe continues to face a refugee crisis, Germany has received a significant share of asylum seekers since the Arab Spring, with thousands flocking to the country in search of safety and security. Many of these refugees have fled war-torn and poverty-stricken countries such as Libya, Ghana, and Togo. To incentivize refugees, the German government has announced that it will offer financial assistance to those who choose to return to their home countries voluntarily. The assistance package aims to provide refugees with enough money to start afresh and rebuild their lives once they return to their country of origin. While the German government hopes this initiative will incentivize some refugees to return home, critics argue that the offer of financial assistance is not enough. Many refugees have fled persecution and violence in their home countries and are unwilling to return for fear of their safety. Despite the challenges facing refugees, the number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany continues to rise. In Hamburg, a group of 300 refugees has set up camp behind the Bismarck monument, seeking shelter and support in a new and unfamiliar environment. For many asylum seekers, the journey to Europe is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Many refugees arrive by boat, often facing perilous conditions on the open seas. Once they reach European shores, they are faced with complex asylum procedures and long waiting times for housing and other forms of support. The situation in Hamburg is just one example of the challenges faced by refugees in Germany and across Europe. Many asylum seekers arrive with few possessions and limited resources, making it difficult for them to integrate into their new communities. As the refugee crisis continues to unfold, policymakers and humanitarian organizations must work together to find solutions that provide support and assistance for those in need. While the offer of financial assistance may not be enough to solve the crisis, it provides a glimmer of hope for some refugees, offering them the opportunity to rebuild their lives in their home countries. Overall, the refugee crisis remains a complex issue that requires a multifaceted and coordinated approach. With no easy solutions in sight, refugees continue to rely on the goodwill and compassion of people across Europe and the world.
