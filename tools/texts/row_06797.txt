article: A married Hungarian couple who toured the world raiding the homes of the frail and elderly have been jailed after targeting pensioners in their 80s and 90s in Newcastle. Husband and wife, Jozsef Forgas, 35, and Otilia Domotor, 37, had already racked up convictions for stealing from homes belonging to elderly people in Canada, Belgium and Hungary. And since moving to Newcastle earlier this year they have been responsible for ten more burglaries - each time targeting and terrifying residents in their 80s and 90s.

Forgas, whose many aliases include Kevin Kiss, has been jailed for four years while his wife, also known as Christina Kiss, was sentenced to 32 months, Chronicle Live reports. Judge Brian Forster, at Newcastle Crown Court, told them: 'Because of your need for money you decided to target older members of the community. 'These were mean and shocking offences.' The couple burgled ten homes in Newcastle - most belonging to old and vulnerable residents (picture posed by model) A carer of a couple aged 93 and 83, became suspicious in May when Forgas and Domotor let themselves in - and had CCTV installed while also alerting police. Less than a month later the carer arrived at the house to find Forgas and Domotor back again. Footage of the pair was circulated and the owner of their rented flat identified them, the court heard. During this time, the professional burglars targeted another home which belonged to an 88-year-old man and his 84-year-old wife. The elderly husband, who suffers from Parkinson's, had just returned from a physio session on May 28 when Forgas and Domotor turned up and let themselves into the property. Stuart Graham, prosecuting, said: 'As seems to be the modus operandi for these defendants, the male Forgas engaged in conversation with the householder while the female asked to use the toilet. 'She was in fact looking for anything that could be stolen.' The victim said in a statement to the court: 'I'm nervous and worried they may come back to burgle my property.' Forgas and Domotor both of Chapel House, Newcastle, pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary and asked for seven other offences to be taken into consideration.

chatgpt: A married couple with a history of burglary convictions has been sentenced to jail for a series of burglaries in Newcastle, targeting old and frail residents. Jozsef Forgas, 35, and Otilia Domotor, 37, have been found guilty of burgling 10 homes. They had already been convicted of similar offenses in Canada, Belgium, and Hungary. The couple specifically targeted homes occupied by elderly people, with some of their victims aged 93 and 88 years old. They stole cash, jewelry, and other valuable items. They used a similar method of operation in all the burglaries--breaking into the homes during the daytime when the occupants were out for shopping or medical appointments. The couple was finally arrested after a victim reported seeing two suspicious people lurking around their neighborhood. The police apprehended the couple and discovered significant amounts of stolen property in their possession. After their arrest, police investigated and found that the couple had been involved in a series of other burglaries in the area. During the court proceedings, Forgas and Domotor pleaded guilty to their crime. Upon sentencing, Forgas received a four-year jail term, while Domotor was sentenced to 32 months in prison. The court took into account the couple's previous convictions for similar crimes and the fact that they had targeted vulnerable and defenseless elderly victims in their latest offenses. The sentencing judge emphasized that the crimes were particularly despicable because of the age and vulnerability of the victims. The judge also noted that the burglaries had left many of the victims feeling traumatized and vulnerable, and that the harm caused by the couple went beyond the mere financial loss. The police praised the victim who reported the suspicious people, stating that it was due to their vigilance that the couple was caught. They also thanked the members of the public who provided information that helped in the investigation and arrest of Forgas and Domotor. The people of Newcastle will undoubtedly feel safer now that justice has been served in this case. However, the fact that these kinds of crimes continue to take place only highlights the importance of remaining vigilant and reporting suspicious behavior to the police.
