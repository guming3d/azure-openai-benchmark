article: (CNN) -- You may have heard it before: billions of years ago Mars probably looked more like Earth does now, with clouds and oceans and a much thicker atmosphere. It may even have had some type of microbes. But now it's a barren, frozen desert. So what happened? Where did the air and water go? NASA is launching a new spacecraft to try to find out. It's called MAVEN, which stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution. It's the first mission dedicated to studying the red planet's upper atmosphere. "We expect to learn how the modern Mars works, really in detail. To see its climate state, to understand how the atmosphere is lost to space -- how Mars may have lost a magnetic field -- to take that information and map it back in time, " said NASA's James Garvin. The earliest liftoff time for MAVEN is Monday, November 18, at 1:28 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket will launch the probe into space on a 10-month trip to Mars. It's scheduled to arrive September 22, 2014. The solar-powered probe is about the length of school bus -- 37.5 feet (11.43 meters) long -- and will weigh about 5,410 pounds (2,454 kg) at launch. What killed Mars? New spacecraft will find out . "MAVEN will fill in a very big gap in our understanding of the planet by exploring the upper atmosphere and its influence on the Martian environment," principal investigator Bruce Jakosky, from the University of Colorado, says on his NASA webpage. He says he's "excited that we're providing one step along the path of answering questions about whether life ever existed on Mars." Jakosky's team will use the spacecraft's three instrument suites to try to meet three key objectives: . â€¢ Determine the composition of upper Martian atmosphere . â€¢ Determine how fast Mars is losing what's left of its atmosphere . â€¢ Determine the history of the atmosphere . MAVEN won't make a cool, daring landing like the Mars Curiosity Rover, which has been roaming Mars for more than a year now. Instead, it will orbit between a low of about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the surface to a high of about 3,728 miles (6,000 kilometers). It also will make five dives, flying as low as 77 miles (125 kilometers) in altitude. NASA says the mission will cost $671 million. Interactive: Mars exploration from Viking to MAVEN .

chatgpt: NASA is set to launch a new Mars mission with their MAVEN spacecraft, which is expected to provide unprecedented insights into the Martian atmosphere. The mission is scheduled to arrive at Mars on September 22, 2014, marking a major milestone in NASA's quest to explore the red planet. The MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) spacecraft has been designed to study the Martian atmosphere, with a key focus on understanding how it has evolved over time. The mission will investigate the upper atmosphere of Mars, looking for clues as to how it has changed and what factors may have contributed to those changes. Scientists hope that the MAVEN mission will provide a wealth of new information about the history of Mars, including how the planet lost its once-thick atmosphere and became the cold, barren world we see today. By studying the chemistry of the Martian atmosphere, researchers can gain insights into the conditions that existed when Mars was a much more habitable world. The MAVEN spacecraft is equipped with a range of instruments, including sensors for measuring solar wind and atmospheric particles. It will also carry a suite of cameras, which will send back detailed images of the Martian surface as the spacecraft orbits the planet. The launch of the MAVEN mission has been eagerly awaited by scientists and space enthusiasts alike. It represents a major step forward in our understanding of Mars and the solar system as a whole. With the increasing interest in exploring other planets and even establishing human colonies beyond Earth, the insights gained from the MAVEN mission could prove invaluable. NASA has a long history of exploration on Mars, dating back to the Viking missions in the 1970s. In recent years, the space agency has stepped up its efforts, with a series of successful missions that have provided new data and insights into the red planet's geology, history, and potential for habitability. The MAVEN mission is part of this ongoing effort to explore Mars and learn more about the mysteries of our neighboring planet. It represents a major investment of time, resources, and expertise, with NASA scientists and engineers working tirelessly to ensure the success of the mission. As the MAVEN spacecraft begins its journey to Mars, anticipation is high among those who have followed the project from the beginning. With the promise of new discoveries and insights about Mars and its place in the solar system, the MAVEN mission is sure to capture the imagination of people around the world.
