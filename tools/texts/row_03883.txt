A number of scathing submissions to the council have been made by locals. In one, the neighbour writes: . 'We object to this ride as it is operating without DA approval. We object to its position and the flashing lights which can operate 24 hours a day as this causes noise pollution and loss of amenity to adjacent residents.' Another wrote it was 'an ugly monstrosity' akin to a permanent crane on the skyline. Luna Park was forced to close in 1996 due to financial burdens, including the closure of some rides due to noise complaints. It was reopened in 2004. It is now on the state heritage register.

chatgpt: The Hair Raiser, a towering 37-metre-tall ride located in Sydney, has been causing controversy since it was opened in late 2013 without proper council approval. Neighbours have been claiming that the ride's beams are shining into their apartments and disrupting their quality of life. Despite these concerns, the operators of The Hair Raiser never obtained the required approvals to erect the ride. This has led to North Sydney Council taking legal action against the operators for breaching planning laws. The Council's case will be heard in court soon, with the operators facing hefty fines and being forced to dismantle the ride. Many local residents have been frustrated with the situation and have submitted a number of scathing council submissions voicing their displeasure. They argue that the ride is an eyesore and detracts from their enjoyment of the area. The council shares this sentiment, describing the Hair Raiser as "visually offensive" and not in keeping with the aesthetic of the neighbourhood. The lack of council approval is a major issue for the Hair Raiser's operators. They claim that they were informed by the previous council that they did not require approval to erect the ride, and therefore did not submit the necessary paperwork. Despite this, North Sydney Council is determined to pursue legal action against the operators. They argue that the ride is causing disruption to local residents and that the operators have shown a disregard for planning laws. The Hair Raiser's future remains uncertain, with the operators potentially facing hefty fines and the ride being dismantled. Local residents hope that the situation will be resolved soon, so they can enjoy their peaceful neighbourhood once again. In the meantime, the Hair Raiser remains a controversial topic, with many debating whether or not it should have been allowed to operate without council approval. Some argue that the ride is a valuable tourist attraction that brings in visitors to the area, while others feel that it is a blight on the neighbourhood and has no place in a residential area. Regardless of one's opinion, the Hair Raiser's future will be decided soon, as the legal battle between the operators and North Sydney Council continues.
