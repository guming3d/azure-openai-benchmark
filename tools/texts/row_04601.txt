article: By . Ruth Styles . From stretchy leggings to billowing tunic tops and tent dresses, the wardrobe of the average mother-to-be isn't always a particularly glamorous affair. But that could all be about to change if Chanel supremo Karl Lagerfeld gets his way, after he closed the French fashion house's latest show with a pregnant bride. Dressed in an elegant crêpe de Chine gown with a gold brocade cape and a neat line of buttons along the bodice, the model, her hair teased into a striking quiff, even allowed herself a smile as she processed along the runway on the arm of the German designer.

Cheered on by a crowd of clapping fashionistas, among them US Vogue's Anna Wintour, Kristen Stewart and Jared Leto, the pair stopped to take a bow at the end of the runway before the model planted a kiss on Lagerfeld's cheek. It was a dramatic end to a dramatic show which offered up a glimpse of Lagerfeld's romantic vision for autumn: one replete with sculptural shapes and elegantly cosy textures. Brocade, tweed and heavy silk all featured heavily, as did gorgeously touchable prints - many of which appeared inspired by William Morris and the pre-Raphaelites. In a departure from last January's S/S14 collection where models clad in neat, knee-length dresses and trainers took centre stage, Lagerfeld's vision for winter took a darker turn with marabou-fringed tweed and bodices studded with armour-like jewels taking centre stage.

But while ladylike might be back, heels, it seems, are not - at least according to Lagerfeld and Chanel. Instead of skyscraper shoes, models on the catwalk at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées in Paris wore delicate flat sandals in black, silver and white, each one tied in place with pretty grosgrain ribbons. They might not have been the most practical of winter shoes but for well-heeled pregnant mothers like the star of the show, they could be just what the doctor ordered.

chatgpt: Fashionistas at the recent Chanel show were treated to a memorable moment when a pregnant bride took to the runway in an exquisite couture gown. The bride, who appeared calm and poised despite her condition, was the highlight of the event. The model wore a stunning cream gown that featured a flowing train and a fitted bodice that hugged her curves in just the right places. But it was the gold brocade cape that really stole the show. The cape trailed behind her as she walked, adding an element of regal sophistication to the already elegant ensemble. But while the wedding dress may have been the main attraction, the rest of the collection did not disappoint. Chanel's A/W15 collection took a darker turn this season, with distressed tweed and jewelled bodices dominating the catwalk. The collection featured a variety of textures and fabrics, with leather and lace also making an appearance. Flats continued to be the shoe of choice, with models sporting ribbon-tied sandals that added a touch of glamour to the otherwise practical footwear. The models themselves seemed to embody the spirit of the collection, with their hair and makeup matching the sombre tone of the clothing. But it wasn't just the fashion that caught people's attention. The front row was teeming with A-listers, including Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and Twilight actress Kristen Stewart. Wintour, who is renowned for her impeccable sense of style, looked sophisticated and chic in a black and white ensemble. Stewart, on the other hand, opted for a more casual look, sporting a simple black sweater and leather pants. Overall, the Chanel A/W15 show was a huge success, with the pregnant bride stealing the spotlight and the collection delivering a refreshing take on winter fashion. With its mix of feminine elegance and dark, brooding tones, the collection is sure to be a hit among fashion-forward women this season.
