"Rami al-Sayed was crucial in getting the truth out through his videos posted on the Internet," said Omar Shaker, a friend and a volunteer at Homs Media Center, a media group set up by activists to share information and videos about the city's Baba Amr neighborhood. "We will really miss him, especially the medical team who relied on him to document all the civilian injuries and deaths on video," he added. Doctors struggle to save wounded children . Al-Sayed's own fatal injuries were also apparently recorded on Tuesday as his brother and a physician mourned his death at a mosque's basement. The video was later uploaded to Al-Sayed's YouTube channel. See Al-Sayed's YouTube channel . In the video, Dr. Mohammed al-Mohammed stands by al-Sayed's dead body and says, "I want to bring you the latest news, the martyrdom of one of the most important cameramen and one of our most important journalists in Baba Amr." "He kept bleeding here in the field hospital for more than three hours; we tried to evacuate him outside the neighborhood but to no avail," al-Mohammed added. Health workers set up underground network . The 27-year-old was hit by rocket shrapnel as he tried to help a family flee bombardment, residents told CNN. "Rami was killed because he was documenting and sending real-life stories from Baba Amr. Rami was killed because he was filming the facts; but we will have 1,000 Ramis. ... Our revolution will prevail," the doctor said as the camera zoomed in on shrapnel wounds on al-Sayed's chest, abdomen and legs. The video-sharing site Bambuser released a statement Tuesday mourning al-Sayed's death, also referring to him as "Syrian pioneer," his nickname on various social media outlets. "Rami Ahmad al-Sayed has been one of the bravest and forefront fighters in getting the world's attention on what's going on in Homs, Syria. This afternoon, cameraman and journalist Rami Ahmad al-Sayed did his last broadcast -- he and his three friends were soon after this killed by the Assad armed forces," the statement said. U.S. calls for international action on Syria . CNN was unable to independently verify the circumstances of al-Sayed's death. His last message to followers on Twitter was: "Baba Amr is facing genocide right now. I do not want people to simply say our hearts are with you! We need actions. We need campaigns everywhere inside Syria and outside Syria. We need all people in front of all embassies all over the world. In a few hours there will be no place called Baba Amr and I expect this to be my last message. No one will forgive you for just talking without any action!" Al-Sayed, who had lost a cousin and a fellow videographer in December, is survived by his wife and an 18-month-old daughter. CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a tragic turn of events, Rami al-Sayed, a 27-year-old Syrian videographer, was killed on Tuesday by shrapnel as he was documenting the ongoing unrest in the country. Witnesses on the scene reported that al-Sayed was struck by the shrapnel and died almost instantly. Despite his young age, al-Sayed was a well-known and respected figure within the Syrian activist community. He was a prolific user of social media, uploading countless videos documenting the brutal conflict that has torn the country apart. His work was regarded as instrumental in spreading awareness of the situation and raising the profile of the Syrian people's struggle. "Rami was crucial in getting the truth out through his videos," said a friend of al-Sayed, who asked not to be named. "He was totally committed to the cause and worked tirelessly to bring attention to what was happening here. His loss will be deeply felt by all of us." In a heartbreaking video posted on YouTube, a doctor can be seen kneeling by al-Sayed's body, sobbing uncontrollably as he tries to revive him. Another man, who is believed to be al-Sayed's brother, can be heard saying prayers over the body. The video has since gone viral, with many people commenting on the terrible loss. The death of al-Sayed is the latest in a long line of tragedies to befall Syria in recent years. The conflict, which started over a decade ago, has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more. The situation shows no signs of abating, despite repeated efforts by the international community to reach a peaceful resolution. Many people are now calling on world leaders to take a more active role in bringing an end to the conflict. The United Nations has been heavily involved in the region, but so far its efforts have not been enough to stop the bloodshed. Activists like al-Sayed were working tirelessly to bring the plight of the Syrian people to the world's attention, and his death is a stark reminder of just how dangerous that work can be. Despite the risks, however, many people like al-Sayed continue to document the war and bring the stories of those affected to light. It is a dangerous and difficult job, but one that is essential if the world is to fully understand the scale of the crisis in Syria. For now, the Syrian people continue to suffer, caught in the midst of a conflict that shows no signs of ending. The legacy of people like Rami al-Sayed, who dedicated his life to bringing the truth to light, will be remembered by those who continue to fight for a better future for the Syrian people.
