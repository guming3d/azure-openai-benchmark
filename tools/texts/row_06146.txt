article: (CNN) -- A 39-year-old woman in Utah told police she either strangled or suffocated at least six babies immediately after she gave birth to them over a period of years, a document shows. Megan Hunstman appeared in court Monday where she is facing six counts of murder, according to Chief Michael Smith with the Pleasant Grove, Utah, police department. She's being held on $6 million bail. Over the weekend, authorities found the remains of seven infants at a home where Huntsman used to live. "During her interview, Ms. Huntsman admitted that between 1996 and 2006, she gave birth to at least seven babies at the Pleasant Grove residence, and that all of the babies, but one, were born alive, and that she either strangled or suffocated the babies immediately after they were born," read a probable cause statement. "According to Ms. Huntsman, she then concealed their bodies inside boxes and placed them inside the garage of the Pleasant Grove residence," the statement added. Police first responded to the home on Saturday. Huntsman's estranged husband, Darren West, contacted authorities after finding a baby wrapped in a plastic bag in the garage, the statement said. A search warrant was obtained and officers discovered six more bodies at the home. "Each baby was found wrapped in either a towel or a shirt, placed inside of a plastic bag, and each was contained in a separate cardboard box," the statement read. It was not immediately clear whether Huntsman has retained counsel. According to Smith, West does not face charges. "He has been cooperative," the police chief said. "But we continue to investigate what type of knowledge or role he may have played, if any." The Utah case sounds eerily familiar to a case in France a few years ago. Prosecutors there charged a woman with murder in 2010 after she admitted giving birth to and smothering eight babies over a 17-year period. The case came to light when a couple gardening in their backyard in the northern town of Villers-au-Tertre found two babies' bodies in sealed plastic bags and called police. Police spoke to Dominique Cottrez and her husband, who had previously lived in the home, and Cottrez admitted immediately that she was the mother of the two babies, prosecutor Eric Vaillant told reporters. She then told police about six others concealed in their garage. It is unclear from subsequent media reports about the Cottrez case whether it has been resolved.

chatgpt: Megan Hunstman, a 39-year-old woman from Utah, is facing multiple charges of murder after the discovery of seven infants' bodies in a home where she used to live. The shocking and disturbing discovery has left members of the community in disbelief, leaving many wondering how such a heinous crime could have been committed. The infants' bodies were found at a home in Pleasant Grove, Utah, on April 12, 2014. The authorities were alerted to the bodies by the woman's estranged husband, who had been cleaning out the garage of the home when he found a small white box that contained a baby's body. He called the police, who quickly discovered six more bodies in the home, all wrapped in towels or shirts, and placed in cardboard boxes. The discovery of the infants' bodies has shocked the quiet community in Pleasant Grove, with many residents expressing disbelief that such a horrific crime could occur within their midst. "This is just heartbreaking," said one resident. "I can't believe something like this could happen here. Our hearts go out to the families of these innocent children." Megan Huntsman has been charged with six counts of murder, and is being held on $6 million bail. According to court documents, Huntsman has confessed to strangling or suffocating six of the seven infants shortly after giving birth to them between 1996 and 2006. She allegedly wrapped their bodies in towels or shirts, placed them in plastic bags, and stored them in the garage of the home where she used to live. The case has drawn comparisons to a similar case that occurred in France a few years ago, where a woman named Dominique Cottrez was charged with the murder of eight of her newborn babies. Cottrez, like Huntsman, had hidden the infants' bodies in her home, and had been able to keep the killings a secret for years. The discovery of the infants' bodies has also raised questions about the role of the authorities in preventing such crimes from occurring. Many have criticized the lack of oversight that allowed Huntsman to give birth to and kill six infants without being detected. "This is a tragic reminder of the importance of vigilant reporting and oversight," said one official. "We must do everything in our power to ensure that something like this never happens again." As the community of Pleasant Grove struggles to come to terms with the tragic discovery, many are calling for justice for the infants whose lives were tragically cut short. "This is a terrible tragedy that has touched everyone in our community," said one resident. "Our hearts go out to these innocent babies, and we will do everything we can to ensure that justice is served."
