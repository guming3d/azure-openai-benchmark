article: (CNN) -- Since 2005, Bruno Serato has been serving up free pasta dinners to children, many of whom are poor and live in motels with their families. Serato is an Italian chef and the founder of Caterina's Club, a nonprofit that provides dinner seven days a week to more than 300 children at the Boys & Girls Club in Anaheim, California. CNN asked Serato for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Bruno Serato: I was home, getting ready to go to work after talking to my mom in Italy over Skype. I can't express the feelings I had at that moment. I was so happy. I was in tears. I wanted to scream like Tarzan! It was amazing news. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to Caterina's Club? Serato: This gives me hope that I can make Caterina's Club a leader in resolving children's hunger in America. I do believe that, all together, we can make a big difference. If restaurants and chefs across America worked with their local Boys & Girls Clubs and followed our program, we could feed millions of children. I feel like I'm a voice on this Earth and my mission is to tell people: "Let's step forward. Don't just talk about it. Do something about it." We can make this a better place to be and fight the poverty in our country. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Serato: It will help me to keep doing what I do and serve more children in need. I also hope to travel to promote the program and make more people aware of our national "motel kids" problem. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Serato: In America, in our own backyards, we have kids who go to bed hungry. If we do something about it, we will have no hungry children in America. If you give up one cup of coffee a day, you can feed 10 kids. One bag of pasta costs a few dollars, and that can serve 10 kids. If I can feed more than 300 kids alone, all together we can feed millions. Read the full story on CNN Hero Bruno Serato: .

chatgpt: Anaheim, California - Bruno Serato has been named one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011 for feeding over 300 children every night in Anaheim, California. Serato, a chef and restaurant owner, has been serving pasta and other Italian dishes at the Boys and Girls Club of Anaheim for almost a decade now.  His inspiration for starting the program came from a simple incident where he met a boy who asked for some leftover pasta. That incident made him realize the need for nutritious meals for the financially backward families. Serato started serving food to needy children as a one-time affair but he felt moved by the sheer numbers of hungry children in the community. Now, he runs the nonprofit organization, Caterina's Club, named after his mother who taught him the importance of helping others. The club not only feeds the children but also provides shelter for families that have been living in motels.  Feeding more than 300 children every night is no small feat but Serato believes that by working together, people can make a big difference in the world. Serato shared his vision, "All together, we can make a big difference and feed millions." Serato has garnered national recognition for his work with Caterina's Club. In 2011, he was named one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes. He has also been honored by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative.  Serato's life-changing work has not only impacted the children he feeds but also the community he serves. His efforts have led to the opening of a second location in the area, expanding his reach to even more children. He has also written a book, "The Power of Pasta," telling his journey from being a chef of Italian cuisine to a crusader of childhood hunger. The book has received overwhelming support, with a portion of proceeds going towards feeding children at Caterina's Club. Serato's contribution to the society goes beyond feeding the needy children. He has also inspired others to get involved in helping the less fortunate. His belief in the power of working together has led to the formation of several partnerships with organizations like Disneyland Resort and the Anaheim Ducks hockey team. Serato's work has garnered national attention and recognition for the need to address childhood hunger across the country. He has become a symbol of hope for children in need and a beacon of inspiration for those looking to make a difference in their communities. In the words of Bruno Serato himself, "All together, we can make a big difference and feed millions."
