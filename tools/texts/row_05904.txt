The Blue Hole . Just off the coast of Belize lies an underwater paradise for novice snorkelers and veteran divers. The Blue Hole is world-renowned as an open-water diving spot. During the Pleistocene era, the Blue Hole was a giant cave on dry land. The stalactites and stalagmites remain and are staggering sights through the crystal blue water. Ambergris Caye . Ambergris Caye is the largest island of Belize, accessible via a small airplane from the mainland of Belize. Believe it or not, the best way to tour Ambergris Caye is by golf cart. Drive around and stop to see mangrove trees, the Belize Barrier Reef that almost touches the shore and lagoons teeming with crocodiles. Maya ruins of Lamanai . Some use Belize as the entry point to Tikal, the famed ruins in Guatemala, but it is also home to several ancient Maya cities. One of the more interesting is Lamanai, which was still occupied by the Maya when the Spanish first arrived. The cultural collision is forever noted here, between the pyramids and the ruins of two Spanish churches. Caves Branch River tubing . Geologists recently stumbled across a vast subterranean network of Maya ceremonial caves. At the Nohoch Che'en Caves Branch Archeological Reserve, guides will lead you across jungle pools to the caverns filled with artifacts like sacrificial skeletons. The spiritual underwater history lesson is a must-do. Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary . Interested in the chance see a jaguar up close and personal? The Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary is the world's first jaguar sanctuary. And, it's also a campground where you can pitch your tent, go hiking, and listen to a symphony of jungle sounds.

chatgpt: Belize, a country on the eastern coast of Central America, boasts of many beautiful sights and destinations. Among them is the world-renowned Blue Hole, a popular destination for diving enthusiasts. Belize's Ambergris Caye is best experienced via golf cart. Lamanai, on the other hand, has a rich history with the ancient Maya. The Blue Hole, located in the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, is a natural sinkhole that is approximately 1,000 feet in diameter and over 400 feet deep. The Blue Hole is a unique diving spot due to its deep diving opportunities and clear water, where divers can see various marine species such as reef sharks, giant groupers, and colorful tropical fish. Jacques Cousteau, a famous French explorer, named the Blue Hole as one of the top ten diving spots in the world. Therefore, visitors from all over the world travel to Belize to cross off this thrilling experience from their bucket list. Another site that visitors to Belize must experience is Ambergris Caye, the largest island off the coast of Belize. One of the best ways to tour this beautiful destination is via golf carts. The roads leading through San Pedro, the island's largest town, are relatively narrow, making it easier to maneuver around and explore the diverse landscape of the island. Visitors can rent golf carts and navigate all around the island, pausing along the way to enjoy the beaches, restaurants, and local culture. Lamanai is another popular tourist destination located in the Orange Walk District of Belize. The Lamanai archaeological site dates back to the Classical period of the Mayan civilization, over 1,500 years ago. The site is located on the banks of the New River Lagoon, and its name means, "Submerged Crocodile" or "Crocodile Submerged in Water" in Yucatec, the Mayan language. 
An interesting fact about Lamanai is that it was still occupied by the Maya when the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century. Lamanai contains a number of impressive Mayan pyramids and temples, which visitors can explore and learn about the culture and history of the ancient Mayan civilization. Belize, with its rich natural beauty and rich cultural heritage, is an attractive destination for tourists from around the world. The Blue Hole, Ambergris Caye, and Lamanai are just a few of the must-see places in Belize, making it a paradise, and a top-rated travel destination for adventurous travelers.
