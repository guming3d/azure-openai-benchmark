article: Sir Richard Branson has confirmed he and his son Sam will be the first passengers on a commercial flight into space in spring 2015. 'I would very much hope that before Christmas, Virgin Galactic has visited space,' the British billionaire and head of Virgin Galactic said. 'And then we'll move the whole program to New Mexico where myself and my son will be the first people to go up from the Spaceport in the spring of next year.' Scroll down for video . Sir Richard Branson confirms he'll take son Sam with him when Virgin Galactic launches its first commercial flights into space in spring 2015 . However, considering the project was originally scheduled for 'lift-off' in 2008 following around £138 million of investment of Spaceport America in New Mexico, many won't be holding their breath for the maiden voyage. As well as voters in the deprived region of having to agree to pay 'special taxes' to fund the project since its inception back in 2005, the promise of 700 flights a year by 2015, with two flights out a day, has failed to materialise. New Mexico's hope that it would be spearheading a new technological age remains a distant dream, despite Branson's latest newscast. According to Reuters, a grand total of ten jobs have so far actually been created on the site for local residents. That’s 0.33 per cent of the number that was originally promised. And works out at £13.85 million per job. Sam Branson, right, pictured in conversation with Grey Goose Maitre de Chai Francois Thibault, will assist his father Richard into space in 2015 . Branson was speaking at an event at the Rose Space Center and Planetarium in New York in conjuction with Grey Goose vodka, a sponsor for Virgin Galactic's world-first passenger flight into space. Seats on the flights into space are already being snapped up for the princely sum of £250,000 ahead of the spring launch at Spaceport America in New Mexico. However, Sir Richard is facing a ‘backlash’ from some of the nearly 700 passengers who have already paid for a ticket on the craft. Some stumped up the fee as long ago as 2005, but still have no idea when they will eventually reach space. The 600-plus takers for the flights are already benefiting from their ticket purchase, which by extension enters them into an exclusive club that has seen them visit Necker Island and the Mojave Desert with Branson along with undertaking G-force training.

chatgpt: Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, has announced that he and his son, Sam, will be the first passengers on Virgin Galactic's first commercial flight into space. The highly anticipated launch, which is scheduled for spring 2015, will take off from the company's Spaceport in New Mexico. The historic flight comes as a culmination of years of development and testing for Virgin Galactic, which aims to offer commercial space tourism to interested travelers. Over 600 seats have already been sold for the sought-after experience, which carries a price tag of £250,000. The project has faced numerous setbacks and delays, however. Originally planned for 2009, the first commercial spaceflight was initially delayed due to equipment issues and then postponed again following a fatal test flight in 2014. But now, with the launch date set for next year, the team at Virgin Galactic is working tirelessly to ensure a safe and successful journey. Sir Richard Branson, who has long been an advocate for space exploration, sees the trip as the realization of a lifelong dream. He has previously said that Virgin Galactic's ultimate goal is to make space travel more accessible to the public, allowing everyday people to experience the awe-inspiring views and sensations of space flight. The flight is set to debut Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo vehicle, a suborbital craft that can carry six passengers and two pilots. The vehicle will launch from a mothership, which carries the SpaceShipTwo until it reaches an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet. Once released, the vehicle's rockets will ignite, propelling it into space and giving passengers several minutes of weightlessness and the chance to see the Earth from a unique perspective. Virgin Galactic's journey into space has been met with both excitement and skepticism. Critics have voiced concerns about the safety of the vehicle, citing the 2014 test flight accident as evidence of the dangers of space travel. However, supporters argue that the development of private space travel is a key step towards advancing scientific research and exploration beyond our planet. Despite the setbacks and criticism, Virgin Galactic's first commercial spaceflight is poised to make history. With Sir Richard Branson and his son among its very first passengers, the flight signals a landmark moment for space exploration and a giant leap forward in the development of commercial space travel.
