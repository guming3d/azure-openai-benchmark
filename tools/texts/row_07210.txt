A taxi driver could lose his cab licence after refusing to take a fare because the passenger had a guide dog. James Chesney, 53, was fined £1,000 for telling the customer his boss would ‘go ballistic’ if the golden retriever was allowed into the car. The driver claimed Desmond Baldwin's guide dog, Denby, could cause the daughter of one of the other drivers to have an allergic reaction. Chesney, from Droylsden, Tameside, was charged under the Equality Act with refusing to take a pre-booked disabled passenger because he was accompanied by an assistance dog. Taxi driver James Chesney, pictured left, has been found guilty of breaching the Equality Act for refusing to pick up blind customer Desmond Baldwin, pictured right, from his house because he was with his guide dog Denby . He denied the offence but was found guilty by Manchester magistrates after a three-hour trial. He was fined £300 and ordered to pay £800 costs. The court heard how Mr Baldwin had pre-booked the taxi to go for a meal with friend Stephen Kingsberry, who is also blind, at The Pearl restaurant in Audenshaw on June 24. Laura Raine, prosecuting on behalf of Manchester council, said that when Chesney arrived he refused to take the fare, stating his boss would ‘go ballistic’. Mr Kingsberry’s carer Pauline Harrop told magistrates she was ‘100 per cent sure’ that Chesney refused to take them on those grounds. Chesney said he believed the car was exempt from taking guide dogs because his colleague - who also drove the vehicle - had a poorly daughter who may be allergic to dogs.

But he also claimed he was about to take the men to the restaurant when another cab, from Hastings taxis, the same company, pulled up and took them. James Street, defending, told the court the firm had sent another car as a replacement and added: 'He didn’t refuse the job, he queried it, and when he was told to go (and do the job) he did it.' Magistrates ruled that Chesney ‘appeared confused by the sequence of events’ when he gave evidence in court, while Mr Baldwin and Miss Harrop were ‘clear and concise’. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Baldwin, 59, from South Elmsall, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire, said: 'I’m glad he’s been found guilty. It’s over with now, and let’s hope it reminds the other taxi drivers they can’t refuse people with guide dogs.' Mr Kingsberry, who made an official complaint which sparked the investigation, added: 'I believe everyone who has a guide dog has the right to go where they want.'

chatgpt: A taxi driver from Bradford has been fined over £1,000 for breaching the Equality Act after refusing to have a guide dog in his car because of a passenger's allergy to dogs. The driver, James Chesney, 53, reportedly declined a ride for Desmond Baldwin, who is registered as blind, after the latter requested to bring Denby, his assistance dog, as he traveled. Baldwin had booked the taxi ride from a local firm, but was refused service by Chesney, who cited the potential for the driver's daughter to suffer an allergic reaction to the dog. The incident was reported to the police, who subsequently arrested Chesney on charges of discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, which requires service providers to accommodate disabled customers, including those who use assistance animals. Chesney's defense lawyer argued in court that the taxi driver had acted out of concern for the safety of other passengers, who might have allergic reactions to dogs, and was not motivated by discrimination against Baldwin. However, the court rejected the argument, citing the clear provisions of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on disability. During the trial, Baldwin shared how he relies on his guide dog to navigate the world, and how incidents like this undermine his independence and dignity. Baldwin expressed relief that the court had taken the matter seriously and held Chesney accountable for his actions. The judge in the trial condemned the driver's behavior and emphasized the rights of all passengers to access equal services, regardless of any disabilities or assistance dogs. The judge also expressed hope that the court's verdict served as a warning to other taxi drivers to comply with the laws that ensure equal access for all. After the trial, Baldwin shared his hope that the verdict will help raise awareness about the rights of assistance dog users, and the importance of treating them with respect and dignity. He also stated that he did not wish for Chesney to lose his job, but rather hoped that the former driver would learn from the incident and respect the rights of all passengers, regardless of their disabilities. The incident highlights the ongoing challenges faced by disabled people and their service animals, despite the legal protections afforded to them. Discrimination remains a persistent issue, as some service providers continue to put up barriers to access, citing unfounded fears or misconceptions. It is essential that service providers, including taxi drivers, receive the training and support necessary to provide equal and respectful services to all customers. In conclusion, the verdict in the Chesney trial represents a significant recognition of the rights of disabled and visually impaired people, and their assistance animals, to access equal services. The verdict sends a strong message to all service providers that they must comply with the provisions of the Equality Act and respect the dignity and rights of all their customers. The verdict also underscores the need for ongoing education and awareness-raising to eliminate discrimination and barriers to equal access to services.
