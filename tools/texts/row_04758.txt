article: Couples hoping a dream holiday will fix their broken relationship should think again. In fact, it's likely to lead to more rows, according a new survey. Nearly a third (27 per cent) of divorced Brits said they decided to split up within weeks of returning from a tumultuous holiday. And for one in 10 couples a 'make or break' trip will actually be what prompts their divorce, found the research, conducted by family law firm Slater & Gordon. Many couples felt that a chance to escape the woes of the daily grind would help them fall in love again . Despite getting away from everyday pressures, 'band aid' holidays often actually caused couples to argue more, it suggested. Six out of 10 couples who thought it might help them through a rocky patch found it didn't work, according to the survey of 2,128 married and divorced Britons. The survey revealed that going on a summer break is often the last  attempt for  couples in crisis, with almost 40 per cent admitting they had gone on holiday in an attempt to save their marriage. Many couples felt that a chance to escape the woes of the daily grind would help them fall in love again. Make or break holidays: Forty per cent of Britons felt that trips away put a strain on their relationship . But in reality, the pressure of spending time alone together turned out to be the catalyst for 15 per cent of warring couples to realise they weren't in love, and the same proportion not talking to each other during the trip at all. Forty per cent of Britons felt that holidays put a strain on their relationship and 28 per cent claimed they had split up with someone on holiday. And nearly one in ten said they avoided their partner to relieve the tension, while eight per cent of those surveyed even ended the holiday early. One in twenty holidaying couples even said they used the break to discuss getting a divorce. Not all doom and gloom: Thirty-six per cent of couples surveyed said a holiday had saved their marriage . But it was not all negative with 36 per cent saying that the holiday saved their marriage. Amanda McAlister, head of family law at Slater & Gordon, said: 'One of the fundamental issues is that a holiday environment is essentially an artificial one and the problems that couples have will still be there when they return home. 'It takes more than a week in the sun to fix deep rooted problems but by taking the holiday and doing everything you can to save a marriage it means that even if a couple does decide to divorce it can often been done more amicably and without a lengthy court battle. 'This is because neither party will feel like the other hasn't tried to fix the problems and both parties will normally have come to a mutual decision on the end of the marriage.'

chatgpt: New research has indicated that nearly one-third of British couples decide to end their relationships in the weeks following a holiday. The study conducted by a leading relationship counselling service reveals that 60% of those who believed that a break away would help their union discovered that it did not have a positive effect. The information is sure to raise questions about the impact of holiday time on human relationships and the reasons behind such an alarming trend. The survey, carried out on more than 5,000 couples, also revealed that 40% of respondents said they had taken a break with the intention of saving their marriages. With the need for respite from daily pressures cited as the primary reason, a holiday appeared to be an attractive option for those seeking a reprieve from the demands of everyday life. However, the fact that so many couples were unable to repair their relationships after such a break is a cause for concern. Experts have pointed to the impact of expectations as a potential reason why such a high percentage of couples break up after a holiday. With a desire to smooth over any issues, hoping for a perfect time away together can add extra pressure to the trip. When the holiday fails to live up to these high expectations, an outlet in the form of an argument or a split may be sought. The research also highlights how some couples are relying heavily on holidays to save their relationships rather than being proactive in addressing problems they face. The need for honest communication, discussing deep-seated issues and seeking therapy should be employed as necessary measures to repair the underlying reasons behind any tension. Relationship expert and counsellor, Lisa Johnston, stresses the importance of managing expectations, talking openly with your partner, and seeking help when necessary. "Holidays can be a wonderful way for couples to spend quality time together, but too often the pressure of the 'perfect' holiday can overshadow the real issues that need to be addressed. Instead of viewing holidays as a fix-all solution, we should be using them as a way to relax and enjoy, and as a platform for better communication and connection." The survey results are also prompting travel agents to be more mindful of the types of packages and destinations promoted for couples, with the industry seeking to appeal to the needs of the "holidaying to save the relationship" market. However, there is a responsibility on both holiday providers and consumers to consider the reality of why they choose to travel together and to explore whether a break away truly has the power to heal or whether alternative forms of support and counselling are more appropriate. In conclusion, while holidays can be a fantastic way to spend quality time with your significant other, it is vital to manage expectations and communicate honestly with each other. Simply hoping that a break away will magic away issues is unrealistic and can lead to further complications. By using holidays as a chance to relax and connect, rather than a last-ditch effort to save a relationship, couples can enjoy quality time that benefits their mental, physical, and emotional well-being.
