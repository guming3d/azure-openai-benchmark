chatgpt: An employee of a closed Manhattan fast-food chain made a grave mistake that led to an armed robbery on Saturday night. The employee, whose identity remains unknown, let in two robbers after they asked to use the ATM at the store despite it being closed for business. One of the masked robbers immediately pulled out a revolver and ordered the guard into the bathroom.

The footage was turned over to the NYPD, who is now tracking the suspects, attempting to apprehend them and bring them to justice. The incident has left the community in shock and outraged at the employee's actions. The management of the fast-food chain released a statement stating that the employee's decision directly led to the robbery, and they are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation. They also noted that they have taken steps to review their security protocols and guard training to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. Despite the clear threat posed by the robbers, many are wondering why the employee did not press the panic button or notify the authorities when the situation began to escalate.
