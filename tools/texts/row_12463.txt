article: NEWARK, New Jersey (CNN) -- The most "far-flung and exotic fugitive investigation ever conducted by the U.S. Marshals Service" ended early Sunday with convicted child molester Alan Horowitz in custody on U.S. soil. Alan Horowitz was convicted in 1991 on 34 counts of child molestation. Officers from the U.S. Marshals service arrested the 60-year-old at Newark Liberty International Airport after a 15-hour flight from New Delhi, India. The ordained Orthodox rabbi and former child psychologist was arrested on May 22 at a seaside resort in Mahabalipuram, India, according to parole officer Robert Georgia. An agent from the Diplomatic Security Service escorted him aboard the Continental Airlines flight, authorities said. He is being held at a correctional facility in New Jersey and will appear before an extradition judge on July 16th before being taken to New York to face a parole violation charge there. He also faces a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.   Watch Horowitz in custody at Newark airport Â» . A number of Internet tipsters in India were responsible for alerting the Marshal's service to Horowitz's whereabouts, said U.S. Marshal Gary Mattison, who was assigned to track down Horowitz last year. Horowitz served 13 years of a 10-20 year sentence for child molestation and was released on parole in 2004, authorities said. In June 2006, he fled the country shortly after meeting with his parole officer, setting off the manhunt that involved the Indian police, agents from the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service, and U.S. Marshals, U.S. Marshals told CNN. Horowitz's 1991 conviction was on 34 counts of child molestation in Schenectady, New York. A dual citizen of the United States and Israel, Horowitz has also been convicted of "perverted sexual practices" in Maryland, where he was found guilty of abusing one of his patients, federal marshals said. During the 1980s, while he was living in Israel, he was the subject of a police investigation into charges he was sexually abusing his second wife's children, according to the U.S. Marshal service. He also faced another sexual misconduct investigation while living in North Carolina, authorities say. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Katia Porzecanski contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Monday, Orthodox rabbi and former child psychologist, Rabbi Eliezer Berland Horowitz, was escorted aboard a U.S.-bound flight by a U.S. agent. Horowitz, who has been the subject of investigations in both the United States and Israel, has multiple convictions against him. The rabbi was arrested by Israeli authorities in 2017 for his role in a sex trafficking ring. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eighteen months in prison. Horowitz was previously convicted of sexual assault in the United States and fled to South Africa to avoid prosecution. He was extradited to Israel in 2016 to face charges. Despite his past convictions, Horowitz continues to have a large following of supporters who believe he is innocent. His followers claim that he is a spiritual leader and a holy man who has helped many people find happiness and inner peace. The reason for Horowitz's recent travel to the United States is unclear. However, his presence on the flight has raised concerns among authorities. The United States is currently taking a tough stance on immigration and security, and any individual with a record of criminal convictions will face extra scrutiny. The U.S. agent who escorted Horowitz was likely tasked with ensuring that he did not cause any disturbances on the flight. Horowitz was likely subjected to additional security checks before being allowed to board the plane. The Jewish Orthodox community in the United States has been quick to distance itself from the disgraced rabbi. Many feel that Horowitz's behavior goes against the values and principles of the Orthodox faith. As the investigation into Horowitz continues, it is unclear what his future holds. Despite his past, he remains a deeply polarizing figure in the Jewish Orthodox community, with many supporting his spiritual teachings while others condemn his actions. For now, Horowitz remains under the watchful eye of authorities in the United States. His supporters will undoubtedly continue to rally behind him, while others will call for justice to be served.
