chatgpt: Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, a prominent property magnate based in Hong Kong, is offering a staggering bounty to any man who can sweep his daughter off her feet. The reward, amounting to HKD 1 billion (approximately USD 128 million), is open to any eligible bachelor who can win the heart of 33-year-old Gigi Chao - even though she is openly gay. The news of the bounty offer comes just months after Gigi Chao made headlines for marrying her long-term girlfriend in France, a move that saw her father receive a flood of media attention and prompted him to publicly offer the bounty for any man who could capture his daughter's heart. However, Gigi has made it clear that she is not interested in the bounty or in any potential male suitors. She has referred to the offer as "quite entertaining" and emphasized that she is happily married and committed to her wife. She also expressed her belief that her father was simply trying to make a point rather than actively trying to matchmake. Many in Hong Kong and beyond have criticized Cecil's offer as both sexist and homophobic. The businessman has already faced backlash for his comments about his daughter's sexuality, including his past claims that homosexuality is a "social evil" and that it is a choice that can be "corrected." Despite the controversy, the bounty has attracted widespread curiosity and speculation. It remains to be seen whether any man will attempt to win the prize, and if so, how Gigi and her wife will respond. The Chao family is well-known in Hong Kong for their wealth and influence. Cecil himself has made headlines in the past for his extravagant lifestyle, including his passion for large yachts and luxury cars. He is also the founder of the property development company Cheuk Nang, which has holdings in both Hong Kong and China. The bounty offer for Gigi's heart may be seen by some as a reflection of the traditional attitudes and values that still persist in some parts of Hong Kong and Asia at large. However, it has also sparked a wider conversation about acceptance and tolerance in the modern world, particularly in the aftermath of the recent landmark court rulings on same-sex marriage in Taiwan and other Asian countries. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that Cecil Chao's bounty has put both him and his daughter in the spotlight once again. For Gigi, it serves as a reminder of the challenges that still remain for LGBTQ+ individuals in society, even in the face of legal and social progress.
