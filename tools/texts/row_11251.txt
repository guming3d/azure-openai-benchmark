chatgpt: Queens Park Rangers (QPR) are currently finding themselves in a spot of trouble as they are languishing in 19th place in the Premier League. As if the situation wasn't enough already, the West London side hasn't garnered a single point away from home this season, adding to their already mounting woes. In light of this situation, QPR's Chairman Tony Fernandes has issued a statement to back the current boss, Harry Redknapp. Fernandes, who is known to have a long-standing relationship with the club, has urged fans to get behind Redknapp for the rest of the year. Fernandes, in his statement, expressed his support for Redknapp, highlighting his experience and dedication to the cause. He said, "I have the utmost respect for Harry Redknapp. He is a passionate manager who has a wealth of experience in the game, and his dedication and commitment to QPR is beyond question." Fernandes went on to assure fans that the managerial position was stable and that the board was confident in Redknapp's abilities. This statement by Fernandes comes at a time when the club is experiencing one of its worst starts to a Premier League season in recent times. QPR's inability to strengthen their squad before the transfer deadline and their continued poor run on the pitch has put Redknapp's job under scrutiny. Despite this, Fernandes has made it clear that he and the board are fully behind Redknapp and have faith in his abilities to lead QPR to safety. The chairman has also urged fans to support the club and the team during this tough phase, stating that the positive energy will go a long way in boosting the players' morale and confidence on the pitch. QPR faces a tough season ahead, with many formidable opponents to come. However, with Fernandes' backing and Redknapp's experience, there is still hope for the London side to turn things around. Meanwhile, Redknapp has also expressed his gratitude for Fernandes' support, stating that it meant a lot to him and the team. Redknapp said, "I am grateful to have the support of Tony Fernandes and the board. They have shown their faith in me and the team, and we will continue to work hard to turn things around." QPR will have their next chance to secure points away from home when they travel to Hull City later this month. The fans will be hoping for a much-needed win to turn their season around and head in the right direction in the Premier League.
