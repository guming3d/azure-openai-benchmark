'We do have very good records, we know where the (pomegranate seeds) came from, we're looking into who the broker is and we're sourcing it back up the food chain to get to it,' Mr Gaar said.

chatgpt: An outbreak of illness in California has been traced back to organic frozen berry mix, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak has infected 30 people in total, with nine of them needing hospitalization. The source of the outbreak has been identified as the frozen berry mix that was sold by Costco. The CDC, in a recent report, states that the frozen berry mix was contaminated with hepatitis A virus. Health officials are urging consumers who have bought this product to discard it immediately, even if they have not fallen ill yet. The agency is warning that the frozen berry mix, which primarily consists of strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, might be the root cause of the hepatitis A virus at the moment. Consumers who have consumed the affected berries and have not got vaccinated against hepatitis A are being warned to look for any signs of illness, especially among food handlers or those that work in the healthcare industry. The symptoms of hepatitis A typically include abdominal pain, jaundice, fatigue, and low-grade fever. The virus is highly contagious and can spread quickly. Costco, the company that sold the product in question, took immediate action once they became aware of the outbreak, removing the product from their shelves. A statement from the company emphasized that they take the health and safety of their customers and employees seriously and promised to work with the CDC and other authorities to get to the root of what had gone wrong. “We have removed this product from our stores since we learned of the issue, and we are working closely with the CDC and other government agencies to investigate the cause”, the company’s statement said. The product, which was sold in at least eight states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Washington, has a best-by date of February 2021, making it possible for people to still have it in their homes. If you have purchased the product recently and have not yet thrown it away, it is best to contact Costco for guidance on returning it. The CDC says it is collaborating with health authorities in various states to identify if there are other cases of hepatitis A infection that may have been caused by the same source. Anyone who falls ill should seek medical attention immediately and report their symptoms to health authorities. Hepatitis A is a serious illness that is spread through contaminated food and water, as well as through sexual contact with an infected person. Although it is not always a severe illness, the disease can cause liver damage and can even be fatal in some cases. As the investigation continues and more samples are analyzed, it is important for consumers to remain vigilant and to pay attention to any public health warnings that might be issued. Staying informed about food-related health risks can help you avoid illness and keep you and your loved ones healthy.
