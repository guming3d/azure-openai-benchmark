article: (CNN) -- Federal authorities raided the office of a University of Florida professor on Wednesday who, along with his wife, is suspected of defrauding NASA. The FBI searched the school's Innovative Nuclear Space Power and Propulsion Institute, founded by Samim Anghaie, and his office on campus, said university spokesman Steve Orlando. Anghaie is a professor of radiological engineering. FBI spokesman Jeff Westcott would only confirm the searches on campus, referring all questions to the U.S. attorney's office. Calls to the U.S. attorney's office were not returned Wednesday. According to an affidavit filed February 19, investigators from the FBI and NASA said that since 1999, the government has awarded 13 contracts to the couple's company, New Era Technology Inc. (NETECH), and deposited $3.4 million into the company's corporate account. Investigators allege they diverted much of the money from the corporate account into personal accounts to buy cars and property. According to NETECH's Web site, the company was established in 1988 as a research and development firm to perform "high-tech, cutting edge research." It boasts "a highly skilled staff of research scientists, engineers, and physicists" and lists NASA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy among its employers. Anghaie's wife, Sousan, is president of NETECH, which is listed under the couple's residential address in Gainesville, according to court documents. The couple have two sons; Hamid, 28, and Ali, 31. Since 2001, Hamid Anghaie, who lives in Tampa, has been director and vice president of the company. Before Hamid took over, his father had the post, according to court documents. Ali Anghaie, who lives in Manchester, Connecticut, works for an aerospace firm, Pratt & Whitney, also listed among NETECH's employers. Calls to the home of Samim and Sousan Anghaie were not immediately returned Wednesday. Authorities said the Anghaies took advantage of two federal grant programs set up to stimulate technological innovation in the private sector and strengthen the role of small businesses. Under the NETECH name, they "submitted multiple fraudulent certified contract proposals to NASA, in order to receive the maximum funding for proposed research contracts," according to court documents. The couple allegedly submitted fraudulent invoices to reimburse payments to "alleged employees," which ultimately resulted in the government overpaying the company, the documents say. The money was allegedly diverted to personal accounts through the intentional overpayment of employees, including Samim Anghaie, or the payments made to "illegitimate" employees, including the two sons, according to the documents. Samim Anghaie, who has worked for the University of Florida for nearly 30 years, has been placed on administrative leave with pay, Orlando said. CNN's Samira Simone and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Tuesday morning, the FBI raided the office of Samim Anghaie, a professor at the University of South Florida, who has been accused of taking money from NASA meant for academic research, and using it for personal gain along with his family. Professor Anghaie has been placed on administrative leave with pay. According to the investigators, Anghaie, who is the Director of the university's Institute of Space Technology and Science, utilized money from a grant given to him by NASA between 2013 and 2018 for personal expenses, which included meals, credit card bills, and international travel expenses for him and his family.  Investigators allege that Anghaie also diverted funds to his other companies, Topline Engineering and Gen X Energy, to further his own interests. Anghaie's wife and son were allegedly co-conspirators in the scheme, and are also under investigation by the FBI. The allegations against Anghaie, who has been with USF since 1986, first came to light in 2018 when the university launched a review of his research activities. The investigation found evidence of research misconduct, and the university alerted NASA's Office of Inspector General, which then launched its own investigation. USF has since put in place enhanced financial controls and additional compliance training for its researchers, and a new interim director has been appointed to oversee the Institute of Space Technology and Science. In a statement, USF said that it was cooperating with the FBI's investigation and took the allegations against Anghaie seriously. "We remain fully committed to the highest standards of ethical behavior and adherence to applicable laws, rules, and regulations," the statement read. Anghaie, who is a respected figure in the field of nuclear engineering, has received numerous awards and distinctions throughout his career, including the prestigious Eugene P. Wigner Reactor Physicist Award in 2017. However, these latest allegations could tarnish his reputation and potentially lead to criminal charges. The investigation is ongoing, and both the FBI and the university have declined to comment on the matter further at this time. This incident raises questions about the importance of transparency and accountability in academic research, particularly when public funds are involved. It also highlights the need for universities to have robust controls in place to prevent fraud, and the potential consequences for those who abuse their positions of trust.
