chatgpt: A woman in her 30s was found dumped outside a landfill in Irving, Texas, wearing only a shirt. The unnamed Hispanic woman had been out drinking with a friend when she was last seen with a man she had just met. The friend had gone to get the car and upon her return, the woman was nowhere to be found.  Volunteer workers discovered the woman's disorientated state at 9 am the next morning. According to reports, she had no memory of the previous night and believed that her drink was spiked. She also claimed to have been raped.  The incident has sparked outrage and concern in the Irving community. Texas is known for its high rates of sexual assault and the community is calling for better measures to be put in place to protect vulnerable individuals who may be at risk of harm.  In a statement, the Irving Police Department acknowledged the seriousness of the allegations and promised to thoroughly investigate the incident. They urged anyone with relevant information to come forward and assist them in their investigations. The victim's friend, who was with her that night, has also been identified and is currently being questioned by authorities. The woman's condition has been described as stable but traumatized.

The incident sparked a wave of protests and calls for better measures to be taken to protect women from sexual assault in public places. The community is now demanding that authorities step up their efforts to ensure that such incidents do not happen again.
