article: London (CNN) -- Jurre Hermans, the 11-year-old Dutch boy who entered the Â£250,000 ($400,000) Wolfson Economics Prize with a pizza-based plan for saving the eurozone, did so because he had an idea and the winnings sounded "very attractive," he told CNN. Jurre received a â‚¬100 ($131) gift voucher and special mention when the prize shortlist was announced Tuesday for his detailed entry -- including a picture, below -- showing how debt can be exchanged for slices of pizza. Exiting the euro: As easy as pizza? The competition was launched in October by Simon Wolfson, the man behind British retail chain Next, to try and find ways to deal with a collapse of the euro -- the currency tying together 17 European countries. The euro has been under intense pressure since Greece was forced to take a bail-out from its eurozone peers and the International Monetary Fund almost two years ago. Through his father Julius, Jurre told CNN he had an idea to solve the euro crisis and also thought the prize money sounded "attractive." Jurre, the youngest entrant to the prize, proposed Greece should leave the euro, with the Greek people slotting their funds into a bank "exchange machine" and getting drachma -- the Greek currency before the country joined the euro in 2001 -- back. As Jurre explains in his application, the bank then gives the euros to the Greek government and "all these euros together form a pancake or a pizza. Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza." Jurre noted the "clever part" of his idea was that the Greek people would not want to change their euros for drachma, because they know the currency would depreciate. However, if they hide their euros, Jurre said they should be slapped with severe financial penalties. Wolfson: Why Europe needs to think about a euro collapse . Jurre wrote: "In this way I ensure that all Greeks bring their euros to a greek bank and so the greek government can pay back all the debts. I hope my idea helps you!!!!" Julius Hermans said he was proud his son thought about the world's problems and came up with solutions. However, Jurre told CNN he plans to be a zoo director rather than an economist, because he loves animals. He also wants the euro to continue. A list of the Wolfson finalists and their plans can be found here. The winner will be announced on July 5. .

chatgpt: An 11-year-old boy, Jurre Hermans, has come up with a plan to solve the ongoing eurozone crisis that has been increasing in severity in recent years. The idea, while unconventional, is gaining attention among policymakers and economists alike, and offers a fresh perspective on a complex issue that has confounded experts in the field. The crux of Jurre's plan involves Greeks exchanging their euros for the national currency, the drachma. This would enable the country to devalue its currency and bring down the cost of exports, thereby making Greek products more competitive on the global market. According to Jurre, this would help in reducing the debt owed by Greece, aiding the country in the long-term. Furthermore, Jurre's plan involves creditors being compensated for the debt they are owed by the Greek government. But instead of receiving cash, Jurre proposes that they are paid in pizza, stating that "sharing a slice of pizza together can help foster better relationships and improve communication between parties." His ingenuity and unique approach have been praised by many, with some experts noting that it's worthwhile to give different perspectives into solutions to the eurozone crisis. Despite the buzz his plan has created, Jurre has cited that he would rather work in a zoo than as an economist. The 11-year-old boy from the Netherlands has a keen enthusiasm for animals, especially big cats like lions and tigers, in addition to his aptitude for economics. Jurre's idea comes at a crucial moment as the eurozone continues to grapple with the financial crisis. The EU has suffered significant financial fallout from the debt crisis in Greece, where government debt levels are much higher than the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Greece has had to receive multiple bailout loans from the EU and the International Monetary Fund to avoid defaulting on its debt obligations. Jurre's refreshing idea is a reminder that creative thinking and innovation are essential elements in finding solutions to complex issues. Expert opinion and years of study are undoubtedly important in economics, yet everyone, even an 11-year-old zoo enthusiast, can have a productive problem-solving approach. Jurre's unique vision provides policymakers with an alternative perspective that can initiate further discussions and shape ideas that could guide the eurozone out of crisis. While Jurre is not interested in pursing a career in economics, the potential that his innovative thinking has already shown is likely to ease concerns about the financial crises the eurozone may face. In conclusion, Jurre Hermans' idea is not only innovative, creative, and fresh but also invokes hope that even unexpected solutions and viewpoints may lead to the resolution of fundamental and economic issues. His idea to exchange pizza in place of cash to resolve debt is unprecedented, and just because of its novelty, his proposal could generate fruitful discussions among experts in finding a solution that is economically viable in the long run.
