chatgpt: A notorious burglar from Leicester named Adam Crampton has pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary in court, but he has requested for an additional 278 break-ins and 60 car thefts to be taken into consideration when he is sentenced. The extent of his criminal history was uncovered when he revealed these crimes to the police.  Despite already pleading guilty to three burglaries, Crampton voluntarily shared social media posts to the police that revealed his extensive criminal history. He took them on four separate tours of Leicester, where he pointed out his targets and the locations he had broken into.  During the tours, Crampton provided officers with a detailed account of the crimes he had committed. He revealed that he had targeted mostly residential areas, including apartments, bungalows, and semi-detached houses. In some cases, he entered properties through open windows or doors, but he also admitted to using tools, such as screwdrivers or crowbars, to force his way into homes.  Crampton also admitted to stealing a total of 60 cars during his criminal career, which he would often sell on to buyers or chop shops. It is not yet clear how long Crampton has been committing these crimes, but it is believed that he has been active for several years.

The news of Crampton's extensive criminal history has shocked many in the Leicester community. Local resident Sarah Jackson, whose home was burgled by Crampton, stated: "I feel violated knowing that this person has been in our home and taken our possessions. It's frightening to think that someone like him was able to commit so many crimes for such a long time without being caught." The investigation into Crampton's crimes is ongoing, and the police are asking anyone with any additional information to come forward. They are also urging residents to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities.
