I don't know what he did but he turned the tables, and the next thing I knew it was ten-each. 'In my mind I knew I was far ahead but Dave kept coming back at me. When it got to ten-each his confidence was sky high, but I didn't think he could keep doing it. 'He put me under so much pressure but I had to slow down, take a deep breath and I managed to get there in the end.' Runner-up Chisnall said: 'I'm happy with my performance over the last week but the final got away from me at the beginning.

Taylor said he will take the trophy to the hospital and leave it by his mum's bedside . 'When I got to ten-all I thought I could take the win, but I missed a double to pull back to 12-11 and when it got to 15-10 it was a struggle. It was never over until he hit the final double and I kept fighting hard, but the better man won.'
