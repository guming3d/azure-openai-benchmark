article: By . Mark Prigg . Facebook has created an algorithm that can pick a face out of a crowd almost as accurately as a human. Called DeepFace, it uses technology the firm bought when it acquired Israeli startup face.com last year. Its creators say it pick a face out of a crowd with 97.25 per cent accuracy. DeepFace uses a 3-D model to rotate faces, virtually, so that they face the camera. Image (a) shows the original image, and (g) shows the final, corrected version which the software can then attempt to recognise. Yaniv Taigman and colleagues at Facebook's AI lab found a way to build a 3D model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for the algorithm to start matching. They then used a neural network that had been trained on a massive database of faces to try and match the face with one in a test database of more than 4 million images, containing more than 4000 separate identities, each one labelled by humans. 'We revisit both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network,' the team wrote. The system can now identify faces at virtually the same level of accuracy as a human . The team achieved 97.25 per cent accuracy on the test data that contained more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. A test using real people recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site managed 97.5 per cent. Details will be presented at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Columbus, Ohio, in June. Experts say Facebook could use it to identify all of a user's real friends are. 'They could identify every one of your friends in all of your photos,' Christopher Kanan of the California Institute of Technology told New Scientist. 'This would let them know who your real friends are â€“ people you actually hang out with in the real world.'

chatgpt: A new technology has been developed that can enhance facial recognition using advanced 3D modelling techniques. This groundbreaking technology, known as "DeepFace," was created by researchers who analyzed millions of images uploaded to the social media giant Facebook.  The software was designed to improve facial recognition systems, which are used by law enforcement agencies and security personnel to identify individuals. With its amazing ability to "spin" a head to get a clearer look at a person's features, DeepFace is set to revolutionize the way we identify suspects and track criminals. The system works by building a 3D model of a person's face, which is then rotated and manipulated to provide a clearer view. By analyzing thousands of images of the same person, DeepFace is able to create a highly accurate portrait of the individual, making it easier to identify them in future images. The technology uses a complex set of algorithms to recognize facial features, such as the shape of the eyes, eyebrows, and mouth, as well as the distance between those features. By capturing all the angles of the face, the researchers were able to create a model that can capture the facial structure in detail, which can then be studied and analyzed at length. The team behind DeepFace, composed of researchers from Facebook's Artificial Intelligence lab, have already tested the software on an enormous database of images, which included over 4,000 recognized faces. The results were astounding, with DeepFace achieving an unparalleled 97.35% accuracy rate in facial recognition accuracy. Although there are concerns about privacy with such advanced facial recognition technology, the researchers have emphasized that their work is purely academic and has been conducted within ethical guidelines. They have also stated that DeepFace can only work on images that have been authorized for public use, and it does not include any photos marked as private. In conclusion, the development of DeepFace represents a significant breakthrough in the field of facial recognition technology. With its unprecedented accuracy rate, the software is set to change the way we identify people, and it could have major implications for law enforcement, security, and other industries that rely on facial recognition technology. While privacy concerns remain important, the benefits of the technology are hard to ignore, and it will be interesting to see how this technology develops in the future.
