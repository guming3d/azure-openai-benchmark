They claimed they were the victims of spite . The pair claimed they were victims of spite involving a man who held a grudge against Arundel after she dismissed someone he knew from the care home she managed in Ipswich. Burgon, a staff nurse at another Ipswich care home, and Arundel accepted they were over the drink-drive limit when they were breathalysed. But they insisted they were under the limit when they drove home from St Audrey's Social Club after meeting up from work. They claimed they downed wine and cider when they got home.

The couple, who have been convicted of drink-driving, insisted they were under the limit when they drove home from St Audrey's Social Club (pictured) after meeting up from work . The journey home from St St Audrey's Social Club was a mere 50 yards - both were caught after a tip-off to police who went straight to their home . The two officers put their hands under the wheel arches of Arundel's Kia Venga and Burgon's Ford Fiesta after getting to their home at about midnight. Both engines were still warm. Sarah-Jane Atkins, prosecuting, told JPs the couple were inside the house in a 'drunken state'. Burgon answered the door and smelled of alcohol. His eyes were glazed and he was unsteady on his feet, the court heard. Arundel was in the lounge and also appeared drunk, the court heard. Both were in their dressing gowns. Burgon told magistrates he had drunk less than two pints of lager in the social club. Arundel said she had had less than two small glasses of red wine. They said that after arriving home they had downed one bottle of wine and started another by the time police turned up. Burgon also admitted having a can of cider. Breath tests showed Arundel had 93 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, while Burgon had 70 mcgs in 100mls of breath. The legal limit is 35mcgs. Burgon was banned from driving for 12 months and Arundel for 17 months.

chatgpt: A couple in a small town in the UK claimed that they were victims of a vicious act of spite, involving a man who had been holding a grudge against them. The local police were called to the couple's house after receiving an anonymous 999 tip-off. When the police arrived, they found the man, identified as Burgon, at the door, seemingly drunk and with his eyes glazed over. The officers noted the strong odor of alcohol on his breath and asked him to step away from the door. Upon questioning the couple, they explained that they had been receiving threatening phone calls and emails from a man named Mark, who they believed had a grudge against them for an undisclosed reason. They had reported this to the police previously, but no action had been taken. The couple claimed that they had no idea why Mark was targeting them, but that they had tried to avoid him as much as possible. However, they had recently received more explicit threats, which had prompted them to call the police. They also explained that Burgon had been drinking heavily as a result of the stress and fear caused by the situation. The police took the couple's statements and attempted to locate Mark. They also advised the couple to keep their doors and windows locked at all times and to report any further incidents immediately. Incidents of this nature can cause immense psychological and emotional distress for the victims. The threat of imminent danger can undermine a person's sense of security and stability, leading to fear, anxiety, and depression. The effects can even spill over into a person's professional life and social relationships. In many cases, when individuals experience harassment or bullying, they often find themselves alienated and unsupported by those around them. It is therefore essential for the police to take reports of this nature seriously and to provide immediate support and resources to those affected. The incident has sparked some debate online, with some questioning the effectiveness of anonymous tip-offs in cases of stalking and harassment. Others have expressed concern about the potential lack of investigation surrounding previous reports made by the couple. The police themselves have cautioned against jumping to conclusions too quickly, noting that ongoing investigations often require the collection of detailed evidence, which can take time. They have urged anyone who receives threatening messages or feels in fear for their safety to contact the police immediately. Overall, this incident highlights the importance of taking reports of harassment and other unwanted behaviours seriously. Victims need to feel supported and heard, and the police have a vital role to play in achieving this. By responding to incidents quickly and appropriately, they can help to prevent future acts of spite and aggression from occurring.
