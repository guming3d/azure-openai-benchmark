For even the slightest misjudgment in ballistics, distance or breathing rate is the difference between life and death. You play Captain Cole Anderson, aka ‘Sandman’, who travels the world with his spotter, taking out various high-profile targets. View to a kill: In Ghost Warrior 2 you travel to a variety of real-world locations, using a selection of authentic weapons and equipment . Similar to its multi-million-selling predecessor, this first-person shooter focuses on sniping – with the popular Bullet Cam returning to show off skilful long range kills. Thankfully, to avoid the somewhat linear nature of the original, City Interactive have improved close quarters combat, too. Secure the area: Unlike its predecessor, close-quarters combat doesn't feel disjointed, with knife takedowns, in particular, a real highlight . There’s now a much greater array of short-range pistols and assault rifles on offer, while brutal knife-takedowns act as a perfect incentive to get up close and personal. Graphically, the game improves on the original in every way. Powered by the CryEngine 3, war-torn cities and dense jungles boast spectacular lighting effects, backed up with the engine’s trademark motion blur and depth of field. Waiting in the shadows: Those after Call of Duty-style thrills may want to look elsewhere. It pays to be patient in Ghost Warrior 2 . Speaking to MailOnline, Lee Kirton, PR and marketing Director for Namco Bandai said: 'Naturally, we wanted to improve the game and build on the success of the original Sniper: Ghost Warrior to ensure Ghost Warrior 2 will provide fans with an incredible, immersive sniping experience. Vantage point: You'll have to listen to your spotter's advice if you're to eliminate your target . 'Thanks to the use of the immensely powerful CryEngine 3, the game looks stunning and provides an incredibly realistic experience. 'With a wide variety of weapons and missions to get to grips with and shots that require the player to consider a whole host of environmental factors, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2  will deliver the most authentic sniping experience to date.’ Stunning: Compared with the rather dull and drab original, Ghost Warrior 2 looks wonderful across all platforms. However, expect the CryEngine 3 to look best on PC . Follow Talal on Twitter: @TalalMusa and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games.
