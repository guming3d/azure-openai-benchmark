chatgpt: Authorities in Bali have made a significant breakthrough in the case of Australian businessman, Robert Ellis, who was brutally murdered last month. Two additional suspects have been arrested, bringing the total number of suspects to five, in connection with Ellis' death. According to reports, the two suspects were apprehended after a lengthy manhunt. They had allegedly fired poisonous arrows and used machetes in the attack on Ellis before being shot by police. They have been identified as 26-year-old Wayan Sumardana and 30-year-old Made Budi. It is believed that the duo were part of a larger criminal network responsible for the murder. They reportedly confessed to their involvement and provided valuable information to investigators. Currently in custody are Ellis' Indonesian wife, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids, and the boyfriend of one of the maids. All four were arrested in the days following the discovery of Robert Ellis' body, which had been wrapped in plastic and dumped in a rice field. Despite the new arrests, two suspects for the murder of Robert Ellis remain at large. Authorities are continuing their investigation and have not ruled out the possibility of making further arrests in the case. The murder of Robert Ellis has sent shockwaves throughout the Australian and Indonesian communities. Ellis was well-known in Bali, having lived on the island for decades and owning several businesses there. His death has prompted calls for greater security measures in Bali, which has long been popular with Australian tourists. Many have expressed concern over the safety of foreigners in the area, and have called for authorities to do more to protect visitors. In response to the concerns, the Indonesian government has announced a major crackdown on criminal activity in Bali. The initiative includes increased police patrols, as well as measures to improve security at key tourist sites. The murder of Robert Ellis remains a tragic event, and one that will likely continue to be felt by many for years to come. However, the recent arrests provide hope that justice may yet be served, and that those responsible for this heinous crime will be held accountable for their actions.
