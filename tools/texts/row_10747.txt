Classic children's TV shows including Topsy and Tim, the Clangers and the Wombles are being brought back to TV. The new version of Topsy and Tim, which starts tomorrow on CBeebies, has been updated for the 21st century and features bedtime stories from Dad on a tablet computer, Mum spending time on her laptop and the children printing things from their computer. The new version of Topsy and Tim (left) starts tomorrow on CBeebies, starring Jocelyn MacNab and Joshua Lester, based on the old animated series (right) The BBC has also said it is making a new version of the Clangers, due for release in 2015, while Channel 5 will be bringing back the Wombles for 52 new episodes in the same year. Topsy and Tim, which started life as a series of book more than 50 years ago, has been turned into a live-action show following the lives of two preschool twins. The 60 new 15-minute shows chart their adventures from Dad making special sandwiches - an odd combination of peanut butter, lettuce and cheese - to washing the car and babysitting a friend's guinea pigs. Speaking to The Observer Jean Adamson, 86, who invented and illustrated Topsy and Tim with her husband, Gareth, said: 'Childhood has not changed significantly over the past 50 years. The books reflect the things very young children do, grubbing about in the garden, squabbling.' She added that the 130 books, which sold 21million copies, were based on real-life events involving her own three children. Another classic show enjoying a revival on the BBC is Peter Rabbit, which has just started its second series. The Clangers, which was first broadcast by the BBC in 1973 and stars a race of mouse-like creatures living in space, is being brought back for new episodes due to start in 2015 . The Wombles, another BBC series, is being revived on Channel 5 with 52 new episodes due to air on the channel Milkshake morning programme from 2015 . The animated show, based on the novels of Beatrix Potter, features Peter alongside his new female sidekick, Lily. The Wombles and Clangers were also based on book series by Elisabeth Beresford and Peter Firmin. However Anna Home, chair of the Children's Media Foundation and former head of BBC Children's TV, said that revival shouldn't stop new material being produced. She added: 'I welcome the classics - there is nothing wrong with them. Topsy and Tim came out a long time ago, so did Peter Rabbit. They are dealing with pretty universal things, and pretty basic things that are common to all children.'
