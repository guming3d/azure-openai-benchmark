article: By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 1:43 AM on 12th January 2012 . A new prototype credit card from Dynamics Inc could be the solution to credit card fraud. The cardÂ  is powered by a tiny battery, and generates a different security code (usually the three digit code printed on the back) every time it's switched on. The number stored in the magnetic strip also changes - so it can't be cloned, at least with current technology. The card is on display at this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and the technology is currently under trial by Citibank. The card's number changes every time it's used - so it's near-impossible to clone with current technology. Online shoppers simply enter a PIN to 'turn on' the card, and it generates a new number which is displayed on the front - this can then be typed in to websites safely . The code stored in the magnetic strip changes every time it's used - so it's very difficult to clone. You 'tell' the card to switch on by entering a PIN code, and it displays the number. Without the code, it's useless. The card is the size of an ordinary credit or debit card, and the battery inside lasts for three years. Dynamics Inc, the company behind the cards, says that its 'powered cards' can also be used for cards that offer access to several accounts from one card, or cards that hide a portion of the number unless a PIN is entered. 'All that is needed to steal a credit card number today is a pen and paper or a portable card reader,' says maker Dynamics Inc, which showed off the card at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week.'The credit card automatically writes a new, unique dynamic security code onto its magnetic strip for every purchase. A display can also be added to the card - thus replacing the three or four digit security code physically printed on traditional cards.' When the card is 'off', the magnetic strip doesn't store the correct number - so thieves can't 'skim' a card in a restaurant.

chatgpt: Citibank is introducing a new security technology for its debit and credit cards that promises to protect customers against fraud. The new technology, which is currently under trial, changes the security code every time the card is used. This means that if a hacker or fraudster were to obtain the security code, it would be useless for any subsequent attempts at using the card. In addition to the changing security code, the Citibank cards also require a PIN code to activate the card. This provides an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to the account. Customers can select their own PIN code during the card activation process and can change it at any time. The PIN code is required for all transactions with the card. But the security measures don't stop there. Citibank's new technology also incorporates a magnetic strip that changes every time the card is used. This makes it virtually impossible for the card to be cloned as the thief wouldn't know which combination of magnetic strip data to use. "We take security very seriously and are constantly looking for ways to enhance the safety and security of our customers' accounts," said a Citibank spokesperson. "Our new technology provides an extra layer of protection against fraud and we are excited to be testing it with our customers." This new technology comes at a time when credit and debit card fraud is on the rise. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, there were over 1,200 data breaches in the United States in 2017 alone, exposing nearly 180 million records. And with the widespread use of online shopping and mobile transactions, the risk of fraud only increases. Citibank's new security measures may not be foolproof, but they do provide an added layer of protection against fraud. The changing security code, PIN code requirement, and constantly changing magnetic strip make it much more difficult for fraudsters to access customers' accounts. The trial period for the new technology is expected to continue through the end of the year, after which Citibank will evaluate the results and determine the next steps. For customers who are concerned about fraud, Citibank recommends monitoring their accounts regularly for any suspicious activity and reporting it immediately to the bank. With the new security measures in place, however, customers can have peace of mind knowing that their accounts are better protected against fraud than ever before.
