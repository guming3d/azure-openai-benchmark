article: Madrid (CNN) -- The judge in charge of the investigation into a horrific train crash in Spain last month has presented preliminary charges against the state-run rail infrastructure company, Adif. Until now, attention has focused on the driver of the train, which derailed near the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, killing 79 people and injuring scores more.

Francisco Jose Garzon faces 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. But preliminary charges have now also been filed by Judge Luis Alaez Legeren against "the person or persons from ADIF responsible for the traffic safety in the stretch of the rail line between the stations of Ourense and Santiago on July 24," according to documents posted on a court website Tuesday. It's not yet clear who the individuals are. The judge also requested more information on traffic safety and speed limits on that stretch of line from both Adif and state railroad company Renfe, and asked the Transport Ministry for details of any other incidents there. A spokeswoman for Adif declined to comment on the charges Wednesday but told CNN the company would work with authorities as far as possible. Garzon took control of the train at Ourense station, about 35 minutes before the crash occurred, a senior rail official told lawmakers during a rail safety briefing called after the disaster. Lawmakers heard that the route the train was on, from Madrid to Ferrol, includes a mix of conventional and high-speed track, with the latter allowing high-speed trains to travel at over 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph.) Two different safety systems are used in Spain: the European Rail Traffic Management System for the high-speed track and another known as ASFA on conventional lines. The train and its engineer were switching between the two kinds of track and operating system in the course of the journey. One such transition occurred shortly before the crash. Court officials have said the train was traveling at 153 kph (95 mph) when it derailed, nearly twice the speed limit on the curve where the accident happened. The driver, Garzon, has been given conditional release while the investigation continues but has surrendered his passport. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro reported from Madrid, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

chatgpt: A Spanish judge has widened the range of charges to individuals at Adif, the country's state-run rail infrastructure firm responsible for track safety at the site of one of Spain's worst rail disasters. The charges were brought after the derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 79 people and injured scores more. The judge's move comes after the driver of the train, Francisco Jose Garzon, was previously charged with manslaughter and accused of reckless driving. Garzon has admitted to going too fast on a curve in the tracks, but he denies criminal responsibility. He is expected to go on trial at some point in the next year. Now, Judge Luis Alaez has widened the scope of the investigation to include employees at Adif who were responsible for track safety on the day of the crash. These individuals could face charges of homicide, reckless endangerment, and professional negligence. The decision by Judge Alaez comes after an investigation that has been ongoing for years and has been dogged by controversy. Spanish authorities were criticised for not conducting a thorough enough investigation into the crash at the time and for not ensuring proper safety measures were in place.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy visited the scene of the crash, and a month after the accident, the country declared three days of official mourning to honour the victims. The tragedy prompted a national debate on railway safety, with many questioning why the train was allowed to travel at such high speeds on a curve in the tracks. Now, as the investigation continues, families of the victims are hoping for justice. Many believe that more should be done to ensure that those responsible for the crash face justice and that the wider issue of railway safety is addressed to prevent similar disasters in the future. The derailment near Santiago de Compostela will forever be a dark moment in Spanish history. Its impact was felt not just by the families of those who lost their lives or were injured in the accident but by the entire country. The hope now is that justice will be served and that steps will be taken to prevent similar tragedies from occurring again in the future.
