article: By . Mia De Graaf . Traditional families with married parents and two children are a thing of the past and 'patchwork' families should be celebrated, a leading Catholic theologian has claimed. Werner Jeanrond, a former pupil of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, said the Church must drop 'moralising statements' about the ideal family set-up and embrace single working parents. His words come as the Coalition announced tax breaks for working mothers worth up to £2,000 a year for every child under 12.

But Professor . Jeanrond, Master of St Benet's Hall at the University of Oxford, . welcomed the idea of a broader definition of 'family'. He branded nuclear families 'an idol of the modern industrialised west', which the early Church would find bizarre. 'Biblical . concepts of the family often transcend biological considerations and . refer to larger households which can include relatives of different . degrees, an intergenerational community, visitors, and . workers/helpers/slaves,' he told MailOnline.

He added: 'Our so-called patchwork families ought to be of interest to a Church so used to changing concepts of family. 'It . is the attention to Jesus Christ that unites a Christian family, not . the adherence to shifting codifications of its boundary.' Professor Jeanrond is Master of St Benet's Hall, University of Oxford, which has just decided to admit female undergraduates, and is a former pupil of Pope Benedict, who many say left an overlooked progressive legacy . Laura Perrins, of campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘It’s a disgrace that taxpayers’ money will be used to contribute to the childcare bill of families earning up to £300,000. The Old Etonians need to take a trip to reality street.’ The Government insisted it is taking various steps to provide support for stay-at-home parents – including a new universal state pension crediting years spent caring for children and a transferable marriage tax allowance to be introduced from next year. But that will be worth just £200 a year, to the dismay of Tory critics. Former children’s minister Tim Loughton said: ‘The state is disproportionately geared up to pushing parents into being working parents.’

chatgpt: In a bold and unapologetic move, Werner Jeanrond, a former pupil of Pope Benedict, has called on the Catholic Church to embrace change and adapt to the modern world. Speaking to a group of religious leaders and scholars, Jeanrond argued that the early Church would not recognize the nuclear family unit that exists in the industrialized West today. Jeanrond's comments are especially poignant given the recent controversy over the Tory government's decision to eliminate tax breaks for working mothers. The move has been met with vocal opposition from members of the Conservative party's right-wing caucus, who argue that it will harm families and undermine traditional values. But according to Jeanrond, the nuclear family has never been a meaningful part of the Church's history or teachings. Rather, he argues, the Church has always been focused on promoting love, compassion, and the common good. And in today's rapidly changing world, he believes that it's more important than ever for the Church to embrace innovation and adapt to the needs of modern-day families. Of course, this isn't the first time that the Catholic Church has been urged to change its ways. In recent years, there has been growing criticism of the Church's stance on social issues like gay marriage and contraception. And while Pope Francis has made some efforts to promote more progressive views, many Catholics are still calling for more sweeping changes. Jeanrond represents a growing faction of the Church that believes that it's time for a more radical approach. Rather than clinging to old traditions and values, he argues, the Church needs to be open to new ideas and perspectives. It needs to be a force for positive change, rather than a passive observer of the world around it. Of course, for many of the Church's traditionalists, this kind of talk is tantamount to heresy. They argue that the Church's teachings are timeless and immutable, and that any attempt to change them is a betrayal of the faith. But as Jeanrond points out, the Church has always been evolving, adapting to the needs of the times. And if it's going to survive and thrive in the years ahead, it will need to continue to do so. For now, it remains to be seen how the Church will respond to Jeanrond's call for change. But one thing is clear: the world is changing rapidly, and the Church must change with it if it wants to remain relevant and meaningful in the lives of its followers. Whether or not the Church will be able to embrace this kind of change remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the debate will continue, and the future of the Church hangs in the balance.
