chatgpt: Tragedy struck the Haunted Scream Park, a popular Halloween attraction in Middletown, Ohio, as a performer collapsed while on tour. Christian Faith Benge, a 20-year-old college student, was portraying a spooky character when she suddenly fell to the ground in front of a group of visitors. Despite the quick response of the park's staff, Benge could not be revived and was pronounced dead at the hospital. The incident occurred on Saturday evening, during the park's busiest time of the year. Benge had been hired as a part-time employee to scare visitors and create an eerie atmosphere inside the haunted house. She was wearing a costume and makeup that covered most of her face, which made it difficult for the staff to notice that she was in distress. According to witnesses, Benge appeared to stumble and lose her balance before collapsing. Some visitors initially thought that it was part of the show, but when they saw that she was not moving, they realized that something was wrong. Park employees who were nearby immediately rushed to her aid and called 911. An ambulance arrived within minutes and transported Benge to a nearby hospital. However, despite the efforts of the medical staff, Benge was declared dead shortly after arriving. The cause of her death has not yet been officially confirmed, but it is believed to be related to a medical condition. The news of Benge's untimely death has saddened many in the Middletown community, including her friends and family. Benge was a resident of Dayton, Ohio and a student at the University of Cincinnati majoring in Communication. Speaking to local media, Benge's father, Eric Benge, said that his daughter was a talented and creative person who had a passion for acting and performing. "She was always making people laugh and smile," he said. "We're devastated by her loss and we will miss her dearly." The Haunted Scream Park issued a statement expressing their condolences to Benge's family and friends. "We are deeply saddened by the tragic passing of Christian Faith Benge, who was a valued member of our team," the statement read. "Our thoughts and prayers are with her loved ones during this difficult time." The incident has prompted an investigation by the Ohio Department of Agriculture, which oversees the regulation and safety of amusement parks and attractions. Although the Haunted Scream Park has a good safety record and has never had a serious accident in the past, the investigation will focus on ensuring that all safety protocols were followed and that the equipment and facilities are up to standard. The tragic death of Christian Faith Benge is a reminder that even seemingly harmless activities like Halloween attractions can have serious risks. While haunted houses and other Halloween-related activities are meant to be scary and fun, it is important to remember that safety should always come first. As the investigation continues, the community mourns the loss of a talented and beloved young woman, and the park works to ensure that this never happens again.
