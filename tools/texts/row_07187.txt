Trial: The 30-year-old Indian nanny is accused of strangling the 11-month-old baby girl with a scarf in their Dubai home as an act of revenge on her British employer when she was not allowed holiday (stock image) ‘Sir, I did not kill that baby,’ the woman told presiding judge Ezzat Abdul Lat at Dubai Court of First Instance, according to Gulf News. ‘I loved her like my own children. I am a mother of two kids and there is not way on earth I would or could have done such a thing. ‘I was tortured while I was in detention. I have suffered a lot because of this case. I swear I did not commit anything wrong.’ The 36-year-old mother of the baby is originally from India but who holds a British passport. Speaking at a previous hearing, the mother said: 'We treated her so well, she was like a sister to me, we ate on the same table.' Pleading: The babysitter told presiding judge Ezzat Abdul Lat at Dubai Court of First Instance that she had loved the 11-month-old 'like her own' Her husband, who has demanded death penalty added: 'We celebrated her birthday and took her out for an ice-cream treat after we bought her some gifts. 'I often told her that I would pay for whatever her children need back in India and I was even looking for a job for her husband to bring him here so they can be together.' The babysitter previously confessed to the crime, saying she strangled the baby girl with a scarf because she had been refused days off. However, appearing at Dubai Criminal Court earlier this year, she denied premeditated murder. The maid's mother had died a month before the murder, which took place on January 18, and she wanted to travel back to India for the funeral. Her employers, who were unable to get time off work, told her to delay her trip until her residency documents for staying the the UAE were completed. The prosecution alleges that after being refused time off, the maid killed the baby to ensure she would not be needed for childcare duties and would therefore be allowed to travel.
