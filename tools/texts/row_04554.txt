article: (CNN) -- The votes have been counted, the candidates have moved on to South Carolina, but remnants of a hard-fought battle blanket Manchester, New Hampshire. The campaigns left behind hundreds, perhaps thousands of political signs on street corners and traffic medians from one end of the city to the other. Now someone has to go around and collect them. "It's definitely a big task to pick them up after the election is over," said Bob Roy as he surveyed a pile of signs at a city yard. PODCAST: The sound of cleaning up a campaign. The chief of street operations for Manchester said every four years, they expect to clean up after the campaigns in the same way they expect to plow the streets when it snows. "A lot of them are just left in place and, therefore, we go pick them up," Roy said. "It's a never ending battle." Often, campaign workers show up at the yard. They sift through the pile and collect the signs bearing their candidate's name. Sometimes they bring them to the next primary state. Or, they hold on to them and hope to re-plant them around the city if their candidate becomes the party's nominee in the general election. Shawn Dionne makes runs in his pick-up truck several times a week as he clears the signs. "The pile gets pretty big," said the public works employee who has the back-breaking job of pulling the signs out of the ground. Sometimes, campaign workers are at the yard waiting for him to back his pick-up truck up to the bin and toss in a few hundred more signs. "I come to bring in a load and they're chilling out here just digging through, throwing signs around ... I let them do their thing," Dionne said. "When they're done I come and drop off my load, go out and pick up more." He gets pleasure from the spectacle. "You gotta enjoy your job sometimes."

Hundreds of signs litter the streets, occupying public spaces and obstructing views. However, city workers have stepped up to assist in the cleanup process, taking on a seemingly never-ending battle. According to one city worker, the task of cleaning up campaign signs has been a tedious and time-consuming effort. The worker stated, "We've been out here for hours, trying to clear the streets. It's amazing how many signs there are, and they seem to just keep appearing." Despite the challenges, they remain dedicated to the task, determined to ensure that the city remains clean and accessible for all residents. In addition to city workers, local residents have also taken it upon themselves to help tidy up the streets. Some have collected campaign signs and personally disposed of them, while others have contacted city officials to report areas in need of cleaning. The collective effort of community members and official city workers working together has been vital in ensuring the cleanup efforts remain effective. The issue of campaign signs being left behind following an election is not a new phenomenon. Promises are often made by candidates to clean up their respective campaigns following the election, but this is not always the case. As a result, it is up to city officials and community members to ensure that the aftermath is dealt with in a timely and efficient manner. Residents and officials have expressed their appreciation for those who have taken action to clean up the streets. "It's great to see people coming together and working towards a common goal," one resident said. "It shows that we care about our community and want to keep it clean." Indeed, the teamwork and cooperation displayed by those involved in the cleanup efforts have been commendable. In conclusion, although the cleanup process following an election may be a never-ending battle, the dedicated efforts of city officials and community members can make a significant difference. The willingness to take on this task demonstrates an unwavering commitment to keep public spaces clean and accessible for all.
