A Colombian baby came back from the dead more than 10 hours after being sent to the morgue. The tiny tot - now named Milagros (Miracles) - was born prematurely in Quibdo in the Pacific state of Choco in the early hours of Wednesday, November 13, last week. Her mother Jenny Hurtado was just 27 weeks pregnant when she was rushed to the San Francisco de Asis hospital at 2:45am. Baby Milagros was pronounced dead after being born prematurely by caesarian section at a hospital in Quibdo, Colombia, before being transferred to the hospital morgue (file picture) Medics performed a C-section but, unable to find signs of life, declared the newborn deceased just 35 minutes later - at 3:20am. Taken to the morgue, the baby was placed inside a box. Staff then waited for her fisherman father to collect her. But, on the father's arrival and as the attendant handed the baby over, they recognised signs of life and heard a soft cry. Realizing the infant was still alive, workers rushed her on board a plane to the Santa Teresita del Niño Jesus clinic in the capital Bogota. She remains there, accompanied by her aunt Reyes Hinestroza, receiving treatment for her underdeveloped lungs in intensive care. It was only when the baby's father came to collect his body from the morgue that they noticed signs of life and he was taken to intensive care (file picture) Her mother remains in Quibdo, where she is recovering from the ordeal. Specialist doctor Javier Zagarra told Semana that the mistaken death declaration could be down to a soft heart beat at the time of the birth. 'In some cases the heart movements are not perceptible even though the newborn is alive, they can declare it dead,' he said. 'When they wrap the baby in a sheet, upon receiving warmth, the baby can then revitalize,' he added.

chatgpt: In a startling turn of events, a baby declared dead after a premature birth by caesarian section was found alive moments before being handed over to the father. The baby, a girl, was immediately flown to the Colombian capital of Bogotá, where she is now receiving intensive care. The mother of the baby, Jenny Hurado, named her daughter Milagros, which means miracles. The birth occurred at a hospital in the town of Barranquilla, Colombia. After being declared dead, Milagros was placed inside a box in the hospital morgue. However, a few hours later, when the baby was being handed over to the father, signs of life were detected. The baby's heartbeat was weak, but it was enough to give hope to the family. The mother, who was still recovering from the caesarian section, was informed of the news and rushed to the hospital to see her baby. Hurado was thrilled to learn that her daughter was alive and had already been transferred to a hospital in the capital. The hospital staff who declared Milagros dead have come under heavy criticism, with many questioning why the baby was placed in the morgue without proper checks or a second opinion. The medical officials involved have expressed regret over the incident, promising an internal investigation to prevent similar mistakes from happening in the future. Despite being premature and facing this traumatic incident, Milagros is reportedly doing well in the intensive care unit. While the road ahead will be long and arduous, her story of survival is nothing short of a miracle. The news of Milagros' survival has spread quickly through social media, with people expressing their joy and amazement at the little girl's strength and resilience. Hurado has also expressed her gratitude to the hospital staff who saved her daughter, calling them "angels on earth." As the family continues to pray for Milagros' full recovery, her story serves as a powerful reminder of the tenacity of life and the resilience of the human spirit.
