chatgpt: Former NFL linebacker Jamie Winborn has been in the news after his wife called the police on Friday morning expressing concerns about her husband's odd behavior. The police conducted a search of the couple's home and discovered a cache of weapons and marijuana. Winborn, who battled cancer as recently as last year, had played in the NFL for ten seasons before being released by the Tennessee Titans in October 2010. He was initially drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft and played for them for five seasons, starting in 28 games. He then spent one season each with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Denver Broncos, before moving on to the Tennessee Titans. According to police, Winborn's wife called them early Friday morning about her husband's behavior, which she described as being "strange and erratic." Upon their arrival, the authorities searched the couple's home and found a cache of weapons, including firearms and knives, as well as marijuana. Winborn, who is currently 42 years old, had been diagnosed with cancer last year and had been battling it ever since. It is unclear if his recent battle with the disease had anything to do with his recent behavior or the possession of the weapons. As of now, Winborn has not been charged with any offense, but the police investigation is ongoing. The former NFL star has yet to release any statement regarding the incident. Winborn was known for his speed and agility during his playing days in the NFL. He was also known for his versatility, as he could play outside linebacker or safety. Despite being undersized for his position, he was an effective tackler and was able to cover receivers in man-to-man situations. However, after 10 seasons in the league, Winborn retired in 2010 after being released by the Tennessee Titans. He finished his NFL career with 324 tackles, 10 sacks, and one interception.
