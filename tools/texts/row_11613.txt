article: A family who saved vouchers so they could go on a £10 holiday have been hit with a £350 fine for taking their children out of school. Simon and Karen Richardson could not afford an expensive break with their four children - three of whom are school-age - so collected vouchers in a national newspaper to save money. But they returned from the five-day trip to Perranporth, Cornwall to discover they had been fined £369 for taking Jodie-Ann, 9, Aiden, 6, and Alex, 7, out of school. The Richardson family from Bideford, Devon saved vouchers for a £10 holiday - but were hit with a £369 fine for taking their children out of school . Mrs Richardson, 35, said they took the risk of going on the trip during term time as they believed the maximum fine they would receive would be £60 and a similar trip during holidays would have cost in excess of £400. But instead both parents have been charged for each of their three children that all attend East-the-Water Community Primary School in Bideford, Devon. The costly break has left Mrs Richardson - who also took her two-year-old son Liam with her - upset and angry. She said: 'I think it is appalling. The school has got it so wrong. We are both working parents and we don't get much family time and we simply can't afford to go away during the school holidays. 'If we had known it was going to cost us this much, we would never have gone.' The family have been told the fine must be paid within 28 days or it will be doubled. If that is not paid they could face a fine up to £2,500 and three months in prison. Mrs Richardson, from Bideford, said: 'I am concerned that we won't be able to pay the fine and worried that any court action could jeopardise my husband's job as an electrician visiting local schools.' She said she did write to the school to make the request to take the time off but Devon County Council say it stands by its decision and claims its procedures were followed correctly. Its policy states that leaves of absence during term time can only be granted by the head teacher and is only allowed in exceptional circumstances - which do not include trying to avoid expensive holidays. A spokesman said: 'If the school refuses your request and the child is taken out of school, this will be recorded as an unauthorised absence and this may make you liable to a penalty notice for each child, payable by each parent or carer.' The school have yet to comment on the row. The family took a five-day trip to Perranporth, Cornwall - but returned home to a shocking bill from the school .

chatgpt: A family from Devon has been left with a hefty fine after taking advantage of a newspaper voucher to go on a budget-friendly holiday during the school holidays. The family, who could not afford a full-price getaway, collected vouchers worth ten pounds from a newspaper to save money on their trip. However, what should have been an enjoyable and affordable five-day trip quickly turned into a nightmare as they were hit with a £369 fine from education authorities upon their return. The fine was issued as their children had missed five days of school. The mother of the family spoke out about the ordeal, saying that if they had known the holiday would cost them so much, they would not have gone on it. The family now fears that they may face court action, which would have a detrimental impact on the father's job. To make matters worse, the local council, which runs the school, has refused to back down over the row. The family is now at a loss as to what to do next. The issue of term-time holidays has been a controversial one in the UK for some time now. While families like the Devon family feel they have no choice but to take their children out of school to save money, education authorities argue that such absences can negatively impact a child's education. The penalty for taking children out of school during term-time was increased in 2013, with parents facing fines of up to £120 per child per session. The fines are in place to deter parents from taking their children out of school without good reason and to encourage them to work with the school to find a solution. However, many parents argue that the fines are unfair, particularly for those who cannot afford to pay them. It is a sentiment that is echoed by the Devon family, who feel they have been punished for trying to make ends meet. The case of the Devon family has once again highlighted the need for a more nuanced approach to term-time holidays. While education authorities have a duty to ensure that children attend school regularly, there needs to be more understanding and support for families who find themselves in difficult financial situations. At the same time, parents also have a responsibility to ensure that their children attend school regularly and should work with the school to find a solution if they are struggling to make ends meet. In the case of the Devon family, it remains to be seen whether they will face court action or be able to come to a resolution with the education authorities. What is clear is that this issue is not going away and that more needs to be done to support families who are struggling to make ends meet.
