article: Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A car bomb Thursday rocked a southern suburb of Lebanon's capital -- an area known as a stronghold of the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, the Lebanese Army said. Eighteen people were killed and 291 were wounded, the Lebanese national news agency NNA reported. Video shown on Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV showed fierce flames engulfing several cars in the Beirut suburb. Thick, black smoke rose from the vehicles; a nearby building also appeared to be on fire. Ambulances were rushing to the site of the blast, NNA reported. "Army units arrived immediately at the scene, enforcing a security zone within the area of explosion while military experts initiated investigations under the concerned judiciary's surveillance," the army said. After the blast, a YouTube video surfaced in which three masked men holding weapons claimed they are part of a group responsible for the attack. They stood before a large Arabic sign containing the Islamic creed, "There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is the messenger of Allah." The group, which calls itself "The brigade of Aisha, Mother of Believers," accused Hezbollah of being aggressors. Aisha is the last wife of the Prophet Muhammad and is especially revered by Sunni Muslims. In its YouTube post, the group called Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah a "pig" and said he works on behalf of Iran and Israel. "A message: To our brothers and sisters in Lebanon: Stay away from anything to do with Iran -- whether in Beirut or outside Beirut," it said. Hezbollah is a Shiite movement in Lebanon. Along with Shiite-dominated Iran, the group is helping Syria's government fight rebels, whose ranks are dominated by Sunnis. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the video or the men's claims. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut tweeted condemnations of the attack. Civil Defense units were trying to rescue some citizens stuck inside their homes due to the fire resulting from the blast, NNA reported. The explosion comes about a month after a car bomb injured dozens of people in the pro-Hezbollah neighborhood of Bir El Abed, located in a southern Beirut suburb. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Beirut, Lebanon. CNN's Yasmin Amer reported from Atlanta.

chatgpt: At least 18 people were killed and 291 others were wounded in a massive explosion that rocked a neighborhood in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday. According to state-run news, the explosion was caused by a car bomb that went off near a Hezbollah-controlled security checkpoint. The blast caused severe damage to nearby buildings and left cars charred and smoldering. Emergency services rushed to the scene shortly after the explosion, where they found chaotic scenes of destruction and people screaming for help. The army has reported that they believe a car loaded with explosives caused the blast. A video posted on YouTube by an unknown group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in retaliation for Hezbollah's military intervention in Syria. The targeted area is a well-known Hezbollah stronghold, and it is believed that the group was the intended target of the attack. Hezbollah, a militant and political group, has been instrumental in supporting the Syrian government during the country's civil war. The incident prompted Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to hold an emergency security meeting with top officials. Speaking after the meeting, Hariri condemned the attack, saying, "What happened today is a terrorist act that violates the sanctity of the area and the people who live there." Hezbollah also issued a statement following the attack, calling it a "cowardly and criminal act" and vowing to continue "fighting against terrorism." The explosion marks a concerning escalation in violence in Lebanon, where residents have been grappling with political and economic uncertainty for years. The country has been hit by a wave of protests over the past several months, with citizens demanding an end to corruption and the provision of basic services. The attack came on the eve of Lebanon's Independence Day, which is typically marked with festive celebrations. However, amid heightened security concerns, many events were canceled. The international community has also condemned the attack, with the United Nations calling for those responsible to be brought to justice. The US embassy in Lebanon also issued a statement, saying, "We stand with the Lebanese people and their legitimate aspirations for security, stability, and prosperity."  A full investigation into the incident is currently underway, and authorities have urged citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.
