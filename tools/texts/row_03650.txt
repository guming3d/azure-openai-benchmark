article: It sounds like a plot lifted from a sci-fi disaster movie. A Russian scientist has said a Soviet-era ballistic missile system dubbed 'Satan' should be put back into use defending the earth from asteroids. Senior rocket researcher Sabit Saitgarayev - who spoke out after a meteor burst over Russia's Ural Mountains earlier this year damaging thousands of buildings - said the old 1960s missiles were ideally suited to destroying any potential threats streaking towards the planet from space. Back in use? The scientist suggested the old Soviet-era SS9 ICBM missiles should be put back to work protecting the earth from meteorites . Threat: The researcher said the missiles - named Satan by NATO - were well suited to 'fighting suddenly discovered small [space] objects' Powerful: The meteor left a 50-foot hole in the frozen surface of a lake as it crashed down in Russia's Chelyabinsk region . Mr Saitgarayev, from the State Rocket Design Center, highlighted the havoc caused when the meteor burst over the Urals on February 15, leaving around 1,200 people injured. It created a sonic boom that shattered windows and damaged thousands of buildings around the city of Chelyabinsk. 'Well-suited': The Soviet-era missiles could intercept a falling missile with a mere 20 minutes' warning, Mr Saitgarayev claimed . The researcher said the missiles, which use standard liquid fuel based on hydrazine, were 'well-suited' to fighting 'suddenly discovered small [space] objects, according to a report on news.com.au. He pointed out that the missiles could be kept poised and ready to launch for up to a decade. It means a missile could be launched against an approaching asteroid with a mere 20 minutes warning, in contrast to modern missile systems, which require several days of preparation ahead of a launch. Hurtling from space: The missiles could intercept a meteorite like the one that streaked across the sky over Chelyabinsk in February before it crashed into the earth, the scientist has claimed . Defence: The scientist referred to the meteor that streaked across the skies over Russia's Ural Mountains earlier this year, causing sharp explosions . Damage: The exploding meteorite left the roof of this zinc factory in Russia's Chelyabinsk region in ruins . Scientists claimed the meteorite that exploded over the Urals was the biggest space rock to hit earth in more than a century. The enormous meteorite weighed an estimated 100,000 tons and measured around 55ft in diameter. Mr Saitgarayev claimed Satan missiles would be capable of destroying objects with a diameter of up to around 300ft. If equipped with a booster, the 1960s missile would be able to destroy a space object hurtling towards earth while it was still five to six hours away, he said. Satan missiles can be used for destroying small space objects with a diameter of up to 100 meters threatening the Earth, if the missile is equipped with the third stage. If reequipped with a booster, the missile will be able to destroy space objects five-six hours before their collision with the Earth, he said.

chatgpt: A new study has emerged which claims that Soviet-era missiles could prevent damage caused by meteorites hurtling towards Earth. This news comes in the wake of a meteorite which burst over Russia's Ural Mountains earlier this year. The sonic boom from the rock caused damage to thousands of buildings and left 1,200 people injured. The researcher who conducted the study believes that a missile could destroy a similar rock before it even makes contact with Earth. Due to the unpredictable nature of meteorite strikes, this type of solution may be necessary in the future to protect communities from damage. The Soviet-era missile in question is a modified intercontinental ballistic missile which could be launched at a meteorite traveling towards Earth. The missile would target the rock and obliterate it, preventing it from causing any harm. The researcher argues that this type of missile is more reliable and effective than conventional anti-aircraft defenses. The exact cost of developing and deploying missile-based anti-meteorite defenses is not clear, but the researcher believes that it would be worth the investment in the long run. The potential damage caused by a meteorite strike could be catastrophic, not to mention the cost of the cleanup and rebuilding efforts afterward. Many scientists have already voiced their support for developing effective anti-meteorite defenses. However, some argue that it is too difficult to predict when a meteorite will strike, and that a missile-based defense system may not be able to react quickly enough to prevent the damage. Despite the skepticism, the researcher behind the new study remains optimistic. They believe that the development of reliable anti-meteorite defenses is essential to protecting our planet from potential catastrophic events in the future. The idea of using missiles to prevent meteorite strikes is not a new one. In fact, NASA has already begun funding research into the development of an anti-asteroid defense system. While the details of this system are not yet clear, it is clear that there is a growing concern about the potential damage that could be caused by a wayward rock hurtling towards Earth. In the end, only time will tell whether or not the development of anti-meteorite defenses is a worthwhile investment. But as the risks of meteorite strikes become more apparent, it is clear that something needs to be done to protect our planet from these catastrophic events. The idea of using Soviet-era missiles to prevent such strikes may seem unconventional, but it may be just what we need to keep ourselves safe from the dangers of space.
