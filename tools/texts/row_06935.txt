Graeme Porteous, 48, was swept to his death on Saturday after his off-piste ski party was hit by a 45ft-wide wall of snow in Argentera in Piedmont. Mr Porteous, who lived in Wimbledon, South-West London, with his wife Alexandra, survived the initial impact of the avalanche but suffered ‘multiple trauma’ when he was trapped against a tree and died within minutes. Danger: Graeme Porteous, 48, was swept to his death in Italy's Argentera region of the Alps (pictured) Last night a neighbour confirmed that Singapore-born Mr Porteous was a private investment banker who ran his own business from the £5.8million family home. The neighbour said: ‘This is a tragic accident for a lovely family.’ Mr Porteous is one of three skiers killed this weekend across Italy by heavy snow falls. Italian authorities said that he was part of a ‘really well organised’ group of ten friends and two guides enjoying the final day of their holiday but that conditions in that area were perilous. Raffaele Bagnis, head of the local Alpine Rescue team, told The Times: ‘They had gone off piste and provoked the avalanche. Thick snow: A skier in the Argentera region (file photo). The group had taken precautions . ‘There was one metre of fresh snow there and two metres higher up, with massive drifts built up by the wind . ‘There was too much snow to be out there. You can be the best skier in the world, but that doesn’t count in conditions like that. ‘Mr Porteous was conscious after the impact, but complained of pain in his leg and died five minutes later.’ The group had taken good precautions against the weather and each skier was wearing a backpack containing twin airbags, which can be inflated when an avalanche approaches to help stop the wearer being buried by snow. None was buried and all excepted for Mr Porteous escaped unharmed. Captain Giuseppe La Torre, the local commander of the Carabiniere police said the spate of avalanches across the region have been caused by unseasonably warm weather. He said: ‘There are lots of avalanches here at the moment because of snowfalls followed by sun. It can be very dangerous and this was indicated to skiers.’ Mr Porteous’s group, which is believed to include his wife, returned to the UK yesterday and were said to be ‘destroyed’ at his death. There were numerous other incidents in the region over the weekend. At Cortina d’Ampezzo in the Veneto region, rescuers spent four hours recovering the body of a 24 year old Dutch skier buried by a an avalanche while skiing off piste. And i the Trentino region, a group of snowboarders headed off piste at Passo Brocon but were struck by an avalanche which killed one of them after he was buried under nearly five feet of snow.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck the ski slopes of Italy this past weekend as heavy snowfalls claimed the lives of three skiers, including Singapore-born investment banker Graeme Porteous. The 48-year-old, who resided in Wimbledon, South London, was skiing in the Argentera region near the French border when he was hit by 45ft of snow. Porteous had been skiing with a group of friends when they were caught off guard by the sudden snowfall. Despite being equipped with the necessary safety gear, including an avalanche transceiver, he was unable to avoid being buried under the heavy snow. His friends immediately sprung into action and started a frantic search, but it took rescue teams several hours to locate and dig him out of the snow. Sadly, their efforts were in vain, as Porteous was already deceased when he was found. The other two skiers who lost their lives over the weekend were also caught in the heavy snowfalls that swept through the region. The tragic incident has sparked a wave of tributes and condolences from Porteous' friends and colleagues in the finance industry. A seasoned investment banker, he had worked for a number of high-profile banks in Singapore and London, including Barclays and Goldman Sachs. One of his former colleagues, who wished to remain anonymous, described Porteous as "a true professional and a great guy to work with. He was passionate about his work and always had a positive attitude, no matter what the market was doing. He will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him." Born and raised in Singapore, Porteous moved to the UK in the early 2000s to pursue his career in finance. He had a passion for skiing and would often travel to the Alps with his friends for weekend breaks. Despite his extensive experience on the slopes, however, he was unable to avoid the tragedy that befell him and his fellow skiers. The ski resort where the incident occurred has since suspended all skiing activities as a precautionary measure, with officials urging skiers to exercise extreme caution in the wake of the tragic deaths. Avalanche warnings have also been issued across the region, with more heavy snowfall expected in the coming days. As friends and family mourn the loss of Graeme Porteous, the incident has once again raised questions about the safety of skiing and other winter sports. While the risks associated with such activities are well-known, accidents like this serve as a stark reminder of the dangers that can lurk on the slopes, even for experienced skiers.
