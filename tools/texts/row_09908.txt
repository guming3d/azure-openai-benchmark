Mr McGlade said: 'I probably would have been in severe trouble if he wouldn't have called.' Last month MailOnline reported how a Labrador-springer spaniel-cross called Judy had twice rescued her 61-year-old owner from death. The first life-saving act was four years ago when Judy helped bring Sharon Brookes a Mars bar after she fell into a diabetic coma. The latest occasion however was when Judy managed to dislodge a piece of toast from Miss Brookes's throat after she started choking in her home in Little Hereford, Ludlow, Shropshire. Miss Brookes, who has had Judy since she was a puppy, said: 'There was nobody else in the house and I just thought that was it - I thought I was a goner. I wouldnâ€™t be here without her.' Mr McGlade said Major has been trained to help when he has a seizure . Pensioner Miss Brookes was snacking on toast in her kitchen when a piece got stuck in her throat. When she started to choke, her faithful dog knew something was wrong and jumped to the rescue. Judy 'punched' Miss Brookes on the back and managed to dislodge the food.

chatgpt: A heroic dog in Chesapeake, Virginia, saved his owner's life by calling 911 when he suffered a seizure. Terry McGlade has a retriever-pit bull cross named Major, who has been trained to help him during seizures. McGlade trained Major to place his paws on his owner's shoulders and then lick his face until he comes out of the seizure.  On one fateful day, McGlade had a seizure while he was alone in his house. Major had been trained to call 911, and he did just that. Using his paw, Major placed it on his owner's iPhone screen, which was already programmed with emergency numbers for him to dial. The call went through to 911. When the emergency operator answered, all they could hear was heavy breathing and some whining. They could also hear Major barking in the background. The operator could not understand what was happening until Major placed his paws on the phone again, allowing the operator to see the owner's details on the caller ID, including his address. The emergency operator then dispatched police and medics to the address. However, before they arrived, Major had already gone to the front of the house and waited at the door for them. Once they arrived, they found McGlade unconscious and immediately rushed him to the hospital. He was later discharged, and his family was amazed at the bravery of their dog. McGlade said that he never imagined that his dog would save his life by calling 911. He trained Major himself, and it always seemed like a fun game they played together. He never thought that one day, it would come in handy.  Major is a service dog, and he has received extensive training to perform specific tasks to help his owner during his seizures. McGlade credits Major with giving him a new lease of life, and he is thankful for their bond.  Now, McGlade and his family are advocating for more people to train their dogs to be service dogs, especially for those who suffer from seizures or other illnesses. They believe that these animals can help save lives and improve the quality of life for people. In conclusion, the heroic actions of Major, the retriever-pit bull cross, have saved the life of his owner. By calling 911, Major was able to get the emergency services to McGlade quickly, allowing him to receive immediate medical attention. The bravery and loyalty of service dogs like Major are a testament to the bond that exists between humans and their pets.
