article: McDonald's doesn't think its employees should eat the food they serve. The fast food giant has advised employees to avoid meals with burgers and fries and to eat healthier options like salad and sandwiches. The advice was dispensed on the now-infamous McResource Line, the employees-only website that has told workers to sell their things and get second jobs to make ends meet. Good idea, bad idea: McDonald's didn't think its employees should eat the food they serve, as seen in this graph from their staff website McResource Line, which was pulled down this week . The advice is given with graphics depicting the ‘unhealthy choice’ and the ‘healthier choice.’ McDonald’s own food is in the former column. Despite featuring a vast array of deep fried delicacies, the Golden Arches reminds employees that ‘avoiding items that are deep fried are your best bet.’ The sensible advice also tells McWorkers to ‘limit the extras such as cheese, bacon and mayonnaise.’ Tasty add-ons that are staples of many menu items they serve on a daily basis. A hamburger, fries and soda are warned against, because ‘eating a diet high in fat puts people at rick for becoming overweight.’ Many locations offer steep food discounts and short breaks to employees, virtually forcing them to eat the unhealthy food, often forcing the hand of workers without the time or means to eat elsewhere. Solid advice: Don't eat at McDonald's. The fast food chain were forced to admit the embarrassing and 'outdated' information on their site has lead to a temporarily shutdown for 'upgrades' ‘It is hard to eat a healthy diet when you eat at fast-food restaurants often,’ the advice continues. ‘Many foods are cooked with a lot of fat, even if they are not trans fats. Many fast-food restaurants do not offer any lower-fat foods.’ The world’s largest fast food chain wants employees to eat elsewhere. ‘Eat at places that offer a variety of salads, soups, and vegetables,’ the site says. This advice comes after a series of tips telling employees find second jobs, apply for food stamps and sell their things to weather a financial crisis. The site also gave advice on how to tip au pairs, doormen, personal trainers and pool boys. A spokesperson told CNBC that the website has been ‘taken entirely out of context.'

chatgpt: McDonald's, the world's largest fast food chain, is once again under the spotlight for its unconventional employee advice. The company's McResource Line, a helpline service for employees, is now encouraging them to avoid deep-fried food, a staple of McDonald's menu. The advice comes as part of McDonald's attempt to promote its health and fitness campaign. The McResource Line has made several controversial suggestions in the past, including encouraging employees to apply for food stamps, pawn their things, and look for a second job to help pay bills. However, the recent advice to avoid deep-fried food comes as a surprise to many. The McResource Line suggests that employees should stick to salads and vegetables, which are now available on McDonald's menu, minus the bacon, cheese and mayonnaise. Although McDonald's has been trying to incorporate healthier items in its menu, the company has been struggling to attract customers to the healthier options due to their comparatively high prices. The McResource Line's announcement comes as McDonald's faces increasing scrutiny on a range of issues concerning its employees. The company has been criticized for its low wages and poor working conditions, which have led to strikes and protests in many parts of the world. The fast food giant has also been accused of promoting unhealthy eating habits through its menu and marketing strategies. In response to the criticism, McDonald's has launched several initiatives aimed at improving the health and well-being of its employees. The company introduced a wellness program for employees, which rewards them for adopting healthier habits. The company has also pledged to increase the wages of its employees and to provide them with better working conditions. However, critics argue that McDonald's needs to do more to address the structural problems in its business model. "McDonald's is a giant corporation that relies on cheap labor and unhealthy food to make profits," says Jessica Levinson, a professor of law at Loyola Marymount University. "It is not enough to offer employees a wellness program while ignoring the fundamental issues of low wages and poor working conditions." Despite the criticisms, McDonald's remains a powerful force in the fast food industry. The company has over 38,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries and serves over 69 million customers every day. However, as public awareness of health and wellness issues continues to rise, the company will need to continue to adapt its business strategies to stay competitive.
