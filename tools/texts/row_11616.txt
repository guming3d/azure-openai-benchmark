article: New York (CNN) -- The remains of three additional people were discovered Monday morning near Gilgo Beach on Long Island, according to Richard Dormer, Suffolk County Police commissioner. A total of eight human remains have been found in the area since a missing New Jersey woman prompted the searches beginning in 2010. Shannan Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, has been missing since May 1 and was last seen alive in the Gilgo Beach area. As authorities searched for clues about her disappearance last year, they uncovered the bodies of four prostitutes in various stages of decomposition. Police say the hunt for a potential serial killer continues, as does the search for Gilbert, who, like the women whose bodies have been found, advertised for prostitution services on such sites as Craigslist. An additional body was found March 29 off Ocean Parkway, west of Cedar Beach. When medical examination determined they were not Gilbert's remains, the police continued to search, leading to Monday's discovery. Gilbert's family is being asked to identify whether the remains found Monday are those of their missing daughter, Dormer said. "We should move forward to find out quickly if it's her or not her. We put a priority on identification," Dormer said. "We haven't given up on the search for Shannan Gilbert," Dormer said, "just in case the remains we discovered today are not hers." Gilbert's sister, Sheree Gilbert, told HLN's Nancy Grace Monday night that her family was notified about the discovery of the latest bodies Monday afternoon. Authorities told them that DNA testing to determine identities will be done "as soon as possible," she said. "We're just hoping and praying that it's not her," she added. The initial four bodies were discovered stuffed into bushes on a quarter-mile stretch of waterfront property on Oak Beach, indicating "they were dumped there by the same person or persons," Dormer said in December. "It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location." The remains of the fifth body were found about a mile from where the other corpses were discovered, he said, refusing to disclose exactly where the three additional remains were found on Monday. Of the first remains found, all four women had advertised for prostitution services on the Craigslist website, with one body having been there for as long as two years, police said. The highway is closed Monday night with officers on guard from the Causeway to Nassau County Line so the search can resume Tuesday, Dormer said. "The investigation is going to move forward over the next hours, and into tomorrow," days and weeks ahead, Dormer said.

chatgpt: After months of searching, authorities in New Jersey have found a total of eight bodies, which they believe are linked to the disappearance of a local woman. The search operation began when the woman went missing, but the investigation quickly escalated when multiple remains were discovered in close proximity to one another.  Investigators say that the remains were found so close together that they believe they were dumped in the same location by the same person. The discovery of the remains has been a major breakthrough in the case, as it has allowed investigators to focus on a specific area and develop new leads.  The search is still ongoing for the original missing person, and authorities believe that there may be additional remains to be found. The grim discovery has shocked and saddened the community, who had been holding out hope for a positive outcome.  The search for the missing woman began in earnest several months ago, after friends and family reported her disappearance to local police. Her car was found abandoned and empty, and there were no signs of a struggle or foul play.  Investigators initially struggled to make progress in the case, with no clear leads or suspects. However, the discovery of the remains has given them new momentum and a renewed sense of purpose. Authorities have been searching the area for weeks, combing through woods, fields, and other remote areas in the hopes of finding more evidence related to the case.  Despite the grim nature of the discovery, authorities say that they are committed to solving the case and bringing justice to the families of those affected. They are urging anyone with information related to the case to come forward and assist with the investigation.  The search for the missing woman and the discovery of the remains has put a spotlight on the issue of violent crime in the community. Concerned citizens are calling for increased vigilance and for law enforcement agencies to redouble their efforts to protect the community from similar tragedies in the future.  As authorities continue their investigations, the community is left to mourn and grapple with the loss of those whose remains were discovered. Families and friends are holding vigils and memorial services to honor their loved ones and to bring a sense of closure to this difficult and painful chapter.  The case has also raised important questions about how society deals with missing persons cases and how we can better protect vulnerable individuals from harm. In the wake of this tragedy, many are calling for increased resources and support for those in need and for greater awareness around the issue of violent crime.  While the search for all of the answers may continue for some time, authorities remain committed to doing everything in their power to bring justice to those affected by this tragedy, and to bring closure to a community rocked by the discovery of these eight bodies.
