article: PARIS, France (CNN) -- As a look, it is about as quintessentially French as it gets. All the same, from the New Year enjoying a cigarette while you sip on your cafe au lait will become a thing of the past. From January 1 it will be illegal in France to smoke in cafes as well as clubs, casinos and hotels. France is extending its ban on smoking to include bars, discotheques, restaurants, hotels, casinos, as well as its fabled cafes. In a country renowned for its fondness for romance, smoking has never quite shaken off its romantic associations with smoky Left Bank cafes and waifish Parisienne beauties clutching on a Gauloises. In spite of the health dangers, about 13.5 million people smoke out of a population of 60 million with around 26 percent of 15 year olds estimated to smoke, according to 2002 figures from the World Health Organization. A smoking ban was first introduced in France in February this year to cover workplaces, schools, airports and hospitals. The new restrictions will only apply to the inside of premises, meaning smokers are still free to light up on the terraces. Even so, enforcing the ban may prove tricky in a country well known for its cafe culture. To soften the blow, the authorities have agreed to an amnesty over the New Year holiday and will not fully enforce the new arrangements until Wednesday. After that time, any smoker caught will face a fine of €450 ($662), while hotel and bar owners who fail to prevent smokers from lighting up on their premises will be fined €750 ($1,100). France has lagged behind many of its European neighbors in bringing in legislation to curb smoking in public places. Ireland became the first European country to introduce a comprehensive smoking ban in 2004. Since then Italy, Spain, Belgium and Britain have followed suit with similar bans. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: France is set to extend its smoking ban to cover bars, clubs, restaurants, and cafes from January 1 next year. This reinforces the nation's battle against smoking after the initial smoking ban was introduced in February 2007, which prohibited smoking in public buildings and workplaces. The new extension of the smoking ban aims to reduce the number of people exposed to harmful second-hand smoke. According to official statistics, about 13.5 million people in France smoke out of a population of 60 million. This is higher compared to some of the other countries, which have already implemented similar bans, such as Ireland, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Britain. The ban has been viewed as a bold move by the French government, especially with the significant numbers of smokers in the country. The smoking ban is part of France's efforts to protect the health of its citizens from the harmful effects of smoking. Second-hand smoking has been linked to numerous health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke. The move is also a strong message to the public that smoking is harmful and needs to be tackled effectively. The French government hopes the new measures will increase awareness on the dangers of smoking and help more people to quit the habit. Smoking cessation support and programs will be made available to help those who want to kick the habit. While many bar, restaurant, and cafe owners have been hesitant to support the new measure, they are aware of the growing demand for non-smoking establishments. The new law presents an opportunity for these establishments to cater to customers who are concerned about their health. In conclusion, the smoking ban extension in France is a significant step in reducing smoking rates and promoting healthier lifestyles. The decision will affect millions of people and is expected to have a significant impact on public health. Similar bans have proven successful in other countries, and France is hopeful that it will follow the same path towards a smoke-free environment.
