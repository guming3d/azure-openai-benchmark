article: BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Protesters across Iraq Tuesday urged government authorities to free the TV correspondent who threw his shoes at President Bush. TV reporter Muntadhar al-Zaidi, shown in a file photo, was jailed after throwing his shoes at President Bush. Hundreds of students at Diyala University in Baquba carried banners demanding the release of Muntadhar al-Zaidi -- described by demonstrators as an "honorable Iraqi." Smaller protests emerged in the Anbar province city of Falluja and in two Baghdad locations -- Baghdad University in the northern part of the city and western Baghdad's Ameriya district. In those events, students also took to the streets. Al-Zaidi threw his shoes at Bush while Bush and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki were holding a Sunday news conference after the president's surprise visit to Baghdad. The journalist was dragged to the ground, hustled out of the room and arrested. Shouting as he was dragged to the floor, the reporter called his shoe-throwing -- a traditional insult in Arab culture -- a "farewell kiss" to a "dog" who launched the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Asked about the incident by CNN's Candy Crowley, Bush said, "I didn't have much time to reflect on anything. I was ducking and dodging." He said the journalist was "looking for notoriety" and that authorities shouldn't overreact in their treatment of him. TV networks across the world continue to air the shoe-throwing scene, which has touched a nerve in the Arab world, where there has been an outpouring of support for al-Zaidi -- a correspondent for the Egyptian-based Al-Baghdadia TV.

chatgpt: Former US President George W. Bush has dismissed the actions of Muntadhar al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist who infamously threw his shoes at him during a press conference in 2008, as just an attempt to gain notoriety. Speaking with Fox News, Bush stated that al-Zaidi was "just a guy that was trying to get on TV and he got on TV."  Bush's comments were made in response to a recent gathering of hundreds of students in the streets of Baghdad, who carried banners calling for the release of al-Zaidi. The demonstrators described him as an "honorable Iraqi" who had simply expressed the frustration and anger felt by many in the country towards American influence.  However, al-Zaidi's own brother has now shed new light on the journalist's actions that day. In an interview with Reuters, Durgham al-Zaidi stated that Muntadhar had long harbored deep feelings of animosity towards both American and Iranian influence in Baghdad.  "His point was not just about President Bush," said Durgham al-Zaidi. "It was about the destruction of Iraq, about the humiliation of the Iraqi people. It was about the killing of innocent people."  Muntadhar al-Zaidi's shoe-throwing incident quickly captured the attention of the world's media, and the journalist was hailed as a hero by many in the Arab world who saw the act as a symbol of resistance against American aggression.  Although al-Zaidi was initially sentenced to three years in prison for assaulting a foreign head of state, the sentence was later reduced to one year and he was released for good behavior after serving just nine months.  Many Iraqis continue to view al-Zaidi as a martyr for their cause, and his shoe-throwing incident remains a potent symbol of resistance against the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Bush's dismissal of al-Zaidi's actions as attention-seeking drew criticism from some quarters. "The fact that Bush would still try to dismiss al-Zaidi's actions as a publicity stunt just shows how little he understands about the suffering of the Iraqi people under his leadership," said one Iraqi commentator.  Despite the passage of over a decade since the incident, Muntadhar al-Zaidi remains a controversial figure, with many in Iraq continuing to view him as a symbol of resistance against foreign aggression.
