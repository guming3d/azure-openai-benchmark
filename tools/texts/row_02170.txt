Tony Blair's multi-million-pound fortune has received an £80,000 boost from the will of his father Leo. Probate records reveal that Leo, a former barrister and law lecturer who died aged 89 last November,  left a net estate worth £295,000. His will, drawn up in 2005, left a legacy of £50,000 to his daughter Sarah, 56, who is unmarried. The rest of the estate was then divided between all three of his children, meaning Sarah, Mr Blair and their elder brother Sir William, 63, a High Court judge, each receive £80,000. Mr Blair, 60, was very close to his father and named his youngest son after him. Inheritance: Tony Blair, pictured with his wife Cherie after winning the Sedgefield seat in 2001, has been left £80,000 in the will of his father Leo, pictured right, who died last year . The former Prime Minister is notoriously secretive about his wealth, with most of his earnings since he left office in 2007 being hidden in a network of private companies. Mr Blair makes millions of pounds a year from advising business chiefs and governments. He is also one of the world’s highest-paid after-dinner speakers. It was revealed just last month how Tony Blair and his wife Cherie have added house number eight to their expanding property portfolio. Like the purchase of their seventh house, costing £1.35million in September, cash was again paid when they snapped up a £600,000 cottage for the former prime minister’s younger sister, Sarah Blair. The pretty woodland retreat – about a mile from the Blairs’ Buckinghamshire mansion for which they paid £5.75million in 2008 – was bought on Valentine’s Day earlier this year. Land Registry documents show it is owned jointly and ‘equally’ by Sarah and Cherie Blair.

The homes the Blairs bought for their children are also co-owned by Mrs Blair. Mr Blair, 60, is said to be protective of his sister, who is unmarried, has no children and shuns publicity. He has said that they and their brother Bill were all very close and that he would often turn to his siblings for emotional support. Until recently Miss Blair lived in a £450,000 flat in Islington, North London. The Blairs also lived in Islington until the 1997 election when they moved to No 10 and sold their home only to see it rocket in value. Now the combined estimated value of the eight properties in their portfolio is nearly £21million. Mr Blair reputedly earns £20million a year from government advisory work, speeches and consultancy work and has amassed a fortune of up to £60million.

chatgpt: The father of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has left a net estate worth £295,000 in his will. Leo Blair, who was a former barrister, left £50,000 to his daughter Sarah, 56, who remains unmarried. The remainder of the estate was divided evenly between all three of his children, meaning Sarah as well as Tony Blair and his elder brother Sir William each received £80,000. The news of Leo Blair's will and its contents has brought attention to the financial status of the Blair family. While Leo's estate is worth a considerable amount, it pales in comparison to the wealth accumulated by Tony Blair over the years. It is believed that the former Prime Minister has a fortune of around £60 million, much of it coming from his work as an international consultant and his property portfolio, which has been valued at £21 million. Interestingly, Tony Blair's wealth appears to have increased significantly since leaving office in 2007. Despite his standing as a controversial figure in politics, Blair has succeeded in turning his public profile into a lucrative business. He has been a sought-after speaker and advisor, particularly in the Middle East, and has also founded his own consulting firm, Tony Blair Associates. While the Blair family's financial status is undoubtedly impressive, it is worth noting that they are not alone in their wealth among former UK Prime Ministers. David Cameron, who preceded Blair, is estimated to have earned around £3.5 million since leaving office, through a combination of speaking fees, book deals, and advisory roles. Similarly, Gordon Brown is believed to have earned millions through speaking engagements and book deals. The revelation of Leo Blair's will has also brought attention to the ongoing debate over inheritance tax in the UK. At present, estates worth more than £325,000 are subject to a 40% tax on everything above that threshold. Many argue that this level is too high, particularly in the context of rising property prices which can push even relatively modest estates over the limit. It remains to be seen whether the Blair family will face any significant tax burden as a result of Leo's estate, but the episode serves as a reminder of the complex and often contentious issues surrounding wealth and inheritance in modern society. While some celebrate the ability to accumulate vast fortunes, others argue that the gap between rich and poor is widening and that the tax system needs to address this. With the debate showing no signs of abating, it seems certain that the issue of wealth and its distribution will continue to be a major topic in the years to come.
