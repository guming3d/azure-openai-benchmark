The incident occurred when a car travelling at a high speed crashed into the rear of a family car in Northeast Washington. In the aftermath of the accident, four sisters and cousins were identified as the victims; Tameika Curtis and Typhani Wilkerson, both sisters, as well as Haddah Ba, 13, and Hassan Boykin, 1. The family was travelling in their Acura when the fatal collision occurred on 22nd Street near Benning Road. The impact was so severe that the family members were trapped in the vehicle. According to a witness at the scene, he saw one of the survivors crawling out of the car on his elbows. He rushed to help, but it was too late to save the others. The deceased sisters were 34 and 31 years old, respectively, and were the daughters of Sheila Curtis, who was also in the car at the time of the crash. Sheila was taken to a nearby hospital but was released after receiving treatment for her injuries. Sadly, ten children are now left without their mothers, who were known for their devotion to their families.
