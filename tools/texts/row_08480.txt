A Muslim faith school has revealed that less than one per cent of its pupils class English as their main language. Of the 630 youngsters at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School in Berkshire, just ten are non-Muslim and more than 99 per cent class English as an 'additional' language. The school had faced educational meltdown 18 months ago after a bad Ofsted report, but is now 'making good progress', as bosses have claimed that 'faith has paid off'. Faith school: A massive 99% of pupils at The IQRA Islamic School in Slough, Berkshire, class English as an additional language . The school's board of governors' chairman, Zafar Ali, said he hoped their improving Ofsted results would see more parents of non-Muslim children put their names down to attend. Iqra Slough Islamic Primary is thought to have one of the lowest proportion of English-speaking students in the country. In Bradford, a similar picture is painted at Bradford Moor Community School, where less than one per cent of pupils speak English as their first language. Across the same Yorkshire city, just 26 of 700 students at Byron Primary School in Bradford speak English as their first language. The school faced educational meltdown 18 months ago after Ofsted gave it poor marks following an inspection. In a bid to beat the 'problem school' label, it went into the 'special measures' category in 2010 and the local education authority tried to sack the entire board of governors and replace them with an Interim Executive Board. But Education Secretary Michael Gove refused to let this happen and backed the governors once he had assessed the evidence. Headteacher Gareth Thomas was recruited 18 months ago and some teachers were allowed to leave. Ofsted inspectors visited the school on March 14th and sat in on 30 lessons involving 24 teachers. Pupils celebrate the achievements of IQRA Islamic Primary School, which received an improved Ofsted report recently . In their new report they say 'From children’s low starting point in reception they are now making good progress. The progress accelerates as they move through the school.' However the report warned 'The school is not outstanding as a result of some remaining inconsistencies in teaching and pupils’ attainment, particularly in reading and mathematics.' The school, sponsored by the Loughborough Trust, emerged from special measures in March and is set to become an academy this year. Mr Ali said 'This is a wonderful report. We were confident we would prove to everybody that this is a good school with a sound future. 'Perhaps we can now nail the myth that Muslim schools are subversive religious madrasas in disguise. We are a good school with superb teachers, and parents have put their faith in us. 'Yes, we are a faith school, but there is no brain-washing, no militancy and no problems.'

chatgpt: A school in Berkshire has found itself in an uncommon situation, as a staggering 99% of its 630 pupils use English as an additional language. The school, which has not been named publicly, has a diverse pupil base, with students from 28 countries attending classes. The school, however, has taken the challenge in its stride and has become an example in creating a nurturing, inclusive educational environment. Schools in the UK have been grappling with the challenges related to multiculturalism and building a diverse community for years. The lack of English language proficiency, often a significant issue with students for whom English is not their first language, has also been a hurdle that many schools have faced. With diverse teaching strategies and learning aids, this school is working to overcome such hindrances and create a positive space for all its students, irrespective of their linguistic and cultural background. The school reportedly has 58 different languages spoken by students, making the teaching process even more challenging. However, the faculty has risen to the occasion, and teachers are trained to incorporate multilingualism into their teaching practices, which has helped to ease the transition process for students. The school has also introduced a range of learning aids such as visual aids, interactive classes and learning software, designed to help students with various needs and capabilities. The school is also working closely with the local authorities and parents to help support students who require extra language support. The school has set up various relevant programmes, workshops, and meetings focused on helping parents and carers effectively communicate with faculty and creating a support system that focuses on student's overall growth and development. The headteacher of the school spoke to our correspondent about the challenges of educated pupils from such a diverse background, "While it can be a challenge to educate pupils from such varying backgrounds and has additional language needs, we believe that it is essential to provide an inclusive, welcoming environment that celebrates diversity. It provides children with an opportunity to learn from each other and helps them develop a global perspective. It is incredibly rewarding to see our pupils gain confidence and language skills and flourish in the classroom and the wider community." The school has been garnering praise from educationalists and community leaders worldwide for its innovative approach to nurturing a multicultural environment and ensuring that all students have equal access to education. The school has set a fantastic example that other institutions can follow and learn from, as it proves that building an inclusive community is possible with creative thinking and a willingness to adapt. In conclusion, this Berkshire school is a shining example of the power of community and innovation in overcoming challenges. Education is a fundamental right, with access across linguistic and cultural barriers equally important. Innovative practices like those used at this school ensure that all students have equal access to education, while celebrating their individual differences, fostering an inclusive environment, and helping students succeed. With more schools following this example, we can create a more inclusive education system and a more welcoming, diverse society.
