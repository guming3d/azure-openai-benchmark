chatgpt: A 24-year-old man named Ho Zhiliang has a medical condition called congenital cardiac exposure syndrome, in which his heart can be seen visibly beating just beneath the surface of his skin in his upper abdomen. This condition has made him a unique case in the medical community and has required constant medical attention throughout his life.  When Ho was born, his parents were told that their son would not live long. However, he proved to be a fighter and has defied the odds by surviving for 24 years. His unique condition has caused him to be the center of attention among doctors and medical professionals.  The condition is extremely rare, with only a handful of cases ever being reported worldwide. Those with congenital cardiac exposure syndrome are born with a weakened diaphragm, causing their heart to push upwards into the chest cavity instead of staying contained in the ribcage.  Though Ho's condition has made him a unique case in the medical field, it is not without its challenges. Due to the constant exposure of his heart, Ho is at risk of infections, trauma, and emotional distress. His condition also makes it difficult for him to participate in normal everyday activities, such as exercise or physical labor. However, there may be light at the end of the tunnel for Ho. Doctors believe that he may be a candidate for a rare surgical procedure that could potentially save his life. This surgery would involve moving Ho's heart back into his ribcage, allowing him to lead a more normal life. The procedure is not without its risks, though. Moving the heart back into the ribcage requires a delicate surgery that carries a risk of significant blood loss and damage to vital organs. However, Ho and his family are optimistic about the surgery and the potential for a brighter future.  In an interview, Ho expressed optimism about the potential for the surgery. "I know that it will be a long, difficult road, but I am ready for the challenge. I want to live a normal life and this surgery gives me that opportunity." Ho's case has become a topic of fascination in the medical community, with many researchers and doctors eager to study his condition further. His unique situation has the potential to pave the way for new medical breakthroughs and treatments for those born with congenital cardiac exposure syndrome. While Ho's journey has been difficult so far, his optimism and resilience are truly inspiring. With the potential for a successful surgery on the horizon, the future looks brighter than ever for this remarkable young man.
