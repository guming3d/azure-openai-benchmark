Sprint boat racing, or jetsprinting as it's sometimes known, originated as an organised sport in New Zealand in 1981, and events were originally held in natural braided rivers. A crew consists of the driver and a navigator whoe guides the driver through the course - typically via simple hand signals - pointing the hand in the direction that the boat must go at the next intersection.

chatgpt: An accident occurred during a sprint boat race in Albany, Oregon, resulting in injuries to multiple participants and spectators. Reports indicate that the incident unfolded during the heat of the competition, as several high-speed vessels navigated a winding water course. According to eyewitnesses, the accident appeared to stem from a miscommunication between two boats, one of which collided with a concrete barrier lining the racecourse. The impact caused the vessel to flip over and sent debris scattering into the surrounding area. The immediate aftermath of the incident was chaotic, with emergency responders rushing to the scene to provide aid to those involved. Scores of spectators were also left in a state of shock, many of whom were hit by the debris or sprayed with water from the wake of the boats. "It was really scary," one witness commented. "One moment everything was fine, and the next thing we knew there was a huge crash, and people were screaming and running everywhere." Multiple people were taken to local hospitals for treatment, including several racers who suffered injuries as a result of the collision. The severity of their injuries was not immediately clear, though several individuals were seen being transported away from the scene on stretchers. Local authorities, including the Albany Police Department and the Linn County Sheriff's Office, also dispatched officers to the scene to help manage the situation. They worked closely with the race organizers and emergency responders to assess the situation and provide support to those affected. Speaking with reporters, race organizers expressed their deep concern and offered their sympathy to those impacted by the accident. They indicated that they would be conducting a thorough investigation into the incident to determine the root cause and identify any measures that could be taken to prevent similar accidents in the future. "Our thoughts are with everyone who was affected by this terrible incident," one organizer said. "Safety is our top priority, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We will do everything in our power to ensure that something like this never happens again." The incident has drawn attention to the potential risks associated with sprint boat racing, which involves high-speed boats navigating through winding watercourses. While accidents are relatively rare in the sport, they can be particularly dangerous given the speeds involved and the potential for collisions with solid objects. As the investigation into the accident continues, authorities are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward and share their accounts. They have also reminded those in attendance at such events to remain vigilant and follow all safety guidelines to prevent accidents from occurring.
