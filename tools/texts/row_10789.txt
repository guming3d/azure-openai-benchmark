article: MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (CNN) -- Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex couples to adopt children after the Senate voted to approve a bill modifying the country's adoption statute. "It is a right for the boys and the girls, not a right for the adults," Sen. Margarita Percovich said after the vote on Wednesday. "It streamlines the adoption process and does not discriminate." The expected Senate approval followed the lower chamber of Congress' passage of the bill last month. The law will pave the way for gays and lesbians to start a family, Daniel Alonso, a resident of the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, told CNN. "You have plans to form a family, to adopt. When you have a law that protects you, it makes you want to have a child," he said. "You feel part of society." The adoption measure would be the most recent of progressive laws passed with the backing of President Tabare Vazquez. Last year, lawmakers approved a measure allowing children aged 12 or older to change their names, a measure aimed at transgender or transsexual youths. Uruguay also authorized same-sex civil unions last year, setting the stage for the current adoption law. The measure was not without opponents among conservatives and the clergy. Last month, Archbishop Nicolas Cotugno of Montevideo, released a statement warning of consequences for society should the law pass, the Catholic News Agency reported. "The adoption of children by homosexual couples is not a question of religion, philosophy or sociology. It has to do with respect for human nature itself," he said, according to CNA. "To accept the adoption of children by homosexual couples is to go against human nature itself, and consequently, it is to go against the fundamental rights of the human being as a person." Journalist Dario Klein contributed to this report.

chatgpt: After months of heated debate, the Uruguayan Senate is expected to approve a bill allowing gays and lesbians to start a family. The legislation passed the lower chamber earlier this week and is being hailed by many as a significant step forward for LGBTQ+ rights. The new law paves the way for same-sex couples to adopt children and conceive through assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization. It also allows for the recognition of same-sex marriages from foreign countries, granting them legal rights in Uruguayan territory. “This is a monumental victory for the LGBTQ+ community in Uruguay,” said a Montevideo resident who asked to remain anonymous. “It finally gives us the opportunity to start a family and raise children, just like anyone else.” The measure was not without opposition, particularly from conservative and religious groups who argued that it went against traditional family values. However, supporters of the bill countered that it was a matter of equal rights and that all families, regardless of sexual orientation, deserved to be protected and recognized under the law. Lawmakers had previously approved another measure allowing children aged 12 or older to change their names if they desire. This move was seen as a small but significant step towards greater gender identity and expression rights. While some are celebrating the passage of these bills as a win for LGBTQ+ rights, others argue that there is still much to be done. Discrimination and violence against the community remain widespread in Uruguay, and many feel that more needs to be done to address these issues. Nevertheless, supporters of the new legislation see it as a major victory for equal rights and a step towards a more inclusive and progressive society. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill in the coming days. If approved, it will become law and pave the way for new and diverse forms of family in Uruguay.
