article: The family of the man who police say shot himself in the back while under arrest  are asking for a new investigation into his death, following the release of a coroner's report which found the bullet actually entered through the front of his body. Louisiana State Police said in a March release that they arrested 23-year-old Victor White after he got into an alleged fight and he was found in possession of drugs. White was transported to the sheriff's office in a police car, and his hands were handcuffed behind him, police said. While handcuffed, White fired a bullet into his own back and later died, police said. Speaking out: Benjamin Crump speaks at a podium in a Monday news conference.

'Once at the Sheriff’s Office, White became uncooperative and refused to exit the deputy’s patrol vehicle,' the release said.

The coroner's report, however, cited a gunshot wound to the chest,The Times-Picayune reported. At a Monday press conference, Benjamin Crump, the attorney for White's family, said 'We think the Justice Department has to do an independent investigation. We cannot rely on the State Police here in Louisiana who work so closely with the New Iberia Sheriff's Department,' the newspaper reported. 'How is it than [police] can find these soft packages [of drugs on him] but they can't find a hard gun?' Crump also reportedly said. Mystery: Attorney Benjamin Crump said the claim that Victor White shot himself 'just continues to defy all logic' WDSU reported that Crump also said, '[White] has to somehow get his arms over his head, shoot himself in the chest, from right to the left - even though he's left handed, so he doesn't use his dominant hand - and then, on top of all of that, the bullet as it gets across, it doesn't go downward, it goes upward. 'It just continues to defy all logic.' Rev Victor White Sr. was filmed by Times-Picayune saying 'I'll say this: my son didn't kill himself' at the press conference. 'My son had too much going on in his life at that time to take his life,' he also said.

chatgpt: The controversy surrounding the death of Victor White has taken a new twist as his family and attorneys have called for a separate investigation into whether White killed himself. The Louisiana State Police had claimed that White, while his hands were handcuffed behind him in a police vehicle, died after he fired a bullet into his own back, but the latest coroner's report seems to contradict this narrative. White's family and attorneys have demanded answers to what they see as inconsistencies in the case. "At best, the official story creates the impression of extreme incompetence or dishonesty. At worst, it suggests a deliberate effort to cover up the truth about Victor White's death," said a statement from the legal team representing White's estate. The incident occurred in March 2014 when White was arrested and taken into custody. The Louisiana State Police claimed that during the car ride to the station, White produced a gun that he had managed to conceal, shot himself in the chest, and died as a result of the wound. However, the coroner's report from August 2021 indicates that White suffered a gunshot wound to the chest, not the back as the police had reported. This new evidence has reignited suspicions about the circumstances of White's death. White's family and attorneys had previously disputed the Louisiana State Police's claims, and they are now calling for a separate investigation into the matter. They argue that the inconsistencies in the official story raise serious questions about what really happened to White and whether he was the victim of police brutality. "Victor's family and friends have been waiting for justice for seven long years, and the latest revelations only add to their confusion and frustration," said Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney representing White's family. The case is reminiscent of similar incidents in which Black people have died in police custody or during encounters with law enforcement officials. These incidents have sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform in recent years. The demand for accountability in the case of Victor White is yet another reminder of the urgent need for greater transparency and oversight in law enforcement, particularly when it comes to the treatment of Black people and people of color.
