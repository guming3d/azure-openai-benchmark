The Olympics and Paralympics may be over, but the insect world is stepping into the breach with some incredible displays of synchronised gymnastics. The clever caterpillars were snapped showing off their moves in front of the watchful eye of amateur photographer Aleksandr Chorny near the River Teterev, Ukraine. He captured the six-strong party of acrobatic caterpillars who seemed delighted with the opportunity to show off their balancing acts whilst carefully clinging on to the side of a leaf. The caterpillars were captured in a series of perfectly executed synchonised moves by a Ukranian photographer . The Ermine moth caterpillar, native . to British-like climates, measure in at just 1.5cm. They tend to move in large groups. They are known to coat large areas with thick silk webs up to 20 feet long. The Ukranian photographer has only been working behind the camera for the past three years and has now turned his hand to specializing in macro -photography. He was taken by surprise by the creative performance when he was out walking along the river. As the sun goes down they often come to life and start nibbling their way through leaves and plants but these ones seemed more interested in trying out their dance routines than getting their daily meal. Green-fingered gardeners are likely to find ermine caterpillars like these a bit of a pest as they're famed for creating whopping silk webs up to 20 foot long. Whilst the webs may look like beautiful works of nature, they're capable of destroying gardeners' hard- grown plants which become cocooned under the webs to be used later for the caterpillar's lunch.Aleksandr, 28, a full-time artist, caught the creepy crawlies on an Olympus E-3 camera over an hour- long period. These congo-ing caterpillars have been caught taking to the stage to display their well- rehearsed version of the famous Conga party dance near the River Teterev in Northern Ukraine . He said: 'I was totally amazed by how peculiar their behavior was because I'd never seen anything like this before. 'When I tried to blow on them, their tails kept getting higher and higher until they were almost standing up vertically. 'It was as if they were reacting to the movement of air. 'I loved seeing the different ways that their bodies could move and watching them felt like I was at a circus show. 'This type of macro photography is my favourite because it gives people the ability to see the hidden world and the beautiful things that can't normally be seen by the naked eye.' The incredible insects also appear to be doing handstands in one of the shots .

chatgpt: In a stunning display of synchronized movement, a group of ermine moths in Ukraine recently captured the attention of onlookers with their impressive gymnastic skills. The moths, typically known for their ability to create chaos with their large webs that can cover whole trees and even cars, were seen performing a range of movements in perfect unison. The spectacle was captured on camera by local wildlife enthusiasts who had been observing the moths in their natural habitat. It was a rare sight, as ermine moths are typically solitary creatures and are not known for their ability to perform coordinated movements. As the video footage shows, the moths were seen flapping their wings in perfect synchronization, creating a beautiful ripple effect across the sky. They flew in formation, creating various patterns and shapes that left onlookers mesmerized. According to experts, the behavior of these moths is likely a result of their natural instincts to avoid predators. The synchronized movement serves as a way to confuse and deter potential predators, making it difficult for them to capture any one individual. Ermine moths are known for their ability to create large webs that can cover whole areas of vegetation. These webs can cause significant damage to plants and shrubs, and even obstruct roadways and vehicles. The moths are also notorious for their appetite, often consuming large quantities of leaves and plant material in a short period of time. Despite their destructive tendencies, the recent display of coordinated movement by the ermine moths has given observers a new appreciation for their beauty and complexity. Many have been left in awe of the moths' ability to work together to create something so stunning. While the phenomenon is rare, it is not entirely unheard of. Similar displays of synchronized movement have been observed in other species of insects, such as locusts and fireflies. These behaviors are often a result of natural selection and evolution, as animals find ways to adapt and survive in a challenging environment. For now, the ermine moths in Ukraine continue to perform their stunning displays of synchronized movement, much to the delight of those who happen to witness it. While their webs may continue to cause chaos, their ability to work together in perfect unison serves as a reminder of the complexity and beauty of the natural world.
