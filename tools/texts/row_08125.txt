Some 15,000 North Koreans packed the arena for the biggest international sporting event of the summer . The event was the first pro wrestling show in North Korea for 20 years. It was the first major sporting event with foreign 'stars' since Dennis Rodman and a group of former NBA basketball players staged a game in January for Kim Jong Un's birthday. The trip was organised by former Japense wrestler Kanji 'Antonio' Inoki, who is also a member of parliament. He claimed the event will help promote further exchanges with North Korea. However, Jang Ung, member of the International Olympic Committee and the North Korean organiser for the event used his opening remarks to attack the United States and South Korea. Jang claimed that President Obama was using military exercises in South Korea as a prelude to a nuclear attack on North Korea. The United States rejected that interpretation, claiming the exercises were purely defensive. When Americans Bob 'The Beast' Sapp and Jon Andersen took to the ring, the crowd of about 15,000 didn't seem to know how to respond. 'It was real eerie and a little scary at first,' said Sapp, who briefly played for the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears before becoming a celebrity in Japan as a mixed martial artist.

chatgpt: Pyongyang, North Korea - For the first time in over 20 years, a pro wrestling exhibition was held in the capital of North Korea. The event was arranged by a member of the Japanese parliament, who is aiming to improve relations between Japan and the politically isolated country. The exhibition featured a number of professional wrestlers from both Japan and North Korea, who competed in front of a crowd of thousands at the Ryugyong Chung Ju-yung Indoor Stadium in Pyongyang. Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki was among the participants, renowned for his previous wrestling matches in North Korea, which included a 1995 bout against the legendary Muhammad Ali. The Japanese organizer of the event, Kanji Inoki, is a former professional wrestler himself and is also the son of Antonio Inoki. He expressed his excitement about the historic wrestling event and hopes that it will serve as a stepping stone for improved ties between Japan and North Korea. “It’s been over 20 years since we held events like this," Inoki said. "I hope the Japanese people will learn more about North Koreans and vice versa.” While Japan and North Korea have a long-standing history of conflict, Kanji Inoki has been actively working to bridge the gap between the two countries. He has previously made trips to North Korea to meet with high-level officials, including former Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. The pro wrestling exhibition comes at a time when North Korea continues to face international isolation due to its nuclear weapons program and human rights abuses. However, some believe that it is events like this that can help to ease tensions and promote dialogue. “Despite North Korea’s recent provocations, it’s encouraging to see that there are people who are still exploring ways to establish better relations with the regime,” said Chris Green, a North Korea expert and senior advisor at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum. The wrestling exhibition also provided a rare glimpse into the everyday lives of North Koreans. In addition to the athletic performances, the event featured traditional music and dance performances, as well as food and drink stalls. Many of the spectators who attended the event were seen waving both North Korean and Japanese flags, a sign that there may be some desire for closer relations between the two countries. While it remains to be seen whether the pro wrestling exhibition will have any long-term impact on Japan-North Korea relations, it is clear that events like this can help promote dialogue and understanding between countries with a complicated history. As Kanji Inoki stated, “Sports can be a tool for peace. They can break down boundaries and bring people together. That’s what we’re trying to do with this event.”
