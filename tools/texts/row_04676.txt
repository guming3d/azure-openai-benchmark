About 160 guests, including other royals and political leaders such as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, also attended. Earlier on Wednesday, the princess attended a welcoming ceremony for the king hosted by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko.

In a sign of her recovery, the royals last year attended the king's inauguration in the Netherlands, where they have close ties. Akihito, in his banquet-opening speech, touched on Japan's aggression during World War II in the Dutch-occupied Indonesia, where many soldiers and civilians from the Netherlands were taken prisoners. 'It was most unfortunate that these long friendly relations between Japan and the Netherlands should have been marred because of World War II,' Akihito said. 'While never forgetting this past, we hope to give more attention than ever to the promotion of good will between our two countries.' Willem-Alexander said the Dutch people's ordeal should not be forgotten, but understanding of each other's pains is the foundation of reconciliation.

chatgpt: Princess Masako of Japan made a rare public appearance on Tuesday, attending an Imperial Palace banquet marking the emperor's enthronement. This was the first time in more than a decade that she attended such an event. The princess has kept a low profile since developing a stress-related illness soon after the birth of her daughter, Princess Aiko, in 2001. The banquet was attended by a variety of guests, including politicians, businesspeople, and foreign dignitaries. Princess Masako arrived at the event dressed in traditional Japanese attire, a kimono and outer robe emblazoned with the imperial chrysanthemum crest. Princess Masako's last appearance at an Imperial Palace banquet was in October 2003, when she attended a state banquet held in honor of the Mexican president. Following that event, the princess withdrew from official duties and has lived largely as a recluse ever since. Princess Masako's absence from public life has sparked speculation about her health and well-being. Some have suggested that the pressure of royal duties, coupled with the conservative and patriarchal nature of the Japanese court, took a toll on her mental and emotional health. The princess has reportedly been receiving treatment for depression and anxiety for many years, and her condition is said to have improved somewhat in recent years. However, she has remained largely out of the public eye, only appearing at a handful of official events each year. The news of Princess Masako's attendance at the Imperial Palace banquet has been welcomed by many in Japan, who see it as a positive step toward her re-engagement with public life. Some have also expressed hope that the princess's example might encourage greater openness and transparency in the notoriously secretive world of Japanese royal circles. Despite her long absence from official duties, Princess Masako remains a popular figure in Japan. She is widely admired for her intelligence, grace, and elegance, as well as her commitment to charitable causes. Speaking to reporters after the banquet, Princess Masako said that she was "honored" to attend the event and expressed her gratitude to those who had supported her during her difficult times. She also hinted that she might be considering a greater role in public life in the future, saying that she hoped to "find a way to contribute to society in my own way." For now, it remains unclear what the future holds for Princess Masako. However, her attendance at the Imperial Palace banquet is being seen as a positive step toward her reengagement with public life and an encouraging sign for those who have long admired her strength and resilience.
