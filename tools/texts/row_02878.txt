article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- Offensive remarks about China made by Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer have struck a chord on Chinese social media -- with some users actually seeing them in a positive light. The outspoken leader of the Palmer United Party went on a tirade on Monday night during a televised interview on Australian television channel ABC. When asked about his legal battle with Chinese firm CITIC Pacific Ltd, Palmer defended his position before launching into a verbal attack on China, calling the Chinese people "bastards" and "mongrels" who "shoot their own people." "I'm saying that because they're Communist, because they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country [Australia]," said Palmer. On Tuesday, Palmer clarified that his statements were meant for the Chinese state-owned company that he is locked in a dispute with, and not for the Chinese community or the Chinese government. 'Vicious attack' Palmer's words sparked outrage among Chinese and Australian citizens and officials -- though they did find support on Weibo, the Chinese micro-blogging platform. "Please separate the Chinese people from the Chinese government. Smart people will know what he is really talking about," wrote one Weibo user. "If those who kill their own citizens aren't bastards, then what are they?" "He [Palmer] was clearly referring to 'Communist,' not to China as a whole, and not about Chinese people. Global Times please do not take things out of context," wrote another microblogger, referring to an opinion piece published in the state-controlled English-language news outlet, Global Times. The article described Palmer's rant as a "vicious attack by one of the Australian elite" and said that he had called "a whole country 'bastard.'" It also called for sanctions to be imposed on Palmer's companies. Meanwhile, official voices continued to condemn the Australian businessman. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called Palmer's outburst "over the top, shrill and wrong" during an interview with an Australian radio station. He said the Chinese economic boom helped Australia get through the global financial crisis. "Palmer's words about China in recent days are totally irrational and absurd," Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement released on Wednesday.

chatgpt: Australian mining magnate and politician, Clive Palmer, came under intense criticism for his offensive comments against China during a television interview on Australian news channel, Sky News. In the interview, Palmer launched into a tirade against the Chinese government, labeling them "mongrels" and "bastards" who "shoot their own people".  The controversial remarks by Palmer, who is known for his divisive politics, have been widely condemned in both Australia and China. In China, many took to social media platforms such as Weibo to express their outrage at the remarks, while some also expressed support for Palmer's comments, believing them to be directed at the Chinese government rather than the Chinese people. Palmer's comments are particularly concerning given the close economic ties between Australia and China, with China being Australia's largest trading partner. There are fears that his comments could damage the already strained relationship between the two countries, which has been strained in recent years due to geopolitical tensions. The Chinese government has not yet issued an official response to Palmer's comments, but there are indications that they are taking a dim view of the remarks. The Chinese embassy in Canberra issued a statement criticizing the comments, stating that "such remarks are not helpful for mutual trust and cooperation between China and Australia." In Australia, there has been a flood of condemnation from politicians, business leaders, and members of the public. Prime Minister Scott Morrison condemned the remarks as "appalling and offensive", while opposition leader Anthony Albanese called for Palmer to apologize for the comments.  Palmer has since attempted to clarify his comments, stating that he was referring specifically to the Chinese government, and not the Chinese people. However, this has done little to quell the backlash, with many still calling for him to apologize for the offensive language used. The incident has brought to the fore once again the delicate balancing act required to maintain a positive relationship between Australia and China, with political and business leaders warning that such divisive rhetoric can have serious consequences for trade and diplomatic relations. In conclusion, the comments made by Clive Palmer have been met with widespread condemnation in both Australia and China, highlighting the importance of maintaining positive relationships between nations, particularly in the current global climate. It remains to be seen whether there will be any lasting repercussions from his offensive remarks.
