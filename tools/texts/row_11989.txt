chatgpt: Jameis Winston, the football quarterback for the New Orleans Saints, has been accused of assaulting a victim in a December incident at an apartment. However, Winston has not yet been questioned by the police, and he believed the matter had been resolved. According to the victim's lawyer, the incident involved an Uber driver who accused Winston of grabbing her crotch while they were waiting in the drive-thru of a restaurant. The incident allegedly occurred on December 13th, 2019, but was not reported to the authorities until over two weeks later. The victim's lawyer stated that his client informed Uber of the alleged assault immediately after it occurred, and the ride-hailing company contacted local law enforcement. However, despite this, the police reportedly have not yet questioned Winston about the incident. Winston's representatives have denied the allegations, stating that the quarterback was in the backseat of the car during the alleged incident and did not have physical contact with the driver. The representatives also stated that Winston believed the matter had been resolved since the driver did not report the incident to the authorities until over two weeks later. Despite this, the victim's lawyer has called for the NFL to investigate the incident and discipline Winston if he is found to be guilty. The lawyer stated that his client deserves justice and that the NFL needs to take these allegations seriously. Winston's past behavior has been called into question before. In 2018, Winston served a three-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy after he was accused of groping a female Uber driver in Arizona in 2016. The NFL has yet to comment on the recent allegations against Winston, and it is unclear if they plan to investigate the matter further. However, given Winston's past behavior, it is likely that any new allegations will be taken very seriously. It is important to note that individuals accused of crimes are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. However, these allegations against Winston are concerning and should be thoroughly investigated to ensure justice is served for all parties involved.
