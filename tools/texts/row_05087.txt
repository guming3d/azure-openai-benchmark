article: Bernard Hopkins insists he belongs in a class of his own as he attempts to defy the doubters once again two months shy of his 50th birthday. Hopkins, incredibly, remains a top contender as he approaches his half-century, breaking several records along the way, and his storied career continues at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City on Saturday night. He puts his WBA and IBF light-heavyweight titles on the line against WBO champion Sergey Kovalev in a unification clash and victory would see him once again be heralded as one of the finest boxers walking the planet. Bernard Hopkins believes he is creating a new legacy in boxing ahead of his 50th birthday .

Yet the Philadelphia fighter has no interest in being placed in the mythical pound-for-pound rankings, believing his accomplishments outstrip anyone else's. Hopkins, who has given himself the moniker 'The Alien' for the longevity of his career, said: 'I don't want to be on anybody's pound-for-pound list when I win this fight because to put me on a pound-for-pound list says that I'm human. 'To me you have to make a new list and what I'm doing now I'm making a new legacy and a new list. 'Fifteen years ago my career was meant to have been over.' Hopkins will once again assume the underdog role against the unbeaten, hard-hitting Kovalev, who has stopped 23 of his 26 opponents, one of whom, Roman Simakov, lapsed into a coma and died three days later after being beaten by the Russian in December 2011. Kovalev (centre) is unbeaten in his 26 fights - having stopped 23 of his opponents . Yet the former undisputed middleweight champion has made a career of confounding the critics, having done so against Felix Trinidad, Kelly Pavlik and Jean Pascal, among others, in recent years. And Hopkins (55-6-2, 32KOs) added: 'The Alien' likes to walk on his tightrope 50 feet in the air, maybe 100, with no safety net but I'm going to make it across the other side. 'An opponent, he can be fast, slick or a puncher; you have to face all of these intangibles that I bring to the ring. 'I don't mind putting my wits up against anyone's wits today. I'm so calm and relaxed. I still have that hunger to prove myself.' Hopkins (left) boasts a career record of 55 wins - via 32 knock-outs, six draws and two defeats .
