Almost half of Britain’s new breed of ‘local’ Post Offices are frustrating customers by refusing to accept parcels that weigh more than 6kg. Their controversial ban breaks the Government’s gold-plated rules – known as the ‘universal service obligation’ – which say Post Offices must deliver parcels of 20kg to 30kg. It means many customers are forced to travel for miles to find a larger branch – a particular problem for the elderly, or small businessmen who sell goods on eBay and rely on their local service. The local Post Offices are mostly based in newsagents such as the one pictured . The new ‘Post Office Local’ branches are mostly based in newsagents and corner shops. They offer the most common services, such as posting a letter, paying a bill or picking up a pension, and boast longer opening hours. Around 2,000 of the country’s crumbling network of 11,500 Post Offices are being turned into ‘Locals’ over the next four years. But a snapshot shopping exercise by Consumer Focus found one in two operators refused to accept large packages. The report, given exclusively to the Daily Mail, revealed many customers were given poor excuses, including ‘the weighing scales in the branch not being large enough’. The report added: ‘Others said they could only accept the parcel if “it was able to fit into the postman’s sack”.’ One customer was told ‘no, take it off’ when they placed a parcel on the scale – because they could have damaged it. Short-term: When 'Locals' were introduced, bosses imposed a weight limit of 6kg on packages, but that was only temporary . When ‘Locals’ were introduced, bosses imposed a weight limit of 6kg on packages, but that was only temporary. The Department for Business, which has responsibility for the Royal Mail, insisted yesterday the weight limit for packages has been ‘up to 30kg’ at Post Office Locals since January. But the shopping exercise, conducted at 100 Post Office Locals, found 48 per cent of packages weighing more than 6kg – including a parcel of books at 6.5kg and a 7kg saxophone – could not be posted. Ministers hope Post Office Locals – of which there are currently 134 – represent a new future for the troubled network.

chatgpt: Some UK Post Office branches based in corner shops are breaking government rules by refusing to deliver parcels weighing between 20kg and 30kg. According to official guidelines, Post Office branches should be able to handle parcels of this weight up to a certain size limit. However, recent reports suggest that some branches are not providing this service, causing inconvenience for customers and concern among officials. This issue came to light after a number of customers reported being turned away when attempting to send parcels through their local Post Office branch. Some were told that the branch did not have the capacity to handle parcels of this weight, while others were simply refused service without explanation. Post Office officials have expressed their concern over the situation, stating that it is important for all branches to adhere to government guidelines. Failure to do so could put the Post Office's reputation at risk and cause frustration for customers. In response to these reports, the Post Office has issued a statement saying that it is taking action to ensure that all branches are following the rules regarding parcel weights. This includes providing extra training for staff and carrying out checks to ensure that standards are being met. The branch-based Post Office model has become increasingly popular in recent years, as many small businesses have found it difficult to compete with larger retailers. However, this latest issue highlights the challenges of running a successful branch and the importance of providing a high-quality service to customers. Despite the challenges, many corner shops and independent retailers continue to value the Post Office as an important part of their business model. For many, the Post Office provides a vital service to their community, offering a range of services beyond parcel delivery, including banking and bill payment. Overall, the recent reports of Post Office branches breaking government rules are cause for concern. It is important for all branches to follow the guidelines set out by the government to ensure that customers receive a reliable and efficient service. As the UK's largest retail network, the Post Office has an important role to play in supporting small businesses and communities across the country.
