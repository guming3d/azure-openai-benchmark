The terrifying moment a family car crashes into a lorry at 50mph - and is shunted along the carriageway for 100 yards has been caught on a dashboard camera . The Honda Civic was filmed as it attempted to pull onto the M25 between two lorries . The rear of car is clipped by the front wing of the lorry - causing it to flip sideways and parallel to the front grille . But thanks to the quick-thinking actions of the lorry driver, the Honda is safely brought to a standstill on the hard shoulder. No one was seriously injured in the collision, with news of the crash only emerging after the driver of the Civic filed a whiplash claim. He was blaming the lorry driver for the incident- but the trucker had a SmartWitness camera fitted to his dashboard which filmed the whole incident. The video proved the Honda driver was responsible and his claim against the HGV driver's insurance was thrown out. The lorry driver manages to keep the car safely attached to the front of his vehicle, and away from the centre lane and other traffic . No one was seriously injured in the collision, with news of the crash only emerging after the driver of the Civic filed a whiplash claim . The car is then shunted at least 100 yards down the motorway as the lorry driver tries to keep control of the car . It was one of 550,000 whiplash claims filed last year, with insurance experts estimating around 60 per cent are bogus. The £1 billion-a-year fraud has led to the UK becoming the whiplash capital of the world. There has been a 60 per cent rise in the number of personal injury claims since 2006, according to the AA. This is despite reported accidents on UK roads falling by 20 per cent during the same period. SmartWitness systems, which makes on-board cameras, says it has saved insurance companies £20 million by providing evidence against whiplash and personal injury claims. Sales of the firm's cameras have soared by 40 per cent in two years as motorists protect themselves against the dangers of fraudsters. Simon Marsh, managing director of SmartWitness, said: 'The camera never lies. Increasing numbers of motorists are using CCTV cameras to protect themselves against fraudulent injury claims.'

chatgpt: In a dramatic incident on the M25 near London, a Honda Civic was caught on camera attempting to pull onto the busy freeway between two large lorries. Unfortunately, the driver of the Civic badly miscalculated the gap between the two vehicles, leading to a collision that sent the car tumbling onto its side.  Fortunately, quick thinking and skilled reactions from one of the lorry drivers involved prevented a potentially deadly crash. As the Civic's rear was clipped by the front wing of one of the lorries, the vehicle flipped sideways and began to skid out of control. However, the lorry driver in question was able to react quickly, using their vehicle to gently push the upside-down car back onto its wheels and onto the hard shoulder of the motorway. Eyewitnesses to the incident expressed their amazement at the skill and composure of the lorry driver involved. "It was like something out of an action movie," said one onlooker. "I can't believe how calm the lorry driver remained throughout the whole thing. They must have nerves of steel to pull off a manoeuvre like that." Despite the potentially catastrophic nature of the incident, no one involved in the crash suffered any serious injuries. The driver of the Honda was understandably shaken up by the incident but was able to exit their vehicle under their own power. Emergency services were quickly on the scene to assess the situation and ensure the safety of all those involved. The incident caused significant delays on the M25, with motorists caught in the resulting traffic jam expressing their frustration at the disruption to their journey. However, many also expressed relief that no one had been seriously hurt in the crash. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of being vigilant and alert when driving on busy roads, particularly when attempting to merge or change lanes between large vehicles. Despite the best efforts of others on the road, accidents can and do happen, and it is always important to take as many precautions as possible to ensure one's own safety and that of others on the road. Officials are urging drivers to take extra care and pay special attention when driving on motorways, particularly during peak hours, in order to avoid similar incidents in the future. It is hoped that a combination of increased awareness and careful driving habits can help to reduce the number of accidents on busy roads and improve overall traffic safety.
