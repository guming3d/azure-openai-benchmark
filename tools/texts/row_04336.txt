article: (CNN) -- The Egyptian cabinet is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss an agreement between political groups and the ruling military council on election policies, the status of the country's unpopular emergency law and other issues. Some activists said the agreement doesn't go far enough to meet the demands of the popular uprising that led to the end of country's longstanding regime, while other political groups said the agreement represented progress. The agreement, reached Saturday, includes promises to open more Egyptian parliament seats to political parties and consider canceling the country's emergency law. The agreement also includes a promise to consider abolishing military tribunals and to consider adopting a 1952 law that opposition groups hope would prevent former President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party from having a role in national politics for up to 10 years. Also included are plans to draft a document to guide the creation of a new constitution and a call for presidential elections following a national referendum on adopting the new ruling document. The coalition of parties had also sought an agreement to hold presidential elections immediately after parliamentary voting scheduled for November, as well as a promise to hand control to a civilian government next year. The deal failed to go far enough, said Mona Seif, a founding member of the No to Military Tribunals movement, who called the decision by a majority of party representatives little more than "treachery." "These parties were fooled if they think they accomplished something," said Seif, who called for renewed protests against the military council. The agreement comes amid rising dissatisfaction with the council, which took control in February after widespread popular demonstrations forced Mubarak to step aside. Following an attack on the Israeli embassy in Giza this month, the council reinstated the widely unpopular emergency law that many in the opposition felt was used by Mubarak to suppress dissent. Despite the concerns, the agreement is a "positive step toward true democracy," said Esam El Erian, the spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party and a leading figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. "Yes, abolishing the emergency law was a main demand of the January 25th revolution and the council promised to abolish it, but the reality on the ground is that there are many forces debating including former members of the regime that come in different faces." El Erian said. Military leaders plan more meetings with political parties to iron out more differences, said Major Alaa Iraqi, a spokesman for the Supreme Council. "Pleasing everyone is impossible," Iraqi said.

chatgpt: After months of negotiations, an agreement has been reached between Egypt's military council and various political parties. However, some critics argue that the agreement doesn't go far enough towards establishing true democracy in the country.  According to one critic, the agreement merely offers cosmetic changes and doesn't tackle the real issues that Egypt is facing. Despite this, a party official has described the agreement as a "positive step toward true democracy."  One of the key features of the agreement is that it opens up more seats in the Egyptian parliament to political parties. This move should help to redress the balance of power in the country and make democracy more inclusive.  In addition, the agreement includes a promise to consider dropping the controversial emergency law. This law has been in place since the 1980s and gives the authorities broad powers to detain citizens without charge. Dropping the law would be a significant step forward for democracy in Egypt.  However, not everyone is convinced by the agreement. Some critics argue that it doesn't go far enough in promoting true democratic values. They argue that the military council still holds too much power in the country and that more needs to be done to limit their influence.  Furthermore, some parties have refused to sign the agreement, citing concerns about the military council's role in the process. This has led to speculation that there could be further divisions within the country's political landscape in the coming months.  Despite these challenges, many people in Egypt see the agreement as a key to unlocking the country's potential. For years, Egypt has struggled to balance political stability with democratic values. The agreement represents a step towards finding a solution to this problem.  Ultimately, the success of the agreement will depend on how well it is implemented in practice. If the military council follows through on its promises and allows genuine democracy to flourish, then it could be a turning point for Egypt. However, if the agreement is merely a token gesture and doesn't lead to real change, then Egypt will continue to face the same issues that have plagued it for decades.  In conclusion, the agreement between Egypt's military council and political parties is a positive step towards democracy. However, it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to bring about lasting change in the country. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether Egypt can finally find a path to true democratic governance.
