Unbeknown to the England team, Romania spent nearly five months using a particular recipe to feed the fish in Lake Corbu where the competition took place, The Independent reported. Using boilies - a blend of flour, egg and flavouring - the dejected English team could only watch as the carp fell hook, line and sinker for the hosts bait, which they had eaten for weeks. Ian Huntington, team manager of the Korda England Carp Team, told The Independent that the secretive method was against the spirit of fair play, but conceded that it was not actually cheating as it did not break any rules. He said the team were deeply disappointed by the outcome of the competition. 'Hard lessons have been learnt and it . has been a very difficult experience to pick the team and ourselves up . after this event,' he told the newspaper. 'Within two hours of the match starting we were asking ourselves questions about the bait.' England were deeply disappointed when they learned that special bait was being used to lure all the carp and win the prizes . The carp were fed bait from boats tethered to the shore in Lake Corbu, months before the big championship . He said Romania would have a distinct advantage using bait that the fish had been previously fed with. Sadly for the competitive team, other countries had heard about the plot and cunningly bought a supply of local bait. They had learned of the plan when they practised on the lakes and had seen the bait tethered to boats, which had begun in May. Romania dominated the event and took the Team Gold and the Individual. Bulgaria were runners-up and Serbia clinched third place after both countries used the particular type of bait. The Angling Trust's international events manager Dick Clegg told The Independent that he would raise the issue at a meeting in November. The tournament's Romanian organisers were unavailable to comment.

chatgpt: England's Angling team has been left fuming after accusing Romanian hosts of acting "contrary to the spirit of fair play" during an international fishing competition held recently in the country. According to team officials, the hosts took advantage of their home advantage by feeding fish at the lake with a secret recipe. The England team, which had spent several weeks preparing for the competition, was left disappointed when they realized that the Romanian hosts had been making use of a secret recipe to lure fish into the area where they were to be caught. As a result, anglers from England and other visiting teams could only watch as the fish in the lake leaped eagerly for the host's bait while ignoring any bait offered by visiting anglers. According to a spokesperson for the England team, the use of secret recipe by the Romanian hosts was not only unsportsmanlike but also a violation of the competition rules. The spokesperson accused the hosts of acting in bad faith and called for an investigation into the matter. To make matters worse, two other teams - Siberia and Bulgaria - were also able to obtain the recipe used by the hosts, giving them an unfair advantage over other teams. Sources, however, point out that the recipe may not have been entirely secret, as it was reportedly handed down from generation to generation in Romania. Despite this, the England team remains convinced that the Romanian hosts acted unfairly and that they should be stripped of their victory in the competition. Team officials have called on the organizers to take action to ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future. For its part, the Romanian team has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that they acted within the rules of the competition. A spokesperson for the team argued that the use of the secret recipe was not prohibited by the rules of the competition and that all teams were free to make use of any bait that they felt would give them an advantage. The incident has once again raised questions about the use of home advantage in international sporting competitions. While it is not uncommon for host teams to enjoy certain advantages, such as familiarity with local conditions, the use of secret recipes or other tactics to gain an unfair advantage is widely regarded as a violation of the spirit of fair play. In the long run, the hope is that incidents like this will prompt organizers of international sporting events to take a closer look at the rules governing such competitions and ensure that they are fair and transparent. In the meantime, the England team can only look forward to future competitions, knowing that they will need to be more prepared than ever if they hope to come out on top.
