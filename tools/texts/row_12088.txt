American crack dealer has won the right to stay in Britain because he . relies on free NHS medical care and has a depressed girlfriend. Johnny . Callie was jailed for seven years in 2007 for conspiracy to supply . crack cocaine and heroin following a two-year covert operation by . Ipswich police. Callie . was part of a 10-strong gang that flooded the area with drugs from . their base in Colchester and was arrested following raids in August . 2005. In January, 2011 Home Secretary Theresa May refused to revoke an order for Callie's deportation after he appealed the automatic order made following his sentencing in November 2007. But the decorated Vietnam war veteran, who is suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure and 'degenerative changes to his right knee' has now argued he would not be able to afford medical care in the US. He also cited the ill health of his long-term girlfriend. The 64-year-old has been fighting his deportation through the courts since his release from prison in August 2010. He earlier halted the order on the grounds it breached his right to family life under Article 8 of the European Convention for Human Rights. Mrs May appealed that decision, but Judge Bernard Dawson ruled that Callie could stay. He heard that Callie had been living with his British citizen partner, referred to in documents as SN, since June 1995, and that she had 'no contact with other members of her family and has very few friends'. A decision . by Judge Dawson reads: 'Due to her depression and anxiety she is . usually dependent upon the claimant and cannot easily leave her home on her own or travel outside Ipswich unless he is with her. Judge Bernard Dawson said Callie's age and medical conditions would make it difficult for him to find work . 'She . would experience high level of anxiety were she to leave her home and . travel to America with the claimant. She has a history of attempted . suicide.' Judge Dawson's decision goes on to say the woman would be unable to stay in the US unless she married Callie, who has two sons who are both British citizens. He said . Callie's partner would not be entitled to Medicaid and it 'is unlikely . the couple could afford private health insurance'. The judge added: 'The claimant has not . lived in the United States since 1984, has no property there and in the . light of his age and his medical conditions it would be difficult for him to obtain employment.' A letter from Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust from February 2014 said Callie's compliance had been 'excellent' and that he didn't demonstrate any behaviour that would 'lead to further offending'. The letter said Callie had remained drug free since his release and had not relied on welfare benefits.

chatgpt: Johnny Callie, a 54-year-old man with high blood pressure, diabetes, and a bad knee, is facing multiple challenges. The conditions and his age would make finding work in the US difficult. Making matters worse, his girlfriend is too depressed to leave their home, let alone move to the US, casting a shadow over their future. Callie's health conditions make it tough for him to work like he used to. But, with his age and lack of opportunities, finding work has become almost impossible. "It's tough out there," Callie said, "I've applied to dozens of jobs, but nobody wants to hire me. They see my age and health problems and just pass me by." Although Callie has been living in the Caribbean, he has been considering moving to the US with his girlfriend. He believes there would be better opportunities for him to improve his health and wellbeing. However, his girlfriend's severe depression is preventing her from leaving their home. "It's a tough situation. I want to improve our lives, but I can't leave her here alone," Callie stated. Callie has been trying to find a solution to his problems, but he admits it's not easy. "I have to take care of her and myself, and it gets a little overwhelming sometimes." His health conditions make it challenging for him to find a job, but he remains optimistic. "I know things will get better. I just have to keep trying." The couple has been relying on social assistance to make ends meet, but Callie wants to be self-sufficient. "I never wanted to be on welfare. I've always worked hard for what I have. But sometimes, life throws us a curveball, and we have to do what we have to do." Despite his challenges, Callie hopes that things will turn around soon. "I have to stay positive. I don't want to give up on life just yet. I know there's still hope," he said. Callie's story sheds light on the struggles that many people face when trying to improve their lives. The lack of opportunities and health issues can be a hindrance to achieving one's dreams. However, it's essential to stay optimistic and keep pushing forward. It's not just about finding a job or moving to a new country. Mental health plays a significant role in achieving success. Callie's girlfriend's depression is a reminder of how mental health can affect our lives. It's essential to take care of our loved ones and ourselves, and seek professional help if needed. In conclusion, Johnny Callie's story may seem bleak, but it is also a story of hope. Undeterred by his health conditions and age, he continues to believe that things will get better. With resilience and a positive attitude, he serves as an inspiration to all who face similar challenges.
