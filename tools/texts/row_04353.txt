chatgpt: Liverpool have struggled to find their form this season, and it's no secret that the team have badly missed star striker Daniel Sturridge. The 25-year-old has been plagued by injuries, with his latest setback coming just last week when he suffered another thigh injury in training. This comes after a 10-week absence with a similar injury in the past. Sturridge has been instrumental in Liverpool's success over the past few seasons, scoring 60 goals in 102 appearances for the club. His speed and clinical finishing have been particularly missed this season as the Reds have struggled to find the back of the net. Liverpool currently find themselves 18 points off the leaders Chelsea in the Premier League, and it's clear that they need Sturridge back in action as soon as possible if they want to start closing that gap. However, the England international posted a philosophical message on Instagram on Monday, suggesting that he is not rushing his recovery and is instead focusing on getting back to full fitness before returning to the pitch. "Life's full of ups and downs. It's how you deal with them that counts. I've had a bit of bad luck recently but I'm still smiling and, more importantly, I'm still working hard to get back on the pitch as soon as I can. Thanks for all of your support and messages, they mean a lot. YNWA," Sturridge wrote. Liverpool fans will be buoyed by the news that Sturridge is hopeful of returning to action soon, but they will also be aware that they cannot rely on him alone to turn their season around. Manager Jurgen Klopp has already started the process of bolstering his squad in the January transfer window, bringing in Polish midfielder Piotr Zielinski and Serbian winger Marko Grujic, but he will need more if Liverpool are to challenge for trophies this season. Overall, Liverpool have badly missed the influence of Daniel Sturridge this season, but they must now look to other players to step up and fill the void. Sturridge's return will be a huge boost, but there is still a long way to go if Liverpool want to finish the season strongly and potentially challenge for silverware.
