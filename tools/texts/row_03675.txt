article: (CNN) -- Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI will attend the Mass of canonization of John Paul II and John XXIII, the Holy See confirmed Saturday, according to Vatican Radio. Benedict XVI, who will be attending at the invitation of Pope Francis, will not be at the altar, but will figure among the cardinals and bishops. It won't be the first time Benedict has made a public appearance since taking the almost unprecedented step of resigning the papacy. He was also present for a ceremony in February in which Francis created 19 new cardinals. Since a new pope usually takes the reins only following the death of his predecessor, seeing both him and Francis together remains a highly unusual event. The two canonization candidates share an improbable path to sainthood: they both rose from very humble beginnings to lead the Roman Catholic Church. John XXIII (1881-1963) -- known as Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli before he became Pope -- was one of 13 children born into a family of Italian peasants, farmers from a tiny village in the country's north, before being sent away to study for the priesthood at age 11. John Paul II (1920-2005), born Karol Jozef Wojtyla, was brought up in a grimy industrial town in Poland and raised by his soldier father after his mother died when he was just 8-years-old. He spent his formative years living under first Nazis, then Communists. His beatification is the quickest in modern times, made possible because Benedict -- who succeeded John Paul in 2005 -- waived the normal five-year waiting period after death to get someone's beatification rolling. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said as many as 150 cardinals and 1,000 bishops would attend the canonization ceremony, as well as 24 heads of state, Vatican Radio reported. The ceremony is also expected to draw upward of a million pilgrims, who will gather in St. Peter's Square to witness the two former popes enter the celestial community of Catholic saints. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, John L. Allen, Jr. and Daniel Burke contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is scheduled to attend the highly anticipated canonization of former Popes, John Paul II and John XXIII, according to the Vatican. This will mark the first time the former Pontiff will be present at a public event since he resigned from the Papacy last year. The ceremony is expected to attract a large number of distinguished guests, including up to 150 cardinals and 1,000 bishops from around the world. In addition, as many as one million pilgrims are expected to gather in St. Peter's Square to witness the historic event. The canonization of John Paul II and John XXIII has been highly anticipated, with both figures playing important roles in the Catholic Church. John Paul II was the Pontiff from 1978 until his death in 2005, and is considered one of the most influential figures in modern Catholicism. He was known for his travels around the world and his efforts to promote interfaith dialogue. John XXIII, on the other hand, was the Pope from 1958 until his death in 1963. Despite his short tenure, he is still remembered for convening the historic Second Vatican Council, which modernized many aspects of the Catholic Church and promoted greater interfaith dialogue. The canonization ceremony is expected to be a major event for the Catholic Church, with many viewing it as a celebration of the legacy of these two influential figures. It is also seen as an opportunity for Pope Francis to further promote his vision of a more open and inclusive Catholic Church. In addition to the canonization ceremony itself, there will also be a number of related events, including a Mass for pilgrims and a prayer vigil. As the date approaches, anticipation continues to grow among Catholic communities around the world, with many planning to travel to Rome to witness the historic event in person. Overall, the canonization of John Paul II and John XXIII is set to be a major moment in the history of the Catholic Church, with significant implications for the future of the faith. With so many important figures and so many pilgrims expected to attend, the event promises to be a truly unforgettable experience for all involved.
