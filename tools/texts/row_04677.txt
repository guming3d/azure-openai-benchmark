chatgpt: Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has been slapped with a fine of £20,000 by the club for his recent behavior. The shot-stopper was caught lighting up by manager Arsene Wenger, an incident which left the Frenchman irked. The incident has left Chelsea loanee Szczesny feeling the heat, with the youngster left apologetic for his actions. The 27-year-old was forced to offer a formal apology to the club for his unprofessional attitude. This is not the first time the Polish international has found himself in hot water over his behaviour. Last season, he was caught smoking in the dressing room showers after Arsenal’s humiliating 2-0 defeat to Southampton at St Mary’s. Szczesny has has been with Arsenal for over a decade, since joining from Lodz in Poland as a raw 16 year-old in 2006. He has made 132 appearances for the Gunners and has become a fan favourite due to his comic personality and likable nature. Wenger, on the other hand, has always been quite strict when it comes to behavior and professionalism. The arrival of goalkeeping coach Jens Lehmann had raised the bar when it comes to the expectations Arsenal have of their players. Furthermore, with Arsenal currently sitting sixth in the Premier League table, their season has been plagued with controversy and poor performances. The Londoners, who have won just six of their 13 fixtures this season, have been underperforming and it seems this incident with Szczesny is just another blow to their struggling campaign. Arsenal faces a tough couple of weeks ahead with back-to-back matches against Manchester United and a crucial Champions League clash against Paris Saint Germain. With the team already riddled with injuries, this could not have come at a worse time. Regardless of the result, the Gunners will be hoping that Szczesny, who once served as their first-choice shot-stopper, has learned from his past indiscretions and can continue to improve his professionalism in the future.
