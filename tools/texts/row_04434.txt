article: (CNN) -- A North Carolina woman who stirred national headlines when she accused three Duke University student-athletes of rape is now herself accused of murder, a county law enforcement official said Monday. Crystal Mangum, 32, was charged Monday with murder, five days after her boyfriend succumbed to stabbing-related injuries at a Durham, North Carolina, hospital, according to Candy Clark, a spokeswoman for the Durham County District Attorney's Office. She also is now facing two felony charges of larceny. Prosecutors reassessed the charges against Mangum after the death of Reginald Daye at Duke University Hospital on Wednesday. Police say she stabbed the 46-year-old man in the torso during an argument early on April 3 at the apartment the couple shared in Durham. Later that day, Mangum was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, police said. She was placed in the Durham County Jail without bond, where she remained Monday. Mangum's next court appearance on the murder charge has not been scheduled, but the district attorney's office said it will occur no earlier than May 2. In March 2006, Mangum claimed she was sexually assaulted by three players on the Duke lacrosse team -- annually one of the best collegiate squads in the nation -- while performing as a stripper at a team party. North Carolina's attorney general later found no credible evidence that the attacks occurred and the charges were dropped. The scandal, however, forced the cancellation of the men's lacrosse season that year and the resignation of team coach Mike Pressler. It also led to widespread criticism of then-Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong, who was eventually disbarred for his handling of the case. In February 2010, Mangum found herself on the other side of the law when she was charged with attempted murder after a fight with her then-boyfriend. She also was accused of arson, identity theft and resisting arrest, among other charges. CNN affiliate WTVD-TV reported that this arrest happened after she had set fire to a pile of the boyfriend's clothes while her children were at home. In a June 2010 interview with the station, Mangum said her boyfriend had attacked her, and she said that her involvement in the Duke lacrosse case had influenced police handling of the case. "I do feel that I am being unjustly treated because of preconceived notions about my character in the media," Mangum said then. In December, a jury found Mangum guilty of child abuse in the case but could not agree on a first-degree felony arson charge, which could have resulted in a seven-year sentence, WTVD reported.

chatgpt: Crystal Mangum, famously known for falsely accusing three Duke University athletes of rape in 2006, is now facing charges of murder and two counts of larceny in Durham, North Carolina. The district attorney's office confirmed the charges on Wednesday, stating that Mangum has been accused of stabbing her 46-year-old boyfriend at their shared apartment. According to police reports, the incident occurred earlier this month, with the man succumbing to his injuries last Wednesday at a hospital in Durham. Details about the circumstances leading to the stabbing or the motive behind the crime are yet to be revealed. Mangum became a household name in 2006 when she accused three members of the Duke University lacrosse team of sexually assaulting her during a party. However, the allegations were later found to be baseless, and all charges were dropped. The case became a significant controversy and sparked nationwide debates about race, class, and the criminal justice system. While Mangum's earlier accusations had caused a public furor, this time around, the news of her arrest has drawn mixed reactions from people. Some see it as a case of a woman with a history of making false accusations getting caught in her web of lies. Others have shown more compassion, stating that Mangum may have been a survivor of abuse and could have acted in self-defense. As Mangum faces the consequences of her actions, her arrest has opened up a broader conversation about domestic violence and the need for support and intervention for victims. Domestic violence affects millions of people worldwide, with women being disproportionately affected. Yet, this scourge of violence often goes unreported, with many victims still living in fear and suffering in silence. In conclusion, the charges against Crystal Mangum mark yet another chapter in a turbulent life. While she may have been famous for making false accusations in the past, this time, she is facing heinous charges that could potentially result in severe consequences. Hopefully, this case will serve as a wake-up call for the society at large, highlighting the need for better support systems for victims of abuse and the importance of speaking out against violence.
