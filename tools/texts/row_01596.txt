Jailbreak: Ropes hang down the side of the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center after Conley and Banks escaped . Conley, 38, is still on the run after he descended a 20 storey drop from a window of the Metropolitan Correctional Center last week with Joseph 'Jose' Banks, who was captured last Thursday by by agents and officers from the Chicago FBI Violent Crimes Task Force, and officers from the Chicago Police Department . Joseph Banks is known as the 'second-hand bandit' for wearing used clothes during his crimes. The 37 year-old was captured by officers without incident. The two men had been on the run for hours before the escape was reported. Banks was convicted the week before the escape of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two others. Authorities say he stole almost $600,000, and most of that still is missing. During trial, he had to be restrained because he threatened to walk out of the courtroom. He acted as his own attorney and verbally sparred with the prosecutor, at times arguing that U.S. law didn't apply to him because he was a sovereign citizen of a group that was above state and federal law. Conley pleaded guilty last October to robbing a Homewood Bank last year of nearly $4,000. Conley, who worked at the time at a suburban strip club, wore a coat and tie when he robbed the bank and had a gun stuffed in his waistband. CBS Chicago website .

chatgpt: Chicago police searching for a fugitive, Kenneth Conley, have shot and killed a pet dog at a house on South Forest Avenue, according to the dog's owner, Chanette Weaver. The incident occurred just minutes after Weaver let her dog, Colonel, out into the backyard. Weaver recalls hearing the disturbing sound of gunfire, and when she went outside, she was informed by police that her dog had been killed. She expressed shock and outrage, saying that the police did not give her any warning before shooting and that the dog was not aggressive. The Chicago Police Department has stated that the officers involved in the incident were acting in self-defence after Colonel had attacked them. However, Weaver disputes this, arguing that her dog was friendly and that police never gave Colonel a chance. Chicago police have been searching for Kenneth Conley since he escaped from a federal prison in December of 2012. Conley was serving time for bank robbery and had reportedly used bed sheets to scale a wall and escape from the facility. Since then, there have been several sightings of Conley, but he has remained at large. Police believed that he was hiding in the area and had received a tip-off that he was at Weaver's house. In response to the incident, a group of animal rights activists has organized a protest outside the Chicago Police Department headquarters. They are calling for a full investigation into the shooting and demanding that the officers involved be held accountable for their actions. The shooting of Colonel is just one of several incidents of police violence against pets and animals in recent years. Law enforcement agencies have come under scrutiny for using excessive force in situations where non-lethal methods could have been employed. In response to these concerns, some police departments have implemented special training programs to teach officers how to handle animals in a safe and humane way. Weaver is still reeling from the loss of her beloved pet and is calling for justice. She is demanding that the officers involved in the incident be held accountable and that police training be improved to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The incident has also sparked a broader debate about police violence and use of force. It raises questions about whether the police are adequately trained to handle situations involving pets and animals. For now, police continue their search for Conley, and Weaver continues to mourn the loss of her dog. The incident is a tragic reminder of the importance of ensuring that law enforcement officers are properly trained and equipped to handle a wide range of situations, including those involving pets and animals.
