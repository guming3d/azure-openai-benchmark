article: Harry Kane has to be in the England squad next month. He’s made the step at every level. England is the next natural stage of his development. To play in his first north London derby and score twice is extraordinary. When you’re looking at a youngster, you bring them into first-team training to see what they can do against your experienced players. And if he copes with that, you take the next step and put him on the pitch. Then you find out for real and the player finds out as well. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has shown he is capable of being in the spotlight by impressing against Arsenal . Tottenham academy graduate Kane roars in celebration after scoring his first derby goal . Kane races away to celebrate after he equalised in the second half at White Hart Lane . Kane has progressed bit by bit. He’s been able to reproduce in the first team everything he’s done in the youth team and Under 21s. Then the confidence comes and suddenly you have a player. I love the fact that for the first goal against Arsenal, the minute the ball came off the hand of David Ospina, he’s reacting. There was no tightness or freezing up. He knew exactly where he was going. He had scored in that split second. He was relaxed and put it away. He has a little bit of everything. He can play in the pocket and up top and his movement is very cute. For the second goal, if he hadn’t moved to the side of Laurent Koscielny, he wouldn’t get the chance to score that great header. The 21-year-old has previously impressed for England's Under 21 side . Christian Eriksen (left) and Mousa Dembele (right) have also been in impressive form  in recent weeks . It was a fantastic performance all round from Tottenham. Their intensity and tempo was superb throughout the 90 minutes. There are three players who have elevated them this season: one is Kane, another is Christian Eriksen but the third is Mousa Dembele. He’s one of the best in the country at going past a player. But if he does it in a deep position, he’s not the same threat as when he plays behind the striker. I feel he’s more suited to that position than Eriksen, because the formation they have at the moment allows Eriksen to drift in from wide positions. They’ve found a balance in those front players. I’d play Andros Townsend ahead of Erik Lamela, but the formula is working well at the moment. And the full backs, Kyle Walker and Danny Rose, are absolutely key. They have the energy to provide width and they release Eriksen and Lamela to come inside, which is crucial to the balance of the team. If they can keep those two fit and fresh, then Tottenham may be able to negotiate upcoming Europa League games and keep on track for the top four.

chatgpt: In a thrilling north London derby clash at the Emirates Stadium, Tottenham's star striker Harry Kane stole the show with a stunning brace, cementing his place in the club's history. The England international's goals took his tally to 22 for the season, and helped Spurs secure a vital 2-1 win over their fierce local rivals. The game got off to a tense start, with both teams eager to impose their dominance on proceedings. Arsenal, in front of their home fans, took the lead through a stunning goal from Mesut Ozil, who controlled a long pass from deep before unleashing an unstoppable volley into the bottom corner of the net. But Tottenham refused to lie down, and Kane was the man to drag them back into the contest. The first of his two strikes came in the 32nd minute, with the striker latching onto a precise through-ball from Christian Eriksen before calmly slotting the ball beyond the outstretched arm of Petr Cech. Then, just before half-time, Kane struck again, taking advantage of some slack defending from Arsenal to power home a header from close range. The Emirates Stadium fell silent as Tottenham's travelling fans erupted in celebration, with Kane's name ringing out around the ground. The second half saw Arsenal throw everything they had at their opponents in a bid to salvage a point, but Tottenham held firm to secure a crucial derby victory. The win moves Spurs up to second in the Premier League table, just three points behind leaders Chelsea and firmly in the title race. After the match, Kane spoke of his delight at scoring twice on his north London derby debut. "It's always special to score goals in big games like this, but to do it in a north London derby is even more special," he said. "I'm just delighted we got the win and could give our fans something to cheer about." The victory was a timely boost for Tottenham, who face a tough run of fixtures in the coming weeks. Mauricio Pochettino's side take on Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League before facing Chelsea in the FA Cup, and then have a run of tricky league games against Southampton, Burnley and Liverpool. The form of Kane will be key in the coming weeks, as he looks to add to his impressive goal tally and fire Spurs towards silverware. The striker has been in sensational form this season, and has already been linked with a big-money move away from the north London club. But for now, Kane is focused on England duty, as Roy Hodgson's side prepare for crucial games against Lithuania and Italy in March. The 22-year-old will be hoping to add to his impressive international record, which has seen him score five goals in just eight appearances for the Three Lions. Overall, Tottenham fans will be thrilled with Kane's impact in the north London derby, and hopeful that he can maintain his scoring form over the coming weeks. The race for the Premier League title is still wide open, and Spurs will be hoping to mount a serious challenge in the coming months.
