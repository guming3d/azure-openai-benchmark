article: E-cigarettes have been touted as a ‘safer’ alternative for smokers, but a new study indicates that this may not be the case. Sales of e-cigarettes have soared by 340 per cent in the past year as Britons turn to the electronic smoking devices in a bid to quit traditional cigarettes. Now, a study examining the biological effects of e-cigarettes found ‘strikingly similar’ gene mutations in lung cells exposed to e-cig vapour as those found in smokers. Risky puff: Scientists at Boston University, U.S. found 'strikingly similar' gene mutations in lung cells exposed to e-cig vapour as in those exposed to tobacco smoke . Scientists grew bronchial cells in mediums exposed to e-cig vapour and compared them to bronchial cells grown in a medium exposed to tobacco smoke. They found that the gene mutations in both sets of cells, although not identical, showed ‘striking similarities’. ‘[E-cigarettes] may be safer, but our preliminary studies suggest that they may not be benign,’ said study author Avrum Spira, a genomics and lung cancer researcher at Boston University. This means that although e-cigarette vapour is tobacco and tar-free and that the device does not require combustion, it could potentially increase a user’s risk of cancer. Mr Spria, who presented the study’s findings at the American Association of Cancer Research’s annual meeting this week, said he could not confirm or deny that e-cigarettes cause cancer, as the research is in its early stages. Further experiments are planned. Still unknown: The new research means e-cigarettes may be safer than normal tobacco cigarettes, but not as harmless as we first thought . E-cigarettes have soared in popularity in recent years as consumers look for ‘healthier’ ways to continue smoking, rather than use gum or patches to quit the habit. Figures released last month found that while sales of smoking quitting aids have slowed, the market for e-cigarettes is booming. Sales have increased by 340 per cent over the past year, from £44 million in 2012 to reach an estimated £193 million in 2013. The report says that while the smoking cessation market has seen strong growth historically, with annual increases of around 6-10 per cent between 2009-12, sales of products such as gum, tablets and patches have slowed. In 2013 the market for smoking cessation aids grew just 1.7 per cent to reach a value of £131 million.
highlights: Electronic cigarettes may not be as safe as first thought . Scientists grew bronchial cells exposed to vapour and tobacco smoke . Lung cells develop similar mutations when exposed to e-cig vapor . This means they might be 'safer' than cigarettes, but not harmless . Sales of e-cigarettes increased by 340 per cent in Britain alone last year .

chatgpt: Scientists have discovered that electronic cigarettes may be more harmful than initially thought. The study, conducted by researchers at the School of Medicine at the University of California, found that lung cells exposed to e-cigarette vapour developed similar mutations to those exposed to tobacco smoke. The researchers grew bronchial cells, which line the airways to the lungs, and exposed them to both tobacco smoke and e-cigarette vapour. They found that while the level of mutation was significantly lower in the e-cigarette group, the mutations that did occur were similar in nature to those caused by tobacco smoke. This means that while e-cigarettes may be “safer” than traditional cigarettes, they are by no means harmless. In fact, the researchers concluded that e-cigarettes pose a significant risk to both the respiratory system and overall health. This news comes at a time when the popularity of e-cigarettes is skyrocketing. Sales of e-cigarettes in Britain alone increased by 340 per cent last year, as more and more people attempt to quit smoking traditional cigarettes. E-cigarettes are often seen as a healthier alternative, as they do not contain the same toxic chemicals as traditional cigarettes. However, this new research highlights the fact that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free alternative. The fact that they still carry a risk to the respiratory system means that people looking to quit smoking should carefully consider their options before turning to e-cigarettes. Despite this news, it is important to note that e-cigarettes are still likely to be less harmful than traditional cigarettes. While quitting smoking altogether is the best option, for those who can't quit e-cigarettes may still be a safer alternative. It is also worth noting that this study may not represent the full picture of the risks associated with e-cigarettes. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term health implications of e-cigarette use. In the meantime, it is important for people to remain informed about the risks associated with e-cigarettes, and to carefully consider their options when it comes to quitting smoking. With so many options available, it is important to find a solution that works for you, while also minimizing the risks to your health.
