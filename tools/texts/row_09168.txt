article: Burger chain Shake Shack, which got its start as a hot dog cart in New York City, plans to raise up to $80 million from an initial public offering of its common stock. The company said Tuesday that it anticipates its IPO of 5 million shares pricing between $14 and $16 per share. Last month Shake Shack Inc. disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was hoping to raise up to $100 million from its IPO, but it didn't say how many shares it planned to offer or at what price, so the figure was subject to change.

Shake Shack said that it plans to give the underwriters the option to buy up to 750,000 additional shares of its stock. The origins of the restaurant date to 2001, when privately held Union Square Hospitality Group, a company owned by restaurateur Danny Meyer, opened a hot dog cart in Manhattan's Madison Square Park. Three years later a more permanent kiosk opened in the same park. It now has 63 locations in nine countries, according to a Tuesday regulatory filing. Shake Shack said that after the offering it will be a separate company from Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2013, Shake Shack had revenue of $84.5 million, up 45 percent from the year before. It posted a profit of $5.4 million in 2013, up 31 percent from 2012. Shake Shack cooks its burgers to order and promotes its use of natural ingredients, including hormone- and antibiotic-free beef. It's known for its long lines and its vibrating pagers that signal when an order is ready. The chain calls its restaurants 'shacks,' and uses the word to describe its menu items. The ShackBurger, for example, is topped with ShackSauce and a hot dog is named the Shack-cago Dog. Other fast-casual restaurant operators have fared well after their IPOs, including chicken chain El Pollo Loco Holdings Inc. and Mediterranean-style restaurant chain Zoe's Kitchen Inc. Shake Shack expects to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the 'SHAK' ticker symbol.

chatgpt: Shake Shack, the popular fast-food chain known for its burgers and fries, started as a humble hot dog cart in Madison Square Park in New York City in 2001. Since then, the company has gone on to open 63 locations in nine different countries, with plans for further expansion. In order to raise funds and fuel its growth, Shake Shack recently announced its plans to go public. The company intends to offer 5 million shares of its Class A common stock in an initial public offering (IPO), with an estimated price range of $14 to $16 per share. This would give the company a market value of around $675 million. Shake Shack's decision to go public follows in the footsteps of other successful fast-food chains such as Chipotle and Yum! Brands, which have also made the transition to the public market. The move is seen as a way to generate additional capital to fund further expansion and capitalize on the success of the brand. Founded by restaurateur Danny Meyer, Shake Shack has become a powerhouse in the fast-food industry, known for its focus on quality ingredients and sustainability. The company's menu features a range of burgers, including classic options such as the ShackBurger and the SmokeShack, as well as vegetarian and gluten-free options. In recent years, Shake Shack has also expanded its offerings to include chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, and frozen custard. The company has also embraced technology, developing an app that allows customers to order ahead and skip the line. Shake Shack's IPO has been met with enthusiasm from investors, with some predicting that the company's shares could soar in value following the offering. The company's strong brand and loyal customer base have helped to fuel its success, and analysts believe that Shake Shack will continue to thrive in the competitive fast-food market. However, some have expressed concern that Shake Shack's focus on quality ingredients could lead to higher prices and lower profit margins in the future. The company also faces pressure from larger fast-food chains, such as McDonald's and Burger King, which are constantly introducing new menu items and marketing campaigns in an effort to stay ahead of the curve. Despite these challenges, Shake Shack's leadership remains upbeat about the company's prospects. In a recent statement, CEO Randy Garutti expressed confidence in the brand's ability to continue to grow and innovate. "We believe that by remaining true to our core values and continuing to offer high-quality food and exceptional customer service, we can build on our success and create even more value for our shareholders in the years to come," he said. Overall, Shake Shack's IPO represents a significant milestone for the company and the fast-food industry as a whole. As the company prepares to go public, investors and customers alike will be watching closely to see how the brand evolves and whether it can continue to defy expectations and outpace its competitors in the years to come.
