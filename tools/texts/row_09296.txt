article: (CNN) -- German art collector Cornelius Gurlitt, whose nearly priceless collection was confiscated because it was suspected to contain pieces looted by the Nazis, died Tuesday and left the masterpieces to a Swiss museum. One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it "his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir." The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. Among the staggering haul found in Gurlitt's Munich, Bavaria, apartment in early 2012 were paintings by Pablo Picasso, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Oskar Kokoschka, Canaletto, Pierre-August Renoir, Franz Marc and Gustav Courbet. Gurlitt had said he never suspected that the collection he inherited from his father might include stolen artworks. Thousands of pieces of art condemned as "degenerate" by the Nazis were confiscated from galleries and private collectors in the 1930s and 1940s. Other works were stolen from Jewish families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country. Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, who was part Jewish, survived the war as one of only four "degenerate art" dealers permitted by Adolf Hitler.

chatgpt: Cornelius Gurlitt, the German art collector who gained notoriety for his massive art collection, has passed away at the age of 81. His death marks the end of a long and storied life that was filled with controversy and speculation about his vast collection. Over the years, Gurlitt had amassed a collection of over 1,500 paintings, drawings, and sculptures that were said to be worth nearly $1.3bn. The collection included works by some of the most famous artists in history, including Picasso, Matisse, and Renoir, but it was the provenance of these works that was causing concern. Authorities had been investigating whether some of the pieces in Gurlitt's collection had been looted by the Nazis during World War II. The investigation began in 2012 after Gurlitt was stopped on a train with a large amount of cash in his possession. He was subsequently searched, and authorities found several works of art in his possession. At the time, Gurlitt claimed that the works had been in his family's possession for decades and that he had nothing to do with any Nazi looting. However, the investigation continued, and the authorities eventually seized his entire collection in 2013. The investigation into the provenance of the works continued even after the collection was seized, with many works being returned to their rightful owners. However, it was clear that Gurlitt had a significant number of works that were still under investigation. Gurlitt's death has left many questions unanswered, including the ultimate fate of his collection. The Fine Arts Museum Bern, which was named as the sole heir to Gurlitt's collection, has stated that it had no prior connection to Gurlitt or his collection. The museum has also stated that it will only accept works from Gurlitt's collection that have a clear and undisputed provenance. It remains to be seen what will happen to the disputed works in the collection, and whether any legal action will be taken to determine their rightful owners. Despite the controversies surrounding his collection, Gurlitt was widely regarded as a passionate art collector who was deeply devoted to his collection. His death marks the end of an era, and it is clear that his legacy will be the subject of continued scrutiny and debate for many years to come.
