article: (CNN) -- Pete Cahall gripped a microphone with his left hand, a few pages of handwritten notes in his right. Both hands trembled nervously throughout the speech he struggled to deliver on Wednesday before the student body at Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C. Odd, since Cahall is the school's principal, and has spoken in front of these very same students countless times before. But he had never given a speech like this before. In fact, he had never spoken publicly about what he was going to say. "I am a proud gay man that just happens to be the principal of Wilson High School," he said to thunderous applause. The announcement came at the school's annual gay pride celebration. Mayor Vincent Gray and openly gay City Council member David Catania were in attendance. "I never made this declaration before because I did not want my kids to think differently of me or to not respect me," Cahall told the students. "I have been in the shadows, but I am liberated today." Later, the principal spoke of the moment. "What I kept thinking was, how can I be the principal of Wilson and oversee a pride day and tell kids to be themselves and be who you are and then not do that? It's hypocritical," Cahall told CNN affiliate WJLA. "That was so unexpected," senior Tao Marwell told WJLA. "I had no idea. I have so much more respect for him now." Gray, whom Cahall thanked in his speech for his "care, leadership and support," had some strong words for Westboro Baptist Church after the controversial congregation threatened to protest Woodrow Wilson for hosting a pride day. "In my best biblical reference, my words to the people of Westboro in Kansas is they can go straight to hell," said the mayor, according to WJLA. Cahall said that he was inspired to come out by openly gay professional athletes Jason Collins and Michael Sam. He also said that a recent birthday might have had something to do with it.

chatgpt: Washington, D.C. - A high school principal in the district proudly came out during a school's gay pride event. Pete Cahall, principal of Duke Ellington School of the Arts, shared his personal journey of self-discovery with his students and faculty, stating that he has finally found liberation. "On this day, I stand before you as a proud gay man," Cahall said during the school's annual Gay Straight Alliance and Diversity Day event. "I am liberated, and I hope that by sharing my story, I can help others find their own sense of freedom." Cahall's announcement was met with thunderous applause and a standing ovation from the students and faculty in the audience. He credited openly gay professional athletes as his inspiration for speaking out and being true to himself. "I am in awe of those individuals who have come out and stood up for who they are," Cahall said. "Their courage helped me find the strength to do the same." Students and faculty members alike praised Cahall for his bravery and leadership. A spokesperson for the school said that Cahall's announcement was a reflection of the school's commitment to inclusivity and acceptance. "Duke Ellington School of the Arts is a place where all students and faculty members should feel respected and valued," the spokesperson said. "We are proud of Principal Cahall for his honesty and his commitment to creating a safe and supportive environment for all." Cahall's announcement comes at a time when the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals are under threat in the U.S. The Trump administration has rolled back protections for transgender students and has sought to restrict LGBTQ+ rights in areas such as healthcare and housing. Despite these challenges, Cahall said that he sees hope for the future in the young people that he works with. "I am constantly inspired by the students at Duke Ellington School of the Arts," Cahall said. "They are intelligent, creative, and compassionate young people who are committed to making the world a better place. I have no doubt that they will continue to fight for equality and justice for all." Cahall ended his speech by encouraging his students to embrace their authentic selves and to support one another in their journeys. "Remember, you are never alone," Cahall said. "There is a community of people who love and support you for who you are. Together, we can create a world that is more just, more equal, and more accepting of all."
