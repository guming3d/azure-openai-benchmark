article: (CNN) -- Buycommonthings.com. It's hardly the catchiest of brand names and Olumide Olusanya knew it. Six months into running his online grocery business, the Nigerian entrepreneur was desperate to find a shorter, more memorable name -- but he'd run out of ideas. And then it him. Like so many others, his Eureka moment came inside that steamy cocoon of inspiration where dirt is cleaned and geniuses are born: the shower. "While I was in the shower one day," recalls Olusanya, "I just had an epiphany of sorts and then, 'yay, it will be Glue!'" he adds. "For the six months that we were in operation," explains Olusanya, "people were coming to site and then you see them coming back repeatedly -- so it looks like our service has a glue effect." To make it more appealing, Olusanya changed the word's two last letters and that's how Gloo.ng was born, Nigeria's leading online grocery store. A former doctor helping trauma patients in a Lagos hospital, Olusanya says he decided to go into business with his wife to try to cater to Nigeria's busy women with no time to shop at the supermarket. "I saw the stress; I saw the love and passion of trying to keep up a very happy home, a very happy family; traveling up and down and then (being) busy on a daily basis," says Olusanya. "And then you have a husband that is totally useless at cooking or taking care of the house, so all this pressure you see coming on," he adds. "This for me was a way of trying to relieve her of that stress -- my own expression of love." Since then, the company has grown to employ nine staff, operating from inside a 20,000 square feet warehouse. And although it's yet to make a profit, Olusanya hopes he can expand the brand as more and more Nigerians turn to online shopping.

With the aim of delivering groceries directly to their doorsteps, Olusanya is looking to turn Gloo into the country's leading supermarket. Nigeria, like many other countries around the world, has been experiencing a shift in consumer behavior due to the pandemic.

Gloo has been providing online grocery shopping services in Nigeria for some time now, but Olusanya is not content with simply being a player in the market. He wants Gloo to become the go-to destination for anyone looking to buy groceries online in Nigeria. He envisions a platform that is convenient, reliable, and most importantly, user-friendly. Speaking to reporters, Olusanya explained his vision for Gloo, saying, "We want to make grocery shopping more accessible and convenient for Nigerians, especially those who may not have the time or means to physically go to a store. By delivering groceries straight to their doorstep, we hope to make their lives easier and more seamless." Gloo currently operates in major cities across Nigeria, including Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. The online grocery store has a wide range of products, including fresh fruits and vegetables, meat and poultry, dairy products, baking ingredients, and other everyday essentials. Customers can place their orders online and have them delivered to their doorstep within a few hours. In addition to offering a wide range of products and fast, reliable delivery services, Olusanya believes that Gloo's success will also depend on building strong relationships with its customers. The company is focused on providing personalized services and creating a community around its brand. Olusanya's dream of turning Gloo into Nigeria's leading supermarket is one that he takes very seriously. He is constantly looking for ways to improve the platform and expand its reach. With the growing demand for online shopping services in Nigeria, there is no doubt that Gloo has a bright future ahead of it.
