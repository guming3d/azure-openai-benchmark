chatgpt: The Welsh Government has introduced new guidelines in a move to promote sensible eating habits among youngsters. The guidelines state that children will no longer be allowed an extra pudding due to the high sugar content that it contains. The move comes after reports showed that children, as young as 14, are receiving gastric bands on the NHS. The guidelines have been introduced in a bid to tackle the obesity crisis that is affecting the country, particularly among young people. According to recent figures, almost a quarter of children in Wales are overweight, and obesity-related illnesses are costing the NHS millions of pounds each year. The new guidelines apply to all schools and local authorities in Wales and have been welcomed by health experts, who believe that they will help to promote healthier eating habits among the younger generation. The guidelines state that puddings and desserts should be limited to one per day and that they should contain no more than 15% sugar. Dr. Dai Williams, Director of Public Health for Wales, said: "We know that obesity is a serious problem in Wales, and it's important that we take action to tackle it. These guidelines will encourage young people to make healthier choices when it comes to their diet, and we hope that they will help to reduce the number of young people who are struggling with obesity." The move to limit puddings and desserts comes after reports that children as young as 14 are receiving gastric bands on the NHS. Figures released by the Welsh Government show that in the past five years, over 200 young people have undergone weight-loss surgery, with almost half of those receiving gastric bands. Gastric bands are an extreme measure and are only offered to people who are severely overweight and have failed to lose weight through other means. The procedure involves placing a silicone band around the stomach, which helps to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten. The introduction of the new guidelines has been welcomed by anti-obesity campaigners, who believe that they will help to address the growing problem of childhood obesity. The British Heart Foundation has called for other countries to follow Wales' lead and introduce similar guidelines in schools. Ashley Dos Santos, a spokesperson for the British Heart Foundation, said: "These guidelines are a step in the right direction and will help to promote healthier eating habits among young people. We know that childhood obesity is a serious problem, and it's important that we take action to tackle it. We hope that other countries will follow Wales' lead and introduce similar guidelines in schools." The introduction of the new guidelines comes after a report by the British Medical Association called for a tax on sugary drinks, in a bid to reduce the amount of sugar that people consume. The report claimed that such a tax could help to reduce obesity rates and save the NHS millions of pounds. In conclusion, the Welsh Government has taken a major step towards promoting a healthier lifestyle and tackling the growing problem of childhood obesity by introducing new guidelines in all schools and local authorities in the country. The move has been welcomed by health experts and anti-obesity campaigners, who believe that it will help to promote sensible eating habits among young people and reduce the number of young people who are struggling with their weight.
