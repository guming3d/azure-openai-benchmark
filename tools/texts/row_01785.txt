Nearly: Graham DeLaet of Canada salutes the crowd after sinking a putt for a birdie on the eighth hole . Furyk, the 2006 and 2007 champion in this event, started from the 10th and after an opening par, kick-started his group's blistering scoring with four straight birdies. He gained further shots at the first, sixth and eighth in a blemish-free round. Home favourite DeLaet, who lies two shots off the lead in third, could not say the same after bogeying the 18th and fourth but recorded nine birdies in a superb round. The third member of the group, Matt Kuchar, was only two shots outside his playing partners' pace with a 65 to reach six under and a share of ninth place. Furyk told pgatour.com: 'I don't know if I've ever played in a group where we shot 63, 63, 65. I was giving 'Kuch' a bunch of crap for being the schlub in the group, shooting a 65.' DeLaet added: 'All of us were making so many birdies out there. You felt like you had to make putts just to keep up.' Kyle Stanley was alongside DeLaet on eight under, with Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell among the group at seven under after a bogey-free 65. He was joined by Americans Justin Hicks, Scott Brown and Andrew Svoboda. Dustin Johnson was a notable name to miss the cut, a second-round 68 not enough to make up for his opening 74, while Hunter Mahan toppled out of the tournament with a 75 featuring seven bogeys. Luke Donald and Trevor Immelman also failed to secure their places for the weekend. Playing partners: Furyk and DeLaet shake hands during the Canadian Open in Montreal .

chatgpt: Jim Furyk and Graham DeLaet both played a fantastic game of golf at Royal Montreal's course on Friday. Both players shot an impressive 63, seven under par, and proved themselves to be in fine form. Furyk's score puts him alongside Tim Petrovic on the leaderboard, with both players sitting pretty on 10 under par. The 2006 U.S. Open champion had a bogey-free round that included five birdies and an eagle. Meanwhile, DeLaet had six birdies and an eagle, but a solitary bogey on the 18th hole prevented him from sharing the top spot with Furyk and Petrovic. Despite narrowly missing out on shooting a 62, DeLaet was happy with his performance. "All of us were making so many birdies out there. You felt like you had to make putts just to keep up," he said. "It was a lot of fun out there." The Canadian golfer is currently ranked No. 108 in the world, but his performance at Royal Montreal has put him in contention for a top finish. The 39-year-old native of Weyburn, Saskatchewan, has never won a PGA Tour event, but a strong showing this weekend could change that. Furyk, on the other hand, is an experienced veteran of the sport. The 51-year-old American has 17 PGA Tour wins to his name, including that 2006 U.S. Open victory. Although he hasn't won a tournament since the 2015 RBC Heritage, Furyk has shown that he still has the skills to compete at the highest level. The Royal Montreal course is known for being challenging, with fast greens and tight fairways. However, Furyk and DeLaet both made it look easy on Friday, and other players will be looking to follow their example over the coming days of the tournament. There are still plenty of players within striking distance of the top of the leaderboard, including Brandt Jobe and Stephen Ames, who are both tied for third place on 9 under par. Further back, a group of players including Scott Parel, Wes Short Jr. and Miguel Angel Jimenez are tied for fifth place on 8 under par. As the weekend approaches, the competition is sure to heat up at Royal Montreal. With so many players in contention for the top spot, it promises to be an exciting few days of golf.
