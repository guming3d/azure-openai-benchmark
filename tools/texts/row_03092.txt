article: By . Talal Musa . PUBLISHED: . 11:46 EST, 9 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:30 EST, 9 May 2013 . XCOM: Enemy Unknown was one of the best turn-based-strategy games of recent times. It’s no surprise, then, that its universe is expanding. Although this XCOM spin-off has been in development since 2006, numerous facelifts have transformed what was once a first-person shooter into a third-person adventure. But thankfully, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified promises to retain the tactical element fans have come to expect from the series. Changed for the better: Although reaction was mixed when 2K Marin first unveiled the game, transforming it into a third-person shooter seems like a sensible move . Developed by 2K Marin, the team behind Bioshock 2, Declassified is set in 1962 at the height of the Cold War. Originally established as America’s covert defense against the Soviet Union, The Bureau must adapt and overcome a threat unlike anything the world has faced before. As special agent William Carter, players will call the shots and pull the trigger, leading their squad of agents in the high-stakes secret war for humanity’s survival. Paramount to repelling the outside threat is The Bureau’s ability to cover-up the enemy’s existence in order to prevent worldwide panic. Similar to the previous game, your decisions have a serious impact on the overall result. Every command can mean the difference between life and death for Carter, his squad and mankind. Carter can also use a unique Battle Focus ability – although exact details about how this works have not been revealed. It has also been reported that Declassifed is a single player experience, and will not feature any sort of multiplayer. ‘We’re thrilled about 2K Marin’s refined vision for The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,' said Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K. 'The game has evolved through a creative and iterative development process, and the result is a narrative-driven experience that is smart, engaging, and challenges players to think tactically.' Watch this space: There is still no word yet on whether Declassified will be coming to next-gen consoles . He added: ‘The team has been working hard to leverage core XCOM elements like tactical decision-making and permanent death of squad mates in a purposeful way that makes this a unique tactical shooter. ‘To that end, The Bureau will challenge players unlike any other third-person tactical shooter.’ It's set for release on August 20 in North America and August 23 internationally.

chatgpt: 2K Marin, the game studio behind Bioshock 2, has announced their newest game, which is a third-person shooter called "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified". The game has undergone dramatic changes during its development process and aims to offer players a tactical shooting experience with consequences for player decisions. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is set in 1962 during the height of the Cold War. Players take on the role of Agent William Carter, a special agent tasked with investigating and suppressing extraterrestrial threats in the United States. One of the biggest differences between The Bureau and previous XCOM games is the shift from the classic turn-based gameplay to real-time action. The game combines elements of squad-based combat and cover-based shooting with a range of weapons and abilities that players can utilize to complete their objectives. While gameplay has evolved, the focus on tactics and consequences for player decisions remains. Players will have to weigh their options carefully before choosing how to proceed. According to 2K Marin, the choices that players make will have meaningful consequences that shape the course of the story and affect the outcome of the game. Players will also be able to assemble a team of agents, each with their unique abilities, weapons and personalities. The game mechanics allow for a dynamic and adjustable squad that adapts to the player's playstyle. The game's graphics are stunning, with 2K Marin going for a retro-futuristic aesthetic that captures the essence of the Cold War era. The in-game environment features a mix of familiar locations such as small towns and government facilities, as well as alien landscapes and structures. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is set to launch on August 20th, 2013, for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. However, 2K Marin has not yet confirmed whether the game would be making its way to next-generation consoles. The game has already garnered a lot of attention from players and critics alike, with many citing the game's new direction as an exciting and refreshing take on the XCOM franchise. Overall, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified promises to be an immersive and exciting tactical shooter with a deep and complex storyline. Fans of the XCOM franchise are eager to see how the game will turn out and whether it will serve as a worthy successor to the original games.
