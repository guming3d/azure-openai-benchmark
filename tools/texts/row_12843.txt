chatgpt: Whitney Thompson, the plus-sized model who won the 10th cycle of the hit show America's Next Top Model (ANTM), has recently been named as the face of the new Sculptresse collection by lingerie brand Panache. The new collection features an extensive range of lingerie pieces that cater to the needs of women who wear larger cup sizes, starting from a D cup and going up to a J cup. Additionally, the range includes back sizes ranging from 36 to 46 to accommodate women of all sizes. The collection includes various lingerie pieces, including bras, briefs, and shorts, all of which are designed with both comfort and style in mind. The bras themselves have wide straps, fuller cups and strong underwires, making them the perfect choice for anyone seeking a combination of support, comfort and style. The new Sculptresse collection is priced at just £33 for a bra and £14.50 for briefs, making quality lingerie items that cater to full-figured women more affordable than ever before.

In a statement, Whitney expressed her excitement about the collaboration with Panache and the opportunity to inspire other full-figured women: "I am so proud to be the face of the new Sculptresse collection by Panache. This is a brand that truly understands the importance of inclusivity and is committed to providing high-quality lingerie for women of all sizes. As a plus-size model, I am passionate about helping other women feel confident and beautiful in their own skin, and I believe that this collection will do just that!"
