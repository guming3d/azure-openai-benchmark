article: A family in Los Angeles have told of their horror at returning home to find one of their dogs dead and another in a critical condition after being attacked by a swarm of killer bees. Justin and Heather Umphenours made the shocking discovery on Sunday at their house in Covina, finding their two German Shepherd-mixes collapsed in the backyard surrounded by hundreds of bees. One dog, Luna, died from her injuries, while her brother, Wolf, was rushed to Inland Valley Emergency Pet Clinic. 'They're members of the family - we've had them since they were four weeks old. They were abandoned,' Mr Umphenours told KTLA. Killed: German Shepherd-mix Luna died on Sunday after being stung hundreds of times by a swarm of bees . Fighting for life: Wolf survived the attack but is struggling to recover from hundreds of stings, most of them in his face and mouth . Swarm: Justin and Heather Umphenours said they returned to their Covina home to find hundreds of bees swarming their two dogs . Heartbroken: Justin and Heather Umphenours have called neighbors and local schools in an effort to prevent the same thing from happening to anyone else . 'To see something like that - to see your animals lying on the ground helpless - is just heartwrenching.' The wild honeybees in the San Gabriel Valley are known as killer bees. Hybrids of European and African strains, they aggressively protect their hives by attacking in swarms, the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District told The Los Angeles Daily News. However the Umphenours, who have four children, say they have never seen bees near their home in the seven years they have lived there. The family said they spent Saturday cutting down branches of lemon trees in their backyard. While they didn't see any hives, they worry the yard work somehow stirred up the bees. 'It's horrific enough that it happened to our animals,' Mrs Umphenours said. 'To know that it might happen to someone else's family - I just don't want that to happen.' Critical: Wolf, who remains at the Inland Valley Emergency Pet Clinic, was stung primarily on his face . Scene: The family spent Saturday trimming lemon trees in their yard, which may have spurred the bee attack . Best friends: The family had the dogs - both abandoned - since they were four-weeks-old . Wolf continues to fight for his life at the animal hospital. Several hundred stingers have already been removed from his tongue. The vet said the stings inside the dog's mouth came from him biting at the bees. He was mostly stung in his face. A friend of the Umphenours has set up a Go Fund Me account help raise money for Wolf’s vet bills, which were expected to exceed $6000.

chatgpt: A tragic attack occurred on Sunday at a home in Covina, Los Angeles, when Luna and Wolf, a pair of pit bulls, were stung by a swarm of wild honeybees. Luna sadly passed away from her injuries while her brother Wolf was rushed to Inland Valley Emergency Pet Clinic. The attack occurred in the San Gabriel Valley, an area known for its wild honeybees, commonly referred to as ‘killer bees’ due to their aggressive nature. Luna and Wolf’s owner was not aware of any beekeeping activities that may have disturbed the bees and triggered the attack. Killer bees are a particularly aggressive species of honeybees that can be found in warmer climates, typically in South and Central America. They have been known to attack people and animals in large numbers, causing fatal injuries in some cases. While most honeybees are relatively harmless, the killer bee’s venom is more toxic, and they tend to attack in large numbers when they feel threatened. The hive is often fiercely guarded by the bees, which will attack anything that comes too close. In recent years, incidents involving killer bee attacks have become increasingly common, particularly in California. Last year, a group of 15 people was attacked by a swarm of killer bees while hiking in the area, resulting in two fatalities. The attack on Luna and Wolf has prompted animal welfare advocates to call for greater awareness of the dangers of killer bee attacks and what pet owners can do to protect their animals from harm. Pet owners are advised to monitor their animals when they are outside, particularly in areas where honeybees are likely to be present. If a swarm of bees is detected, it is important to try to move away from them as quickly as possible before they become agitated. If a pet is stung by bees, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. In the case of Luna and Wolf, despite efforts by their owner and emergency responders, Luna sadly lost her life. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of understanding the risks involved when it comes to interacting with wildlife, particularly in areas where animals and humans coexist. The San Gabriel Valley, with its diverse wildlife and unique ecosystem, is a reminder of the fragile balance that exists between nature and urbanization.
