article: By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 6:18 PM on 28th December 2011 . YouTube's recent 'new look' changed the focus of the video-clip site from individual videos to 'channels' similar to ones on television. The site's transformation into a rival to TV services seems set to continue. The latest service from the video giant, YouTube Slam, is a weekly talent show where users vote on their favourite comedy, music and viral clips. YouTube bills it as a 'video discovery experiment' - it also has videogame-like elements, where users earn points for accurately predicting favourites. YouTube's Slam lets users vote for their favourite comedy, music and viral videos of the week - another TV-like element which will help YouTube compete with other TV providers . 'Have some free time this week? Think you can find the next singing sensation, viral video like Charlie bit my finger or Surprised Kitty?' said the official YouTube blog this week.'Each week a new crop of videos battles head-to-head in Comedy, Cute, Music, Bizarre and Dance Slams, where your votes determine who wins the Slam and gets featured on the leaderboard.'Earn points for predicting the crowd favorites, and see how you stack up against other players at the end of each week.' The move is another unusual shift for YouTube, which remained broadly the same for years until Google started offering 'channels' with professional content earlier this year, then rolled this into the site's 'new look'Â  in early December. The 'competition' is a new, unfamiliar element - more akin to the apps and games on Facebook. 'YouTube is in a process of reinvention at the moment - a rival site, Vevo, is basically taking all of the music videos away from them,' Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst at the Music Industry blog told the BBC.'YouTube desperately need to create a new relevancy for themselves and that's why with the recent site relaunch - making it look more like a rich interactive TV-like experience - and features like Slam are all about trying to give YouTube a unique place in the online video landscape.'

chatgpt: Video hosting platform, YouTube, has introduced a new feature to incentivize its users to vote more in favor of their favorite videos. Users, who participate in the voting process, will now earn points, which they can redeem for a chance to win prizes or cash. The new feature is part of YouTube's strategy to make its platform more "TV-like," in response to the growing competition from its new rival Vevo. According to industry analysts, the introduction of the voting feature is part of YouTube's efforts to make its site more engaging for users. The new feature is expected to increase user engagement on the platform, which could help to boost YouTube's overall revenue. The video hosting giant has faced stiff competition from Vevo, a music video platform that has gained a significant following among Millennials and Generation Z users. YouTube's new feature is part of a broader move to make its platform more appealing to young viewers, who are increasingly turning to social media sites and other video hosting platforms for their entertainment needs. According to recent surveys, YouTube's user base has been declining among younger age groups, who have been seeking alternative platforms that cater to their preferences. YouTube's move comes as Vevo is dominating the music video landscape, with its videos generating billions of views each day. The music video platform has been credited with introducing new artists to the mainstream, and with its extensive catalog of music videos, it has become the go-to destination for music fans worldwide. Industry analysts predict that the introduction of the new feature could provide YouTube with a much-needed boost, as it seeks to take on Vevo and other emerging rivals. YouTube's new feature will undoubtedly resonate with young viewers, who are always on the lookout for new ways to engage with their favorite online content. In conclusion, YouTube's new feature is set to make the site more engaging for users, helping it to remain competitive in the face of growing competition from Vevo. The inclusion of the new feature is also expected to help YouTube cater to younger users, who are increasingly turning to social media platforms and video hosting sites for entertainment. With this new move, YouTube aims to secure its position among the top video hosting platforms, offering users a more TV-like experience.
