Unsuccessful: Charles Edwards tried to fight against the state's decision over his sexual encounter with an 18-year-old student but the court rejected his appeal . A former teacher who appealed his conviction for having consensual sex with an 18-year-old student has lost. The Kansas Court of Appeals upheld a state law designed to prevent sexual relations between teachers and students. Charles Edwards, who had been the choir teacher at Wichita Northwest High School, argued he should be held to the same standards as professors at university campuses who are allowed to have sex with their students. The court disagreed, stating in its . report: 'While it is true that both situations involve learning . environments, the circumstances are hardly comparable.' It continued: 'High school attendance . is mandatory... while attendance at college is voluntary. Most of the . children attending K-12 schools are minors.' Edwards said the law infringed on his right to have consensual sex with a consenting adult in his home. He was charged with having sex with the student in March 2010 and then placed on probation after being found guilty. State law says having sexual contact with a student at your school is a low-level felony for a teacher or person in position of authority. The ruling acknowledged Edwards' defence but disagreed with it. High school: Charles argued he should be treated in the manner of university professors who are allowed to have sex with their students . 'Teachers are in a unique position to groom or coerce students into exploitative or abusive conduct,' it read. 'The state must provide a safe school environment for students, which includes preventing the sexual exploitation of students. 'A sexually charged learning environment would confuse, disturb, and distract students, thus undermining the quality of education in Kansas.' The ruling continued: 'Students very well may not have the necessary level of maturity to remove themselves from a sexually charged situation.'

chatgpt: A former high school teacher in Maryland has been sentenced to three years in prison for having sex with a student. Charles Edwards, who taught at Prince George's County's Northwestern High School, was found guilty of violating state laws that prohibit people in positions of authority from engaging in sexual acts with students. Edwards admitted to the sexual relationship during the trial, but argued that the law violated his constitutional right to have consensual sex with an adult. He argued that the student was over 18 and that the relationship was consensual. However, state laws do not allow any sexual relationship between a teacher and a student, whether or not the student is over 18. On Thursday, Judge Kathleen Gallogly Cox said during Edwards' sentencing that his actions broke the trust that students and parents place in educators. "You were in a position of trust and authority over this young woman," Cox said. "Rather than helping her, you deprived her of the guidance and leadership she deserved." Edwards was convicted of three counts of sexual abuse of a minor and three counts of sexual offense in the 4th degree. His sentence is the maximum permitted by law for his offenses. Many have spoken out against Edwards' argument that the law violated his constitutional rights. "There is no such thing as consensual sex between a teacher and a student. Even if the student is 18 or older, the teacher has the ability to manipulate and coerce the student," said Melissa Brockie, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Edwards' sentencing serves as a reminder that any sexual relationship between a teacher and a student, no matter how consensual, is illegal and violates the trust and authority granted to educators. The sentence handed down sends a clear message that the state of Maryland takes these crimes seriously and will not tolerate any violation of the power dynamic between teachers and their students.
