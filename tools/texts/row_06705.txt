'It should be noted all deputies involved were in their class 'B' uniform, thus giving a poor perspective and lack of neutrality on behalf of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.' The recommended discipline for the trio was 'verbal couseling.' The rapper was in court fighting an arbitrators order - in April he was ordered to pay a Bradenton earphone manufacturer more than $16 million in connection with a failed partnership to produce the entertainer's line of headphones. 50 Cent was ordered to pay Sleek Audio nearly $4.5 million in attorney fees and $11.7 million in damages. The U.S. District Court in Miami affirmed the award in late March after a three-year legal battle. Records allege that Jackson, a Sleek partner, stole the designs of over-the-ear headphones he asked the company to conceptualize and manufacture. Jackson has been selling headphones of a similar design under the 50-Over line with another manufacturer.
