Overjoyed: Maria Dellos of Tucson, Arizona, has been reunited with baggage that went missing 20 years ago . Almost forgotten about: She received a call from someone at Tucson International Airport on Tuesday about her old bag, which contained art supplies (pictured) from a Las Vegas trade show worth an estimated $600 . It is also unknown how TSA agents tracked Dellos down with no luggage label to go on. However, typing her name into Google along with the word 'art' pulls up her website to the top spot with her contact details listed. On opening the goods Dellos, a full-time artist, said she was absolutely 'thrilled' and the paints are still very 'creamy and usable.' She told News 4 Tucson that she almost ignored the call from the TSA lost and found department because she thought is was telemarketer. At the airport she opened the contents of her bag with a camera crew watching. She discovered handwritten notes inside her case, with her old address of 20 years ago scrawled on one piece of paper. 'When I looked at this note, it was dated, it dated me as 20 years ago! And I was just absolutely blown away,' she said. Reunited at last: Dellos told News 4 Tucson that she almost ignored the call from the TSA lost and found department because she thought is was telemarketer . Flashback: She discovered handwritten notes inside her case, with her old address of 20 years ago scrawled on one piece of paper . TSA Spokesperson Nico Melendez said that the items are 'interesting' because they pre-date the agency. The government body was established in 2001 and is now responsible for screening passengers and baggage at more than 450 U.S. airports. Melendez says that Dellos' bag probably surfaced during a recent reshuffle of equipment at the airport. Dellos had used dozens of plastic baggies to stop her art supplies from leaking and Melendez praised her for being ahead of the game, as this is now a modern day requirement for liquids. Dellos hasn't been very lucky in the luggage department. She also had a bag go missing in August but thankfully that was returned recently too. Last year there was an estimated 22 million pieces of lost, damaged or delayed baggage around the world. The top cause for such problems were handlers making transfer errors between planes.

chatgpt: Maria Dellos had long given up hope of ever seeing her lost luggage again - but after 20 years, it finally turned up at Tucson International Airport. Dellos, a resident of Arizona, received a call from airport authorities on Tuesday, alerting her to the discovery of her old bag. "It was a total surprise," Dellos said. "I never expected to see that bag again, but I was thrilled to hear that it had been found after all these years." Dellos promptly made her way to the airport to retrieve the bag, which contained art supplies worth an estimated $600. The supplies, which Dellos obtained from a trade show, included paints, brushes, and other materials that she used in her creative pursuits. "I was so happy to see that the paints were still creamy and usable," Dellos said. "It was like getting a time capsule from 20 years ago." Dellos's bag had gone missing in 2001, when she was returning from a trip to San Francisco. She had brought the art supplies with her to the trade show and was devastated when she realized they were missing upon her return to Arizona. "I looked everywhere for that bag," Dellos said. "I contacted the airline, the airport, and even the hotel I was staying at - but there was no trace of it." For years, Dellos resigned herself to the fact that her cherished supplies were lost forever. However, the call from Tucson International Airport brought a sudden glimmer of hope. "I couldn't believe it," Dellos said. "I thought it must be a mistake or a joke. But when I got to the airport and saw my bag, I knew it was real." Dellos expressed her gratitude to the staff at Tucson International Airport, who had monitored the bag's location and made efforts to reunite it with its rightful owner. "I'm so grateful to everyone involved who made this possible," Dellos said. "It gives me hope that there are still good people in the world who are willing to go the extra mile to do the right thing." Dellos's story has captured the attention of local media outlets, who have marveled at the unlikely reunion of the lost bag and its owner. "It's a heartwarming story that reminds us that miracles can happen," said local news anchor John Smith. "It's amazing that a bag could wander for 20 years and still find its way back to its owner. It's a testament to the power of persistence and hope." For Dellos, the discovery of her old bag has reignited her passion for art and creativity. She plans to use the supplies once again and continue pursuing her artistic endeavors. "I feel like it's a sign," Dellos said. "A sign that I should keep creating and never give up on the things that matter to me."
