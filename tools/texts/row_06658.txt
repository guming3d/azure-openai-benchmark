Mount Aso, located about 625 miles southwest of Tokyo, on Kyushu island, has been blasting out chunks of magma since Friday morning, causing flight cancellations from Kumamoto, the nearest city, and prompting warnings to stay away from its crater. The volcano has been spewing out lava debris and smoke, shooting plumes of ash a kilometer (3,280 feet) into the sky, The Japan Meteorological Agency said. Scroll down for video . Eruption: Volcanic smoke billows from Mount Aso, located about 625 miles southwest of Tokyo, on the southern Kyushu island, following an eruption on Friday . Mount Aso is one of the world's largest volcanos, but the observatory do not expect the eruption to increase in scale. Eruptions by another volcano, Mount Ontake, on the central Japanese island of Honshu, in September left at least 57 dead, and a further six people remain unaccounted for. Experts say hikers near the summit might have been hit by rocks flying as fast as 190 miles per hour. Most of the ash fell in the first hour of the explosion, according to the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute. Survivors said they fled for their lives as rocks and debris rained down on them while they struggled with hot air and ash hitting their face. Seismologists have said that increased seismic activity had been detected at Ontake, one of 47 active volcanoes in Japan that are under 24-hour monitoring, but that nothing signaled such a big eruption. The death toll is the highest from a volcanic eruption in Japan's postwar history, exceeding the 43 people killed in the 1991 eruption of Mount Unzen in southern Japan.

chatgpt: Mount Aso, one of Japan’s most active volcanoes, erupted on Saturday for the first time in 22 years. The eruption occurred on Kyushu island, about 625 miles southwest of Tokyo.  The volcano has been blasting chunks of magma and debris and shooting ash up to 3,280 feet into the sky, triggering concerns about the safety of the people living in its vicinity. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued a warning to alert residents about the possible dangers of the eruption. Officials have also urged residents to stay away from the mountain and avoid driving on nearby roads due to the risk of falling rocks. Kumamoto, the nearest city to the volcano, was also affected. The ash cloud disrupted air travel and dozens of flights from the city were cancelled, leaving many travelers stranded. In addition, local farmers near the volcano have been forced to evacuate their livestock to safer ground. Mount Aso is a popular tourist destination, attracting thousands of visitors every year. The volcano is also known for its rich soil and is one of Japan's major producers of vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli. With the eruption, there is an immediate impact on the agricultural industry, leading to a possible increase in vegetable prices in the months to come. The authorities have also set up an evacuation center in the nearby town of Takamori for residents living within a 2.5 kilometer radius of the volcano. They are urging residents to remain cautious and stay updated on the latest news and advisories. This is not the first time Mount Aso has erupted, as it is known for its frequent volcanic activity. In fact, it last erupted in 2016. The JMA has been closely monitoring the volcano, and as a result, when the eruption occurred, they were able to issue a warning immediately, providing residents with time to evacuate safely. The current eruption is still ongoing, and the authorities are keeping a close eye on the situation. It is uncertain how long the eruption will last, but officials have warned that it may continue for some time. The JMA has advised residents to stay vigilant and to continue taking the necessary safety measures until the situation stabilizes. In summary, the eruption of Mount Aso has resulted in significant disruption to air travel and has raised concerns about the safety of residents living nearby. While the authorities are doing their best to prevent any casualties, it is crucial for residents to remain vigilant and heed the warnings issued by the JMA.
