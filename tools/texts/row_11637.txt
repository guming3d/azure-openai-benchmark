Resignation: David Tovar has left his position as chief spokesman for Walmart after the retail giant discovered he had lied about his college degree . He stepped down after eight years with Walmart and the former spokesman declined all requests to make a statement. A spokesman for the retailer told Bloomberg that it was up to Tover to 'speak to anything about his background.' According to the New York Post, Bloomberg discovered the lie while they were screening Tovar for another promotion. The fabrication of his degree was uncovered through this 'due-diligence screening.' Why Walmart only conducted a screening of Tovar now is unknown, however he joined Walmart with no problems in 2006 from tobacco giant Altria. Tovar came to national prominence earlier this year when he became involved in a spat with the New York Times' own Walmart Blog about a 'wildly inaccurate' column by Timothy Egan regarding the minimum wage. In March 2013, Tovar was arrested for failure to appear before an Arkansas county judge regarding a speeding ticket. The arrest had nothing to do with his dismissal this week . Giant: Walmart is the world's largest retailer and said it had no comment about the decision to let David Tolar go . In a poorly received move, Tovar uploaded a version of Egan's column covered in red pen that showed inaccuracies, as if marked by a school teacher. In an interview with CNBC, Tovar told the network that his resume omission was uncovered when he was being promoted to senior vice president. 'As part of that process I was going through additional leadership assessment, including a battery of tests including questions about leadership, drug tests, background checks,' he said to CNBC. 'In the background check my education was flaggedâ€”it was done by a third party company. They asked me about it, and I was 100 percent transparent. 'I got a job and never looked back. I really didn't think an art degree would matter in communications, which was the field I went into,' he said. Tovar said that whatever happens, he is not leaving Walmart under a cloud. 'Walmart said they could not promote me based on what they found. I said that the more senior job is the one that I wanted, so we agreed I would leave,' he said. 'I am leaving on good terms and Walmart has been very supportive. I am still here a few more weeks.'

chatgpt: David Tovar, a 40-year-old man who currently works at Walmart, has been caught in a lie about his educational background. Tovar claimed to have graduated from the University of Delaware in 1996, but it has been revealed that he did not actually graduate. Tovar joined Walmart in 2006 and quickly climbed the ranks to become the Vice President of Communications. However, when he was being considered for a promotion to Senior Vice President, his lie about his education was uncovered. A spokesperson for Walmart stated that the company was made aware of Tovar's deception and that he has since resigned from his position. The spokesperson also added that Walmart has a strict code of ethics that all associates are required to abide by, and any violation of that code will not be tolerated. This situation highlights the importance of being truthful about one's educational background, especially when it comes to career advancement. Lying about a college degree can not only damage one's professional reputation but can also be grounds for termination from a job. Furthermore, it raises questions about the hiring and vetting process that Walmart undertakes when bringing on new employees. It is unclear how Tovar's deception went undetected for so many years and whether any changes will be made to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. As for Tovar, his future job prospects are certainly in question. Having been caught in such a significant lie, it is uncertain whether other employers will be willing to take a chance on him. He may also face legal repercussions for falsifying his educational background. This incident also serves as a reminder that academic credentials should not be the sole criteria for job performance or promotion. While advanced degrees and certifications can certainly be valuable assets in certain fields, job experience, skills, and personal qualities should also factor into hiring and promotion decisions. In conclusion, David Tovar's lie about his education has cost him his job and damaged his professional reputation. It also raises concerns about the hiring and vetting practices at Walmart, as well as the perceived importance of educational credentials in the workplace. Employers and employees alike should be honest about their educational background and recognize that it is just one factor in a broader evaluation of job performance and potential.
