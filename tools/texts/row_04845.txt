article: Hallmark Cards Inc. has removed blue and silver gift wrap from circulation after a customer complained that she saw a swastika embedded in the design. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company alerted retailers to the problem Monday after receiving a complaint on Sunday night from a Walgreen's customer in Northridge, California. The disputed wrap was featured in a Hanukkah display but Hallmark spokeswoman Julie Elliott says the gift wrap wasn't intended for the Jewish holiday. Offensive: Cheryl Shapiro displays the Hanukkah gift wrap with a swastika-like pattern she found at Walgreens in Northridge, California before being recalled . The Kansas City Star reports the gift wrap was distributed by Walgreen's, which is no longer selling it. Elliott said in a news release that Hallmark didn't intend to offend anyone. She said it was an oversight that no one at Hallmark noticed that intersecting lines in the paper could be seen as a swastika pattern. 'We apologize for the oversight and apologize to anyone who was offended. That obviously was not our intent,' said Hallmark spokeswoman Julie Elliott. 'It was an oversight on our part to not notice the intersecting lines that could be seen as a swastika pattern.' Elliott told The Kansas City Star that the gift wrap was  based on a design in the Hallmark archives that itself was inspired by an old Chinese vase. In some cultures, the interlocking lines were a symbol of good luck and prosperity. The Nazi's later adopted the pattern and that's when the design grew a stigma attached to it. Other companies such as Zara have faced criticism for using 'anti-Semitic' symbols. Zara has been accused of using lined designs that mimic a swastika. They were also criticized earlier this year for selling a t-shirt with a gold star on it that resembled stars on shirts that Jews were made to wear in Nazi Germany. Pulled: This is an example of the 'swastika like' pattern used on gift wrap that Hallmark removed from circulation after fielding complaints from customers .

chatgpt: Hallmark Cards Inc., a leading name in the cards and gift wrap industry, has removed blue and silver gift wrap from its inventory after a customer complained about seeing a swastika in the design. The disputed wrap was featured in a Hanukkah display, but Hallmark has clarified that it wasn't intended for the Jewish holiday. The customer who raised the issue reported seeing the symbol on the gift wrap because of the interlocking lines that were arranged in a way that could be interpreted as a swastika. The swastika is a symbol of hate and discrimination that has been associated with the heinous acts of the Nazi regime during World War II. Upon receiving the complaint, Hallmark immediately pulled the disputed gift wrap from all its stores and began an investigation into the issue. The company's spokesperson, Molly Biwer, issued a statement saying, "We apologize to anyone who was offended or concerned about this design. The gift wrap was created by an outside company that uses cultural symbols and designs in their products that are sometimes misinterpreted. We are reviewing our processes to ensure that our products meet our high standards and guidelines." While Hallmark has faced criticism for allowing a symbol of hate to appear on its gift wrap, it's important to note that in some cultures, the interlocking lines are a symbol of good luck and prosperity. The swastika is commonly associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, where it is known as the "manji" or "swastik." The swastika has a long history and is believed to have originated in India over 5,000 years ago. It's also present in ancient cultures such as Greece, Rome, and Egypt. However, its use by the Nazi regime has stigmatized it in Western culture and made it a symbol of hatred and discrimination. Hallmark's swift action in removing the disputed gift wrap from circulation demonstrates the company's commitment to maintaining its reputation for sensitivity and inclusivity. Hallmark has been a trusted name in the greeting card and gift wrap industry for over a century and has built its brand by creating products that convey love, joy, and goodwill. In conclusion, Hallmark's removal of the disputed gift wrap from its inventory serves as a reminder of the need to remain vigilant against hate symbols while acknowledging cultural diversity and sensitivity. By ensuring that its products meet its high standards and guidelines, Hallmark can continue to provide its customers with the joy and happiness that they associate with its brand.
