article: PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French Senate early Thursday narrowly passed a controversial law to allow many more shops across the country to open on Sundays, in what would be a significant cultural shift. The law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones. The vote, which followed two days of debate, was expected to happen Friday. But the Senate put the measure to a vote at 2 a.m. Thursday (8 p.m. ET Wednesday), when it passed 165-159. The law, however, is not a fait accompli. The opposition Socialist party immediately appealed to the Constitutional Council, asking it to make sure the measure is constitutionally sound. A decision from the council is expected in about two weeks. If the Constitutional Council approved the law, it would mark a significant cultural shift in France, where Sundays have officially been set aside as a day of rest for more than a century. A 1906 law forbids Sunday trading in all but the largest cities. President Nicolas Sarkozy had pushed for the measure, but the law that passed Thursday contains fewer changes than Sarkozy had originally intended, because he has had to give in to opposition from the left and the right. Socialists filed thousands of amendments to the president's original version of the law. Leftists and unions said it would effectively introduce a seven-day workweek and allow bosses to force employees to work Sundays.  Watch how new law will change a way of life in France » . Members of the president's own ruling conservative party opposed the law despite assurances that it would boost economic activity, saying it would instead deprive families and church groups of their dedicated day. The law would permit shops, department stores and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones of what are called "exceptional commercial" centers in and near three of the country's largest cities: Paris, Marseilles and Lille. Those centers are malls or clusters of shopping centers often located just outside major cities. Additionally, 29 areas involving about 500 cities and towns would be added to the list of tourist areas, which already allow some economic activity on Sundays. Among other things, the new law would straighten out a somewhat chaotic situation in which some stores manage to obtain exceptions from the old law and others don't, and in which some stores find it makes sense to accept fines for breaking the existing law, because the income from Sunday sales more than makes up for the penalties. Opinion polls in France showed slightly more than half the population wanted shops to have the freedom to open on Sundays, according to Time magazine. CNN's Jim Bittermann and Niki Cook contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The French Senate has passed a new law allowing more shops to open on Sundays. The legislation, which if approved by the Constitutional Council, would overturn the 1906 law that prohibited shops from opening on Sundays. The bill has been a contentious issue, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy has faced opposition from both the left and the right over the proposed changes. The new law, which was passed by the Senate in a 165-159 vote, has been hailed by proponents as a victory for businesses and consumers alike. Many believe that allowing shops to open on Sundays will stimulate economic growth and provide greater convenience for customers. However, opponents to the bill have raised concerns about the impact that increased Sunday shopping will have on workers. Many argue that workers will be forced to work longer hours without proper compensation, leading to a decline in the quality of life for many French citizens. Despite these concerns, President Sarkozy has remained committed to the proposed changes, arguing that the current restrictions on Sunday shopping are outdated and out of touch with modern society. In a statement released after the Senate vote, he expressed optimism that the bill would be approved by the Constitutional Council, saying that "France cannot remain stuck in the past." However, some members of the opposition parties have vowed to continue fighting against the proposed legislation. Socialist Senator Didier Guillaume argued that the new law "puts the interests of big business ahead of the interests of workers and consumers." He added that the bill "goes against the principles of the French republic." Similarly, members of the Green Party have expressed concerns about the impact that increased Sunday shopping will have on the environment. Green Party Senator Joël Labbé argued that "we need to be promoting more sustainable forms of consumption, not encouraging people to shop more." Despite these objections, the new law is expected to have a significant impact on the French economy. According to a recent study by the French Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, the proposed changes could lead to the creation of up to 100,000 new jobs and could generate up to €1.5 billion in additional revenue for businesses. In addition, proponents of the bill argue that increased Sunday shopping will provide greater convenience for consumers, particularly those who work long hours during the week. Many French citizens have expressed frustration with the current restrictions on Sunday shopping, arguing that they make it difficult to run errands and purchase necessary goods. Overall, the passage of the new law allowing more shops to open on Sundays is likely to be seen as a significant victory for President Sarkozy and his supporters. While opposition to the bill remains strong, many believe that the proposed changes will help to modernize the French economy and provide greater flexibility and convenience for consumers.
