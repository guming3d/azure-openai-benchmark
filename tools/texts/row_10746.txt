article: Tottenham will this week consider an £5million swoop for Burnley striker Danny Ings. Mauricio Pochettino wants to add to his forward line before the transfer deadline, and Ings is high on his list of options. Ings has been on Tottenham's radar for over 12 months, with former boss Tim Sherwood interested in the forward during his time in the hotseat. VIDEO Scroll down to see Danny Ings in goal-scoring action for England U21's . Danny Ings has scored seven goals for Burnley this season but he may still ending up leaving the club . Spurs have retained their interest and are set to move for the 22-year-old, who has scored seven goals for the Clarets this season. The White Hart Lane club had been interested in Saido Berahino, but are not prepared to meet West Bromwich's £20million asking price. Pochettino's interest in Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez has cooled owing to the England international's long-running battle to recover from a serious knee injury. A move for Ings may depend on moving players out of the club in the coming days. Pochettino wants to shift a number of players this month as he looks to free up money on his wage bill. Mauricio Pochettino is one of the managers keen on getting Ings' signature, and wants him at Tottenham . They were successful in offloading Kyle Naughton in Swansea last week, recouping £5million. And they remain hopeful in trying to sell more players this month, with Emmanuel Adebayor, Aaron Lennon, Vlad Chiriches, Younes Kaboul and Paulinho all available. Burnley manager Sean Dyche will want to keep his prized-asset until at least the end of the season. But with the striker's contract due to expire in the summer, the club will find it hugely difficult to resist an substantial offer for Ings this month. Because Ings is under 23, Burnley would receive a compensation fee, understood to be in the region of £3million, for the forward should he run down his contract. So any bid upward of that figure is likely to be considered by Burnley.

chatgpt: Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino is reportedly interested in bringing Burnley striker Danny Ings to the White Hart Lane. Sources close to the club have revealed that they are considering a £5million offer for the 22-year-old, who has been in fine form for the Clarets this season. Ings has scored seven goals so far, making him one of the most prolific strikers in the Premier League this season. Pochettino sees the youngster as a valuable addition to the Tottenham attack, which has struggled in recent weeks. The Argentine manager is keen to offload some of the current squad members to free up wages, and therefore has been looking for affordable, yet talented, players to add to the squad. Ings, who only has six months left on his current contract, would be a cost-effective signing, allowing Pochettino to focus on other areas where the squad needs strengthening. Spurs currently sit 7th in the Premier League table, eight points behind 4th-placed Manchester United. The club's hierarchy is reportedly eager to push for a Champions League spot, and strengthening the attacking line-up with a player like Ings would help achieve that goal. Ings is no stranger to the Premier League, having scored 11 goals last season to help Burnley win promotion to the top-flight. The England U21 international would provide competition for Spurs' current strikers, Harry Kane and Roberto Soldado. Tottenham's interest in Ings may come as a blow to Liverpool, who have been heavily linked with the player for several weeks. However, with Tottenham reportedly willing to offer more guaranteed playing time, Ings could be tempted to make the move Down South. It remains to be seen whether Burnley would be willing to part ways with one of their prized assets, especially given their current struggle to avoid relegation. However, with Ings' contract set to expire in the summer, Burnley may be willing to accept a £5million offer in order to avoid losing him for free in the summer. Overall, Pochettino's interest in Danny Ings highlights Tottenham's need for a new striker as they look to push for a Champions League spot this season. Whether a deal for the Burnley forward can be reached before the January transfer window closes remains to be seen.
