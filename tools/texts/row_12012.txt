Cobane, 32, is clearly shown spotting the money at his home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, pointing to something behind a confused Mr Gill and stealing the cash when he is not looking. The out of work hairdresser, who moved to  Grindleton Avenue, Sharston, Wythenshawe, admitted theft when she appeared before Stockport magistrates. She will be sentenced later this month and magistrates warned that she could face jail. Mr Gill's niece Louise Haig set up the sting with help from private detectives Proactive Investigations.

Claire Parrott, defending, told the court that her client had led a previously crime-free life, but after splitting up from her partner she started taking amphetamines and drinking heavily. Within a year, Cobane had developed a daily habit for the drugs, said Mrs Parrott. A spokesman from Proactive Investigations, who set up the camera, said: 'We are delighted to have been given another opportunity to succeed where others have failed. 'In this case we have assisted a particularly vulnerable member of the community and family.'

chatgpt: Relatives of a man suffering from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) decided to take matters into their own hands after noticing that things kept disappearing from their loved one's home. They installed a hidden camera in the living room and placed £20 as bait to see if anyone was stealing from the house. The camera footage revealed the culprit to be their neighbor, Lisa Cobane. It was reported that Cobane cased the living room before distracting the MS sufferer, Malcolm Gill, while the 32-year-old mother then stole the cash when his back was turned. Cobane had previously offered to care for Mr. Gill while a permanent carer was found. When confronted with the footage, Cobane admitted to the theft and appeared before magistrates. She was warned that she could face imprisonment for her actions. The magistrates were appalled at her behavior as they considered that she had manipulated the trust and vulnerability of someone who was dependent on her care. The theft has shocked the local community who had previously praised Cobane for offering to help care for Mr. Gill. MS is a highly debilitating condition that affects individuals' physical and mental functions, and those diagnosed with it often require specialist care. It is distressing for families and friends to see their loved ones suffering from this condition and equally concerning for them to witness the stealing from their homes. Relatives of Mr. Gill have since stated their relief that the thief had been caught and that justice would take its course. They have warned others in the community to be vigilant and take steps if they suspect anything is amiss. The hidden camera footage has certainly proven to be an effective means of detecting such crimes, and its use is likely to become more widespread. It is hoped that this story will serve as a warning to anyone who is considering taking advantage of those in a vulnerable position. The relatives of Mr. Gill have expressed their gratitude to the police and magistrates for their swift action and the support they have received from the community. They hope that this incident will not happen to anyone else and that their loved one's ordeal will come to an end soon.
