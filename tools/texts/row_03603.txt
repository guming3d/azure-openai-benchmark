A crowd reportedly sung circumcision songs as they gathered the men up before taking them to a nearby medical centre where the operations were carried out. One of the wives, Anne Njeri, who witnessed the incident on Friday, told the radio station: 'We are happy with the move to have such men cut because uncircumcised men are dirty and do not perform well in bed and thus we are sure their wives will now enjoy their marriages.' Each of the men have been provided with money by others in the town for treatment, according to the report.

chatgpt: Moi's Bridge, a town in western Kenya, is facing a wave of mandatory circumcisions after wives revealed their husbands had not undergone the procedure.  The revelations have sparked a call for all men in the town who have not been circumcised to have the procedure done. The cultural practice of male circumcision has been prevalent among many communities in Kenya for centuries. It was believed to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted diseases, which led to a massive campaign in 2008 sponsored by the World Health Organization and Kenya's Ministry of Health to increase the rate of circumcision among men. Despite these efforts, some men in Moi's Bridge have never undergone the procedure. This has led to concerns among health officials and community leaders, who are now advocating for mandatory circumcision to reduce the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. According to the wives who revealed their husbands' un-circumcision, the issue became apparent after several of them contracted sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Although the men were reluctant to discuss the issue, their wives decided to speak out, convinced that having the procedure could help prevent the spread of diseases. Mandatory male circumcision has been met with mixed reactions in Moi's Bridge. While some community leaders welcome the move, arguing that it could help curb the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, others are opposed to it, citing cultural and religious reasons. In some communities, male circumcision holds significant traditional and religious value, and the introduction of mandatory circumcision raises concerns over the violation of individual rights and beliefs. However, some traditional leaders have also shown support for mandatory circumcision, arguing it can be an effective way to reduce HIV transmission. Moi's Bridge residents are now receiving education and counseling sessions to emphasize the importance of circumcision, its benefits and the positive impact that it can have on one's life. Health officials hope that with increased knowledge and awareness, men will voluntarily undergo the procedure, reducing the need for mandatory circumcision. The debate surrounding male circumcision in Moi's Bridge highlights the ongoing cultural and societal changes taking place in Kenya. While the practice of male circumcision has been deeply rooted in Kenyan culture for centuries, the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the introduction of modern medical practices are sparking a new conversation about the practice. Many experts agree that mandatory male circumcision, if implemented appropriately, could be an effective way to reduce the rate of HIV transmission in Moi's Bridge and other parts of the country. However, it is equally important to respect individual rights and beliefs and to work towards ensuring that men make informed decisions about their own bodies, rather than mandating medical procedures.
