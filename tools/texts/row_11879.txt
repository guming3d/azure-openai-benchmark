article: Washington (CNN) -- A Georgetown University student was charged on Friday with possessing ricin after admitting he made the poison in his campus dorm room, a court document showed. Daniel Harry Milzman, 19, appeared in federal court, where a judge ordered him held pending a hearing next week. Milzman was arrested by the FBI and charged with possessing a biological toxin, according to an FBI affidavit. That submission said he learned how to make ricin on his iPhone and then bought ingredients at retail stores. Ricin is a deadly toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. On Monday, Milzman allegedly showed a bag that he claimed to contain ricin to his dorm adviser, who notified school authorities. They in turn called police, the filing states. Preliminary lab tests confirmed the substance was ricin, it said. Milzman allegedly produced the substance a month earlier in his room, placed it in plastic bags sealed with hockey tape and stored it in his room, according to the document. The amount produced possibly could have been enough to kill someone had it been inhaled or injected, the affidavit said. Milzman is due back in court on Tuesday . His attorney, Danny Onorato, declined comment when contacted by CNN on Friday evening. Georgetown said in a statement on Wednesday that tests on McCarthy Hall for the presence of biological agents were negative, and there had been no reports of anyone being exposed to ricin. The university on Friday said the undergraduate student will not be permitted to return to campus at this time. "The possession or manufacturing of illegal substances are issues we take very seriously and are violations of the university's student code of conduct," said media relations director Rachel Pugh in a statement.

chatgpt: A Georgetown University student has reportedly confessed to making a deadly toxin called ricin, according to an affidavit filed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The student in question, 19-year-old Daniel H. Milzman, was ordered to be held until his next court hearing. The court document reveals that Milzman claimed to have made ricin in his dorm room. The substance, which is derived from castor beans, can be fatal if inhaled or injected. According to the FBI affidavit, Milzman allegedly showed a fellow student a vial containing the toxin and stated that he intended to use it. After being alerted to the situation, Georgetown University conducted a thorough check of the dorm where Milzman resided, as well as the surrounding campus. Thankfully, no one has reported any exposure to ricin, and the campus has been deemed safe. Milzman's motive for making the deadly toxin is currently unknown, and it is unclear whether he had planned to use it. However, given the severity of the situation, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are now working together to investigate the matter fully. Ricin, in its powdered form, can be easily inhaled or ingested, causing severe respiratory distress and potentially leading to death. Its use as a weapon is strictly prohibited by international law. The FBI has warned that anyone caught using or producing ricin will face serious legal consequences. The incident at Georgetown University serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by individuals who experiment with dangerous substances. The consequences of such actions can be deadly and have far-reaching effects on entire communities, as we have seen in the past. As the authorities continue their investigation, the public is urged to remain vigilant and immediately report any suspicious activity or behavior. The safety of our communities must always be our top priority.
