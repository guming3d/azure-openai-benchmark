article: (CNN) -- A British-owned cargo ship on Monday became the latest vessel to be seized by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. International naval patrols have been stepped up in the Gulf of Aden following increased pirate attacks. The 32,000-tonne Malaspina Castle was taken early on Monday and was believed to be heading towards Somalia's pirate-infested coast, the European Union's Horn of Africa maritime security center said. "Few details are known at this stage, but the mixed-nationality crew is believed to be safe," a statement on the London-based organization's Web site said. The vessel, which is operated by an Italian company, carried a crew of 24, from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia and the Philippines, Britain's Telegraph newspaper reported. "There have not yet been communications from the Malaspina Castle that we are aware of, so information is limited," said Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers' Assistance Program in quotes carried by the Telegraph. He added: "It is likely to be taken towards the Somali coast and negotiations will begin soon." Meanwhile, the BBC reported that a Taiwanese fishing boat, with a crew of 29, was also hijacked Monday approximately 260km (160 miles) from the Seychelles. The latest attacks follow a string of incidents in the pirate-plagued waterway off Somalia at the weekend, with a French yacht, a Yemeni tugboat and a German ship also reported to have been seized. Last year, pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 off Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau. In response, a number of countries have deployed warships from their navies to the region, including the United States, China and Japan. Monday's seizure of the Malaspina Castle was immediately condemned by the UK ship masters' union Nautilus, which has long urged governments to take stronger action to deter piracy. Nautilus assistant general secretary Mark Dickinson told the British Press Association: "Over the last 10 years, most governments have not really done very much about this. "More recently they have been motivated to act and there is an EU naval coordination force patrolling off the Gulf of Aden." He added: "I'm not sure that this is going to be a long-term thing and I'm also worried that the pirates will start seizing ships well away from the areas being patrolled. "In Somalia, piracy is like a big, successful industry and the authorities there need to act. The pirates are treated like local heroes. People look up to them and girls want to marry them. They are seen by some locals as good people but they are ruthless."

chatgpt: A cargo ship, the Malaspina Castle, was taken in the early hours on Monday by pirates despite enhanced naval protection around the Gulf of Aden. The 32,000-tonne vessel was manned by a crew of 24 workers from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia, and the Philippines. The EU's maritime security center expressed their belief in the safety of the crew members, and there have been no reports of harm to the crew. Piracy remains a significant threat to vessels and their crews in the Gulf of Aden. The increased naval patrols by international forces, along with ship owners hardening their vessels to make them more difficult targets, has dented the number of piracy attacks in the area. However, it appears this recent incident shows that pirates are still active and looking for opportunities to seize valuable cargo. The International Maritime Bureau provides figures that demonstrate piracy remains a significant maritime problem, with 33 pirate incidents reported worldwide between January and September 2019. The Gulf of Aden, in particular, has seen increasing incidents of piracy; however, it remains one of the world's most important and busiest shipping routes, with vessels from around the world using the passage to reach their destinations. The capture of the Malaspina Castle is concerning, as it is highly likely that pirates will attempt to hold the ship and its valuable cargo for ransom. Piracy gangs are known to use hijacked ships and their crews to barter for funds that can often amount to millions of dollars. It appears that the vessel was targeted by the pirates due to its slower speed, making it easier for the pirates to get aboard. The ship's operators had employed avoidance measures, such as following the recommended routes, but still fell prey to the pirates. The incident raises questions about the effectiveness of the international naval patrols, with some calling for an increase in efforts to combat the piracy issue. The Malaspina Castle was sailing from Greece to South Korea when it was taken by the pirates, and the ship's owners have engaged with the relevant authorities to seek their assistance in recovering the ship and crew. In conclusion, the capture of the Malaspina Castle highlights the ongoing threat of piracy in the Gulf of Aden, and the need for increased vigilance from ship owners and international forces. The incident is likely to prompt further discussions on how best to combat piracy and protect shipping lanes around the world.
