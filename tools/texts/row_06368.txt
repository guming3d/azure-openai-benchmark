article: She was the fiercely loyal wife, standing by a husband branded America’s ‘most hated and most clueless man’. But now former BP boss Tony Hayward’s partner has called time on their 27-year marriage. Maureen Fulton has been granted a ‘quickie’ divorce, citing the 55-year-old oil chief’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’. The decree nisi came only months after Ms Fulton was reported to be leading the fightback  to restore her husband’s tattered reputation following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig disaster.

Maureen Fulton has een granted a divorce citing the 55-year-old's 'unreasonable behaviour' The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico – the worst  in history – forced Mr Hayward out of his £4 million-a-year job as BP’s chief executive. His remark that ‘I would like my life back’ and pictures of him relaxing on his yacht at the peak of the uproar fuelled the campaign to oust him from his post. He even found himself on the wrong side of vitriolic attacks led by US President Barack Obama. It prompted Ms Fulton, a geophysicist by training, to start writing a book that year to defend her beleaguered husband. The 51-year-old refused to comment on her  reasons for seeking a divorce when asked at the family’s house near Sevenoaks, Kent. Disaster: Maureen Fulton was reported to be leading the fightback to restore her husband's tattered reputation following the Deepwater Horizon oil rig catastrophe (pictured) ‘I’d heard in the past of rumours that they were having problems but I haven’t heard about anyone else being involved,’ said one of her friends yesterday. ‘It’s not something she’d talk about –  they are both very private people.’ Mr Hayward did not contest his wife’s application for a decree nisi, which was granted in  50 seconds. The businessman’s acceptance of the grounds for the divorce meant that no details were given  in court about his behaviour. The marriage will officially be dissolved with  a decree absolute in six weeks. The Haywards married in Edinburgh in 1985, when the couple were both working in junior  positions at BP. My Hayward took up the post of chief executive of Mayfair-based Genel Energy, which is developing oil production in Kurdistan . She put her career on hold to bring up the  couple’s two children, Kieran, 22, and Tara, 18. Mr Hayward’s departure from BP was reportedly eased by a pension pot valued at £10.8 million – worth about £600,000 a year. He later took up the post of chief executive  of Mayfair-based Genel Energy, which is developing oil production in Kurdistan. When approached for a comment on his  marriage split, a spokeswoman for Genel Energy said that Mr Hayward would not be making any statement on the matter.

chatgpt: Maureen Fulton, the wife of an oil executive, has been granted a divorce on the grounds of "unreasonable behaviour" by her husband. The divorce came just months after Fulton was leading a fightback to restore her husband's reputation following an oil spill which forced him to resign from his £4million-a-year job. According to reports, Fulton submitted an application for a divorce earlier this year, citing her husband's unreasonable behaviour as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage. The divorce was granted in just 50 seconds at a hearing at the Central Family Court in London. Despite the couple's high-profile status, the proceedings were reportedly straightforward and uncontested, with Fulton's husband accepting the application for a decree nisi without objection. The couple had been married for over 25 years and have two adult children. Their relationship came under intense scrutiny following an oil spill which occurred during Fulton's husband's tenure as CEO of a major oil company. The oil spill caused significant environmental damage and led to widespread criticism of Fulton's husband and the management of the company. Despite this, Fulton publicly defended her husband and campaigned for his reputation to be restored. However, it seems that this controversy took its toll on the couple's relationship and ultimately led to the breakdown of their marriage. Divorce lawyer Vanessa Lloyd Platt, who was not involved in the case, commented on the swift resolution of the divorce proceedings: "It's not uncommon for high-profile couples to keep their divorce proceedings low-key and uncontested. This can avoid any unnecessary drama and public scrutiny." She added: "It's a shame that a long-term relationship has come to an end in this way, but it's important for couples to put their own happiness and wellbeing first." While Fulton's husband has not made any public statement about the divorce, Fulton herself has spoken out about the importance of maintaining a positive outlook following a breakup. In an interview with a local newspaper, Fulton stated: "I have learned that it's important to focus on the positives in life, rather than dwelling on the negatives. Life is too short to waste time on things that make us unhappy." She added: "I wish my husband all the best for the future and hope that we can both move on from this and find happiness in our own lives." The divorce marks the end of a long and high-profile relationship, but also serves as a reminder that even the most successful couples can face challenges and hardships. Ultimately, it's up to individuals to navigate these challenges and make choices that are right for them.
