article: Some things never go out of fashion: case in point, the trusty rain mac. Thanks to our unpredictable weather, the raincoat will always be a British wardrobe staple. But now Burberry — the company behind the most iconic mac design of all time — reports sales are soaring again and are up by 10 per cent. But that doesn’t mean you can just buy any old one, pull it on any old how, and still look great — the same classic trench can flatter one woman and swamp the next.

Necklace, £15, debenhams.com . Shoes, £195, lucychoilondon.com . Tall women can capitalise on their height with a midi-length: you never need to worry about looking dumpy. This grown-up look is universally stylish and bang on-trend at any age. But only the really giraffe-like should opt for a belted design. BUSTY . Mac, £36, debenhams.com . Jumper, £69, johnlewis.com . Skirt, £35, marksandspencer.com . Shoes, £170, lkbennett.com . With busty ladies, it’s easy to create the unwitting effect of a shelf across the body — so avoid double-breasted designs. It also helps if the mac is not fully done up. Leave it open to create a V, drawing the eye to the waist. Lots of detail on the top half or breast pockets are a big no. PEAR . Mac, £165, frenchconnection.com . Trousers, £120, reiss.com . Shoes, £195, lkbennett.com . PearS are bottom-heavy, so draw the eye upwards and outwards to balance out your shape. The buttons on this mac form a V from the waist, broadening the shoulders to create an hourglass form. Avoid fussy design below the waist, and anything too long. PETITE . Mac, £69, johnlewis.com . Blouse, £125, reiss.com . Dotty jeans, £85, hobbs.co.uk . Shoes, £25.99, zara.com . Here, it’s best to choose a shorter length to avoid being drowned by swathes of fabric. Anything below the knee is a guaranteed disaster. It’s important to be able to see your legs, so they look as long as possible. A belt will nip in the waist, helping to emphasise your legs. Heels are a must to finish the look. BOYISH . Mac, £175, lkbennett.com . Cashmere jumper, £79, marksandspencer.com . Skirt, £110, jigsaw-online.com . Shoes, £129, reiss.com . The trick is to add shape without hiding your slim frame. Adding detail to your top half — via epaulettes or padded shoulders — will work beautifully. A flare will add shape to narrow hips, or leave the mac unbuttoned but belted to add a curve. Fitted clothing beneath leaves no doubt you’re slim.

chatgpt: Rain Macs Remain a Fashion Staple with Burberry Sales Up 10% The classic British rain mac has always been a wardrobe staple, and it seems it's not going anywhere soon. Fashion house Burberry, renowned for its iconic trench coats, has reported a 10% increase in sales of its rain macs. The brand is capitalizing on the timeless appeal of this essential fashion piece, which is popular with fashion-conscious men and women alike. Kate Battersby, a fashion writer, has looked at six different styles of rain macs to suit all body shapes. In an effort to ensure that everyone feels comfortable and confident, Ms. Battersby has recommended various styles that flatter different body types. For those with a larger bust or broad shoulders, the "straight-cut mac" is recommended. This style provides a looser, more comfortable fit, while the straight-line cut helps to balance the figure. For those with a smaller frame or pear-shaped figures, the "wrap-style mac" is a great option. This design features a belted waist, which cinches in to emphasize the waistline and create a more hourglass shape. The "short mac" is another option for those who prefer a more casual look. This style is perfect for wearing with jeans and trainers and is a great option for those who want to look relaxed and comfortable while still looking stylish. For those who like to make a statement, the "bright-coloured mac" is perfect. This style is available in a variety of bold colours, making it a fun and playful option. The "belted mac" is perfect for those who want to create a more defined silhouette. This style features a belt that cinches in at the waist, creating an hourglass shape. Lastly, for those who prefer a more classic look, the "traditional mac" is still a great option. This style has remained popular with Burberry and is perfect for those who prefer a more understated look. The rain mac has always remained a go-to piece for many Brits, and Burberry's latest sales figures are proof of its continued popularity. The mix of classic and contemporary styles offers something for everyone, and with the array of options presented by Kate Battersby, it's easier than ever to find the perfect style to suit your body shape and fashion preferences. In conclusion, the rain mac continues to be a timeless wardrobe staple, and with Burberry's current success in sales, it seems as though it will continue to be a popular choice for years to come. As always, the key is to find a style that suits your individual body shape and personal style.
