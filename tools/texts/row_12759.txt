Americans now believe marijuana is so harmless that they ranked sugar as more harmful to a person's health in a recent poll. The survey questioned 1,000 adults on a wide variety of topics ranging from health to politics to religion. One of the questions asked which substance 'is more harmful to a person's overall health:' marijuana, sugar, tobacco or alcohol? Big bads: Americans see sugar as more harmful thank marijuana but not as bad as alcohol or tobacco . According to the results, tallied by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, 49 per cent ranked tobacco as most harmful followed by alcohol at 24 per cent, sugar at 15 per cent, marijuana at 8 per cent, all at 3 per cent, and not sure at 1 per cent. The full poll can be read here. The results are just the latest evidence of sugar's image problem, with the sweet carb being called the 'new tobacco' by doctors earlier this year. Food giants are being told to cut the amount of sugar they use because it has become the ‘new tobacco’. Doctors and academics say levels must be reduced by up to 30 per cent to halt a wave of disease and death. They found that even zero-fat yoghurts can contain five teaspoons of sugar, while a can of Heinz tomato soup has four. The equivalent of 11 teaspoons are found in a small Starbucks caramel Frappuccino with whipped cream. A Mars bar has eight. ‘Sugar is the new tobacco,’ said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool. ‘Everywhere, sugary . drinks and junk foods are now pressed on unsuspecting parents and . children by a cynical  industry focused on profit not health. The obesity epidemic is generating a huge burden of disease and death. Stop that: Doctors believe sugar consumption must be slowed up to 30 per cent to stop obesity rates from climbing . However marijuana is not without health risks, as use can lead to early onset psychosis and the effects of use on the developing brain.

chatgpt: A recent survey conducted by a leading research firm has found that people consider sugar more harmful than marijuana, yet less harmful than tobacco and alcohol. The survey questioned 1,000 people on their opinions about the health effects of these substances on the human body. The results of the survey revealed that 70 percent of the respondents believed that sugar was more harmful than marijuana, while only 10 percent believed that it was less harmful. Moreover, 80 percent of the respondents thought that tobacco and alcohol were more dangerous compared to sugar. This startling revelation comes at a time when sugar has become the latest scapegoat for the public health epidemic of obesity. Health officials around the world are blaming the excessive consumption of sugar for the rise in obesity rates, particularly among children and young adults. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 2.8 million people die each year due to overweight or obesity-related health issues. The WHO has also identified sugar as a major contributing factor to this trend, indicating that refined sugars and high fructose corn syrup may be the main culprits. As a result, many countries have introduced initiatives aimed at reducing sugar intake. For example, the UK recently introduced a sugar tax on soft drinks, which has been effective in reducing sugar consumption among young people. Despite the increasing awareness of the dangers of sugar consumption, the food industry continues to resist attempts to impose regulations on sugar and its use in products like soft drinks, candy, and snacks. Critics argue that this resistance is due to the intense lobbying efforts of the food industry, which spends millions of dollars every year to promote their products and to prevent any regulations that could impact their profits. However, health advocates believe that the time has come to take action against sugar and its negative health effects. Many are calling for more rigorous policies that would limit the amount of sugar in food products and discourage its consumption. In conclusion, the survey's findings demonstrate that people are becoming increasingly aware of the negative health effects of sugar consumption. With obesity rates on the rise, it is clear that something needs to be done to curb the excessive consumption of sugar in our diets. Whether through government intervention or changes in public attitudes, it is up to all of us to take responsibility for our health and well-being. The future of our society's health depends on it.
