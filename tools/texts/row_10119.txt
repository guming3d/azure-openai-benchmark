article: (CNN) -- Mardy Fish has criticized tennis authorities for halving the suspension handed out to fellow American player Wayne Odesnik for importing controlled drugs. Odesnik will be able to resume his career from December 29 after the International Tennis Federation conditionally canceled the second year of his ban following his cooperation with anti-doping officials. The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to importing human growth hormone into Australia at the start of last year, but is now free to play again when the 2011 season begins Down Under next month. The ITF said he had provided "substantial assistance" to its anti-doping program, and that his requirement to do so is "ongoing." Fish described the ITF's decision as "a black eye for all of sport, not just tennis," in quotes reported by U.S. newspaper USA Today. "He's a good player on enhanced substances. Let's see if he can be a good player without them," the world No. 16 said. Odesnik, who was born in South Africa but moved to the United States when young, has slipped from a career-high 77th to completely off the ATP Tour's rankings list. "I am thrilled that I can return to the game and compete in the sport about which I am truly passionate. I have learned a lot during my time away from competitive tennis and I now have even a greater appreciation for what a privilege it is to be a professional athlete," Odesnik said in a statement. "I want to take this opportunity to thank my family, true close friends and fans who have stood by me during this difficult time. I am deeply grateful and humbled by your support."

chatgpt: The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has been criticized by former player Mardy Fish, after they decided to reduce the two-year suspension given to Wayne Odesnik for importing Human Growth Hormone (HGH) into the United States. Odesnik, a former world number 77, was given a reduced suspension after cooperating with anti-doping officials.  Mardy Fish, who is also a former top 10 player, described the ITF's decision as "a black eye for all sport". He added that reducing the ban sends the wrong message and undermines the efforts made by anti-doping agencies. Wayne Odesnik was originally given a two-year ban in 2010 after he was caught trying to import HGH into the United States. He returned to the game in 2011, but has been suspended again after failing a doping test in 2014.  The ITF said in a statement that they would reduce the ban for Odesnik as he had provided substantial assistance to anti-doping officials. They added that they expect Odesnik to continue giving assistance in the future. However, Fish is not the only person to criticize the decision. Many tennis fans and players have expressed their disappointment towards the ITF. They believe that reducing Odesnik's ban sends a message that cheating is acceptable as long as you cooperate with authorities. The former world number 77 is free to return to tennis from December 29, but his reputation has been tarnished. The ITF's decision has raised questions about their commitment to tackling doping in sport.  In conclusion, the ITF's decision to reduce Wayne Odesnik's ban has caused controversy and anger among tennis players and fans. While the ITF claims that it reduced the ban because of his cooperation with anti-doping officials, critics believe that it sends the wrong message about doping in sport.
