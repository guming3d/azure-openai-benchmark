article: (CNN)Cold, cold and more cold. That's what's on tap in terms of temperature for much of the United States early this week. "We're looking at 50 million people in 24 states that are going to see some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time," CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said Sunday. The National Weather Service predicted heavy rains and mountain snow in the Northwest, and snows from the northern Plains to the northern Mid-Atlantic states. "An Arctic air mass that already invaded the north central U.S. will spread southeastward ... plunging temperatures from the Mississippi Valley to East Coast. "The cold air blowing over warmer waters will allow snow showers to crank up across the Great Lakes region ... especially downwind of Lake Ontario and Erie," it said in a forecast. Wind chill warnings and advisories were in effect for much of Wisconsin, Minnesota and parts of North Dakota and Illinois. "This arctic cold is potentially deadly and dangerous," Maginnis said. "Wind chills in Minnesota and the Dakotas are as low as minus 45 degrees. And a second blast of cold air will reinforce the deep freeze on Tuesday." Are you there? Share images, if you can safely . Northern exposure . Rough conditions are on the way in other areas too. A storm system will bring a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain to parts of upstate New York and New England. In the Midwest, snow will also coat portions of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. And farther west, the same forecast faces Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Utah. The South is in for it too.  "Another reinforcement of the polar air will move its way into the lower 48 this week, plummeting temperatures in the Deep South to below freezing on Thursday into Friday," said CNN meteorologist Michael Guy. Mississippi storms . Central Mississippi was cleaning up Sunday after severe weather raked the state a day earlier. Folks in Jasper County were among the hardest hit. Craig Youngblood said a tornado missed his house by about 50 yards. "We got pretty lucky," he told CNN affiliate WAPT. "We had a safe room in the house and we were all in there." Mary Magee was on the porch with her grandkids when the funnel cloud approached. "There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to go," she said.

chatgpt: Residents of the Great Lakes region are bracing themselves for a blast of winter weather as snow showers are forecast to hit the area. The National Weather Service has issued wind chill warnings and advisories for much of Wisconsin and Minnesota, urging people to stay indoors and avoid prolonged exposure outside. The cold front moving across the country is expected to bring heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures, particularly in the Upper Midwest. In Minnesota, wind chills could reach as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, causing frostbite to develop in mere minutes. To stay safe, local officials recommend dressing in layers, covering exposed skin, and limiting time spent outside. Homeowners are also advised to keep their thermostats at 68 degrees or higher to prevent frozen pipes. Meanwhile, other parts of the country are also experiencing wintry conditions. Upstate New York and New England are expected to receive snow and freezing rain, leading to slippery roads and treacherous driving conditions. State authorities have mobilized snowplow crews and salt trucks to keep the roads clear, but motorists are urged to exercise caution and stay alert while driving. School districts across the region have also cancelled classes due to the weather, to ensure student safety. Despite the challenging conditions, many residents are embracing the winter weather and finding ways to enjoy the snow. Some are heading to the slopes for skiing and snowboarding, while others are taking advantage of the frozen lakes for ice skating and ice fishing. However, experts warn that even if the weather seems calm and sunny, the cold temperatures can still pose a significant risk to those who are unprepared. Hypothermia can develop quickly if you are exposed to cold temperatures without proper insulation, so it is crucial to take precautions and stay informed about the weather conditions. Overall, the winter storms and snow showers are a reminder of the power and unpredictability of nature. As always, it is important to stay safe and prepared, by heeding the advice of local officials and taking the necessary steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.
