article: Harry Camilleri, 34, has been jailed for 10 months after stealing £45,000 from 35 customer deposits . A Mercedes-Benz salesman stole £45,000 from 35 customer deposits for luxury cars to fund his online betting addiction. Harry Camilleri, 34, one of the company's highest earners, has been jailed for 10 months after handing himself in to police and admitting theft. The father-of-one had a large portfolio of prestige buyers and earned £65,000 in commission, on top of a £12,000 salary, at the showroom in Manchester city centre. But he squandered his earnings and ran up debts 'chasing the next big win' online betting, Manchester Crown Court heard. Judge Robert Brown refused a defence appeal to suspend Camilleri's sentence so he could start a new job and pay all the money back. Camilleri's systematic thefts went unnoticed for 18 months, until a customer paying for a car questioned why they had been given two separate account numbers by Camilleri in April this year. Confronted by bosses, 'highly trusted' Camilleri told them it was an honest mistake. But the following day he handed in his resignation, and bosses decided to launch an investigation. The day after, Camilleri handed himself in to police and revealed all, telling an officer, 'gambling is my illness'. He admitted deceiving customers into paying deposits into his own account. Camilleri would then transfer some, but not all the money into the company account. By the time he was arrested, he had stolen between £500 and £10,000 from 35 different customers' deposits. Neil Nehra, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was employed for nine years and was a well-respected salesman. He was described by the management team as one of the high performers of the company.' Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard how the father-of-one had a large portfolio of prestige buyers and earned £65,000 in commission, on top of a £12,000 salary, but squandered the cash chasing his 'next big win' Camilleri, of Blackpool, has since repaid £10,000 of the money, and had company payments withheld, bringing the balance of the money owed to £26,000. Adrian Palmer, defending, said: 'It's clear there's a long-standing difficulty with addiction to gambling, but he's a man who works extremely hard - a well-paid, well-respected man who has let himself and his family down.' Mr Palmer said Camilleri's relationship with the mother of his young daughter had broken down following the revelations, and so he had to move back in with his parents in Blackpool. He also said that Camilleri had banned himself from online betting accounts as he sought help for his addiction.

chatgpt: A top salesman at a showroom in Manchester has been jailed for 10 months after admitting to the theft of £45,000 from 35 different customers over an 18-month period. Harry Camilleri, 34, was known for his impressive sales record and ability to win over customers with his charm and wit. However, it was this very same charm that he used to lure customers into giving him their deposits, which he then pocketed for his personal use. Camilleri, a father-of-one, said that he was addicted to gambling and that he couldn't resist the temptation of using the deposits to fund his habit. He went on to say that he had initially believed he could win the money back but that things had quickly spiraled out of control. Eventually, he found himself in a position where he could no longer keep up with the demands of his habit and so he decided to come clean. The court heard that Camilleri had earned an annual salary of £12,000 plus £65,000 in commission from the showroom. He had been with the company for eight years and was highly regarded by his colleagues and customers. Judge Thomas Brown, who presided over the case, said that Camilleri's actions had caused significant harm to the customers whose deposits he had stolen. He described the theft as a "betrayal of trust" and said that it was made worse by the fact that Camilleri had been in a position of authority and had used his position to take advantage of vulnerable customers. "Your actions have caused significant financial damage to the people you stole from, many of whom were hardworking and saving for something important to them," said Judge Brown. "The fact that you were a highly respected member of the community only makes this betrayal of trust even more egregious." Camilleri's defense lawyer said that his client had shown genuine remorse for his actions and had taken full responsibility for what he had done. He went on to say that Camilleri had handed himself in and had been cooperative with the authorities throughout the investigation. In passing sentence, Judge Brown said that while he acknowledged Camilleri's remorse and cooperation, he could not overlook the seriousness of the offense. He said that a custodial sentence was necessary to reflect the gravity of the crime and to send a message to others who might be tempted to commit similar offenses. Camilleri will serve 10 months in prison and will be required to pay back the stolen money as part of his sentence. His future as a salesman and member of the community remains uncertain.
