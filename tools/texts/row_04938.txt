Displeasure boat: Grupinski was hired to repaint thew 193-foot super yacht owned by Google founder Larry Page . Grupinski claims he used the product in unventilated conditions under threat of termination and soon passed out below deck, where he was found  bleeding from the eyes, ears and anus. When asked to take him to the hospital, his boss, ID'd as Heidi from HF Interior--a company also named in the suit along with one called Modern Mud--then told him to 'drink some milk' and 'stop being a baby' according to the suit. Per court documents, Grupinski has suffered ever since from seizures, COPD, neurological problems and even early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

The yacht has plenty of room for entertaining with a big dining room table and ten bedroom suites . Grupinski is seeking unspecified damages in the personal injury suit. The massive pleasure boat, for which Page paid $5 million in 2011, first set sail in 1999. 'Senses Georgetown', as it's been dubbed, features a helipad, gym, multi-level sun decks, ten luxurious suites, a crew of 14 and interior design by famed French designer Philippe Starck. Page, who is worth an estimated $30 billion, bought the boat from New Zealand brewing heir Sir Douglas Meyer. Page's toy is actually dwarfed by those owned by other high-tech moguls, such as Paul Allen and Larry Ellison. Allen's 'Octopus' comes in at 415-ft in length, while Ellison's 'Rising Sun' is 454-ft long, with both costing more than $200m. The living room is bigger than many New York City apartments and features a projector for movie nights on the high seas .

chatgpt: James Grupinski, a painter who worked on a yacht owned by Google co-founder and billionaire Larry Page, has spoken out about the unsafe conditions he was allegedly forced to work in. Grupinski claims that he was denied safety equipment such as gloves, safety goggles, and a respirator, and was exposed to toxic chemicals while painting Page's 193-foot yacht. Grupinski worked on Page's yacht, called Senses, in 2018 and 2019. He says that during that time, he was not given any protective gear despite repeatedly asking for it. Grupinski told NBC News, "I didn't want to die for a boat," and that he "was worried about my health, and I was worried about my life." Toxic chemicals such as epoxy and isocyanates are commonly used in yacht painting, and they can cause serious health problems if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Grupinski claims that he suffered from headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms after working on Page's yacht. Grupinski also alleges that he was not given proper training on how to use the hazardous materials, and that he was told to work in areas without proper ventilation. Furthermore, Grupinski claims that he was instructed to sand areas that had just been painted, which created more dust and fumes. According to Grupinski, he tried to raise concerns about the unsafe working conditions to the contractor who hired him, but was ignored. He eventually quit the job after five months of working on the yacht. In response to the allegations, a spokesperson for Larry Page's family office said, "We take the safety of our contractors seriously and work diligently to ensure that all contractors working on our properties are properly trained and equipped to perform their work safely." The spokesperson added that Page's family office was not aware of any complaints about Grupinski's working conditions and that Page himself was not involved in the management or oversight of the yacht painting project. However, Grupinski's allegations are not unique in the yacht industry. A 2019 investigation by NBC News found that yacht workers are routinely exposed to hazardous materials without proper protective gear, and that many government agencies do not enforce safety regulations in the industry. Grupinski's story highlights the need for better oversight and regulation of the yacht industry to protect workers' health and safety. It also underscores the importance of workers speaking out about unsafe working conditions, even if they fear retaliation. As for Grupinski, he says he wants to raise awareness about the hazardous conditions many yacht workers face. "I'm not trying to hurt anyone," he said, "but I want people to understand how bad it can be and to make sure they protect themselves."
