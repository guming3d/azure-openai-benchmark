article: By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . If you dream of living beside the seaside, you’d better move fast because house prices are soaring. The average price of a home in a seaside town has been rising by nearly £500 a month for the last decade. Some of the most popular resorts have seen house prices double in that time. On average, a home by the sea now costs nearly £200,000, according to Halifax. In places such as exclusive Sandbanks in Dorset and Salcombe in Devon, the average is around £600,000. Craig McKinlay, mortgage director at Halifax, said: ‘Seaside towns provide a unique lifestyle opportunity and remain popular places for people to live. They also attract people looking for second homes or holiday properties which can place additional upward pressure on house prices.’ Salcombe, where the average home costs £615,344, is the most expensive place to live beside the seaside. The town is in Devon’s South Hams district, one of the country’s most popular second home hotspots. It is close to the mouth of the Kingsbridge Estuary, lies within an area of outstanding natural beauty and is loved for its unspoilt beaches and magnificent coastal walks.

Sandbanks, the so-called millionaires’ resort where a tatty bungalow can sell for more than £2million, comes second.

Aldeburgh is the only seaside resort in Suffolk to make it into the top ten most expensive seaside towns. Residents of the picturesque town, whose high street still has traditional sweet shops, recently fought a bitter battle against the opening of a new Tesco. The average seaside home costs £196,826, but many are a fraction of this and Mr McKinlay said: ‘Living near the seaside remains an achievable dream for many.’ To find an affordable place your best chance is to look north. Mr McKinlay said the ten cheapest seaside towns are all below £95,000, including Newbiggin-by-the-Sea in Northumberland (£83,769), Port Bannatyne (£85,605) and Girvan (£85,868). The latter two are in Scotland  which has eight of the ten cheapest seaside places. The annual Halifax report looks at house prices in 196 British seaside towns based on Land Registry and the Registrar of Scotland figures. It comes after an Office for National Statistics report found some English seaside resorts are among the most deprived places in the country, blighted by high unemployment and poor health. The investigation laid bare the crisis facing resorts such as Blackpool, Clacton, Ramsgate and Margate.

chatgpt: The dream of owning a home by the sea may be getting further out of reach for many, as the average price of a seaside property in the UK continues to climb. According to recent data from the Land Registry, the average price of a home by the sea has been rising by nearly £500 per month. In total, buying a house in a seaside resort now costs almost £200,000 on average. While this may be a significant sum, it pales in comparison to the prices seen in some of the UK's most popular coastal destinations. In places like Salcombe, Devon, the average cost of a seaside property is around £600,000, putting it out of reach for many. The reasons behind the increase in seaside property prices are numerous. For one, the UK's coastal regions are becoming increasingly popular as holiday destinations, as more and more people seek to escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. Additionally, many coastal areas have seen significant investment in recent years, with improvements in infrastructure and the creation of new attractions helping to boost local economies. However, the rise in property prices is not good news for everyone. For those who have long dreamed of owning a home by the sea, the escalating prices may make their dreams impossible to achieve. First-time buyers, in particular, are finding it harder and harder to get onto the property ladder, with many facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles when it comes to securing a mortgage for a seaside property. Despite this, the allure of the sea remains as potent as ever, with many people willing to pay the high prices in order to secure their own slice of coastal paradise. For those who do manage to buy a seaside property, the rewards can be significant, including stunning views, fresh sea air, and easy access to a range of watersports and other outdoor activities. However, it is worth noting that owning a seaside property also comes with its own set of challenges. Coastal erosion, flooding, and storms can all potentially cause significant damage, while ongoing maintenance costs can be higher due to the corrosive effects of saltwater. Despite these challenges, the draw of the sea is likely to continue to attract buyers for years to come, ensuring that seaside property prices remain high for the foreseeable future. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing depends on your perspective, but there is no denying that owning a home by the sea is becoming an increasingly exclusive perk that only the wealthy can afford.
