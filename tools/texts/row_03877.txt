article: Navy veteran who served on Arctic convoys takes on airline over 'insulting' £60 to carry military standard . A Second World War veteran, who accused a budget airline of insulting the memory of his fallen comrades, has won a battle over baggage. Royal Navy veteran Alec Penstone, 86, was charged £60 to take a ceremonial standard on a Flybe flight to attend Jersey's Liberation Day parade. The veteran branded the fee disgusting and pursued his fight with the budget airline until it conceded it was in the wrong and amended its policy. In his letter to management Mr Penstone said: 'Without my generation of men and women and what we fought for, your aircraft would be carrying the Nazi Swastika on the wings and tail fin.' Victorious: Mr Penstone was 'insulted' by the charge to take his standard on the flight . Two other veterans were forced to abandon their company standards at Exeter Airport because they could not afford the fee, heaped on top of normal baggage charges made by the airline. Outraged Mr Penstone took his fight to Flybe management, but was told by the . complaints department the cost was correct. Undaunted, he fought on and has now earned victory in the shape of a new Flybe policy on military regalia. Mr Penstone, 86, served with the Royal Navy as a submarine detector, protecting vital cargo ships crossing the Arctic and North Sea. Sky high charges: The airline has changed its policy after Mr Penstone's complaint . Almost 70 years on, he found himself locked in the battle over what he described as a disgusting attempt to charge him to fly with his 2.5kg, 4ft 6in Royal Naval Association standard to the Jersey memorial service. He said: 'I felt it was completely unjustified. 'I have taken the standard to Murmansk, America, Malta, Jersey and Australia to attend parades and memorials for the last 22 years, and have never been charged extra. 'I was not fighting for reimbursement, rather a change in company policy. I think to charge for something like this was disgusting and an insult.' Following the victory Mr Penstone said: 'This is fantastic news.' A Flybe spokesman said: 'The charge applied to Mr Penstone at the airport was correct and in line with Flybe policy for the carriage of non-standard items in the hold. 'However Flybe fully appreciates that such a valued oversize item of military regalia needs to be carried to special events and so would like to thank him for bringing this anomaly to its attention. 'As a result Flybe is amending its rules of carriage charges to in future allow one item of military regalia to be included within the 20kg baggage allowance. 'As a gesture of goodwill Flybe will be pleased to reimburse Mr Penstone with the £60 he was charged.'

chatgpt: A Navy veteran who served on the Arctic convoys during World War II has spoken out against an airline that reportedly charged him £60 to transport a military standard. The veteran, who served on British merchant vessels that delivered vital supplies to the Soviet Union during the war, called the airline's actions insulting. The veteran, who wished to remain anonymous, was reportedly flying with the airline from Bristol to Glasgow to attend a commemorative service for his fallen comrades. He had brought the standard, which bears the emblem of the British Merchant Navy, with him as a mark of respect. Upon arrival at the airport, the veteran was allegedly told by the airline that he would need to pay £60 to carry the standard on board as an extra piece of baggage. The airline cited its policies on oversized and overweight items, and reportedly told the veteran that he would need to pay the fee if he wanted to bring the standard with him. The veteran, who was said to be disappointed and angry at the airline's actions, refused to pay the fee and instead carried the standard onto the plane himself. Other passengers reportedly expressed their support for the veteran, with some even offering to hold the standard for him during the flight. News of the incident has sparked outrage among veterans’ groups and members of the public alike, with many taking to social media to express their anger at the airline's alleged actions. Some have called for a boycott of the airline until it apologizes to the veteran and changes its policies. The incident also highlights the ongoing debate over how veterans are treated and honored in modern society. Many argue that more needs to be done to recognize their sacrifices and contributions, and to ensure that they receive the support and respect they deserve. In response to the backlash, the airline released a statement saying that it was "sorry for any upset caused" and that it would be reviewing its policies regarding the transport of military standards. However, some have questioned whether the apology goes far enough, with many calling for the airline to donate the £60 fee to a veterans' charity or to the Royal British Legion. The incident is just the latest in a series of incidents involving airlines and veterans. In 2018, a US veteran was reportedly denied boarding on an American Airlines flight because his service dog was deemed too large. The incident sparked widespread outrage and led to calls for greater awareness and understanding of the needs of veterans and service animals. Overall, the incident involving the Navy veteran and the airline serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by veterans, both in terms of their treatment by society and the difficulties they experience when navigating bureaucracy and red tape. It is hoped that the incident will spark greater awareness and understanding of these issues, and that steps will be taken to ensure that veterans are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.
