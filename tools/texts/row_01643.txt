article: (CNN) -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report. Americans spend a little less time in traffic, a study shows, but drivers on I-110 in Los Angeles might not notice. Rising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation's largest university-based transportation research facility. "It's temporary, but real," said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. "As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There's fewer people going to work." The institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007. The organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by "every measure, congestion has increased substantially" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007. Researchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline. Congestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a "rare break in near-constant growth," the report said. Because the changes were nominal, most people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said. "Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice," Fette said. Among the report's other findings: . • American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler. • The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That's more than $750 per person. • The amount of wasted fuel, from sitting idle with the motor running, topped 2.8 billion gallons, or three weeks' worth of gas, for every traveler. Congestion has slowed but, said the report's authors, that means only that things are getting worse slower, "hardly a positive goal statement." The Urban Mobility Report database includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s. In every case, when the economy rebounded, so did the congestion problem, the report said. That means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up. Americans might then have fatter pocketbooks, but they'll go back to staring through their windshields a bit longer. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.

chatgpt: According to a new study released by the Transportation Institute, Americans spent one less hour stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did the previous year. This marked the first year since 1982 that the trend of increased traffic congestion had shown signs of slowing down. However, the authors of the report warn that this news should not be taken as a sign that the problem is completely under control. They note that while congestion levels may be decreasing, it is only happening at a slower rate, and those improvements could be easily lost if economic growth prompts more drivers to hit the road. "The drop in congestion we're seeing is really just an indication that things are getting worse slower," said Tim Lomax, a research fellow at the Transportation Institute, in an interview with CBS News. The study found that the decrease in traffic congestion in 2007 could be attributed to a number of factors, including high levels of joblessness and costly gas prices. When people are out of work, they are less likely to commute to their jobs, and when gas prices are high, people tend to drive less overall. However, the authors note that these factors are not sustainable in the long term, and that traffic congestion is likely to worsen once the economy begins to improve. "When things get better, more people will start driving again, and we'll see congestion levels rise once more," said Lomax. The study's findings are particularly relevant in light of recent debates over infrastructure spending and environmental policy. Many experts argue that the United States needs to invest heavily in new transportation infrastructure and public transit in order to address the growing problem of traffic congestion. Others point to the need for policies that encourage people to drive less, such as higher gas taxes and better urban planning. "The truth is that we need to pursue a multi-faceted approach to reducing traffic congestion," said Lomax. "We need to invest in new infrastructure and public transit, but we also need to look at ways to change people's behavior and get them to use their cars less." The study's findings are likely to be of interest to city planners and transportation officials across the country as they try to find ways to ease traffic congestion and reduce carbon emissions. The authors note that further research is needed to fully understand the complex factors that contribute to traffic congestion, and to determine which policies are most effective at reducing it. Overall, while the news that Americans spent one less hour stuck in traffic in 2007 is certainly welcome, it should be seen as just a small step in the right direction. Traffic congestion remains a major problem in the United States, with a staggering economic and environmental cost, and urgent action is needed if we are to effectively address it.
