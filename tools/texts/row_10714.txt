chatgpt: Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo was forced off the pitch just eight minutes into Wednesday's game against Villarreal. The early substitution sparked fears that the Portuguese forward could miss the Champions League final on May 26. However, reports indicate that Ronaldo has allayed concerns by returning to training. Ronaldo was seen holding his left leg during training on Tuesday, leading to speculation about his fitness. But his quick return to training on Thursday has given Real Madrid fans hope that he will be ready for the upcoming final against Liverpool. The Los Blancos' coach Zinedine Zidane was visibly disappointed with the early injury substitution. Real Madrid also had earlier been dealt with another injury blow of Welsh forward Gareth Bale. Bale had been ruled out of the match due to injury, leaving Real Madrid's attacking options seriously depleted. Despite the injury setbacks, Real Madrid managed to cruise to a 3-2 win over Villarreal thanks to goals from Gareth Bale's replacement, Lucas Vazquez, and two goals from the in-form French forward Karim Benzema. Real Madrid's victory against Villarreal was not only crucial for their confidence ahead of the Champions League final but also for their league position. The win moved Real Madrid up to third in the table, five points behind city rivals Atletico Madrid who are in second place. The return of Ronaldo to training has been a huge boost for Real Madrid. He has been the talisman for the team throughout the season, and his presence in the final will give Real Madrid a major advantage over Liverpool. Ronaldo has been in prolific form this season, scoring 15 goals in the Champions League alone. Real Madrid will face Liverpool in the Champions League final on May 26th in Kiev, Ukraine. Liverpool will be hoping to replicate their 2005 Champions League success against AC Milan in the final, while Real Madrid will want to lift the trophy for the third consecutive time. With Ronaldo's return to training, Real Madrid will be confident of achieving their goals in Kiev.
