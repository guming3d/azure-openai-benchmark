In her role as a police officer, the German is also thought to be planning to bring charges against the man. In one post on her official Facebook page, Friedrich, from Frankfurt, told her fans: 'I’ve been offended in the past, sexually harassed and I’ve had a stalker before. 'It’s time to act; it’s time to defend myself. And that’s what I’m doing. No more and no less.' Revealed: Friedrich outed her stalker by posted his personal details on her official Facebook page .

Friedrich's manager, Günter Eisinger, attempted to play down the incident amid concerns it could affect her preparations for London 2012. Mr Eisinger told The Local on Saturday: 'The issue has nothing to do with the public. 'We can do without any stress factors.'

chatgpt: German Olympic high jumper Ariane Friedrich has taken matters into her own hands after being repeatedly stalked by a man. In a bold move, she posted the stalker’s name, address and photo on her Facebook page, which has over 7,500 followers. Friedrich shared her frustration of being stalked for years, and how she has been let down by the authorities. The athlete revealed that she filed multiple police reports and even obtained a restraining order, but the stalking persisted.  Her post has sparked mixed reactions on social media, with many applauding her bravery while others criticising her for taking matters into her own hands. Friedrich hit back against the criticism in a subsequent post, stating that her decision was not easy but necessary. She felt that the authorities failed her and that she had to take action herself to protect herself and others from the stalker.  The post was later removed by Facebook for violating community standards. Friedrich received a warning from the social media giant that further violations could result in the deletion of her page. However, the athlete says she stands by her decision and will continue to fight for her safety.  Friedrich's actions have sparked a much-needed conversation about stalking and what victims can do to protect themselves. In Germany, stalking is punishable by up to three years in prison, and the country has laws to protect victims. However, the burden of proof is often on the victim, making it difficult to prosecute stalkers. Friedrich's actions are shining a light on the need for authorities to take stalking seriously and implement better measures to protect victims.  This incident is not the first time Friedrich has spoken out about issues facing women in sports. In 2017, she criticised the German Athletics Federation for failing to provide equal opportunities for female athletes. She has also been vocal about issues such as body shaming and the objectification of women in sports. Friedrich's bravery in speaking out on these issues has made her a role model for many young athletes.  In conclusion, Ariane Friedrich's decision to post her stalker's information on Facebook has sparked a conversation about stalking and the need for better measures to protect victims. While some may criticise her for taking matters into her own hands, Friedrich's actions demonstrate the frustration that many victims of stalking face. Her bravery in speaking out on this issue, and on other issues facing women in sports, has made her a role model for many athletes.
