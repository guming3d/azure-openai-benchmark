article: (CNET)  -- Google's Chrome browser continued to carve away share of worldwide browser usage from rivals in May, new statistics show. Chrome rose 0.3 percentage points to 7.1 percent of share, said Net Applications, which monitors browser usage on a network of Web sites. The statistics reflect activity, not the number of people using a browser, as people load up about 160 million pages each month on sites Net Applications monitors. Because Web usage is increasing, the absolute number of people using a browser can increase even as its fractional share of usage drops. The share losses came from Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which dropped 0.3 percent to 59.7 percent, and Mozilla's Firefox, which dropped 0.2 percentage points to 24.4 percent. Fourth-place Safari from Apple rose 0.1 percentage points to 4.8 percent, and Opera rose 0.1 percentage points to 2.4 percent. The browser market has become hotly competitive with new features being built in to support new Web standards. Even Microsoft, long considered a technology laggard even as its browser dominated, is back in the game with aggresive work developing IE9. Microsoft has been trying to rid the world of Internet Explorer 6, introduced in 2001 and now considered outmoded, slow, and insecure. Even though IE lost share overall, Microsoft can point to progress in upgrading: The various versions of IE8 accounted for 28.9 percent of usage. Meanwhile, another analytics firm, StatCounter, reported IE6 use had dropped below 5 percent in the United States and Europe and to 9.8 percent worldwide. "At these levels, Web developers now have valid justification not to support IE6 in the future," StatCounter Chief Executive Aodhan Cullen said in a statement. The company collected its data from 15 billion page views of Web pages in May. Net Applications also released statistics for iPad use, showing gradual gains since the Apple tablet's release. With the iPad now for sale internationally, usage peaked May 29 with 0.17 percent. Net Applications' data shows the iPad is relatively popular on the weekend. Use generally is lowest as a fraction of browsing on Monday, climbs gradually as the weekdays progress, than roughly doubles on the weekend days. The company also tracked mobile-phone browsing usage. Java ME, a mobile phone version of the technology from Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle, took the top spot with 40 percent of usage share. Next in line was iPhone OS with 32.8 percent, Symbian at 14 percent, Android at 6.2 percent, and BlackBerry at 3.6 percent. Â© 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

chatgpt: In the ever-evolving world of technology, one crucial consideration is the usage rates of popular web browsers. The latest statistics indicate that Google Chrome has made some impressive progress in increasing its share of global browser usage. In particular, Chrome's percentage of worldwide browser usage rose 0.3 percentage points to 7.1 percent. However, it is important to note that these statistics reflect activity, rather than the number of people using a browser. Nonetheless, this increase is a promising sign for Google's browser. While Chrome is on the rise, Microsoft has been working tirelessly to rid the world of its outdated browser, Internet Explorer 6. This browser, released in 2001, has become notorious for its lack of support for modern web standards and its vulnerability to security threats.  Microsoft's efforts to phase out Internet Explorer 6 began in 2009, but the browser remains in use today. In recent years, Microsoft has urged users to upgrade to newer versions of its browser or switch to third-party alternatives like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari. Microsoft's focus on upgrading its web browsing technologies is not limited to ridding the world of Internet Explorer 6. The tech giant has invested heavily in its new Edge browser, which is built on the same engine as Google Chrome. This marks a significant shift for Microsoft, as Edge replaces the once-dominant Internet Explorer as the default browser for Windows 10. In addition to increasing browser usage rates, Google has been working to improve the overall user experience of Chrome. The browser now includes various features such as the built-in password manager, ad blocker, and offline capabilities. These features have helped Chrome solidify its position as one of the top web browsers in the market. Furthermore, Google's emphasis on mobile technology has also contributed to Chrome's success. The browser is now available on almost all mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. In conclusion, the latest statistics indicate that Chrome has made some impressive gains in increasing its share of global browser usage. While Microsoft is working hard to rid the world of outdated browsers like Internet Explorer 6, Google is continuing to focus on improving the user experience of its popular web browser. As technology continues to advance, the battle for the top web browser will undoubtedly continue.
