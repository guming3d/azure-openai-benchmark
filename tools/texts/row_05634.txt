article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Andrew Breitbart, the conservative blogger whose posting of a sexually explicit photo of former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner led to the congressman's downfall, died of heart failure, the Los Angeles County Coroner said in an autopsy report released Friday. Breitbart, 43, died on March 1. The final cause of death was listed as heart failure, which was caused by Breitbart having an enlarged heart and some heart disease, said Chief Coroner Craig Harvey. Breitbart had a small amount of alcohol in his system, but no prescription or illicit drugs were detected. No significant trauma was present and foul play is not suspected. A full report is expected to be available within two weeks. Breitbart was the first to post Weiner's infamous Twitter photos last year, in which the married congressman appeared bare-chested and in his underpants in pictures sent to a woman online. Weiner eventually stepped down amid the scandal. Breitbart's regular appearances on FOX News, his websites and his speeches to conservative groups made him a star on the right and a villain to the left. Republican presidential candidates quickly responded to news of Breitbart's death last month. Former Sen. Rick Santorum called him a "powerful force" who was "constantly out there driving and pushing." "What a huge loss, in my opinion, to our country and certainly to the conservative movement," Santorum said. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tweeted: "Andrew Breitbart was the most innovative pioneer in conservative activist social media in America. He had great courage and creativity." And former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney called Breitbart a "brilliant entrepreneur, fearless conservative, loving husband and father." Breitbart was a driving force in the conservative tea party movement. In a posting on the Tea Party Nation website, blogger Judson Phillips wrote that Breitbart was an "amazing patriot" who "relished fighting those who would destroy this great country." Breitbart came under heavy criticism in 2010 for posting an edited and incomplete video of a speech by Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod, who is black, appearing to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance. She was forced to resign over the video. A full version of the speech showed that Sherrod had assisted the farmer. The department later offered her job back when it was clear she had been misrepresented. Breitbart also posted video of a sting operation against the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, which showed conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute seeking advice on how to set up a brothel. The video prompted a groundswell of action against the organization, including a limited investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and a slashing of funds from the federal government and several states. ACORN went bankrupt and closed its doors. Breitbart got his start helping to run the original right-wing online media behemoth the Drudge Report and helped launch The Huffington Post before founding his own websites. CNN's Stan Wilson contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Andrew Breitbart, a conservative political commentator renowned for his provocative media tactics and staunch support of President Donald Trump, died unexpectedly on March 1st, 2012, at the age of 43. According to an autopsy report, Breitbart’s passing was likely due to a combination of an enlarged heart and heart disease. Breitbart rose to prominence in the world of conservative media due in part to his role in exposing the so-called “Weinergate” scandal. In 2011, Breitbart posted photos on his website purportedly sent by former U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner to a young female supporter. The photos, which depicted Weiner in various stages of undress, sparked a flurry of media attention and ultimately led to Weiner’s resignation from the House of Representatives. Despite his advocacy of conservative causes and his close connections to notable figures on the right, Breitbart also became widely reviled by those on the left. Many condemned his willingness to employ what they perceived as unethical tactics in pursuit of his goals. As an example, Breitbart himself would often offer rewards to anyone who could produce evidence of liberal media bias or malfeasance. While Breitbart’s death may have come as a shock to many, it was not entirely without precedent. In fact, the right-wing figure had experienced serious health issues in the past. Some reports suggest that his ongoing struggles with chest pain led him to seek medical attention on a number of occasions. Nevertheless, his passing was widely mourned by his supporters and online allies, many of whom took to social media to express their condolences. Breitbart’s funeral took place in Los Angeles and was attended by a number of conservative politicians and media figures. Among them were former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, conservative commentator Glenn Beck, and then-Lieutenant Governor of California, Gavin Newsom. In the years following Breitbart’s death, his legacy has remained a point of contention in the world of conservative media. Some argue that his tactics and messaging have continued to influence the movement, while others feel that his legacy has been tarnished by his extreme partisan politics and overall lack of regard for the truth. One of Breitbart’s most notable legacies is the website that bears his name. Breitbart News has become a prominent platform for right-wing commentary and reporting, garnering significant attention for its coverage of issues like immigration, Islam, and feminism. Though the site has been accused of promoting fake news and engaging in questionable journalistic practices, it nevertheless retains a large following among many conservatives. Overall, Breitbart’s life and career were marked by controversy, polarizing opinions, and a commitment to brightening the light on the issues he felt were of utmost importance. While his death may have been unexpected, his impact and influence will long be remembered by those who knew him and those who followed his work.
