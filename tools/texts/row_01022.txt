chatgpt: West Ham United striker Andy Carroll has been ruled out of action for up to four months following an ankle injury. The 27-year-old has been receiving support from his girlfriend, Billi Mucklow, during his rehabilitation process. Carroll sustained the injury during West Ham's Europa League match against Astra Giurgiu last month. The Englishman has undergone surgery and is now looking to make a full recovery. According to sources close to the club, Mucklow has been a positive influence on Carroll's recovery. Hammers boss Sam Allardyce has previously praised Mucklow for the "great job" she has done in supporting the striker. Allardyce has highlighted Carroll's importance to the team and is hopeful that his return will give them a boost. The manager has also expressed his confidence in Carroll's ability to make a full recovery from the ankle injury. Carroll's absence has been felt by West Ham, as they have struggled to find a replacement for the powerful striker. The Hammers have scored only five goals in their four league games this season, with summer signing Enner Valencia yet to find the back of the net. The injury setback is a huge blow for Carroll, who has had a difficult time with injuries throughout his career. The former Newcastle and Liverpool striker has missed significant chunks of his career due to a range of injuries, including ankle problems. Carroll joined West Ham on a permanent deal from Liverpool in 2013, after initially impressing on loan. The striker has since struggled to maintain a consistent level of fitness, but has shown glimpses of his best form when fit. The injury is likely to rule Carroll out of West Ham's next Europa League fixture, with the Hammers looking to bounce back from their defeat against Astra in their opening game. West Ham will also be without midfielder Dimitri Payet, who is set to miss up to three months with an ankle injury of his own. The Frenchman has been one of the standout performers for the Hammers this season and his absence will be keenly felt by the team. Despite these setbacks, Allardyce will be hoping that his team can bounce back and produce a strong performance against Manchester City in their next league game. The Hammers face the defending champions at the Etihad on Saturday, with kick-off scheduled for 5:30pm.
