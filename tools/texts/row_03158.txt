article: Researchers found those with a spiritual understanding of life were more likely to suffer from mental illness . Being spiritual may give life deeper meaning, but it can also make you more susceptible to mental illness, new research suggests. A study found that people professing to be spiritual, but not conventionally religious, were more likely to suffer from a host of mental challenges. They suffered problems including abnormal eating conditions, drug abuse, anxiety disorder, phobias and neurosis. They were also more likely than others to be taking medication for mental health problems. Professor . Michael King, from University College London, and his fellow . researchers wrote in the British Journal of Psychiatry: 'Our main . finding is that people who had a spiritual understanding of life had . worse mental health than those with an understanding that was neither . religious nor spiritual.' The . study was based on a survey of 7,403 randomly selected men and women in . England who were questioned about their spiritual and religious . beliefs, and mental state. Of the participants, 35 per cent . described themselves as 'religious', meaning they attended a church, . mosque, synagogue or temple. The vast majority of this group were . Christian. A further 19 per cent claimed to have spiritual beliefs or experiences without following a specific religion, while 46 per cent were neither religious nor spiritual. More than nine out of 10 were white British, with an average age of 46. Of the different groups, spiritual people were 50 per cent more likely to have a generalised anxiety disorder and 72 per cent more likely to suffer from a phobia. Spirituality was also associated with a 40 per cent greater likelihood of receiving treatment with psychotropic drugs . They also had a 77 per cent higher chance of being dependent on drugs and were 37 per cent more at risk of neurotic disorder. Spirituality was also associated with a 40 per cent greater likelihood of receiving treatment with psychotropic drugs. Individuals of religious faith and those with none experienced equal levels of mental problems, the study found. But there were fewer problems with drugs or alcohol among the faithful. Unlike some American studies, the new research found no clear relationship between religious belief and happiness. One recent large internet study in the US reported that non-religious people with spiritual beliefs were emotionally less stable than other groups. However, they made up only 2 per cent of the study sample. The researchers wrote: 'We conclude that there is increasing evidence that people who profess spiritual beliefs in the absence of a religious framework are more vulnerable to mental disorder. 'The nature of this association needs greater examination in qualitative and in prospective quantitative research.'

chatgpt: Spiritual beliefs and practices have been the subject of both curiosity and debate for centuries. Now, researchers from University College London say there is a link between spirituality and mental healthcare issues. According to their findings, spiritual believers are more likely to suffer from eating disorders or anxiety disorders. While it’s not a new idea, it’s the first time that researchers have carried out a meta-analysis to investigate the link. The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, analysed almost 27,000 participants from 38 different studies, including clinical trials and population-based surveys. The study aimed to explore the potential relationship between spirituality and mental health in adults. The researchers found that people with spiritual beliefs were more likely to experience mental health issues. Specifically, spiritual believers were found to have a 50% increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder and a 20% higher risk of developing an eating disorder compared to their non-spiritual counterparts. The study’s lead author, Dr. Amy Bilderbeck, said that the findings suggest that specific aspects of spirituality may be detrimental to mental health. She suggests that this could be due to factors such as the pressure to live up to societal expectations or adherence to strict religious rules. “While many people find meaning and comfort in their faith or spiritual practice, it can come at a cost to their mental health,” says Dr. Bilderbeck. “We need to understand how and why spirituality might lead to poor mental health outcomes so that we can better support people who are struggling.” Despite these findings, the researchers say that their study does not suggest that spirituality is bad for mental health overall. Researchers say that more in-depth research is required to understand the complex relationship between spiritual beliefs and mental health. Professor Michael King, a co-author of the study, said the relationship is complex, but the findings suggest that people need to be aware of the potential impact of their beliefs on their mental health. He further stated that if people are struggling with their mental health, they should seek help from a professional rather than relying solely on their spiritual beliefs. The researchers also say that their study emphasises the importance of mental health professionals asking their patients about their spiritual beliefs as part of their assessment. They say that understanding a patient’s spirituality can help mental health professionals to provide more effective support. According to the World Health Organisation, one in four people worldwide is affected by mental illness. Despite this, there remains a stigma around mental health that can discourage people from seeking help. Researchers hope that studies such as this one will help to break down some of those barriers and encourage people to seek appropriate support. In conclusion, the study by researchers at University College London has found that people with spiritual beliefs are more likely to suffer from eating disorders and anxiety disorders. While the findings do not suggest that spirituality is altogether bad for mental health, they do highlight the importance of mental health professionals exploring the spiritual beliefs of their patients as part of their assessment. The ultimate goal is to ensure that people are aware of the potential impact of their beliefs on their mental health and encourage people to seek professional help if they are struggling.
