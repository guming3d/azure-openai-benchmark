Brendan Rodgers' decision to field a weakened team for Liverpool's Champions League clash against Real Madrid was not the unmitigated disaster many predicted. The Reds lost by a smaller margin than their 3-0 home defeat to the reigning champions - but Karim Benzema's match winning strike still leaves Liverpool's European hopes in the balance. Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman was at the Bernabeu to pick out a few points... Karim Benzema celebrates scoring the opening goal as Liverpool's defence appeal for offside . One of the few surprises was that Cristiano Ronaldo did not get on the scoresheet . GOING CHEAP . One of the advantages of having an enormous stadium is that you can afford to offer a few tickets at more affordable prices. So it was on Tuesday night that Madrid were still selling tickets for about Â£30 for this game right until kick-off. Mind you, those seeing Liverpool's team sheet may have asked for their money back.

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti gives Rodgers a sideways glance as managers watch from the sidelines . PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, STEVEN . In his interview with Sportsmail last week, Steven Gerrard talked dismissively of the way Jose Mourinho sent out a weakened team to try and frustrate Liverpool at Anfield towards the end of last season. 'For me, they just destroyed the game and broke it up,' said the Liverpool captain. It's hard not to wonder what he made of Brendan Rodgers' selection.

Interesting that amid all the team changes, goalkeeper Simon Mignolet kept his place.

chatgpt: In a highly anticipated Champions League clash, Liverpool suffered a 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid at the Bernabeu stadium. The match was expected to be an uphill battle for Brendan Rodgers' men, as they faced a formidable Madrid team that had a perfect winning record so far in the competition. However, the Reds put in a valiant effort, especially in the second half, and came close to equalizing on several occasions.  The match-winning goal came from the boot of Karim Benzema, who struck in the 27th minute with a crisp first-time shot. The French striker was a constant threat to Liverpool's defense throughout the game and proved to be the difference between the two sides. Despite the loss, Liverpool can take solace from the fact that they limited Madrid's attacking threat for the most part, with only a few nervy moments in defense. Rodgers decided to rest a number of key players for the game, including skipper Steven Gerrard and forward Raheem Sterling. The manager admitted that the decision was made with one eye on their upcoming Premier League fixture against Chelsea. The decision to rest these players gave an opportunity for others to step up, including Lazar Markovic, who was at the heart of Liverpool's best moves on the night. The Serbian came close to scoring on a couple of occasions and provided a creative outlet for Liverpool's attack. One player who didn't quite look up to the task was goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. The Belgian has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for some shaky performances, and his display against Madrid did little to alleviate those concerns. Mignolet looked far from convincing on the night, with several nervy moments in his handling and decision-making. The goalkeeper will need to improve his form if Liverpool is to have any chance of success this season. Despite the defeat, Liverpool can take heart from their second-half performance. The Reds came out with more intent after the break and created several opportunities to score. Substitute Rickie Lambert had a glorious chance to equalize late on, but his effort was saved by the Madrid goalkeeper. Liverpool fought until the final whistle, and their performance will give them confidence heading into their next fixture. The defeat leaves Liverpool third in their Champions League group, behind Madrid and Basel. The Reds will need to win their remaining fixtures and hope for favorable results elsewhere if they are to progress to the knockout stages. However, with performances like the one against Madrid, Liverpool can hold their heads up high and look forward to their next challenges in the competition.
