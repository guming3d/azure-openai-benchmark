chatgpt: Actress Skye McCole Bartusiak, best known for her roles in "The Patriot" and "24," passed away on July 19 in her Texas home at the young age of 21. The shocking news of her untimely death left fans and loved ones devastated, prompting an immediate investigation into the cause of her passing. Now, tests have revealed that Bartusiak died from a deadly combination of prescription drugs and an inhalable chemical, according to a statement from the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. The institute's report confirms that Bartusiak had taken the opiate hydrocodone, the muscle relaxer carisoprodol, and the highly-toxic refrigerant difluoroethane before her death. Investigators are still uncertain how Bartusiak came to take these drugs, which can be highly addictive and are often abused recreationally. However, Bartusiak's mother had previously suggested that her daughter may have had a seizure and choked while no one was around to help her. It is unknown whether the drugs played a role in Bartusiak's seizure, or whether they were taken intentionally or accidentally. Bartusiak had been acting since she was a child, and her early work included roles in "The Cider House Rules" and "Don't Say a Word." She also appeared on the hit TV shows "Lost" and "House M.D." However, it was her role as Mel Gibson's daughter in "The Patriot" that made her a household name. In the wake of Bartusiak's death, fans and fellow actors have taken to social media to express their condolences and remember her career. Actress Abigail Breslin, who co-starred with Bartusiak in the 2002 film "Signs," tweeted that Bartusiak was "a beautiful person and a talented actress." Meanwhile, actress Marlee Matlin, who worked with Bartusiak on a TV movie in 2001, described her as "a sweet, funny young woman with a huge heart." Bartusiak is survived by her parents, two sisters, and a brother. Her family has not yet commented on the report's findings. This tragic news serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of prescription drug abuse, as well as the importance of seeking medical attention in the event of a seizure or other medical emergency. As Bartusiak's death highlights, even seemingly innocent drugs can have deadly consequences when used improperly. Her fans and loved ones will undoubtedly remember her as a talented actress and a shining star, taken from the world far too soon.
