article: By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . After spending $184,000 on a new motor, most people would - at the very least - expect the car to have working doors. But if the model in question is the rarest Mini ever made - one of just of 15 and a personal favourite of the Queen - perhaps you could make an exception. The 1962 Austin Mini Beach Car, built without doors or side-pillars, fetched more than double its estimated value of $70,000 at Bonhams' Quail Lodge sale in California this week. Only 15 models of the Austin Mini Beach Car were made by British Motor Corporation in 1962 . The car, built without doors or side-pillars, was bought for $184,000 at Bonhams' Quail Lodge sale in California this week . The car, which has a tiny 849cc engine producing a modest 34bhp, was built 52 years ago by British Motor Corporation - with all but one being made as left-hand drives with the intention of being shipped over to the USA. The one right-hand drive that was produced was loaned to the Royal Family and it is thought that the Queen enjoyed driving the golf-buggy-like motor around Windsor Castle. At the time, the Daily Express wrote: 'The Queen, a knowledgeable motorist, doubtless enjoys travelling in this unconventional little vehicle as much as she does in her Rolls.' Despite being 52-years-old, the car has had just three owners since it was first shipped to San Francisco and has covered only 12,000 miles - an average of 4.4 miles per week. At $184,000, it is a world record price paid for a Mini at auction and 200 times what the original model cost back in 1962.

The car also cost the frivolous buyer $157,000 more than the cheapest Mini currently made by BMW is worth. David Swig, motorcar specialist at Bonhams, said: 'This powder blue, beach-going Mini - also known as the Riviera Buggy - is the rarest Mini variant. 'Built by hand, the car is a quirky, fun, early example from the iconic British Mini brand, perfect for beach lovers.'
