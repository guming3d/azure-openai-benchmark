article: At the tender age of five, surviving a tornado a mile wide is, at the least, traumatizing. Being separated from mom and dad after that, and living in a strange house, is enough to make a little boy break down and cry. Through the eyes of a dog, possessive of its owner, a stranger in the house screaming at a family member can look like a threat that must be dealt with. The two scenarios cruelly collided over the weekend when a 150-lb bull mastiff fatally mauled a 5-year-old boy, puncturing his head and neck. Lynn Geiling had taken the little boy into her Jessieville, Arkansas, home after he and his family survived a monster tornado that in May waylaid Moore, Oklahoma.  His parents had returned home, 200 miles away, to gather up the pieces of their lives. Sunday, something upset the child and he threw a temper tantrum, the country sheriff's office said. Geiling went over to calm him, but the screaming upset another family member -- Geiling's dog. The dog probably thought the boy was attacking its owner, said Garland County Deputy Scott Hinojosa. It lunged for him. Geiling fought to unlock the dog's jaws from around the boy while calling to her husband for help, the sheriff's office said. She pried the dog loose, but the damage was done. The couple rushed the bleeding boy to meet an ambulance, which took him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Authorities did not release his name. The dog ran away but was later captured.  No charges have been filed against Geiling, Hinojosa said. "I am just really sorry that this happened in Garland County to people who have undergone such tragedy. It makes your heart bleed for them," Garland County Justice of the Peace Mary Bournival told CNN affiliate KATV. She was close to tears. As justice of the peace, she has seen too many maulings by dogs. She keeps a collection of gruesome photos of people with flesh torn away from their arms, legs and faces by "bully" breeds, as she calls them. "I would say just in the last two months we've had at least seven attacks involving these dogs," she said. Her county has some of the most relaxed laws in the state, she said. "We don't even have a simple leash law." She wants that to change. But that would be too little too late for the little boy and his family. List of the May 31 storm fatalities in Oklahoma .

chatgpt: In an unfortunate incident, a young boy was tragically mauled by a bull mastiff while staying with friends in Arkansas. The family of the boy had been in the process of rebuilding their lives after being affected by the devastating Moore, Oklahoma twister. The boy had been staying with his host family when the incident occurred. Lynn Geiling, owner of the bull mastiff, had tried desperately to pull the dog away from the boy but was unable to do so in time to prevent further harm. Although it is unclear at this time what provoked the attack, it serves as a devastating reminder of the potential dangers that can come along with dog ownership. It is important for all pet owners to take precautions to ensure the safety of both their pets and others around them. The boy was rushed to the hospital for emergency medical treatment and is currently recovering from his injuries. His family has expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support they have received from the community during this difficult time. In response to the incident, Lynn Geiling has expressed deep remorse for what has occurred and has made sure to take full responsibility for her dog's actions. She has vowed to work closely with authorities to investigate the incident and take measures to prevent something like this from happening again in the future. The issue of dog attacks is not a new one, and it has become increasingly important for both pet owners and non-pet owners alike to be aware of the risks. Some cities and towns have implemented breed-specific legislation that aims to restrict ownership of potentially dangerous breeds, while others have enacted community education programs to raise awareness of responsible pet ownership. Regardless of what measures are put into place, it is essential that pet owners take responsibility for the actions of their animals and do everything in their power to ensure the safety of their pets and those around them. With continued education and awareness, we can all work together to prevent incidents like this from happening in the future. As for the young boy who was mauled, our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time. We hope for a speedy and full recovery.
