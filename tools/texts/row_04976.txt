Diana and George Beckwith claim that Phyllis Blakesley continued to torment them despite being issued with a 5-year ASBO in 2008 . A pensioner is behind bars after breaching a restraining order by continuing her hate campaign against her neighbours - from 350 miles away. Former tearoom owner Phyllis Blakesley, 79, continued an abuse campaign against former neighbours Diana and George Beckwith despite being issued with a restraining order. Mrs Blakesley was slapped with a five-year ASBO and banned from going within 200 metres of the couple's Cumbria home in 2008. But she continued her hate campaign from her new home in Bognor Regis, West Sussex by bombarding the pair with scores of threatening letters,. Worthing Magistrates Court heard how the former nurse had sent more than 30 letters since February alone, branding the Beckwiths as drug dealers and thieves. Blakesley admitted sending the letters between August and October last year but denied she had an ASBO, claiming her signature on the document was forged. She told magistrates: 'It's all corrupt. No document is authentic. 'They were all in cahoots. It's a malicious prosecution.' Mrs Blakesley claimed the Beckwiths had led a 'witch hunt' to force her out of Cumbria after her court appearance there in 2008. But Melanie Wootten, prosecuting, said there was no evidence the document was forged - an opinion shared by the magistrates. The court heard how Mrs Blakesley, who has nine convictions for 29 offences, was given the ASBO after she breached a series of restraining orders. The orders were given for sending the Beckwiths letters, squirting them with a hose, attacking their cattle with a broom, sabotaging farm machinery and sawing part of a fence. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Beckwith said she had been left 'distressed and humiliated' by Blakesley's abuse. She said: 'We have suffered harassment for 15 years. She is so abusive. I've felt let down and helpless. 'She is very disturbed, bitter and angry. She has a total disregard for her victims.' Mrs Blakesley admitted sending the letters between August and October last year but denied she had an ASBO, claiming her signature on the document was forged . Doctors previously diagnosed Blakesley with a paranoid personality disorder, which left her with a tendency to be suspicious of other people. She suffered paranoid and irrational delusions, leaving her with conspiracy theories about her neighbours, the local council, the justice system and Freemasons. Mrs Blakesley originally fell out with the Beckwiths over access rights through a gate at her home in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, which she bought from the couple. At an earlier hearing, Blakesley was jailed for calling the judge a "b******". Meanwhile the grnadmother-of-11 said she would go on hunger strike if sent to prison. She was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on April 16.

chatgpt: A pensioner who breached a restraining order was brought before the court for allegations of verbal abuse towards her neighbours in Kidderminster. Norma Blakesley, aged 78, was found guilty of harassing and verbally abusing her former neighbours after a dispute over gate access rights in August last year. The court had previously issued a restraining order against her in October 2019. Prosecutor, Mr. Michael Davies, informed the court that the defendant had a "history" with her neighbours, which escalated into verbal abuse and harassment. According to Mr. Davies, the situation started over a disagreement concerning the gate access rights at Mrs. Blakesley's former home. The court heard that Mrs. Blakesley had accused her neighbours of being thieves and drug dealers. She also called them insulting names and hurled a string of profanities towards them. The defendant had a previous history of breaking the restraining order in which she was prohibited from contacting her two neighbours or entering her former home. Mrs. Blakesley was found guilty of breaching the order in October 2019, where she showed no remorse for her actions. Mrs. Blakesley represented herself during the hearing and denied any wrongdoing. She maintained that her actions were justified, and that she had not done anything wrong. The judge presiding over the case reminded Mrs. Blakesley that she had been warned previously and had received the restraining order for a reason. He went on to say that harassing and verbally abusing neighbours was unacceptable and that the court would not tolerate such behaviour. The judge sentenced Mrs. Blakesley to three months in prison, suspended for 12 months. She was also ordered to abide by an indefinite restraining order, which forbids her from contacting her former neighbours or entering her former home. Additionally, Mrs. Blakesley was instructed to pay a fine of £300 and £200 in costs. In conclusion, Mrs. Blakesley's behaviour towards her neighbours was deemed unacceptable by the court. Despite being issued a restraining order in October 2019, she continued to verbally abuse and harass her former neighbours. The judge's decision to sentence her to three months in jail, suspended for 12 months, shows that such behaviour will not be tolerated. It is hoped that Mrs. Blakesley will abide by the indefinite restraining order and avoid contact with her former neighbours to ensure a peaceful coexistence.
