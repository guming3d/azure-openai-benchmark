chatgpt: Tragedy struck the Grand Forks Rail yard in North Dakota in the early hours of July 14, 2019. Ben Ayling, a 20-year-old student, who had just attended a college party with his friends, died when he got his arm tangled in a train and bled to death. The parents of Ben Ayling, Corey and Robin, are now suing the BNSF Railways and Pi Kappa fraternity, claiming that the alcohol served on the premises contributed to their son's death. The lawsuit also alleges that the rail company did not have adequate warnings in the rail yard, making it unsafe for pedestrians. An autopsy report revealed that Ben was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. He had a blood alcohol content of 0.24%, three times the legal limit for driving. According to court documents, Ben and a group of friends had attended a party at the Pi Kappa fraternity house on the night of the incident. After the party, they decided to walk home and crossed the Grand Forks Rail yard, which was a shorter route. It was during the crossing that Ben's arm got tangled in a passing train, and he was dragged for several feet. His friends tried to free him, but by the time the train came to a stop, they discovered that Ben was bleeding profusely from his arm. Emergency services were called, but unfortunately, Ben had lost too much blood and was declared dead at the scene. The Ayling family argues that both the train company and the fraternity were responsible for their son's death. They are seeking compensation for their loss and have asked for a trial by jury. "Both parties could have taken the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of my son and other pedestrians in the area. They failed, and as a result, my son died a tragic and preventable death," said Corey Ayling, Ben's father. The lawsuit alleges that the rail company should have had signs and signals warning pedestrians of the dangers of crossing the rail yard. The Pi Kappa fraternity is accused of serving alcohol to underage students, leading to Ben's intoxication. BNSF Railway has declined to comment on the pending lawsuit, and Pi Kappa fraternity has yet to issue a statement. The Aylings have lost their son under tragic circumstances, and they hope that their lawsuit will be a wake-up call to others who may overlook safety protocols. Their loss is a reminder of the potential dangers when walking near railways, particularly when under the influence of alcohol. Ben Ayling's family and friends will always hold him close in their hearts as they mourn his passing.
