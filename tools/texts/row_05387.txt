article: (CNN) -- A weekend killing in Australia has prompted the Indian government to issue an advisory for its college students studying in that country. "While the majority of Indian students studying in Australia, especially those enrolled in universities and reputable institutions, have a positive experience of living and studying in Australia, the number of such incidents of assault as well as of robbery has been on the rise in recent months, which has affected not only Indian students but also members of the larger Indian community in Australia," said a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs. Nitin Garg, 21, was stabbed to death Saturday night in Melbourne as he walked to work from a train station through a public park. Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard dismissed the notion that Australia is a unsafe for international students. "Australia is a very safe country. By world standards, we have a very low homicide rate," Gillard said Wednesday. "In big cities around the world, we do see acts of violence from time to time; that happens in Melbourne, it happens in Mumbai, it happens in New York, it happens in London." Despite the assurances from the Australian government, India has issued a list of basic precautions its students should take while studying on the continent: . • Do not travel alone late; . • When traveling alone, make sure that you have checked out your route carefully and that you keep to well-lighted, populated areas; . • Make sure that someone knows where you are going and when you are expected to return; . • Don't carry too much cash. Do not make it obvious that you're carrying expensive items, such as iPods or laptops. Australia has seemed increasingly less safe for Indian students over the past year. During a one-month period over the summer, at least 10 Indian students were attacked. The most severe case left an Indian student in a coma; another student was stabbed in the stomach. More than a dozen arrests were made. Australian authorities said at the time that they didn't think the attacks and robberies were racially motivated but were instead crimes of opportunity against soft targets: students who typically travel alone at night on public transportation. But hundreds of Indian students saw it differently. During the summer, they reacted with protests in at least three Australian cities. Police said at one point that Indian students had decided to take the law in their own hands and retaliate, which was condemned in India and Australia. Australia has a lot riding on its reputation as a destination for international students. It has an estimated $12.6 billion-a-year education export industry. More than 90,000 students from India study in Australia. CNN's Ed Payne and Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The Indian Government has issued an advisory to its students studying in Australia following the tragic weekend killing of an Indian man in Melbourne. Nitin Garg, a 21-year-old accounting graduate, was stabbed to death as he walked to work through a public park. It is not the first time Indian students have faced violence in Australia, and there has been public outcry both in India and Australia. The Australian authorities have previously denied that the attacks were racially motivated, however, the Indian government has taken this latest attack seriously. The Advisory, issued by the Indian Government, lists basic precautions that Indian students should take while studying in Australia. Among the recommendations are avoiding lonely places, carrying a personal alarm, reporting any suspicious activity to the authorities, and not carrying large amounts of cash on them. The advisory comes as a shock to many Indian students currently studying in Australia. Many have expressed fear and concern about their safety. Some have even considered quitting their studies and returning to India. The Australian authorities have condemned the attack, and the Victorian Police Department has launched an investigation into the murder. Detectives have already interviewed a number of witnesses and are confident they will make an arrest soon. The investigation is ongoing, and any information from the public is appreciated. The Australian government has also been working to improve the safety of Indian students studying in Australia. New measures have been introduced to crack down on crime in certain areas, and police patrols have been increased in areas with high populations of Indian students. Despite these measures, the Indian community in Australia feels that more needs to be done. They believe that the Australian Government needs to take a firm stance and acknowledge that these attacks are racially motivated. Without such an admission, they fear that the problem will continue to escalate. The Indian government has also called on the Australian Government to take action to ensure the safety of Indian students studying in Australia. India's External Affairs Minister, SM Krishna, has previously expressed his concern over violence against Indian students and has called on the Australian Government to take strict action. The death of Nitin Garg has highlighted the issue of violence against Indian students in Australia, and it is clear that the issue needs to be addressed. It is not only Indian students who are being targeted, but students from other countries as well. It is important that the Australian Government takes this issue seriously and works to improve the safety of all students studying in Australia. In the meantime, Indian students studying in Australia are advised to take the necessary precautions to ensure their own safety. The advisory issued by the Indian Government should be taken seriously, and all students should follow the guidelines set out in the document.
