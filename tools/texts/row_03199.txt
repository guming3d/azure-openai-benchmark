article: BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- For the war-beaten orphans of the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, this big old shoe fits. A monument to a shoe thrown at former President Bush is unveiled at the Tikrit Orphanage complex. A huge sculpture of the footwear hurled at President Bush in December during a trip to Iraq has been unveiled in a ceremony at the Tikrit Orphanage complex. Assisted by children at the home, sculptor Laith al-Amiri erected a brown replica of one of the shoes hurled at Bush and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki by journalist Muntadhir al-Zaidi during a press conference in Baghdad. Al-Zaidi was jailed for his actions, and a trial is pending. But his angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world. He is regarded by many people as a hero. Demonstrators in December took to the streets in the Arab world and called for his release. The shoe monument, made of fiberglass and coated with copper, consists of the shoe and a concrete base. The entire monument is 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) high. The shoe is 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) long and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) wide. The orphans helped al-Amiri build the $5,000 structure -- unveiled Tuesday -- in 15 days, said Faten Abdulqader al-Naseri, the orphanage director. "Those orphans who helped the sculptor in building this monument were the victims of Bush's war," al-Naseri said. "The shoe monument is a gift to the next generation to remember the heroic action by the journalist." "When the next generation sees the shoe monument, they will ask their parents about it," al-Naseri said. "Then their parents will start talking about the hero Muntadhir al-Zaidi, who threw his shoe at George W. Bush during his unannounced farewell visit." Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi leader toppled by the United States in 2003, was from the Tikrit region. Al-Zaidi marked his 30th birthday in jail earlier this month. One of his brothers said he is "in good health and is being treated well." Al-Zaidi's employer, TV network al-Baghdadia, keeps a picture of him at the top left side of the screen with a calendar showing the number of days he has spent in detention. The network has been calling for his release. By tradition, throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the Arab world. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A fiberglass and copper sculpture of a shoe, which was famously thrown at former President George W. Bush during a 2008 visit to Iraq, has been unveiled at an orphanage in Tikrit, Iraq. The 8-foot-tall monument was created with the help of local orphans who worked alongside artist, Laith Al-Amiri, to build the $5,000 sculpture. The shoe-throwing incident occurred during a press conference at the prime minister's palace in Baghdad. The Iraqi journalist who threw the shoe, Muntadhar al-Zaidi, was quickly subdued and jailed for his actions. However, the shoe-throwing incident quickly became a global symbol of the resentment felt by some Iraqis toward the United States and George W. Bush. The director of the orphanage, Faten Ahmed, said that the monument was a gift to the next generation so they would remember the heroic action of al-Zaidi. Ahmed said that the orphans who helped build the shoe "were the victims of Bush's war," and that the sculpture was a way to honor their sacrifice. The sculpture was unveiled at the orphans' home in a ceremony attended by local officials and members of the media. The shoe was hoisted up and placed on a pedestal in the courtyard of the orphanage, where it will be on permanent display. Al-Amiri, the artist who created the sculpture, said that he was inspired to make the monument as a way of expressing his feelings about the war and the sacrifices made by ordinary Iraqis. He said that he was particularly moved by the involvement of the orphaned children in the project, who worked tirelessly to help him complete the sculpture. The shoe-throwing incident is just one example of how the war in Iraq has had a lasting impact on the country and its people. The monument in Tikrit is a powerful symbol of that legacy, a reminder of the sacrifices made by Iraqis during the conflict. As for al-Zaidi, he has since been released from prison and has become something of a folk hero in some circles in Iraq. The incident has also spawned a number of copycat shoe-throwing incidents around the world, as a way of protesting against political leaders and their policies. But for the orphans of Tikrit, the shoe sculpture is a way of honoring their own sacrifices and the sacrifices of those who came before them. It is a beautiful monument, and one that will surely be cherished for generations to come.
