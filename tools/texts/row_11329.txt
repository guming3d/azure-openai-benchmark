article: (CNN) -- The mother of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman filed a civil lawsuit against the boy's stepmother Friday, alleging she is responsible for his disappearance and demanding she reveal his whereabouts. The suit also seeks damages of $10 million. "I hope that I am wrong, but I fear that he is gone forever," said Kyron's mother, Desiree Young. Her son was last seen on June 4, 2010, inside his Oregon elementary school. His stepmother, Terri Horman, told police that she'd dropped off the boy that morning at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. Mystery, pain linger after Oregon boy went missing . "I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is. I believe that Terri Horman is responsible for where my son is. The time has come for Terri to take responsibility for what she has done and to tell me and my family where Kyron is and how he got there," said Young, struggling to speak through tears. Any money recovered through the suit will go toward helping families and parents of other missing children, she said. Since Kyron's disappearance, most of the speculation has focused on the boy's stepmother. Parents plea for Kyle Horman . In August 2010, investigators solicited the public's help for information about the location of the white pickup truck that she is believed to have driven the morning of then-7-year-old Kyron's disappearance. And in divorce filings, the boy's father, Kaine Horman, said he believes his estranged wife, Terri Horman, "is involved" in the boy's disappearance. Court documents also allege Terri Horman tried to hire a man to kill her husband. Searching with dread for missing children . Still, no charges have been filed against anyone in the case, nor has anyone officially been named as a suspect -- including Terri Horman. On Friday, Horman's attorney released a statement, declining to comment on the suit. "Until such time as I have had an opportunity to thoroughly review the complaint, I will not be making any public statement with respect to this matter," Stephen Houze said in a statement. The civil suit was filed when it was because there is a two-year statute of limitations on such claims, said Young's lawyer Elden Rosenthal. There is no such statute for a murder charge in the criminal justice system, he said, stressing his client's belief that criminal charges will eventually be filed against Horman. "Until I can bring Kyron home, I will not rest. It's time for there to be answers," said Young.

chatgpt: A $10 million lawsuit has been filed against Kyron Horman's stepmother, Terri Horman, alleging that she was responsible for the disappearance of the young boy. Kyron was last seen on June 4, 2010, and Monday will mark two years since his disappearance. In the lawsuit, Kyron's mother, Desiree Young, claims that Terri Horman had "opportunity, motive, and intent" to harm the boy. The suit also accuses Terri Horman of obstructing the investigation into Kyron's disappearance. Desiree Young spoke out about the lawsuit, saying that "it's time for there to be answers" and the legal action was necessary to hold those responsible accountable. She expressed her hope that the lawsuit will bring new evidence to light. Kyron's disappearance sparked a massive search effort involving local law enforcement, the FBI, and volunteer teams from across the country. Despite this, the young boy was never found. In the years since Kyron's disappearance, Terri Horman has come under intense scrutiny. She was the last person to see Kyron before he vanished and has been widely criticized for her behavior in the days and weeks after his disappearance. Though Terri Horman has never been charged in connection to Kyron's disappearance, the lawsuit filed by Young casts a shadow of suspicion over her. If the claims in the lawsuit are proven true, Terri Horman could face serious legal consequences. The $10 million in damages sought by Young may seem like a staggering amount, but it's important to remember just how tragic Kyron's disappearance was. For more than two years, his family has been living without answers, not knowing what happened to their beloved son and brother. If the lawsuit succeeds in exposing new evidence or bringing attention to existing evidence, it could be a major step forward in the search for justice for Kyron. While his disappearance will never be anything other than a heartbreak, the lawsuit filed against Terri Horman offers hope that those responsible for what happened to him will be held accountable.
