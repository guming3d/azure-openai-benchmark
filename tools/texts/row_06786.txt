Drinking alcohol in moderation could slash the risk of rheumatoid arthritis, according to new research. Some regular drinkers were nearly half as likely to develop the crippling condition as teetotallers or those who rarely drank. Researchers discovered the connection after carrying out an extensive review of previous studies that looked into the role of alcohol and rheumatoid arthritis. The results, published in the journal Rheumatology, suggest a few drinks a week could have a protective effect against a disease that affects around 600,000 people in the UK. Although the latest investigation did not look at the reasons why a regular tipple might offer some protection, earlier research suggested it could be because alcohol appears to dampen down inflammation in the body and also has a mild pain-killing effect. Rheumatoid arthritis is triggered when the immune system, the body's in-built defence mechanism, goes into action unnecessarily, attacking joints and sometimes other parts of the body. The reasons why remain a mystery but some evidence suggests exposure to mild infection may be enough to launch this over-reaction. As a result, joints become inflamed and swollen, causing pain or stiffness, and many sufferers also experience flu-like symptoms. In very severe cases, they can end up crippled and unable to live a full or active life. Several small studies in recent years . have hinted that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol could reduce the . risks of developing the incurable condition.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a crippling condition that causes extreme pain and in some cases deformity . Now researchers from King's College London have carried out a meta-analysis, where data from earlier investigations are pooled to provide a more definitive answer. They gathered findings from nine different studies involving a total of nearly 12,000 patients. When they combined all the results they found that regular drinkers were 48 per cent less likely to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the benefits were confined to patients who tested positive for anti-citrulllinated protein antibodies. These are proteins that are released into the bloodstream when the disease in emerging and can often be detected before any symptoms appear. They affect around two-thirds of arthritis sufferers and their presence indicates a more severe form of the disease. Patients who tested negative for the protein, which suggests they have a milder form of the disease, saw little or no benefit from regular drinking. In a report on their findings the researchers said: 'Alcohol intake is inversely associated with ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a protective effect. 'But further research is needed to confirm this relationship.'

chatgpt: Britain's health authorities have announced a surprising finding that may lead to a shift in the way people think about alcohol. The review of studies has found that alcohol, when consumed in moderation, may help to protect against the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, a debilitating disease that affects over 600,000 people in the UK. Despite the fact that alcohol is often viewed as a negative influence on health, experts believe that it could actually have a positive impact in some cases. The review found that alcohol appears to have both anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects that could help to reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. The study analyzed data from a range of sources including previous research studies, NHS data and scientific publications. The findings showed that moderate alcohol consumption may have a protective effect against the disease by reducing the body's immune response. The research was conducted by a team of scientists and health professionals including experts from the Arthritis Research UK charity, as well as medical practitioners and academics. The team found that people who consumed moderate amounts of alcohol had a lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis than those who did not drink at all. Although the study's findings may seem surprising, they are consistent with previous research that has suggested a connection between moderate alcohol consumption and a lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the positive findings, experts are keen to emphasize that alcohol should not be recommended as a treatment for the disease. The review suggests that alcohol can only be consumed safely in moderation and that excessive drinking could actually increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. The charity Arthritis Research UK has welcomed the findings of the review, saying that they could provide important information for people who are trying to manage the disease. The charity has also called for further research into alcohol consumption and its impact on rheumatoid arthritis. The findings of this study could represent an important shift in the way that people view alcohol and its potential health benefits. While alcohol is often seen as a negative influence on health, the findings suggest that moderate consumption could have positive effects in some cases. However, experts are quick to point out that alcohol should always be consumed in moderation and that people who are concerned about their health should always seek advice from a qualified medical professional before making any changes to their lifestyle.
