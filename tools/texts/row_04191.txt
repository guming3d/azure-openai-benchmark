article: (CNN) -- The exhumation of three bodies from a Florentine crypt may have brought Italian researchers a step closer to confirming the identity of the woman believed to be the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's famous "Mona Lisa" painting, also known as "La Gioconda." "La Gioconda" refers to Lisa Gherardini, the second wife of a Florentine silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. The remains of del Giocondo, his son by Gherardini -- Piero -- and Gherardini's stepson Bartolomeo have been uncovered in their family crypt, the authority of Florence has announced. A team led by Silvano Vinceti accessed the remains beneath the Chapel of the Holy Martyrs, in Florence on August 6, it said in a statement. Last year, Vinceti's team exhumed the remains of eight women from the ruins of a Franciscan convent in Florence where old city records said Gherardini had been buried. A laboratory at the University of Bologna had established that three of the skeletons at the St. Ursula convent were consistent with the age at which Gherardini had died, the statement said. Further carbon testing to establish which of those skeletons dated from the 16th century -- when Gherardini died -- was being carried out at the University of Salento, it quoted Vinceti as saying. If DNA taken from the del Giocondo family remains matched one of the skeletons found in the convent ruins, the skeleton could be confirmed as Gherardini's, he said. Scientists could then reconstruct Gherardini's face and compare it to da Vinci's mysterious portrait. Talking to CNN's Ben Wedeman when the convent skeletons were found last year, Vinceti said the reconstruction would have a margin of error of just 2 to 8% -- once researchers factored in that Gherardini had probably been in her early 20s when she posed for da Vinci.

Vinceti told Wedeman he was certain that da Vinci had been commissioned to paint a portrait of Gherardini but could not be sure that the "Mona Lisa" was of her, or just contained some of her features. For starters, the famous smile was not Gherardini's, he said. Analysis of the "Mona Lisa" had shown that "when Leonardo began painting the model in front of him, he did not draw that metaphysical, ironic, poignant, elusive smile, but rather he painted a person who was dark and depressed." A reconstruction would finally answer the question art historians had been unable to resolve, Vinceti said: "Who was the model for Leonardo?" Read more: Da Vinci's lost masterpiece may be found .

chatgpt: Researchers in Florence, Italy have made a fascinating discovery, uncovering the remains of relatives of the woman thought to be the model for the world-renowned Mona Lisa painting. The findings hold enormous significance and could even bring us closer to uncovering the true identity of the woman who has long been shrouded in mystery. According to reports, researchers are planning to check the DNA of the newly discovered remains against that of a skeleton found at the site where the woman thought to be the "Mona Lisa" model was buried. If the DNA matches, they will reconstruct the skeleton's face and compare it to the painting. Many theories have circulated over the years about who the woman depicted in the painting could be, with some suggesting that she may have been Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy merchant living in Florence in the 16th century. To date, none of these theories have been definitively proven, but the discovery of these remains adds another layer to the mystery. The researchers involved in the project are hoping that the DNA comparison will not only help to identify the model, but also shed light on her life and the era in which she lived. It is not yet clear how long the DNA testing and facial reconstruction process will take, but many believe that the results could be groundbreaking. The discovery of the remains was not entirely unexpected. In 2019, researchers excavated a convent in Florence where it was believed that Lisa Gherardini may have been buried. They uncovered a skeleton that was consistent with the right age and social status of the woman thought to be the "Mona Lisa" model. However, since there was no known DNA from her living descendants, the identity of the skeleton remained unknown. The discovery of the additional remains, however, could be a game-changer, providing the missing link necessary to match the DNA of the mysterious skeleton to a known living relative. The Mona Lisa remains an enigma to this day, and the prospect of uncovering the true identity of the woman behind the portrait has captured the imagination of art enthusiasts and historians alike. While the mystery may never be completely solved, the discovery of these remains offers a tantalizing opportunity to move closer to the truth. For now, researchers will continue their work with the utmost care, knowing that they hold in their hands not only the key to unlocking a centuries-old secret, but also the remains of an individual who lived and died in a time long past. As they move forward, their eyes will be trained on a woman who has captivated the world for generations, and who, with this discovery, may reveal more of her secrets yet.
