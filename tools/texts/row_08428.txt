article: London (CNN) -- A study for Paul Cezanne's master work "The Card Players," missing for decades, has been rediscovered among the paintings of a Texas art collector, and looks set to sell for more than $15 million when it goes under the hammer later this year. The watercolor, one of the preparatory sketches for Cezanne's five painting series, was only known from a black and white photograph, having last been seen in public in 1953, and was presumed lost. But the immaculately preserved work was found earlier this year in the collection of Texas medical expert and art collector Dr. Heinz F. Eichenwald, and will be sold at Christie's in New York on May 1. The auction house predicts a great deal of interest from collectors in the piece, which is expected to fetch between $15 and $20 million. "For a full-size study from this series to come to light now, when it was feared to have been lost to history by scholars and collectors alike, marks a pivotal moment in the art market," said Sharon Kim, international director of Impressionist and Modern Art at Christie's. The figure in the image has been identified by Cezanne scholars as Paulin Paulet, a gardener on the painter's family estate, the Jas de Bouffan, near Aix en Provence in the south of France. Paulet is the only person to appear in all five of the finished "Card Players" works, which were the subject of a major exhibition at London's Courtauld Institute and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York last year. The watercolor study was originally bought by Eichenwald's parents, who brought it with them to the United States when the family fled the Nazi occupation of Europe in the 1930s and settled in New York. Eichenwald, who trained as a pediatrician in the U.S. and went on to become a renowned specialist, died last September at the age of 85. He was a keen art collector, and several of his other paintings and sculptures will feature in Christie's New York sales on May 1 and 2. "The 'Card Player' series is one of the most important of the modern era, influencing so many of the painters who sought to follow in Cezanne's footsteps," said Kim. "[It] offers us a rare glimpse into [his] artistic process, showing us how he worked through the pose and positioning of the characters that would come to populate his greatest masterpieces." Paul Cezanne (1839-1906) was one of the most influential Post-Impressionist painters; a childhood friend of the novelist Emile Zola and a contemporary of Manet, Monet, Renoir and Degas. His works were a major influence on the development of Cubism: Picasso referred to him as "the father of us all." "A Card Player" by Paul Cezanne, will be the star lot of a sale of Impressionist and Modern Art at Christie's in New York on May 1, 2012.

chatgpt: Art aficionados and collectors are in for a rare treat as a long-lost sketch for one of Paul Cezanne's most iconic works has surfaced among a Texas art collector's paintings. The sketch that has been discovered is for "The Card Players," a series of five paintings that are considered to be some of Cezanne's most significant works. The sketch has been missing since 1953, and it was feared to have been lost forever. The finished paintings in the series are now on display in some of the world's best-known galleries, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. The study is expected to fetch a whopping $15 to $20 million at auction on May 1, according to experts. The art collector from Texas, who has chosen to remain anonymous, has been holding onto the painting for decades, perhaps not realizing the significance of the artwork that was hidden in plain sight. "The Card Players" is a series of paintings that are considered to be some of the most important works of art of the 19th century. The series depicts peasants in the south of France playing cards, and it is known for its bold and innovative style. Cezanne spent over a decade working on the series, which he considered to be his most significant work. The series is also recognized for its historical significance, as it is believed to have inspired the cubist movement in art. The sketch that has been discovered sheds new light on Cezanne's creative process and offers insights into his method of working. The study that has been found is an oil on canvas sketch that measures 19 inches by 26 inches. The sketch closely resembles one of the completed paintings from the series, but with subtle differences that indicate it was a work in progress. The colors are less vibrant, and the brushstrokes are looser, suggesting that Cezanne was experimenting with different techniques before finalizing the painting. The discovery of the sketch is a significant event in the art world, and it has generated a great deal of excitement. The fact that such a significant work has been missing for so long and then found in such an unexpected place is a testament to the power of art and its enduring appeal. The art collector from Texas has declined to comment on the discovery of the sketch, but art experts and enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the auction on May 1. It remains to be seen who will walk away with the sketch and what they will do with it. But one thing is certain: this long-lost masterpiece has been given new life, and it will now take its rightful place among Cezanne's most significant works.
