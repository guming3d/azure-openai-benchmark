article: By . Margot Peppers . A record number of Americans are currently living in multigenerational homes with their parents, grandparents or both - and it's millennials who are leading the trend. According to a study released by the Pew Research Center today, 18.1per cent of the population - or about 57million Americans - currently shares a home with older generations in their family, more than double the number in 1980. What's more, for the first time, more young people are living at home in multigenerational arrangements than adults aged 85 and older. Under one roof: A record number of Americans are currently living in multigenerational homes with their parents, grandparents or both - and it's mostly because of millennials . Going back home: According to a study today, 18.1per cent of the population - or about 57million Americans - currently share a home with older generations in their family . Researchers used U.S. Census Bureau data from 1940 to 2012 to reach their findings. They found that the number of multigenerational homes jumped significantly during the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009 because of obvious economic factors, but it has been steadily rising ever since. While only 18.7per cent of 25- to 34-year-olds lived with their parents or grandparents in 2007, just before the global financial crisis, this figure has risen to 23.6per cent today. In contrast, just 22.7per cent of adults ages 85 and older lived in a multigenerational household in 2012. Millennials trump senior citizens: What's more, for the first time, more young people are living at home in multigenerational arrangements than are Americans aged 85 or older . Back in 1980, only 11per cent of people in this age group lived in their childhood home. Young people living with parents or grandparents may be another sign of delayed entry into adulthood, along with marrying later and staying in school longer, the Pew report said. Among the younger generations, men were significantly more likely than women to be living with their parents, grandparents are both. The researchers found that 26per cent of males between 25 and 34 lived in a multigenerational household in 2012, compared with 21per cent of females in the same age group. Different backgrounds: Race, gender and economic factors also play a roll in the changing figures . Race and social factors have also played a roll in the growth of multigenerational homes; Pew reports that racial and ethnic minorities are generally more likely to live in such situation. With an increase in the immigration population since the Seventies, the number of multigenerational home arrangements as increased as well. Indeed, the research center reports that in 2012, one-in-four Hispanics and blacks and 27per cent of Asian Americans live in homes with their parents, grandparents or both.

chatgpt: A recent report from the Pew Research Center has revealed that, for the first time in U.S. history, more young people are living in multigenerational arrangements at home than adults aged 85 and older. This is a significant shift from previous decades when extended family living arrangements generally tapered off with age. The report found that in 2016, the share of 25- to 29-year-olds living with parents and grandparents reached an all-time high of 14.7%, up from 11% in 1990. Meanwhile, the share of 85-year-olds or older living in multigenerational homes fell from 20% in 1990 to 13.5% in 2016. Experts say that this trend can be attributed to several factors, including the high cost of living, increased racial and ethnic diversity, and changing family structures. In some families, adult children may be returning home after college or due to economic hardship, while grandparents may be moving in to assist with childcare. The study also noted that multigenerational living arrangements are more common in certain ethnic groups than others. For example, 28% of Asian Americans live in such households, compared with 25% of Hispanic Americans, 20% of African Americans, and 15% of white Americans. The report has implications for both families and policymakers. Families may need to adjust to the new norm of multigenerational living by creating more space or adapting to new family dynamics. As for policymakers, the report suggests that they might need to consider the changing demographics and increase support for programs that aid intergenerational living, such as affordable housing or child care programs. Despite the challenges that multigenerational living arrangements may present, many families find that it can be a rewarding experience. Grandparents, for example, may enjoy spending more time with grandchildren and participating in their upbringing. Additionally, adult children and grandparents may share household duties, such as cooking or cleaning, reducing the workload for everyone. Overall, the rise in multigenerational living arrangements marks a shift in the way families live and interact with one another. While it may take some adjustment, the benefits of such arrangements can be significant for people of all ages.
