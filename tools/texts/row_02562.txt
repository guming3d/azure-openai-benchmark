article: (CNN) -- Ooh, burn! You know that tribute to Woody Allen's lifetime achievement at the Golden Globes on Sunday night? Well, it left out one tiny detail, says his son. "Missed the Woody Allen tribute," Ronan Farrow tweeted, "did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?" That's a reference to Allen's adopted daughter, Dylan, who accused the director of molesting her 20 years ago. So, why would Allen's own son allude to the allegation? It's part of the messy, convoluted story that is Woody Allen's personal life. Accusations . Farrow is the child Allen fathered with actress Mia Farrow. (Or is he? More on that later) Mia Farrow also adopted several other children -- Dylan among them. After a 12-year relationship, the couple split after Mia Farrow learned that Allen was having an affair with Soon-Yi, a daughter Mia Farrow adopted before she began dating Allen. (Soon-Yi is now Allen's wife). The same year, Dylan said Allen inappropriately touched her. (A court case was later dropped). "I'm scared of him, his image," Dylan -- who goes by another name now -- told Vanity Fair in October. "I have never been asked to testify. If I could talk to the seven-year-old Dylan, I would tell her to be brave, to testify." Woody Allen's lawyer Elkan Abramowitz told the magazine that Allen still denies the allegations. Award show . Which brings us back to Sunday night where Allen, 78, was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award. Right before the segment aired, Mia Farrow tweeted she'd be switching the channel: . "Time to grab some icecream & switch over to #GIRLS" But Ronan Farrow went for the jugular with his tweet.

Many took Farrow's side, including correspondent Luke Russert (son of legendary journalist Tim) who tweeted a link to the Vanity Fair article. Others said Allen's personal life shouldn't take away from his filmmaking achievements. "Sorry to hear @RonanFarrow's rage, and @thelist which fuels it, but Woody is one of the greatest film directors and deserved the tribute," tweeted Antonio Vantaggiato. Paternity . Now, on to that bit about Ronan Farrow maybe, possibly not being Allen's son. In the Vanity Fair interview, his mom calls Frank Sinatra the great love of her life and said the two "never really split up." Asked if her son was Sinatra's, Mia Farrow answered, "Possibly." Ronan's response? "Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son." When a parent really isn't yours . Ronan talks Allen, Sinatra .

chatgpt: The relationship between famed filmmaker Woody Allen and his family has been a subject of scrutiny for years. The latest bombshell in this ongoing saga came from an unexpected source -- one of his own adopted daughters.  Ronan Farrow, Allen's son with actress Mia Farrow, has been making headlines of his own as an investigative journalist, exposing the likes of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer. However, there have always been rumors regarding his true paternity.  Recently, one of Allen's other adopted daughters, Dylan Farrow, made headlines once again for accusing Allen of molesting her when she was just seven years old. Allen has vehemently denied these allegations for years, but Dylan's story has been gaining traction in the #MeToo era.  But what makes this situation even more complex is the fact that Allen is currently married to another one of his adopted daughters, Soon-Yi Previn. This relationship, which began when Previn was just 19 and Allen was in his 50s, has long been a source of controversy. Many view it as creepy and unethical, given the power dynamics at play.  To make matters worse, Previn recently gave an interview in which she accused Mia Farrow of abuse and manipulation throughout her childhood. The backlash was swift, with many wondering if Previn was defending Allen as well.  It's unclear where this messy situation will go from here, but it's clear that the public's opinion of Allen has soured in recent years. Once regarded as a genius filmmaker, his reputation has been tarnished by allegations of abuse and misconduct.  Ronan Farrow, for his part, has used his platform to speak out against abuse and hold powerful men accountable. His tweets about his family's situation have been few and far between, but it's clear that he supports his sister's bravery in coming forward.  For now, the focus remains on Dylan Farrow's allegations and the public reckoning with Allen's legacy. It's unclear if he will ever face any consequences for his alleged actions, but the conversation around abuse and power dynamics in Hollywood has certainly been shifted by these recent events.
