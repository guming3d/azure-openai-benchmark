Thai authorities have been mocked for their Twitter campaign urging teens to avoid pre-marital sex on Valentine's Day. File photo . Young people were asked to support the campaign called 'Just a Meal for Valentine's Day' by tweeting #DinnerOnly in Thai - but instead, the request attracted mockery. This year's campaign came amid a morality overhaul initiated by Thailand's military government, which took power from an elected administration following a coup last May. The Ministry of Culture said a recent survey it conducted found 83% of Thai teenagers planned to have sex on Valentine's Day, according to local media reports. Earlier this week, police asked parents and teachers to inform children of the 'dangers' of Valentine's Day and to avoid 'risky behavior'. Police also warned nightclubs across the country not to admit underage customers. Major General Patipat Suban Na Ayuuthaya said that all police units would be on alert until Sunday to 'increase vigilance in risky areas' such as nightclubs.

He urged entertainment venues to call police hotlines to reports cases of youths trying to enter. One all-girl's school in Bangkok took the extra step of holding a Valentine's Day self-defense class earlier this week. Thai media showed policewomen on stage in the auditorium of the Sainampeung School flipping a man before an assembly of hundreds of students. Authorities annually warn youths to avoid 'inappropriate activities' on Valentine's Day, which is widely celebrated in Thailand. Narathip Pumsap, the Moral Promotion Center's director, said: 'Parents and teachers should create correct understanding about Valentine's Day with children. She added that instead of engaging in intimacy, young people should 'show love to their family, society, themselves and the country,' the Khaosod newspaper reported. Despite its reputation as a freewheeling destination for sex tourism, Thailand's socially conservative authorities are on a constant mission to uphold the country's traditional Buddhist values. Hollywood movies are censored with sex scenes and cigarette smoking pixellated out, and Thai soap operas are not allowed to show alcohol consumption.

chatgpt: The Culture Ministry's Moral Promotion Center has issued its usual warning to teenagers ahead of Valentine's Day. According to a recent survey, 83% of teens planned to have sex on February 14, which has prompted the agency to urge them to refrain from such activities and to go home after dinner instead. The center has been vocal about promoting abstinence and moral values among young people in Thailand, but their efforts seem to have backfired this year. Their social media campaign advocating for a code of conduct on Valentine's Day has attracted mockery on Twitter, with many users questioning the effectiveness of telling teenagers what to do. One user tweeted, "Oh wow, and here I thought abstinence-only education went out of style years ago. It's like they want teenagers to rebel." Another user said, "Just because the Moral Promotion Center says not to do something, doesn't mean teenagers will listen. This is just going to make them more curious and rebellious." The campaign featured a cartoon couple holding hands and walking away from a bed with a heart-shaped pillow, accompanied by a message urging teens to "return home" and "protect themselves from sexual diseases." The backlash on social media highlighted the divide between different generations' views on sex and morality. While the center's message may resonate with some older adults who prioritize traditional values, it seems to miss the mark with teenagers who are more progressive in their attitudes toward sex. According to a study by the United Nations, Thailand has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia. While the center's efforts to promote abstinence may be well-intentioned, experts say that a more comprehensive approach that includes education on sexual health and contraception might be more effective. Some critics also argue that the center's focus on morality is misplaced, and that young people need more support and guidance from parents and teachers rather than being told what not to do. The backlash on social media shows the importance of engaging with young people in a way that resonates with them, rather than simply imposing values from above. As Valentine's Day approaches, it remains to be seen whether teenagers will heed the center's warning or rebel against it. However, one thing is clear – efforts to promote abstinence and morality need to be met with a more nuanced and comprehensive approach in order to effectively address issues of teenage sexuality and pregnancy.
