Jodie La Spina pleaded guilty to two counts of arson and unlawful use of a motor vehicle . La Spina received a three-year sentence at the Brisbane District Court on Tuesday . But she will be released on three years' probation on Friday after spending more than four years behind bars - including 20 months in a mental health facility . La Spina purchased a lighter from a service station and jemmied open a door at the Cleveland Ambulance Station before taking the keys to one of the two vans inside the building which she set alight with accelerant ethanol, the court heard. She then drove the ambulance to her bike and set fire to the van. Crown prosecutor Maita Aylward said La Spina made threats to burn down another ambulance while being transported as a patient three months earlier. Ms Aylward told the court that she said to the officers: 'Ambulance van 292 was "a shitbox" and she was going to burn it down'. Ms Aylward said La Spina 'staged the scene' by laying her motorcycle down to concoct a story that the ambulance driver knocked over her bike. La Spina threatened to burn down another ambulance while being transported as a patient three months earlier . She told the officers that ambulance van 292 was "a shitbox" and she was going to 'burn it down' She also changed her stories twice and then said she could not recall anything from that night. Ms Aylward said La Spina's motive was revenge because her Queensland Ambulance Service was rejected due failing a psychometric test. Marty Barrett, who lives across the road from the station, told Daily Mail Australia, that he still recalls the 2010 blast like it was yesterday. 'I was laying in bed when I heard weird noises so I went outside and thought I would try to rescue the ambulances but gas started exploding and I knew it wasn't worth risking my life for,' he said. Mr Barrett couldn't comprehend the deliberate arson attack. 'The service only does good so why would someone want to do damage to it? It's unnatural.' The Cleveland Ambulance Station reopened just a few months ago after the 2014 arson attack . The rebuild of the new ambulance station cost more than $2million .

chatgpt: Jodie La Spina, a 27-year-old resident of Cleveland, Queensland, has been granted probation after serving over four years in prison for setting fire to the Cleveland Ambulance Station and two vans in 2010. La Spina has pleaded guilty to two counts of arson and one count of unlawful use of a car. The arson incident occurred at the ambulance station on Thornlands Road in June 2010. La Spina set alight two parked vans before igniting the station itself, which suffered significant damage. The incident caused great concern in the local community, and La Spina was subsequently arrested and charged. During the trial, the prosecutor told the court that La Spina had also made threats to burn down another ambulance while being transported as a patient three months earlier. The prosecutor expressed concern that La Spina posed a continued threat to the community and requested a sentence that reflected the seriousness of the crime. However, the defense argued that La Spina had a troubled upbringing, suffering from mental health issues and substance abuse problems. They also noted that La Spina had expressed remorse for her actions and had undergone rehabilitation while in prison. In delivering the sentence, the judge noted the seriousness of the crime and the need to protect the community from further harm. However, he also acknowledged La Spina's efforts to address her personal issues and her willingness to cooperate with the authorities. He ultimately granted probation, allowing La Spina to return to the community under strict supervision. Under the terms of her probation, La Spina must abide by certain conditions, including regular meetings with a probation officer, maintaining employment, and attending counseling or therapy as directed. She is also prohibited from possessing or using illegal drugs or alcohol and must submit to drug testing as required. The decision to grant probation has been controversial, with some expressing concern that La Spina has not fully accounted for her actions or demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation. Others have praised the decision, arguing that probation offers a second chance for those who have made mistakes in their past. La Spina has not commented publicly on the decision, but her family has expressed relief that she will be able to return home soon. They have also reiterated their belief in La Spina's potential to turn her life around and make a positive contribution to society. The case of Jodie La Spina highlights the challenges of balancing punishment and rehabilitation in the criminal justice system. While some may view probation as a lenient sentence, others see it as an opportunity for individuals to address their underlying issues and make meaningful changes in their lives. Only time will tell whether La Spina will be able to take advantage of this second chance and become a productive member of her community.
