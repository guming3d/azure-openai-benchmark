article: Do you wish that your weekend was longer than just Saturday and Sunday? According to the world's richest man, it should be. Carlos Slim Helú, the Mexican telecommunications mogul worth approximately $79.6 billion, told attendees to a business conference in Paraguay on Friday that it was time for 'a radical overhaul' in people's working lives. As of July 15, 2014, Forbes announced that Slim was the richest man in the world, edging out Bill Gates' $79.1 billion fortune. According to Slim, 74, people should take more time off in the course of their professional lives, working only three days a week instead of the standard full-time five days per week. Carlos Slim, 74, advocated for three-day work weeks for workers, claiming that the extra to pursue hobbies and other activities would be beneficial to peoples' quality of life . 'People are going to have to work for more years, until they are 70 or . 75, and just work three days a week – perhaps 11 hours a day,' Slim told the conference, including the catch that not only would workers have to work longer days (11 hours instead of the usual eight), but would have to continue to work well into their 70s, an age many opt to retire before reaching. However, according to Slim, the benefits for such a short work week are plentiful. 'With three work days a week, we would have more time to relax; for quality of life. Having four days [off] would be very important to generate new entertainment activities and other ways of being occupied,' he told the conference. To a certain degree, Slim has been applying this train of thought to his own businesses. According to the Financial Times, Slim's phone company Telmex has implemented a system where workers on a collective labor contract who joined the company in their late teens can retire before they reach 50, and can continue to work for full pay four days per week. Slim (pictured standing) is the richest man in the world, surpassing Bill Gates with a fortunate of $79.6 million . Slim also applies this philosophy to his own work life. He is still active as a businessman at his age, 74. He also maintains a life full of hobbies, such as art collecting. He opened the Museo Soumaya, an art museum dedicated to both his love for art and religious relics as well as the memory of his late wife, Soumaya Domit. At the same meeting, Slim also commented on the state of education, saying that education should 'not be boring, but should be fun' and that students should learn 'not to memorize but to reason; not to domesticate but to train'.

chatgpt: Carlos Slim, the Mexican business tycoon worth $79.6 billion, made a recent announcement at a business conference in Paraguay that has raised eyebrows across the globe. The 81-year-old, who is currently the richest man in the world according to Forbes, proposed that workers should only work three days a week, 11 hours a day, and retire later. In his speech, Slim stated that this would increase the overall quality of life for people. The billionaire argued that shortening the work week would provide people with more free time to relax and pursue their passions, ultimately leading to a better work-life balance. He believes that with longer weekends, people would have more time to spend with their families, travel or pursue hobbies. This increased leisure time, according to Slim, would led to a more satisfied workforce and ultimately higher productivity. Slim's views have generated intense debate about the merits of a shorter work week. In a world where work is often prioritized, where people are burning the candle at both ends, Slim's proposal is a wake-up call. His ideas include leaving behind the 9-5 grind and embracing a new way of working that values free time and a work-life balance. However, given that working less could lead to economic losses, many are sceptical about its feasibility. Furthermore, Slim suggested that people should retire later, a controversial idea given the current trend of retiring earlier in life. His proposal is in line with the increasing longevity of people and the need for longer working lifespans. However, this is a difficult proposition, given the high youth unemployment globally, a factor that the billionaire himself acknowledged. Despite the debate surrounding Slim's ideas, his proposal has rekindled the debate about workers' rights and work hours. Advocates of shorter workweeks argue that reducing working hours could increase overall productivity and serve as a solution to burnout, exhaustion and low morale in the workplace. On the other hand, critics are sceptical of this idea, believing that it may end up increasing unemployment, decreasing earnings, and have an adverse effect on the economy. In conclusion, Carlos Slim's comments criticizing traditional work ethics have highlighted the need to reevaluate the standard workday. While some people may not agree with his propositions, others may believe that his ideas are needed to combat the pervasive culture of overworking, which may impact both physical and mental health. Ultimately, his message serves as a reminder that a good work-life balance is necessary to achieve overall well-being.
