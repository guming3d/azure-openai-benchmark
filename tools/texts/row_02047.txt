article: You might think finding six double-yolk eggs in one box is about as likely as discovering a unicorn munching through a field of four-leaf clovers. However, Marks & Spencer has cut the odds to the point where it is a certainty. The chain is launching boxes of six extra-large eggs with every one guaranteed to have two golden, gooey yolks – a product M&S says is ‘perfect for people who think the yolk is the best bit’. Scroll down for video . M&S is launching boxes of extra-large eggs this weekend - with the guarantee each one is a double-yolker . The company say the new boxes of double-yolkers are ‘perfect for people who think the yolk is the best bit’ In normal circumstances, the likelihood of finding just one such egg in a box is about one in 1,000, according to the British Egg Information Service (BEIS). Consequently, the equation for finding six would theoretically be 1,000 to the power of six, which equates to an American quintillion – 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (18 zeros). Farmers at M&S have managed to take the luck out of the equation by opting for young chickens, whose first eggs are much more likely to produce double yolks. Any particularly large eggs from these birds are likely to have multiple yolks, so choosing out the double-yolkers becomes easier. Finally, the eggs are then passed by hand in front of a strong light to check for the double yolk. The BEIS said double-yolkers almost always come from hens about 20 to 28 weeks old, whose hormone systems are not fully developed yet. Normally the chances of finding a double-yolker like this one in a box of six eggs is just one in 1,000 . A spokesman said: ‘In reality it gets its mechanics just slightly wrong. 'You get a young bird and it comes to lay its first egg and it releases more than one egg yolk. It forms a shell around the egg and out pops a rather large egg with two egg yolks in it.’ The yolk is the tastiest and most nutritious part of the egg, because it contains high quality essential fats, vitamins and minerals, including B12, B6, A, K, E and folate. It is also one of the few foods to naturally contain vitamin D, which is important for bones, particularly in children. Yolks also contain most of the egg’s calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, selenium and iron. The British free range double-yolkers, which are extra-large, are available from this weekend for £2.75 for a box of six, compared with a box of the store’s normal large free range eggs, which costs £2.

chatgpt: UK-based retail giant Marks & Spencer (M&S) is set to launch a new product guaranteed to delight egg lovers: boxes of six extra-large eggs guaranteed to have two yolks each. Dubbed the "perfect product for people who think the yolk is the best bit," the extra-yolky eggs are set to hit M&S store shelves across the country in the coming weeks. These eggs are not only twice as yolky as traditional eggs, but are also a rare find. Normally, the chances of finding a double-yolker in a box of eggs is one in 1,000. However, M&S has sourced hens aged between 20 to 28 weeks old who are sure to lay mostly double yolker eggs. The new product was trialed earlier this year and proved to be a hit with customers, who praised the "luxurious, velvety" texture of the double yolks. M&S's egg buyer, Joe McDonald, said, "We know our customers love an indulgent breakfast or brunch, and these double yolk eggs are perfect for that. They're also ideal for baking, where double yolks are often used to create a richer, creamier texture." The product launch comes as M&S continues to invest in innovation and new product development, with a focus on providing customers with high-quality, unique offerings that cannot be found elsewhere on the high street. M&S has a long history of innovation, having been the first UK retailer to introduce avocados and kiwi fruits to British shoppers. The move towards the double yolk eggs also speaks to a broader trend in the food industry, which is seeing a rise in demand for high-quality, ethically produced products. M&S has long been committed to animal welfare and sustainability, with all of its eggs coming from hens that are free to roam and are kept in small flocks of no more than 1,000 birds. The new product is set to be available in M&S stores across the UK starting next week, with a box of six extra-large eggs costing £2.50. Early indications suggest high demand for the product, with M&S already reporting pre-orders well above initial expectations. M&S has advised customers to act fast if they want to get their hands on the coveted double yolk eggs, saying they are likely to sell out quickly. Overall, the new product launch speaks to M&S's ongoing commitment to providing customers with innovative, high-quality products that cater to their ever-evolving tastes and preferences. With the demand for high-quality, ethically produced food on the rise, the double yolk eggs are sure to be a hit with consumers looking for a luxurious breakfast or ideal ingredient for rich baking recipes.
