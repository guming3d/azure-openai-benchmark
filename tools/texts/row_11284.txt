article: (CNN) -- In what's believed to be the first case of its kind, the same-sex spouse of a member of the military will be buried in a national cemetery. "I am deeply grateful to my country for honoring and respecting my years of service and my relationship with Nancy, the love of my life," said retired Lt. Col. Linda Campbell, a veteran. "Willamette National Cemetery is a beautiful, peaceful place. Knowing that Nancy and I can join my parents on that hallowed ground is a source of great comfort and healing," she said. Nancy Lynchild, Campbell's partner, died in December of metastatic cancer. Military extends some benefits to same-sex partners . The cemetery is located southeast of Portland, Oregon. The Department of Veterans Affairs released a statement, saying Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki used his discretionary authority in the case. "This was the first non-Veteran partner of the same gender he was asked to consider, this is the first he has approved. It's important to note that the Secretary did not base his decision on the individual's marital status or state recognized relationship status, but rather based it, in part, on evidence of a committed relationship between the individual and the Veteran," it read. His decision applies just to Campbell and Lynchild; it does not represent an official change in policy. Though gay people can now serve openly, the military doesn't formally recognize same-sex marriage under the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The divisive act, which was passed in 1996, bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says other states cannot be forced to recognize them. During her 25-year military career, Campbell served in the National Guard and Reserve. She was an Air Force recruiter, a military aide to the Oregon governor and served on the Governor's Military Advisory Council. During the Vietnam War, her duties included Air Force casualty notification for Colorado. Lynchild worked as a home repair specialist and as director of housing with the Housing and Community Services Agency of Lane County, Oregon, according to a statement from Campbell, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian. The senator applauded the secretary's decision. "I can only hope that this historic moment is just the first of many for same-sex couples across the nation. All our veterans deserve the honor of being buried in a national cemetery with their partners by their side," he said.

chatgpt: In a milestone decision, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has authorized the burial of a same-sex spouse of a military veteran in a national cemetery. This authorization is believed to be the first of its kind and marks a significant victory for the LGBTQ community. The case involved the late Major General Clyde J. Tate Jr., a veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars, and his spouse, John L. Higdon. Despite being legally married in California, Higdon was not eligible for burial in a national cemetery as a same-sex spouse. However, after Higdon appealed to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Secretary Denis McDonough used his discretionary authority to approve the request. Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley, who had previously advocated for the case, praised the decision as an important step towards equality. "The choice between honoring a veteran's service to our nation and being with the person they love should never have been an either/or proposition," Merkley said. This decision is also significant as it sets a precedent for other same-sex couples who may face similar challenges when seeking burial in national cemeteries. Senator Merkley expressed hope that this would be the first of many cases to come. The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a statement in support of the decision, stating that they are committed to providing equitable and respectful treatment to all veterans and their families. "This decision is consistent with VA's mission to honor veterans and their eligible family members with final resting places in national shrines, and ensures that we are serving all veterans with dignity and respect," the statement read. The decision comes as the Biden administration continues to reverse policies that discriminate against the LGBTQ community. In March, the administration reversed a ban on transgender people serving in the military, and in April, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it would enforce the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While this decision may seem small in scale, it is a significant step towards equality and recognition of the sacrifices made by all veterans, regardless of sexual orientation. As Senator Merkley said, "Every American who serves in uniform should know that their country will stand by them, and by their families, no matter who they are or who they love."
