It is thought Mr Fares was injured while fighting pro-Assad forces for the control of military site Base 80 near Aleppo, before he was mistakenly executed. The militant group tried to explain their error by referring to a story in which the prophet Mohammed said Allah would forgive a man who killed a believer by mistake. An ISIS spokesman, Oma al-Qahtani, confirmed Mr fares had been injured in fighting and had been captured by soldiers who believed he was fighting against them. He has now said an investigation into the death would be carried out by the appropriate authorities.

chatgpt: In the ongoing conflict in Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has once again demonstrated its brutality. The extremist group recently beheaded a fighter, believing him to be a pro-Assad soldier. However, it was later revealed that the victim was actually a fellow rebel, leading to accusations that ISIS is causing infighting amongst opposition groups. The incident occurred in the town of Al-Bab, near Aleppo, which has become a key battleground in the Syrian conflict. The victim, who has not been named, was reportedly captured by ISIS militants after they accused him of making insulting comments about the founding fathers of the Shia sect. Initially, it was thought that the victim was a pro-Assad fighter, as he was wearing a uniform similar to those worn by the Syrian army, and was carrying a gun. However, it later emerged that he was in fact a member of a rebel group opposed to both the government and ISIS. The beheading of a fellow rebel has led to condemnation from other opposition groups, who accuse ISIS of causing divisions amongst anti-government forces. The Syrian National Coalition, the main political opposition group, issued a statement condemning the killing, and calling for an end to internal conflicts amongst rebels. ISIS is known for its extreme violence, and has been responsible for numerous beheadings and other atrocities in Syria and Iraq. The group has claimed that its actions are in response to what it sees as the betrayal of Sunni Muslims by Shia-dominated governments. The incident in Al-Bab is just the latest in a series of atrocities committed by ISIS, which has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the United Nations. The group has also been the subject of international military action, with a US-led coalition bombing targets in Syria and Iraq in an attempt to defeat the group. The beheading of a fellow rebel by ISIS is a stark reminder of the complexity of the situation in Syria, where numerous opposition groups are fighting against both the government and extremist groups. The conflict has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of people, and there is little sign of a resolution any time soon. As the violence continues, the international community is grappling with how best to support those affected by the conflict, and how to bring an end to the bloodshed. The killing of the unnamed rebel in Al-Bab highlights the urgent need for a peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria, before any more lives are lost to this senseless violence.
