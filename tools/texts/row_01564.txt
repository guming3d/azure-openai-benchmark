The passenger was reported missing by the crew just after 1.30am when the Pride of Kent ferry was around six miles off the coast of Dover. HM Coastguard sent a helicopter, three lifeboats and a tugboat  to search the sea in darkness after the ferry crew said they feared someone had gone overboard. A witness claimed he saw someone having a drink on the deck before calmly putting down their glass, climbing over the railings and jumping into the Channel.

chatgpt: In the early hours of this morning, a passenger was reported missing around six miles from Dover. The alarm was raised just after 1.30am, and a coordinated search effort was launched with a helicopter, lifeboats and a tug boat all joining the overnight hunt. According to a witness, the individual was seen drinking on deck before climbing over the railings and jumping. The witness's account has been verified by crew members who were on board at the time. While it is unclear at this stage why the passenger might have taken such a drastic action, the incident has raised concerns about the safety of those travelling on board. A spokesperson for the ferry company said that a head count of passengers and staff at Calais, the ferry's destination, found no missing people. However, the passenger's family have been notified and are said to be "extremely distressed" by the news of their loved one's disappearance. The search and rescue operation lasted several hours as emergency services scoured the area around where the passenger was last seen. Despite their efforts, no trace of the missing person was found. The search was called off at first light, and investigations are now ongoing to determine what happened on board the ferry. The incident has once again highlighted the need for adequate safety measures and protocols to be in place on board all vessels, including ferries, to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. There have been several similar incidents in recent years, and safety experts have called for more stringent safety measures to be introduced across the industry. Passenger safety is an issue of paramount importance, and ferry companies must do everything in their power to ensure that passengers are kept safe while on board. It is vital that all incidents such as this one are thoroughly investigated, and lessons are learned so that steps can be taken to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. The missing passenger's family are still waiting for answers, and it is hoped that the investigation will provide them with the closure they need. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.
