article: (CNN) -- An American human rights group documenting widespread sexual violence against Darfuri women in Sudan and Chad has called for "vigorous prosecution of rape as a war crime." Sudanese women in a refugee camp in southern Chad in March. Physicians for Human Rights, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, issued a report Sunday "documenting the scope and long-term impact of rape and other sexual violence" experienced by women who fled the war-torn Sudanese region of Darfur and now live as refugees in neighboring Chad. The report -- titled "Nowhere To Turn: Failure To Protect, Support and Assure Justice for Darfuri Women" -- is based on interviews with 88 female refugees living in Chad's Farchana refugee camp. The study was done with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. "Many Darfuri women refugees live in a nightmare of memories of past trauma compounded by the constant threat of sexual violence around the camps now," said Susannah Sirkin, the physician group's deputy director. "Women who report being raped are stigmatized, and remain trapped in places of perpetual insecurity. There's no one to stop the rapes, no one to turn to for justice for past or ongoing crimes, and little psycho-social support to address their prolonged and unimaginable traumas." Dr. Sondra Crosby, a Physicians for Human Rights consultant and expert in refugee trauma, said "the atmosphere of intimidation was palpable as we listened to women describing their profound suffering and fear, and their yearning to return safely and with dignity to their former lives." Of those refugees interviewed, "32 reported instances of confirmed or highly probable rape" -- 17 in Darfur and 15 in Chad, the group said. "Among the instances of rape reported in Chad, the vast majority (10 of 11 confirmed reports) occurred when women left the camps to gather firewood." And just over half of the 88 women interviewed -- 46 of them -- live in fear of sexual assaults around the refugee camp. The group supports the issuing of International Criminal Court warrants against the Sudanese perpetrators. The group also called for "legal reforms in Chad to end impunity for sexual violence," and for "effective psychosocial support to survivors." And it said increased protections are needed by police and peacekeepers, including "effective firewood patrols." The conflict in Darfur began in 2003 after rebels in the western region of Sudan began attacking government positions. Sudan's government responded with a fierce military campaign that has led to some 200,000 deaths and forced 2 million people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.

chatgpt: 88 Darfuri women who fled their homeland and currently reside in Chad have reportedly described "profound" suffering and fear stemming from the ongoing conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan. According to reports, these women faced severe and life-threatening experiences, including sexual assault, domestic violence, and physical abuse. The women who participated in the study were living in refugee camps and had fled the Darfur region since fighting began in 2003. So far, an estimated 200,000 people have lost their lives, with at least 2 million people fleeing the region for safety. Despite the ongoing conflict, the situation in Darfur has not received widespread attention, and the international community has yet to intervene effectively. During the interviews, the women reportedly painted a bleak picture of their lives in Darfur, with some recounting stories of sexual assault at the hands of government soldiers and militias. Others described domestic violence and physical abuse, saying that they lived in constant fear of attacks on their homes and communities. According to a leading expert in refugee trauma, Dr. Pauline Boss, the experiences described by the Darfuri women were consistent with her own research on the psychological impact of trauma on refugees. Dr. Boss noted that "the atmosphere of intimidation was palpable" and that the "profound suffering" experienced by these women was likely to have long-lasting effects on their psychological well-being. Despite the ongoing violence, little has been done to address the situation in Darfur. International attention has been sparse, with much of the focus on other conflicts around the world. Meanwhile, the Darfuri refugees continue to suffer, living in makeshift camps with inadequate access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. The situation in Darfur has been long-standing, with the roots of the conflict dating back to the 1980s. However, tensions escalated in 2003 when rebels rose up against the government, sparking a brutal conflict that has raged ever since. While numerous peace agreements have been signed over the years, none have been successful in bringing lasting peace to the region. In light of the ongoing violence and the suffering of the Darfuri people, it is crucial that the international community takes action to address the situation. This means providing assistance to the refugees, addressing the root causes of the conflict, and holding those responsible for human rights abuses accountable for their actions. Without such action, the Darfuri people will continue to suffer, and the region's future will remain uncertain.
