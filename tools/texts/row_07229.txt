article: Wladimir Klitschko will make a belated return to the American ring when he takes on Bryant Jennings at Madison Square Garden on April 25. The long-reigning heavyweight champion, who holds three of the four major belts, has not fought in the United States since his win over Sultan Ibragimov at the same venue in 2008. Since then Klitschko has fought primarily in Germany, making 13 successful defences of his titles. Wladimir Klitschko, pictured following his title bout against Kubrat Pulev in November, will return to the USA . Klitschko will fight Bryant Jennings (pictured, left) in his first return to the American ring since February 2008 . The Ukrainian will be making the 18th straight defence of his second reign as world champion and is the second-longest reigning heavyweight in history, just under three years shy of matching Larry Holmes’ record of 11 years and eight months. He said: 'I do have great respect for Bryant Jennings and his achievements. He has good movement in the ring and good technique. I know this will be a tough challenge. 'I am extremely happy to fight in New York again. I had my first unification fight here and a lot of great heavyweight matches have taken place at Madison Square Garden. Klitschko's (left) last fight on American soil came at Madison Square Garden in 2008, against Sultan Ibragimov . Since his last USA outing Klitschko has fought primarily in Germany, making 13 successful title defences . 'It will definitely be a great fight night and I will do everything for it from my side.' The undefeated Jennings who, at 30, is eight years his opponent’s junior, did not start boxing until 2009 and fought just 17 times as an amateur. He made his professional debut a year later and has won all 19 of his fights with 10 coming by knockout. His most impressive victory was his latest, a split-decision win over Cuban Mike Perez last July. Pictured in Germany last week, Klitschko presents his new training programme, 'Klitschko Body Performance' Of his upcoming fight with Jennings, Klitschko said: 'I am extremely happy to fight in New York again' ‘I have all of the attributes naturally to be a champion that you can’t teach - heart and will,’ Jennings told ESPN. ‘I’m psyched up. This is the level where I’m at. This is exactly what I planned to do. ‘Whatever competition you are in, your goal should be to reach the top. This is the top, but now it’s about taking it to higher heights and winning.’ Should Klitschko prevail, he will surely target America’s newest champion, Deontay Wilder, after his impressive victory over Bermane Stiverne last weekend.

chatgpt: Former unified world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko is set to make a return to Madison Square Garden for the first time since 2008. The Ukrainian boxer will be defending his world heavyweight title against undefeated American fighter Bryant Jennings on April 25 this year. Klitschko, who currently holds three out of the four major belts, will be making his 18th straight defence of his second reign as world champion. The fight is expected to be a test for the 39-year-old, who has been out of the ring since last November. His opponent, 30-year-old Bryant Jennings from Philadelphia, is looking to upset the odds in his first world heavyweight title fight. He did not start boxing until 2009, but has since won all of his 19 professional fights, with nine of them coming via knockout. Jennings is excited to be fighting Klitschko, whom he considers to be one of the greatest boxers of all time. "I'm very humbled and grateful for this opportunity," he said. "This is what I've been working for since the beginning. I'm just thankful and I'm ready." Klitschko, on the other hand, is aware of the challenge that Jennings poses. "Bryant Jennings is a very dangerous opponent," said Klitschko. "He's fast, he's quick, he's got great head movement. He's also very confident, and that's what I like about him." Klitschko's last fight in the USA was against Sultan Ibragimov in February 2008, which he won by unanimous decision. He has since fought exclusively in Europe, defending his titles against the likes of David Haye, Alexander Povetkin, and Kubrat Pulev. The return to Madison Square Garden is sure to bring back memories for Klitschko, who fought there twice during his early career. In 2000, he defeated American fighter David Bostice by TKO, and in 2005, he defeated American boxer Eliseo Castillo by unanimous decision. Klitschko has set his sights on unifying the heavyweight title by winning the fourth major belt, which is currently held by American boxer Deontay Wilder. "I want to be the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world," said Klitschko. "That's my goal, that's my dream, and I'm going to do everything I can to achieve it." The Klitschko vs Jennings fight is expected to be a great spectacle for fans of boxing, with two fighters in their prime going head-to-head for the world heavyweight title. Madison Square Garden will be packed for the event, with thousands of fans hoping to witness a piece of boxing history.
