Lee Weir, a 27-year-old from Auckland, recently had characters from the highly popular animated sitcom "The Simpsons" etched on his skin for life. This may not sound like a monumental news item but what sets Weir apart from the other tattoo collectors is the story that inspired his tattoo choice.

His father, who he affectionately refers to as the "real-life Ned Flanders," would not permit him to watch the show airing on television. Despite his father's strict "no cartoon" policy, Weir became a fan of "The Simpsons" in adulthood and has seen all 32 seasons of the beloved sitcom. To fulfill his desire to have a permanent tribute to the show, Weir approached a renowned tattoo artist, Benjamin Lloyd in early June. Lloyd, who hails from New Zealand and is known for his hyper-realistic tattoos, accepted the challenge and crafted an elaborate sleeve tattoo that covers Weir's arm from the shoulder to the wrist. The tattoo depicts the iconic Simpsons characters such as Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie in vivid detail. Weir shared photos of his impressive ink on social media, where it quickly went viral, garnering thousands of likes, comments, and shares. Weir's unique and personal backstory coupled with the intricate tattoo design touched a chord with people worldwide. The tattoo trend also spawned an online campaign by Simpson's fans worldwide encouraging other enthusiasts to etch the animated characters onto their skin. When asked about his thoughts on the tattoo's global impact, Weir humorously replied, "I'm just thrilled that I'm the guy that gets to forever be known as the insane person that got the 'Simpsons' tattoo! I think I got the most elbow nudges and awkward laughs out of everyone." Weir's story has undoubtedly cemented his love for the long-running series and the program's devoted following. Moreover, it highlights the significant role "The Simpsons" have played in shaping popular culture worldwide.
