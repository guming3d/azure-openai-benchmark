article: T-shirts, hoodies and even toy figurines bearing the ISIS logo are being sold on online and marketed across social media. For around $10 you can buy an ISIS shirt with the militant group's logo and phrases printed on it like "We are all ISIS" and "Fight for Freedom, Until the Last Drop of Blood." A toy soldier available on Rezji.com, an Indonesian site which by Tuesday could not be accessed, holds a gun in its hands and an ISIS flag with the Islamic tenet: "There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God." The websites are marketing the ISIS paraphernalia across social media. Facebook has been removing the pages once the media alerts them to their existence. "Where hateful content is posted and reported, Facebook removes it and disables accounts of those responsible," a Facebook spokesperson told CNN via email. CNN alerted Twitter to some of the merchants' pages on that social network, but Twitter declined to comment. Using merchandise to market itself as "cool" is a one of the common propaganda tools ISIS uses, according to researcher Hassan Hassan of the Delma Institute in Dubai. "The point is to encourage people to get out there and join the trend," Hassan said. Many of the websites with the merchandise come from Indonesia. While Middle East experts are unsure whether ISIS is manufacturing the products, terrorism researcher J.M. Berger says he wouldn't be surprised if the money ends up going to ISIS. "ISIS has a big base of support in Southeast Asia -- a long history with Islamism and jihadism. A number of foreign fighters come from the region," Berger wrote in an email to CNN. "Much radical activity is local: vigilante gangs and mainstream politics. For those who find those options lacking, ISIS seems to be the leading choice of outlet." While some of the Indonesian manufacturers of the ISIS merchandise may be opportunistic capitalists, others may be sympathetic to ISIS. On the Twitter feed of the Rezji manufacturers, they describe themselves in the Indonesian language as "distributors of anti-Western culture" and state "together we stand with you against the tyrants." In early 2014, the Institute for the Policy and Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) published a report that said the Syrian conflict was attracting foreign fighters from Indonesia. "Indonesian extremists are more engaged by the conflict in Syria than by any other foreign war in recent memory, including Afghanistan and Iraq," the report said. "As far as we know the number of Indonesian combatants is still in the dozens."

chatgpt: The availability of clothes emblazoned with ISIS slogans on various websites and social media platforms has raised alarms across the globe. Retail sites selling these clothes are reportedly located in Indonesia, where analysts warn that some may have sympathies towards the extremist group. The clothes featuring ISIS slogans have been found on multiple websites, including popular social media client Facebook. However, the tech giant revealed that it has been disabling accounts that sell these apparel items on its platform whenever they come to its notice. The use of clothes as a medium to display extremist views is not an isolated incident. In the past, ISIS has utilized similar methods to spread its message and attract followers. The extremists are known for using propaganda via social media to spread their message and influence public opinion. The retail sites in Indonesia that sell ISIS-branded clothing have raised concerns among government officials and experts. Many fear that the availability of such propaganda items poses a grave threat to national security. The Indonesian government has already cracked down on some online retailers that were selling ISIS-themed merchandise. Analysts have expressed concern about the rise of ISIS sympathies in Indonesia. The country has the world's largest Muslim population and is considered a crucial battleground in the fight against religious extremism. The Indonesian government has been working to curb the spread of extreme ideologies and preparing for any possible security threat. Meanwhile, the availability of ISIS-branded clothing on social media platforms like Facebook has caused outrage among users. Some users have reported seeing the merchandise being advertised directly to them, leading to criticism of the platform's content moderation efforts. The social media giant has been working to clamp down on misinformation and hate speech on its platform. However, the task of monitoring billions of pages and posts on Facebook is an uphill battle, and the platform has been criticized in the past for failing to remove extremist content from its site. The sale of clothes featuring ISIS slogans is yet another example of how the extremist group is leveraging social media to spread its message. Governments and tech companies must work together to prevent the sale and spread of such propaganda items. In conclusion, as the threat of extremist ideologies continues to linger, the availability of propaganda clothes must be taken seriously by all stakeholders. Countries, governments, and social media platforms must collaborate to put an end to the sale and spread of such items, which could be exploited to incite violence, spread hate, and encourage radical behavior.
