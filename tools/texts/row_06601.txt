article: A British-sounding parrot called Nigel went missing for four years - and came home with a Spanish accent. Nigel, who lived in Torrance, California with his British owner, Darren Chick, flew away one day in 2010, and was gone so long he was given up for lost. But, in a case of mistaken identity, Nigel was returned to another pet owner, who was also looking for their African grey parrot, and was able to pass him on to Chick. Long gone: African grey parrot Nigel, pictured, had been without his British owner for four years and had picked up Spanish instead . However, during his long absence, Nigel had forgotten all about his British roots - and started speaking Spanish. Rather than swapping pleasantries in English, the bird now fires off a 'Â¿Que pasa?' to passing humans, the Daily Breeze reported. After Nigel went missing, he lived in the wild - presumably around Torrance - until he was found a few months ago by a local business owner, Julissa Sperling. After hearing Nigel making noise outside her house, she took him in and searched for potential owners. Instead of his actual owner, she found an ad put out by Teresa Micco, a local vet. When the mistake emerged, Micco noticed that Nigel had a microchip, and used it to find Chick and reunite the two. Sperling, a Panamanian who speaks Spanish, said Nigel might have picked up some of her phrases while waiting in the shop. Coastal: Nigel went missing in the California town of Torrance, near Los Angeles . She said: 'He was the happiest bird. He was singing and talking without control. He was barking like the dogs. I'm from Panama and he was saying, "What happened?" in Spanish.' However, when Sperling handed Nigel over to Teresa Micco, a local vet, she realized he wasn't the right bird. Micco had been searching for her own African grey parrot, Benjamin, who flew away this February. But Micco was able to track down Chick with information from Nigel's microchip, and brought him home shortly after taking him in. She said: 'I introduced myself and said, "Have you lost a bird?" He initially said no. But he thought I meant recently.' When she verified Chick's name and said she had his African grey parrot, 'He looked at me like I was crazy.' Chick says last week's reunion brought tears of joy to his eyes - despite the fact that Nigel bit him when he first tried to pick him up. He said: 'He's doing perfect. It's really weird. I knew it was him from the minute I saw him.' Nigel is the fifth parrot guided home by Micco, who has been running ads for her own missing bird for nine months.

chatgpt: Once a British-accented African grey parrot living in California, Nigel's four-year disappearance was finally solved in 2014. However, his British accent was nowhere to be found. Instead, his vocabulary had become intermingled with Spanish words and phrases, leaving his past owner and caretakers with numerous questions. Nigel initially went missing in 2010, leaving owner Darren Chick distraught as the duo had an incredibly close bond. The search spanned for four long years until he was finally discovered by a dog-groomer in Panama by the name of Erika Guardia. Despite the shock of Nigel's appearance, Guardia knew one peculiar thing: the parrot spoke Spanish. Chick soon got word of Nigel's discovery, and once verified, was transported back to his Californian home. However, the remarkable transformation of Nigel's language continued to surprise anyone who interacted with him. It is presumed that during his years away from home, he most likely picked up phrases from Guardia or other Spanish speakers in Panama. This experience was an anomaly as parrots' abilities to pick up languages from humans are already impressive. However, Nigel's case was unprecedented, showcasing the malleability of a parrot's language capabilities. Many animal behaviorists studying the case found it intriguing how Nigel's accent had seemingly vanished, with his words now spoken in an entirely different inflection and tone. There have been various studies about parrots' mimicry abilities, with African grey parrots being the most impressive imitators in the bird family. Their ability to mimic sounds accurately has been documented in the scientific world, allowing researchers to learn more about the vocal learning mechanisms in birds. While Nigel's case was an interesting and unprecedented case, it left many scratching their heads. As far as we know, Nigel had not been in contact with any Spanish-speaking individuals before his disappearance. Still, he returned with a newfound bilingualism that fascinated animal psychologists and linguistics experts alike. Even though Nigel's experience was unparalleled, perhaps it serves as a reminder of the intricate communication abilities of animals. Nigel's story intrigues us because we never quite know how animals will surprise us next. His story will be an enduring mystery of the natural world, adding yet another fascinating layer to the world of animal communication studies.
