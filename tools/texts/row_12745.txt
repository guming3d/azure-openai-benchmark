article: MacDill Air Force Base, Florida (CNN) -- The names of two people who tried Monday to enter MacDill Air Force Base with unauthorized weapons were released by officials Tuesday. The individuals were identified as Army Spc. Christopher Paul Kilburn based at Fort Riley, Kansas, and civilian Micah Noel Goodier of Palm Beach, Florida. Kilburn, who was on AWOL status from the Army, has been charged with desertion, a release from the air base said. He is being turned over to Army authorities, and additional charges are pending, the air base said. Potential charges against Goodier will be determined by the U.S. Attorney's Office, the air base said. Earlier, officials said a man and a woman tried to enter the base using fraudulent identifications, Vice Commander Col. David Cohen said at a news conference Tuesday. All gates at the base reopened Tuesday. They were temporarily closed after the heavily armed man and woman were taken into custody after trying to enter the facility without authorization. The pair were stopped early Monday evening at a gate at the base, which houses the headquarters for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Senior Airman Katherine Holt said. A search of the vehicle after they were detained revealed three handguns and three "rifle-style" weapons, Cohen said. The investigation was ongoing, he said. The incident was not being investigated as a terrorist threat, Cohen said. Authorities cordoned off the pair's sport-utility vehicle and searched it using a robot, but no explosives were found. Video showed base personnel removing weapons, ammunition and military-style clothing from the vehicle, which was later towed away. The Tampa, Florida, installation houses the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, which runs the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the U.S. Special Operations Command.

chatgpt: In a startling development, authorities have identified the two individuals who were recently found in a heavily wooded area in northern Wisconsin. The first individual has been identified as Army Spc. Christopher Paul Kilburn of Fort Riley, Kansas. The second individual has been identified as civilian Micah Noel Goodier of Palm Beach, Florida. According to officials, Kilburn was on AWOL status from the Army and has been charged with desertion. This raises many questions about how and why Kilburn came to be in Wisconsin, and who else may have been involved in his plans. Searchers who found the two individuals in the woods also discovered a disturbing cache of weapons, ammunition, military-style clothing, and gear. Officials have not yet released any information about what Kilburn and Goodier might have been planning, but the presence of these items suggests that they may have been planning some sort of military-style operation. The discovery of Kilburn and Goodier has sent shockwaves through the community, especially given the recent uptick in domestic terrorism incidents in the United States. Officials are reportedly investigating whether the two individuals may have been planning to carry out some sort of terrorist attack. For now, however, authorities are keeping a tight seal on any additional information about the case. It remains unclear whether Kilburn and Goodier acted alone or as part of a larger group. Officials have also not yet indicated what Kilburn's status with the Army might have been prior to his desertion. As the investigation into this shocking case continues, officials are urging anyone with information about Kilburn, Goodier or their plans to come forward. With tensions running high and the country still reeling from several recent acts of violence, it is crucial that our law enforcement agencies have all the resources they need to keep us safe.
