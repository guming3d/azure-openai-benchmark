article: Ben & Jerry's has apologized for putting fortune cookies in pints of its "Taste the Lin-Sanity" frozen yogurt sold at its Harvard Square, Massachusetts, location in honor of basketball sensation Jeremy Lin. "We offer a heartfelt apology if anyone was offended by our handmade Lin-Sanity flavor," read a statement issued Friday on behalf of Ben & Jerry's Boston Scoop Shops. "We are proud and honored to have Jeremy Lin hail from one of our fine, local universities and we are huge sports fans. Our intention was to create a flavor to honor Jeremy Lin's accomplishments and his meteoric rise in the NBA, and recognize that he was a local Harvard graduate," the statement said. "We try (to) demonstrate our commitment as a Boston-based, valued-led business and if we failed in this instance we offer our sincere apologies." The fortune cookies have since been replaced with waffle cookies. The misstep isn't the only one that has surrounded the hype over the Asian-American guard for the NBA's New York Knicks. ESPN fired a writer over a controversial headline. The headline read "Chink in the Armor: Jeremy Lin's 9 Turnovers Cost Knicks in Streak-stopping Loss to Hornets." The phrase -- Chink in the Armor -- contains a word that has two meanings; one is an ethnic slur. An anchor who used the same phrase was suspended, the sports network said last Sunday. Lin, 23, came off the bench earlier this month to guide the Knicks to win after improbable win. The unlikely star of Taiwanese descent quickly turned into a global brand and "Linsanity" became the phrase of the times.

chatgpt: Jeremy Lin, the NBA superstar and Harvard graduate, is making headlines once again. This time, it's not his performance on the court, but rather a controversy sparked by a famous ice cream chain. Ben & Jerry's recently named a new flavor after the basketball player, named "Taste the Lin-Sanity". However, the flavor included fortune cookies as an ingredient. The use of fortune cookies, which are often associated with Asian culture in a stereotypical and offensive way, drew criticism from Lin's fans and followers. The ice cream shop quickly removed the ingredient from the flavor and issued a statement apologizing for offending anyone. However, the incident didn't stop there. A writer for ESPN published a headline that caused even more uproar. The headline read, "Chink in the Armor: Jeremy Lin's 9 Turnovers Cost Knicks in Streak-ending Loss to Hornets". The use of the word "chink", which is a derogatory term for people of Chinese descent, resulted in the writer's termination from ESPN. The sports network also issued an apology for the offensive headline. Lin spoke out on the issue, saying "I don't think it was on purpose or whatever, but they have apologized and so from my end I don't care anymore." He chose to focus on his performance on the court, and leading his team to victory. Jeremy Lin has been an inspiration to many, not only for his athletic achievements, but also for his education and commitment to his community. Despite the recent controversies, he remains a beloved figure in the world of basketball and beyond.
