article: (CNN) -- A father and son who tread water for more than 12 hours in the Atlantic Ocean before being rescued spent much of the time in the dark seas not knowing if the other was alive, authorities said Monday. A U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer gives a thumbs up after reaching Chris Marino. Walter Marino, 46, and his son Chris Marino, who has autism, were swimming in the Ponce Inlet, south of Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday when currents pulled the 12-year-old boy out to sea. His father jumped in to try to save Chris but was also pulled out to sea. Family members called 911, but by the time rescue units arrived, the father and son could no longer be seen, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard, the Volusia County Beach Patrol and the sheriff's office immediately launched a search-and-rescue mission using helicopters, boats and personal watercraft to try to find the Winter Park, Florida, father and son. "[We were] floating," Walter Marino told CNN affiliate WKMG-TV after the rescue. "We were floating and just waiting for help to come."  Watch the father thank rescuers Â» . Hoping to find the pair alive, the Coast Guard searched from Saturday night until early Sunday morning before suspending the search because of darkness, Coast Guard officials told CNN. Coast Guard officials told Lt. j.g. David Birky that he would be part of a backup crew to relieve the team from the night before. Birky told CNN the crew was set to do a search when the sun came up, but received a call while they were en route that a good Samaritan boat found Walter Marino about 7:30 a.m. Birky, the co-pilot of the crew, told CNN that after the father was found, they began searching that area for his son. Chris Marino was found two hours later, three miles from where his father was rescued. The Coast Guard lifted the boy into a helicopter, and both father and son were taken to Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach, where they were in good condition. Both were treated for dehydration, according to WKMG-TV. "The Coast Guard rocks," Walter Marino said as he was being transported to the hospital, according to WKMG-TV. "God bless the Coast Guard." While Walter Marino praised the Coast Guard for its rescue efforts, Birky said the true praise goes to the father and his young son. "That kid is an amazing kid," Birky said. "To tread water for almost 14 hours, I don't know about you, but I don't think I could do that. They have amazing willpower to be able to do it."

chatgpt: A leisurely day of fishing turned into a terrifying ordeal for a California father and son who were swept out to sea by strong currents. The father bravely jumped in after his son, but the two were eventually separated by three miles. According to witnesses, the father and son, whose identities have not been released, were fishing in the Pacific Ocean near San Francisco when they were carried away by the strong currents. A nearby boater spotted the father, who was flagging for help, and radioed the Coast Guard. The father later recounted their harrowing experience, saying, "We were floating and just waiting for help to come. We were both scared, but we kept telling each other that we were going to be okay." The father was eventually rescued by the boater, who brought him safely to shore. However, the son, who is autistic, remained missing for two hours. The Coast Guard launched a massive search effort, using helicopters and boats to comb the area. Finally, after two long hours, the Coast Guard spotted the young boy, still afloat in the ocean. He was quickly pulled from the water and transported to a nearby hospital for medical evaluation. Miraculously, both the father and son are expected to make a full recovery. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of the ocean and the importance of practicing safety measures. Strong currents and unpredictable weather conditions can quickly turn a fun day on the water into a life-threatening situation. "We can't stress enough how important it is to always wear a life jacket and stay within your limits," said a Coast Guard representative. "These two individuals are lucky to be alive, and we're grateful for the quick actions of the boater who found the father and the Coast Guard crews who located the son." The incident is also a powerful testament to the courageous spirit of parents who will stop at nothing to protect their children. The father's quick thinking and bravery may have saved both of their lives, despite the terrifying circumstances they found themselves in. The Coast Guard has issued a warning to all boaters, reminding them to be vigilant and cautious when out on the water. With summer in full swing, it's important to remember that even the most experienced swimmers and sailors can fall victim to the unpredictability of the ocean. Always take proper safety measures and keep a close eye on your loved ones.
