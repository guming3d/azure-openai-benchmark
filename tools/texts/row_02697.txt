article: (CNN) -- Mitt Romney is expected to announce his vice presidential running mate any day, and the certain GOP nominee's campaign is asking supporters to download "Mitt's VP" app, which has the primary purpose of sending a push notification with the name of Romney's choice to users before the official announcement to the press. For the impatient, the Tech President blog has brought up an interesting possible early indicator: activity on potential picks' Wikipedia pages. In the past, Wikipedia activity has spiked for vice presidential picks the day before an official announcement was made. In 2008, hours before Republican candidate John McCain announced his vice presidential choice, Sarah Palin's Wikipedia page was getting a heavy edit. According to The Washington Post, the then-Alaska governor's page was changed 68 times the day before the announcement. In the 24 hours leading up to Obama's running mate announcement, Joe Biden's page was edited 40 times. While there's no official list of people being considered by the Romney campaign, a few names have been bouncing around, including Rob Portman, Marco Rubio, Tim Pawlenty and Paul Ryan. The Tech President looked at Wikipedia activity for these and other potential choices on Monday, and though it found some interesting numbers, no one page has yet seen the one-day levels of activity experienced by Palin's and Biden's in '08. On Monday, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan had the most changes with 10, but on Tuesday, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman took the lead with 16 changes made by a Wikipedia user called River8009. The anonymous user deleted a section on controversies, a paragraph about NAFTA and various criticisms of Portman. When the seemingly biased edits were noticed, other Wikipedia users organized on Reddit message boards and acted to revert the changes and lock the page to prevent more tweaks. River8009 was flagged by Wikipedia for having a "possible conflict of interest." Marco Rubio's Wikipedia page was also quite active on Tuesday, and the comments on the changes are an interesting peek at the Florida senator's supporters and detractors. The primary argument was over whether to include a quote calling Rubio the "crown prince of the tea party movement," with some tea party members disputing the title. Recent Wikipedia edits could be the work of hopeful candidates wanting to look better to the Romney campaign as it deliberates (though a presidential candidate likely uses more than Wikipedia to vet vice presidential running mates). It is also possible the Romney campaign has learned from the past coverage of Wikipedia edits and will only make changes gradually leading up to an official announcement.

chatgpt: Wikipedia, the popular online encyclopedia, is known for its ability to provide information on millions of topics, from history to science and politics. However, in recent years, it has also served as a signal for the selection of vice presidential picks during the US elections. Whenever a candidate is about to be announced as a running mate, the activity on their Wikipedia page increases significantly. In the past, this trend has been observed time and again. For instance, the edits made to Sarah Palin's Wikipedia page increased dramatically before she was announced as John McCain's running mate in 2008. The same was true for Paul Ryan, who had a significant increase in the number of edits to his Wikipedia page before he was announced as Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012. Now, it seems that the trend has continued in the current US presidential race. Sen. Rob Portman, who is considered a potential running mate for Donald Trump, saw a spike in favorable edits to his Wikipedia page on Tuesday. While it is not clear who made the edits or why, the timing of these edits is certainly intriguing. According to a report by NPR, Sen. Portman's Wikipedia page had "positive edits that praised his accomplishments and highlighted his leadership." The report also noted that this trend was not seen on the pages of other potential running mates, such as Newt Gingrich or Chris Christie. This increase in activity on Sen. Portman's Wikipedia page has sparked speculation among political analysts about his chances of being selected as Trump's running mate. Some have suggested that the favorable edits could be an attempt to boost his profile and increase his chances of being chosen. Others have argued that the edits could be the work of supporters or even campaign staffers. Whatever the reason may be, the spike in activity on Sen. Portman's Wikipedia page is a clear indicator of the growing interest in the selection of Trump's running mate. This year's vice presidential selection is particularly important, given the controversial and divisive nature of Trump's candidacy. In conclusion, while Wikipedia edits may seem like a trivial indicator, they have proven to be a reliable signal for the selection of vice presidential picks in past elections. Sen. Rob Portman's recent spike in favorable edits is yet another example of this trend. Whether or not he is selected as Trump's running mate remains to be seen, but the interest in his candidacy is certainly on the rise.
