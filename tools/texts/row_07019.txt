chatgpt: Everton may have to wait to see what Chelsea's intentions are with regards to Romelu Lukaku. The Belgium international has enjoyed an impressive loan spell at Goodison Park and it seems as though the Toffees wouldn't mind making the deal permanent. However, Everton boss, Roberto Martinez, has admitted that they will need to see what Chelsea's plans are for the 20-year-old striker before making any moves. Lukaku was signed by Chelsea for a fee of Â£18m back in 2011, but has found first team opportunities hard to come by at Stamford Bridge. He has since had loan spells at West Brom and Everton, where he has impressed with his performances and goalscoring ability. Speaking to reporters, Martinez said, "We all know Romelu is a quality player and he has been magnificent for us this season. It's obvious we would like to keep him at the club, but at the end of the day, it will come down to Chelsea's intentions." The Toffee's boss believes that the sky is the limit for the young striker and believes that he has the potential to become one of the world's best. "He has all the attributes of a top striker - pace, power, technical ability and an eye for goal. He still has a lot to learn, but he has made tremendous progress since joining us and I have no doubt that he will continue to improve and develop into a top-class player." Lukaku has been a vital player for Everton this season, scoring 14 goals in 30 appearances in all competitions. His performances have been one of the main reasons behind the Toffees' push for a Champions League spot. It's no surprise that Everton would like to keep hold of Lukaku beyond this season, but whether Chelsea will be willing to sell remains to be seen. The Blues have struggled to score goals this season and with the future of Fernando Torres and Demba Ba uncertain, they may be reluctant to part with Lukaku. However, if the young striker continues to impress at Goodison Park and proves that he can replicate his form on a consistent basis, then Chelsea may find it hard to resist any offers that come their way. For now, though, Everton must wait and see and hope that Chelsea doesn't have any immediate plans for Lukaku's future.
