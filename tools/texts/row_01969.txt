While this bear might score 10/10 for cuteness, he has a lot to learn about playing hide and seek ... he can be seen from a mile off. The brown one-year-old bear gave up trying to climb the trunk's slippery bark and made do with cuddling it instead during playtime in the forest in Suomussalmi, in rural east Finland. It even looks like the youngster is trying to hide from his brother and sister as he creeps behind the tree, leaving just a furry ear poking out. You can't see me! The young bear does a bad job of making himself invisible before showing himself again . Photographer Valtteri Mulkahainen, 52, took the shots from the safety of a house about 10m away in a wildlife centre in the woods. Mr Mulkahainen said: 'The bears were around the house all night and the next morning. 'The mother bear was always nearby waiting for the cubs and when she felt they had played enough she would lead them further into the forest. 'I was very lucky; I've never seen anything like it and was pleasantly surprised that I could photograph the bears at such close hand. 'Most of all I liked the picture where the bear was hiding behind a tree and was seen only by his ear. How do you climb this thing? The cub tries several times to scale the smooth tree trunk before giving up and hugging it . He added: 'These cubs were very funny and cheerful. They constantly played with each other, fighting, tumbling and standing up on their hind legs. 'They repeatedly tried to climb the tree, but it was smooth, and so eventually they realised they were unable to climb on it.' Mr Mulkahainen, a married father of two who works as a PE teacher in Sotkamo, 70 miles from the centre, was bear-watching with three other tourists. They were visiting the Martinselkosen Erakeskus Wilderness centre in the eastern region of Kainuu. In walks Mama Bear: Photographer Valtteri Mulkahainen said the cubs' mother was never far away while the young bears played . What shall I do next with this tree? The cub has already tried climbing it, hiding behind it and cuddling it . With its lakes and uninhabited forests, Kainuu is a mecca for tourists keen to see wild animals up close. Mr Mulkahainen said: 'Bears are very cautious animals so it's rare to see them normally in the forest. 'In the forest, a person can pass by bears without noticing it, but an encounter with a bear always leaves a lasting impression. 'When you hear him breathing and growling five metres away from you, run.'
