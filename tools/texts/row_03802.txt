article: New York (CNN) -- Police took actor Charlie Sheen to a hospital early Tuesday after responding to a call at New York's Plaza Hotel concerning "an emotionally disturbed person," a law enforcement source said. Sheen's representative blamed an "adverse allergic reaction" to a medication for the hospitalization. "Charlie Sheen has been discharged from a hospital in New York and is returning to Los Angeles today," Sheen representative Stan Rodenfield said Tuesday afternoon. "Everything else is speculation." Police would only identify the man as a 45-year-old white male, but a law enforecement source who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak confirmed it was Sheen. Sheen is 45. A woman was in Sheen's hotel room when police arrived, the source said. The source would not identify the woman. An ambulance carried him from the hotel to New York Downtown Hospital at 1:30 a.m., a New York Police Department spokesman said. "What we are able to determine is that Charlie had an adverse allergic reaction to some medication and was taken to the hospital, where he is expected to be released tomorrow," Rosenfield said. Sheen spent at least a month this year at a Malibu, California, rehab center, but it was never disclosed what he was treated for there. A Colorado judge allowed the actor to count his time at Promises of Malibu toward a 30-day jail sentence after he entered a guilty plea in August to a charge in Aspen, Colorado. The plea deal reduced the charges from felony domestic violence charges to a misdemeanor third-degree assault count. The case stemmed from Sheen's arrest on Christmas Day after his wife, Brooke Mueller, told Aspen police he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home. Sheen's three months of unsupervised probation ends on November 2, according to an Aspen court official. Since police did not file charges relating to Tuesday's New York incident, it has no bearing on the Colorado case, the official said. The son of actor Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen recently signed a new contract last summer to continue with his hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men." CNN's Brittany Kaplan and Rachel Wells contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Actor Charlie Sheen was released from the hospital on Tuesday after it was confirmed by law enforcement that he was the individual who was hospitalized following an incident in his hotel room. Authorities were summoned to New York's iconic Plaza Hotel on Monday evening, where they found an unidentified woman in Sheen's hotel room. Law enforcement sources have declined to identify the woman or describe the nature of her relationship with the actor.  According to a police report, officers responding to the Plaza found an "emotionally disturbed person" in the room. The report states that the individual was yelling and throwing things in the room, leading to a 911 call from another guest at the hotel. It is unclear if this person is the same individual found with Sheen in the hotel room.  This is not the first time Sheen has made headlines for his personal life. The actor has a history of drug abuse and erratic behavior in his public life. However, it is worth noting that Sheen has been sober for over a year following a series of high-profile incidents that led to his hospitalization and rehab. Sheen has not yet publicly commented on the events at the Plaza Hotel. His publicist has declined to comment on the situation, citing privacy concerns. The incident has brought renewed attention to the issue of mental health and its impact on individuals and communities. It is essential to ensure that those struggling with mental health have access to the appropriate care and support they need to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.  The Plaza Hotel is known to attract high-profile guests and has been the site of several notable incidents over the years. However, incidents like this serve as a reminder that even the most glamorous locations can have underlying issues that need to be addressed. It remains to be seen what consequences Sheen may face, if any, as a result of this incident. However, as details continue to emerge, it will be interesting to see how this story develops and how it impacts both Sheen and the wider conversation about mental health.
