article: Two men accused of the rape and murder of four prostitutes while on parole face the possible death penalty after a grand jury in California agreed to send them forward for trial. Steven Dean Gordon, 45 and Franc Cano, 28, both of Anaheim, California were both indicted by the grand jury in Orange County for four felony counts of special circumstances murder during the commission of rape, kidnapping, lying in wait and multiple rape. They also face four felony counts of forcible rape. According to the Orange County District Attorney's Office, both men, upon conviction face a minimum sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Stephen Dean Gordon, left, and Franc Cano, right, face the death penalty after a grand jury in Orange County, California decided to indict them on four felony counts of murder and rape after a three-day hearing . Gordon and Cano were on parole at the time of the crimes and were wearing GPS tracking devices. The DA's office confirmed that the grand jury heard testimony from 16 witnesses over a three-day period before returning the indictment on the fourth day. Both men are expected back in court later today. They have been in custody since their arrest in April. Prosecutors say Cano and Gordon worked together to sexually assault and kill the California women while the men were wearing the tracking devices ordered after prior sex crimes. The monitoring systems helped investigators link the pair to the slayings earlier this year after the body of Jarrae Nykkole Estepp was found at an Anaheim household waste recycling facility. Messages were left for the men's attorneys seeking comment. Gordon and Cano were expected to be arraigned Friday in Orange County Superior Court. Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 21, from Oklahoma, left, whose body was found on a conveyor belt at a recycling centre in Anaheim prompted the initial investigation which led to the other cases including Martha Anaya, 28, right . Josephine Monique Vargas, left, andÂ Kianna Jackson, 20, right, were also raped and murdered . The case has raised questions about the effectiveness of GPS devices and other forms of parole supervision in tracking offenders and deterring them from committing new crimes. Parole records show the men had escaped supervision together before. In 2010, Cano cut off his GPS device and fled to Alabama, where he was arrested with Gordon. The two were arrested in Las Vegas two years later after cutting off their ankle bracelets, according to court records and state officials. In addition to Estepp, the men are charged with killing Kianna Jackson, 20; Josephine Monique Vargas, 34; and Martha Anaya, 28, last autumn in Santa Ana. Authorities searched for the bodies of the three women for months but gave up in August, saying it was unlikely they'd ever find them because too much time had passed.

chatgpt: Franc Cano and Steven Gordon, two convicted sex offenders, were indicted on Tuesday after a three-day grand jury hearing. The duo face four counts of felony murder in special circumstances, in addition to four felony counts of forcible rape. The crimes were committed while Cano and Gordon were on parole and subject to GPS tagging. The arrests came after an extensive investigation into the murders of Kianna Jackson, Josephine Monique Vargas, Martha Anaya, and Jarrae Estepp. Estepp, a 21-year-old woman, was found dead in a recycling bin in Anaheim in March 2014. The other women were found in or near an alley in Santa Ana over the course of a month. All four victims were strangled. Cano and Gordon were taken into custody in April, after authorities identified them as suspects in the crimes. Both have prior convictions for sex crimes. In 2004, Gordon was convicted of lewd acts on a child under the age of 14, while Cano was convicted of rape in 2008. During the grand jury hearing, prosecutors presented evidence that linked Cano and Gordon to the murders. Cell phone records showed that the men were in the same location as the victims at the time of their deaths. DNA evidence also linked the men to the crime scenes. According to Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, the special circumstances in Cano and Gordon's case are due to the fact that the murders were committed during the commission of a rape, burglary, and kidnapping. Both men face a minimum sentence of life without the possibility of parole, and could face the death penalty. "The Orange County District Attorney's Office will be seeking the death penalty against both defendants," Rackauckas said in a press conference on Tuesday. "We will do everything in our power to ensure justice is served for these victims and their families." The murders sparked outrage in the Santa Ana community, as well as concerns about the state's parole system. Cano and Gordon were both on parole at the time of the crimes, and were subject to GPS monitoring. Despite this, they were able to commit a series of murders over the course of a month without being caught. In the wake of the murders, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation launched an investigation into the state's parole system. According to a report released in June, the department found that GPS technology was not being used effectively to track parolees, and that many were able to commit crimes without being detected. The report also found that there was a lack of communication between parole officers and law enforcement authorities, which contributed to Cano and Gordon's ability to evade detection. The department has since implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving communication and tracking of parolees. The indictment of Cano and Gordon brings some closure to the families of the victims, who have been waiting for justice for over five years. It also serves as a reminder of the need for improvements in the state's parole system, to ensure that dangerous offenders are not able to commit crimes while on parole.
