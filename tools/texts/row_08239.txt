Leyla Ors, Joseph Gerard Cavallo and Emanuel Karl Hudson were charged with attempted extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion, conspiracy to receive a bribe and conspiracy to obstruct justice, according to a statement from the district attorney's office. In addition, Ors, 33, was charged with one count of offering to receive a bribe by a witness. Ors, a German national, told police in March that she had been raped, beaten and kept prisoner by Thamer Albalwi, the 23-year-old son of Sheik Monsur Albalwi, one of the wealthiest men in Saudi Arabia, the district attorney's office said. Ors was Alballwi's personal assistant. Scroll down for video . Flalse claims: Los Angeles attorney Joseph Cavallo has been charged with trying to extort money from a wealthy Saudi sheik . Based on her allegations, a physical examination and visible injuries, the junior Albalwi was charged March 13 with four counts of sexual assault. In June, prosecutors allege, Hudson, 58, called Thamer Albalwi's father and told him that for $15 million, Ors would not testify against the son and 'the case would be over.' On the same day, Cavallo, 58, allegedly called the sheik and demanded $20 million, saying an account would be set up in Lucerne, Switzerland, to receive the cash. The three were arrested last week. The attorneys were released on bail, but Ors remained in custody. Her scheduled arraignment Monday was postponed until Tuesday when she asked for a German interpreter. Cavallo was scheduled for arraignment on Tuesday, and Hudson is expected to be arraigned July 31. If convicted, each of the defendants could face up to four years behind bars. The sexual assault case against Thamer Albalwi was dismissed on Friday. His attorneys issued a statement Monday saying that an investigation showed the Albalwi family was 'the target of a sophisticated, international extortion scheme.' Attorney Alan Jackson said that Superior Court Judge James R. Dabney issued a rare finding of 'factual innocence' concurring with the district attorney's office that that 'Albalwi was falsely accused of sexually assaulting a woman visiting him in Los Angeles.' Albalwi provided police with telephone and credit card records, emails, text messages and surveillance video which showed the accuser's allegations were false, Jackson said. Thamer Albalwi issued a statement saying, 'I prayed that the truth would come out and, thanks to the American justice system, it did.'

chatgpt: A German national, Leyla Ors, made headlines as she accused Thamer Albalwi, the son of Sheikh Monsur Albalwi, of rape, beating and imprisonment in March. Ors worked as a personal assistant to Thamer Albalwi and claimed that she was held hostage in his apartment in Los Angeles. However, the charges against Thamer Albalwi have since been dropped, and prosecutors have alleged that Ors and her attorneys made up the story in an attempt to extort money from the sheikh. According to reports, Ors' attorneys, Joseph Cavallo and Emanuel Hudson, contacted Sheikh Monsur Albalwi and threatened to have Ors testify against Thamer Albalwi in court unless the sheikh wired $20 million to a Swiss bank account. However, prosecutors say Cavallo and Hudson made up the story and were attempting to extort the sheikh. Following the allegations, Ors has remained in jail, while Cavallo and Hudson are out on bail. If convicted, all three could face up to four years in prison. The case has raised questions about the credibility of sexual assault allegations and the importance of due diligence in pursuing claims. While it is crucial to support and believe survivors of sexual assault, false accusations can have devastating consequences. False accusations not only harm the accused individual but also undermine the credibility of real victims of sexual violence. False allegations can also have long-lasting legal, financial and reputational consequences. In this case, the allegations against Thamer Albalwi have been withdrawn, and the focus has shifted to the criminal behavior of Leyla Ors and her attorneys. The accusations made against Thamer Albalwi carry serious implications, and the decision to withdraw the charges should not undermine the importance of supporting and believing real victims of sexual violence. The case highlights the importance of the justice system to conduct a thorough investigation into sexual assault allegations before making an arrest or pressing charges. It is also crucial for the justice system to ensure the rights of both the accused and the accuser are protected. Overall, the Leyla Ors case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of false sexual assault allegations and the need for proper due diligence in investigating claims. The legal and personal consequences of such accusations are immense, and it is crucial to ensure that justice is served for all parties involved.
