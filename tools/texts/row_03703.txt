Zambia has banned the hunting of lions and other endangered wild cats because of the dwindling number of big cats. The country’s tourism minister said there is more value in game viewing tourism than bloodsports. 'Tourists come to Zambia to see the lion and if we lose the lion we will be killing our tourism industry,' Sylvia Masebo said. Ban: Zambia has become the latest African country to ban the hunting of lions and other endangered big cats . The estimated £2 million that Zambia earned from safari hunting of all its wild animals annually was too little to merit the continued depletion of Zambia’s wildlife, she said. 'Why should we lose our animals for £2 million a year? The benefits we get from tourist visits are much higher,' she said. The leopard population for the sprawling southern African country is unknown, while lion numbers are not believed to exceed around 4,500. Estimates for Africa’s total lion population vary from around 20,000 to 30,000, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The population on the continent is falling in the face of numerous threats, including conflict with livestock farmers and loss of prey and habitat. Zambia’s move follows neighbouring Botswana’s decision to ban all sport hunting from 2014 as it also works to promote itself as a game viewing destination. Wildlife-rich Kenya set this trend when it halted trophy and sport hunting decades ago. Lions and leopards are the feline pair of the so-called 'Big 5' group of dangerous African animals coveted by some trophy hunters. The others are elephant, rhino and Cape buffalo. But there are growing concerns about Africa’s big animals in the face of a surge in poaching of elephants for their ivory and rhino in South Africa for their horns to meet soaring demand from Asian countries.

chatgpt: The Tourism Minister of a Southern African country has announced that the government will no longer support hunting as a means of generating revenue. According to the minister, game viewing is a much more valuable activity that can benefit both the local economy and the environment. This decision comes after years of controversy surrounding bloodsports, which have long been a popular attraction for tourists seeking the thrill of the hunt. However, the practice has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years, as wildlife conservation efforts have gained momentum across the globe. The Southern African country used to earn £2 million a year from hunting, but the minister says that the potential benefits of game viewing far exceed that figure. In addition to providing a more sustainable source of income, game viewing has been proven to be more environmentally friendly, as it does not involve the killing of wildlife. The move follows a similar decision made by neighbouring Botswana, which banned hunting in 2014. Since then, the country has seen significant growth in its tourism industry, with visitors flocking to the country to observe the wildlife in its natural habitat. One of the primary concerns with hunting is the impact it has on lion populations across Africa. The majestic creatures have long been a sought-after trophy for big game hunters, with some estimates suggesting that as many as 600 lions are killed each year as part of the practice. However, lion populations across the continent have been dwindling in recent years due to a variety of threats. Habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching are all major factors that contribute to the decline in lion populations, and many conservationists are calling for increased efforts to protect these animals. By promoting game viewing as a more sustainable and ethical way to experience the beauty of Africa's wild animals, the Southern African country is aligning itself with the global trend towards responsible tourism. As more and more travellers become aware of the impact of their choices on the environment and communities they visit, this decision is likely to be welcomed by tourists and locals alike. In conclusion, the Southern African country's decision to abandon hunting in favour of game viewing is a significant step towards promoting responsible tourism and protecting the region's wildlife. As the lion population continues to face threats from a variety of sources, this move is one small but important contribution towards safeguarding these beautiful creatures for future generations.
