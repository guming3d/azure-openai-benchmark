Old Homestead Steakhouse in New York's Meatpacking district is hosting a $35,000 (£22,300) feast for four - that's $8,750 (£5,500) a head - making it the most expensive Thanksgiving feast of all time. What's more unbelievable, one group of four has already bought it (although its not yet been revealed who). Game bird: The meal includes turkey stuffed with seven pounds of ground Japanese Wagyu filet mignon . And it's not just a meal, but the ultimate American Thanksgiving experience that's up for grabs. Tourists with deep pockets will also be treated to four grandstand seats at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade; a $6,000 (£3,800) gift card to Bloomingdale's; and dancing lessons at Fred Astaire dance studios to learn the Turkey Trot, a popular dance from the early twentieth century. The food itself with include a nine-course meal with squab (young pigeon) stuffed with foie gras and soaked in Courvoisier L'Esprit Cognac ($5,000/£3200 a bottle) followed by roasted organic turkey stuffed with  seven pounds of  ground Japanese Wagyu filet mignon and gravy made with Château Mouton Rothschild ($1,750(£1,100)/bottle), widely regarded as one of the word's finest clarets. Finest dining: New York Old Homestead Steakhouse promises a dinner 'with attitude and personality' A serving of butternut squash will be infused with winter black truffles ($160£100/lb) and whipped sweet potatoes are topped with three pounds of Royal Osetra 000 caviar ($1,600£1,020/oz). The creamy mash potato is accompanied by Swedish moose cheese and the cranberry orange relish is made with Gran Marnier. To finish diners will get poached bourbon-soaked pears with pumpkin paste dusted with 24-carat gold flakes. Far from a dry lunch, the drinks menu is unsurprisingly lavish with fine wine, champagne and Scotch. No expense spared: A bowl of the potato mash with Swedish moose cheese, made from moose milk . Feast: The whipped sweet potatoes is topped with three pounds of Royal Osetra 000 caviar . 'Let's face it, Thanksgiving dinner is boring, basic, and frankly, unimaginative. We're taking all of the traditional holiday fare — the turkey, gravy, stuffing, pumpkin pie — to a creative level never seen before. It's turkey dinner with attitude and personality,' co-owner Marc Sherry told the New York Daily News. 'We know it's over-the-top expensive, but Thanksgiving comes once a year. If you can splurge for this, you have a lot to be thankful for.' For the less Amex-ready the restaurant also has a $65 (£40) Thanksgiving package that comes with turkey, stuffing and the rare opportunity to watch four people eat a $35,000 dinner. Thanksgiving is celebrated every forth Thursday in November and every second Monday in October in Canada.
