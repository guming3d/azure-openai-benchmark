article: Russian customs officer opened luggage belonging to the band Roxette and posted pictures of themselves with the musical instruments. The stunt was exposed when fans of the group spotted the images on social media in Russia and sent them to the band's management. Roxette, a Swedish pop rock duo fronted by Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, are in Russia performing 13 dates across the country as part of their current world tour. Fans spotted the images of Roxette's musical instruments online, with the duo Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle pictured performing here, and sent them to the band's management who contacted airport officials . An official in Domodedovo airport, pictured left, marvels at a drum belonging to Roxette, while photos of the instruments were later posted on social in media in Russia, pictured right, alerting the group's management . Roxette's equipment was transported through Moscow's Domodedovo airport for their 13 concerts in Russia . The band said it would not make a formal complaint because nothing was taken from the luggage. The photographs were taken by customs officials working in the Russian capital Moscow's Domodedovo airport. They show luggage containing the band's equipment had been opened and photographed, in some cases with airport workers in the pictures. The pictures were then passed on to the band, who posted them online themselves to show the sort of problems they face during their tour. Mikky Lindstorm, 42, who is running the tour by the Swedish band, said it was clear the images were taken at the airport but that it seemed nobody wanted to comment on the matter. He said it was not the first time the band suspected its equipment, which was clearly labelled as being property of Roxette, had been opened and messed around with. However, he said they would not be making a complaint because technically nothing was missing and therefore no crime had been committed. The Scandinavian duo, which formed in 1986, shot to fame three years later with the hit song 'The Look' from their 'Look Sharp' album. The tune hit number 1 in the Billboard US charts. The pop rock pair, with Fredriksson, 56 on vocals and Gessle, 55, on vocals and guitar, will take their current world tour  to countries including Lithuania, Estonia, Finland and Australia and New Zealand.

chatgpt: Officials from Moscow's Domodedovo airport have found themselves in hot water after snaps of musical equipment were posted online by workers. Fans spotted the equipment on social media, leading to Roxette's followers sending the pictures to the Swedish duo's management. The equipment in question were drums, which were allegedly found in a restricted area of the airport. The photos, which were posted on social media, showed the drums being loaded onto a truck. It is unclear why the equipment was at the airport or what it was intended for. However, the airport officials have confirmed that the workers responsible for the mishap have been identified. Despite the band's fans sending the pictures to Roxette's management, the band has indicated that it will not be making a complaint. In a statement, the band said, "No crime has been committed, and we are happy to move on from this incident." The incident is yet another example of the power of social media to hold people and organizations accountable. The fact that fans were able to spot the equipment and raise the alarm is a testament to the power of community action. It is not clear what actions the airport will take against the workers responsible. However, given the sensitive nature of airport security, it is likely that the workers will face disciplinary action. This incident serves as a reminder to all workers to be careful with what they share online. Social media is an incredibly powerful tool but can also be a liability if not used responsibly. Overall, this is a cautionary tale for anyone working in a sensitive industry. The consequences of mishandling equipment or breaching security can be severe, and the power of social media means that those responsible may not be able to escape scrutiny.
