chatgpt: Pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine have released three Ukrainian prisoners of war on Wednesday. The release comes after months-long captivity of these Ukrainian soldiers. The mother of one of the captives was seen embracing her son after his release, as they both shed tears of joy. However, reports suggest that the planned major prisoner exchange between Kiev and the rebels has been delayed by a day. Both the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russian rebels were due to release hundreds of prisoners on Wednesday. According to sources, the delay is due to technical reasons. The planned exchange of prisoners is seen as a significant step towards easing tensions and bringing lasting peace to the war-torn region. The last major prisoner exchange between Ukraine and the rebels was in 2019, where the two sides swapped more than 200 prisoners. The release of these three prisoners was welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is committed to ending the conflict in the eastern Donbas region. The conflict started in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Crimea, and has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Zelensky's administration has made the release of prisoners a top priority, aiming to bring prisoners of war back to their families and loved ones. In September 2019, Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to exchange all remaining prisoners, one of the key issues in the peace negotiations. However, progress has been slow, and several rounds of talks have failed to yield a breakthrough. The Ukrainian side has been putting pressure on the pro-Russian separatists to release prisoners, with Zelensky ordering increased efforts to bring prisoners home. The release of these three prisoners is seen as a positive sign, with hopes that the major exchange of prisoners will take place soon. The release of the Ukrainian prisoners is a result of joint efforts from various international organizations and countries involved in the peace talks. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, France, and Germany have all been actively involved in negotiations to bring peace to the region. As the scheduled exchange of prisoners was postponed, it is uncertain whether the exchange will take place as planned. However, the release of these three Ukrainian prisoners is a significant step towards the release of all prisoners of war and helps to build confidence between the conflicting parties.
