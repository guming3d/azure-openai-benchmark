Now those birthing pains are being felt by men in China. On Mother's Day on Sunday, male volunteers in Nanchang City, in south China's Jiangxi province, were hooked up to complex machines that provided them with a painful taste of what women go through in labour.

Some 20 men went on a local TV show to submit to the pains that women endure. The challenge consisted of ten levels of pain with an agony scale from 50 to 500.

chatgpt: On Mother's Day in the Chinese city of Chongqing, 20 brave men stepped up to experience the pain of childbirth through a unique experimental event. These volunteers were hooked up to machines that simulated the contractions and pain experienced during labor, leaving them writhing and screaming in agony. The event, organized by a Chinese TV channel, aimed to help men better understand the physical pain and emotional distress of childbirth. The machines had an "agony scale" ranging from 50 to 500, and the volunteers were given electric shocks to simulate the pain of contractions. Among the participants was British singer, Kym Marsh, who agreed to take part in the event as an advocate for fetal and maternal health. Marsh, who played a midwife on the TV show "Coronation Street," wanted to raise awareness about the difficulties and pain women go through while giving birth. The event was not without controversy, as some critics argued that the simulation was not an accurate reflection of the real pain of childbirth. However, the organizers defended the experiment, stating that it was meant to give men a better understanding and appreciation for what women go through during labor. The participants' reactions were varied, with some unable to cope with the intensity of the shocks and others lasting longer than expected. One man remarked that the pain was "unbearable," while another begged for mercy as he writhed in agony. The event received mixed responses on social media, with some viewers praising the participants for their bravery while others criticized the experiment as unnecessary and painful. Despite the controversy, the organizers hope that the event raised public awareness about the difficulties and pain of giving birth. While the experiment may not have been a perfect simulation of childbirth, it did offer a glimpse into the physical and emotional pain that women endure during labor. It also provided a platform for discussing the need for better support and resources for pregnant women and mothers. In the end, the event was a reminder that childbirth is a painful and challenging experience that deserves our respect and understanding. The brave participants who endured the pain of the simulation deserve recognition for their willingness to step outside their comfort zones and gain a better appreciation for the sacrifices that women make during childbirth.
