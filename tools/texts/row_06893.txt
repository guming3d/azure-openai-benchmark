chatgpt: Aleks Mijatovic, an avid fisherman from Berkeley, California, has come up with a unique solution to keep himself warm while fishing in cold weather. Mijatovic would often feel the chill while fishing in the colder months, which would often make it difficult for him to fully enjoy his favorite hobby.  To tackle this problem, Mijatovic got creative and designed a coal-fired backpack that could keep him warm while he was out fishing. He used scrap metal from his home to create the unique design, which not only keeps him warm but also doubles as a portable cooker to cook his catch while he continues to fish. Mijatovic's invention has already created quite a buzz in the local fishing community. Fellow fishermen have often been amazed by how he is able to stay warm and cook his catch at the same time. They have described the invention as both "ingenious" and "revolutionary." The backpack works by using a coal-fired stove that heats the metal frame of the backpack, providing a source of warmth for the wearer. The stove is also connected to a small cooking surface that can be used to cook small fish or other catches. Mijatovic believes that his invention could be a game-changer for outdoor enthusiasts, as it provides a sustainable source of heat and cooking while also being environmentally friendly. The backpack is designed to run on coal, a relatively cheap and abundant fuel source, making it both accessible and affordable for most people. Mijatovic has also been approached by several investors who are interested in turning his invention into a commercial product. He is excited about the possibility of taking his invention to the next level and making it available to a wider audience. Not everyone, however, is thrilled about Mijatovic's invention. Some environmental groups have raised concerns about the use of coal as a fuel source, arguing that it is a dirty and unsustainable source of energy. Mijatovic, however, has defended his invention, arguing that it is a more sustainable and practical alternative to other sources of heat and cooking while fishing. Despite the controversy, Mijatovic's invention has certainly stirred up quite a bit of excitement in the fishing community. It remains to be seen whether the backpack will catch on as a widely used product, but it certainly represents a unique and innovative approach to solving a common problem faced by outdoor enthusiasts.
