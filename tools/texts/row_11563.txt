article: Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Somalia's top militant group may soon counter the government's recent thrust against them with an offensive of their own. African Union intelligence sources say Al-Shabaab is massing hundreds of troops in the African nation's embattled capital of Mogadishu for a show of force during the Muslim month of Ramadan, which begins Monday. The sources said Al-Shabaab received a shipment of weapons by sea in preparation for this offensive. They believe that Al-Shabaab allies in Yemen shipped the items across the Red Sea to Somalia. Ramadan is a period of fasting and religious reflection. Islamic radicals have chosen the period to carry out attacks against their enemies during the holy month. Fighting has intensified this summer as Somali government forces -- backed by troops from the African Union -- have battled insurgents from the militant Al-Shabaab. Somali government forces on Thursday launched an offensive on Islamist strongholds in northern Mogadishu. The U.N. refugee agency on Friday expressed concerns about "the protection of civilians" in Mogadishu amid the fighting. But African Union forces said the offensive was launched to counter Al-Shabaab attacks on displaced persons camps. "An offensive on Thursday by pro-government forces in and around the important Bakara and Balcad markets has increased the risk for Mogadishu's citizens as well as the estimated 100,000 internally displaced people (IDP) who have fled drought and famine in neighbouring regions in recent months," the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. Since September, African Union forces said they have steadily been taking territory in the capital from Al-Shabaab. The fighting comes also as Somalia is battling its worst drought in 60 years and tens of thousands of famine-stricken people are walking for days into both Kenya and Ethiopia in search of food and water and away from the conflict between government forces and rebels. The United Nations on Friday said it is asking for a further $1.4 billion to help starving people across the Horn of Africa. The request lifts the Horn of Africa appeal to $2.4 billion, of which $1 billion has been received so far. "More than 12 million people -- in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti -- are in dire need of help, and the situation is getting worse," said Valerie Amos, U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator and head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. "If we are to avoid this crisis becoming an even bigger catastrophe, we must act now." Meanwhile, Erastus Mwencha, the African Union Commission deputy chief, visited Mogadishu to assess the humanitarian situation and announced an international pledging conference August 9 in Ethiopia. The African Union has already donated $500,000 of assistance in the famine.

chatgpt: The African Union has announced a pledging conference to seek international support for the ongoing famine crisis in the Horn of Africa. The conference, which is set to take place in the coming weeks, aims to raise funds for the millions of people affected by the severe drought and famine in the region. The announcement came as the African Union sources reported that the terrorist group Al-Shabaab had received a shipment of weapons by sea. This has raised fears that the group may use the weapons to escalate its terrorist activities in the region, worsening the already dire humanitarian situation. In response, the government forces launched an offensive against the group on Thursday, in an effort to regain control of the areas affected by the group's activity. The offensive, which was supported by airstrikes, has reportedly led to significant gains for the government forces in the region. Despite these efforts, the situation in the Horn of Africa remains critical, with millions of people facing starvation and displacement. The United Nations has once again issued an appeal for aid money, calling on the international community to step up and provide urgent humanitarian support to those affected by the crisis. According to the UN, around 12 million people across the region are in urgent need of assistance, including food, water, and medical supplies. The organization has warned that without immediate and substantial aid, the crisis could worsen, with many people at risk of starvation and disease outbreaks. Many aid organizations have been working hard to support those affected by the crisis, providing emergency relief and working with local communities to develop sustainable solutions. However, the scale of the crisis and the ongoing conflict in the region have made it difficult for aid organizations to reach all those affected. The pledging conference announced by the African Union is therefore seen as a critical step in bringing greater attention and resources to the crisis. The conference is expected to bring together leaders and officials from across the region and around the world, with the goal of raising funds and mobilizing support for the millions of people affected by the crisis. As international attention turns to the situation in the Horn of Africa, many are now calling for a coordinated and sustained effort to address the underlying issues that have led to the crisis. This will involve not just providing emergency relief, but also investing in long-term solutions that build resilience and reduce vulnerability to future humanitarian crises. As the situation in the Horn of Africa continues to unfold, it is clear that the crisis is far from over. However, with greater investment and support, there is hope that the region can begin to recover and rebuild, providing a brighter future for millions of people affected by the crisis.
