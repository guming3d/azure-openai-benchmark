Bonnie: Gail Castle allegedly robbed a Bank of America, and used an old man as her unwitting accomplice . An elderly man who was only trying to sell his car unwittingly became her getaway car driver after the woman taking it on a test drive tried to rob a bank. Gail Castle, 51, had asked if the 83-year-old man, who declined to be identified, would mind her taking the car out for a drive before she bought the 1994 Chrysler 5th Avenue. But after making a pit stop at a Bank of America branch in Sacramento, the man knew something was wrong when he heard sirens behind them. Castle was attempting to buy the man’s decades old car for around $2,200. The man told KTXL that she asked to go for a short drive and needed to stop at the bank before purchasing his vehicle. He drove her to the Bank of America branch in Manteca, California. The bank was quite full, so the man was shocked to see Castle reappear a short time later with dozens of bills in her purse. Thinking nothing of it, the man began driving back to his house to complete the sale. But that’s when he heard sirens. The Manteca Bulletin snapped a picture of the would-be Bonnie Parker as she was arrested by police. Castle allegedly stole more than $2,000 from the bank, KTXL reported.

The man was handcuffed and taken to a squad car. But Castle wasn’t going to give up without a fight. The Bulletin reports that the petite 51-year-old woman attempted to flee and was shot by a taser.

chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, a 51-year-old woman from Springfield, Massachusetts was arrested on Thursday for allegedly using an 83-year-old man as an accomplice in a bank robbery. Gail Castle purportedly coerced the elderly man into assisting her in the crime, promising him a share of the loot if he helped her carry it out. The elderly man, who had been trying to sell his 1994 Chrysler 5th Avenue, was allegedly duped into driving them to the bank, where they proceeded to commit the robbery. According to authorities, Castle had planned the bank heist for weeks and had been scouting potential accomplices. She came across the elderly man while he was trying to sell his car and convinced him to help her in the robbery. Castle allegedly promised the man a significant share of the money she intended to steal, luring the elderly man into her scheme. On the day of the incident, Castle and the elderly man drove to the bank, with the elderly man unaware of her plans. Castle allegedly entered the bank and brandished a handgun, demanding cash while the elderly man waited outside in the car. Witnesses reported seeing Castle fleeing the bank with a bag filled with cash, which she reportedly shared with her accomplice. Police officers were quick to respond to the scene and managed to catch up with Castle and the elderly man. They were both taken into custody for questioning, and evidence tying them to the crime was reportedly found in their possession. Castle has been charged with bank robbery and the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, while the elderly man is being treated as a witness. The incident has sent shockwaves throughout the local community, with many questioning how this could have occurred. The elderly man’s family members have expressed concern for him, stating that he is a vulnerable individual who may have been taken advantage of by Castle. This case highlights the importance of looking out for vulnerable individuals in our communities, especially the elderly. It is crucial that we ensure that they are not taken advantage of or put in harm's way by individuals seeking to exploit them for their own gain. The police officers involved in this case have urged members of the public to come forward with any information that may help in their investigation. The 83-year-old man has since been released from police custody and is reportedly recovering from the ordeal. It is unclear what the future holds for him or Castle, who could potentially face a lengthy prison sentence if found guilty of the charges. This disturbing incident serves as a cautionary tale for all of us and serves as a reminder of the need to remain vigilant and look out for one another in these trying times.
