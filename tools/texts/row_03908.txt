Although the team have refused to reveal any details of the hologram, it is believed it was created using an updated version of an illusion known as 'Pepper's ghost'. The same technique was used used at Coachella to 'resurrect' slain rapper Tupac. That hologram effect was created using a system developed by London-based Musion, which employs an advanced version of Pepper's Ghost to great effect. While the traditional illusion uses light partially reflected off a pane of glass, Musion's version involves a custom-developed foil to create more believable images. 'Yoshiki unveiled a never before seen classical concert performance at FLAUNT Magazine's party celebrating its upcoming List Issuem,' the musician said on his YouTube page. 'Yoshiki mesmerized the audience at Austin's Qui as he performed a piano duel with a hologram of himself, resulting in a passionate and dramatic musical experience celebrating the artistry of the multi-talented, classically trained musician.' The musician has been experimenting with holograms for several years, long before the technology was used by more mainstream artists. It was most famously used in 20012 at the Coachella festival where Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre brought back late rapper Tupac Shakur for their headline performance.

chatgpt: In what could be considered as a remarkable milestone in the music industry, artists have taken to using holograms on stage, similar to the ones used to "resurrect" rapper Tupac at Coachella Festival. The use of holograms on stage has been an ongoing experiment for four years, with artists exploring the technology's capabilities to provide a unique experience for concert-goers. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival saw history being made in 2012 when rapper Tupac Shakur was brought back to life on stage as a hologram to perform alongside Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. The controversial performance sparked conversations on the possibility of using technology to immortalize deceased artists and bring them back to perform for their fans. The technology behind the hologram was developed by Digital Domain, a company specializing in Hollywood visual effects. Since then, artists have been experimenting with the use of holograms on stage to provide a unique experience for concert-goers. One of the most notable examples was the performance by deceased vocalist Roy Orbison. Hologram USA and BASE Hologram collaborated to create a virtual Orbison that went on tour in 2018, performing alongside other musicians for a series of concerts. The technology behind these holograms works by projecting a 3D image of the artist onto a transparent screen made of a special material called Mylar. The image is then illuminated with high-intensity light to create the illusion of a hologram. The technology has been steadily improving, with more realistic and interactive holograms being developed over the years. The use of holograms on stage has been met with a mixed response from music critics and fans alike. Some argue that it is a fitting tribute to the artist's legacy, while others believe it is a gimmick used to cash in on the artist's name. Others have raised ethical concerns over the use of deceased musicians' images without their consent. However, it cannot be denied that the technology has opened up new possibilities for creating unique experiences for concert-goers. One of the most exciting aspects of this technology is its potential to bring artists who are unable to perform live due to health issues back to the stage. Earlier this year, ABBA announced that they would be reuniting in the form of digital avatars for a series of concerts. The tour, titled "ABBA Voyage," will feature the band members in their prime performing alongside a 10-piece live band and a choir. The use of technology will enable the band to perform together again, despite their age and physical limitations. In addition to musical performances, holograms are also being used to create immersive experiences for fans. For instance, the Whitney Houston hologram went on tour in 2020, offering fans an interactive experience that allowed them to dance with a virtual version of the late singer. The experience was created in collaboration with Houston's estate and features some of her greatest hits. In conclusion, the use of holograms on stage has become an increasingly popular trend in the music industry. While there are still concerns over the ethical implications of using deceased musicians' images without their consent, the technology has opened up new possibilities for creating unique experiences for fans. As the technology continues to improve, we can expect to see more holographic performances and immersive experiences in the future.
