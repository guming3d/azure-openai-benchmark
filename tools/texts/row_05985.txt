article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- The plan to raise what would be the world's tallest building in a dizzyingly fast time is in danger of not getting off the ground at all. According to reports in Chinese state media, Broad Group, the developers for Sky City, have so far failed to get the proper permits required to proceed with construction. The company put the first spade in the ground in the 202-story project to much fanfare on July 20. Developers hope it could be built within the year. The 838-meter construction in Changsha, the capital of China's central Hunan province, would rise ten meters higher than the world's current tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. "Broad is still currently in the beginning stages of arranging the construction project," a Changsha Urban Planning Department representative told CNN. "So far, they've undergone the process to obtain 136 mu [22 acres] of land, but that's it. They're still in the very basic beginning stages. We've been giving a lot of attention to this case, and everything they've done has been according to law." For its part Broad Group insisted everything was above board. "We have not yet started work on Changsha's Sky City," a Broad Group press officer told CNN. He added that they have evidence to show no laws have been broken. Penalties for illegal construction vary widely across China between the countryside and cities, as well as between residential and commercial use. In Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, baseline fines for illegal construction range from 5% to 10% with investigative fees as much as doubling the amount. Additional penalties for various infractions can then double the original fine, according to one official government website. In the southwest megacity of Chongqing, the fine for the illegal construction of a commercial building is 50% of the cost of construction, according to another government site. If similar penalties exist in Changsha as for Chongqing, Broad Group could be fined nearly $750 million. Sky City's total construction cost is $1.46 billion. Construction advocates have touted Sky City's green credentials: It will save on energy and land use, creating an all-in-one home, office, shopping, farming and recreation environment for some 30,000 residents that no one ever needs to leave. Critics -- including architectural experts and the Chinese public -- worry about safety because of the use of non-traditional building techniques and the pace of construction. Broad Group pioneered the use of pre-fabricated steel-and-concrete blocks -- akin to Lego blocks -- that can be quickly hoisted into place. While the Burj Khalifa took five years to build, Broad Group says this "fast-building technology" means it can construct Sky City in just ten months. Sky City will be completed in April 2014, said Broad Group in earlier statements. However when questioned by CNN, the company's press officer hesitated to provide a start date for construction. He added that plans will be announced at an as-yet unscheduled future press conference, leaving construction plans for Sky City firmly frozen on the ground.

chatgpt: The Sky City in Changsha, China, which was intended to be the world's tallest building, has hit a speed bump as the Chinese state media has reported that it does not have the necessary permits to start construction. Sky City, a project by Broad Group, was set to rise 838 meters above the ground but has yet to acquire the necessary legal documents to begin work.  The Broad Group's project would have been a towering achievement, as it was designed to be taller than the current record holder, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which stands at 828 meters. However, the project has encountered a setback as the Chinese authorities have stated that it is still awaiting appropriate permission to begin construction.  When asked about the issue, Broad Group spokesperson commented to CNN, saying, "We have not yet started work." The spokesperson added that the company remains committed to the project and is working closely with the Chinese authorities to ensure that they obtain the necessary permission to proceed soon.  The Sky City project was set to be completed in April 2014, utilising pre-fabricated steel-concrete blocks as its primary construction material. The Broad Group believes this will significantly reduce construction time and costs compared to traditional building methods.  Despite the delay in acquiring official permits, the Broad Group remains optimistic about the project, emphasising that they have taken all the necessary precautions to meet building standards and environmental regulations, and is confident of obtaining the necessary permission soon.  If the project goes ahead, the Sky City will be located in the heart of the rapidly developing city of Changsha in Hunan province, serving as a star attraction and a testament to China's rapid technological progress. Construction would take only 90 days compared to the more than seven years it took to build the Burj Khalifa. There would also be numerous commercial and residential spaces available in the building, including apartments, shops, hotels, and offices.  However, the Sky City project has undergone several controversies along the way. Critics have raised concerns about the safety and environmental impact of the rapid and low-cost construction method. Meanwhile, the project also drew criticism for its design, which some consider to be a similarity to the 2008 Olympic Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing.  Despite these concerns, the Broad Group remains steadfast in their commitment to the project, with their focus clearly on obtaining the official permits required to commence construction. If Sky City does eventually reach completion, it would undoubtedly become a symbol of China's continued economic transformation and a mecca for tourists and locals alike.
