article: (CNN)  -- A U.N.-backed military operation to thwart rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo has led to deliberate killings of more than 1,400 civilians in the country over a nine-month period, Human Rights Watch said Monday. The human rights organization's report accuses militants and Congolese soldiers of brutal attacks, and urges the United Nations to end support for the military operation and find other ways to establish security. Attacks include chopping civilians to death with machetes and slitting the throats of others. The attacks occurred between January and September, according to the report. Human Rights Watch said it based its findings on interviews with more than 600 victims, witnesses and relatives. More than 7,500 women and girls were sexually abused in eastern Congo during the same period, Human Rights Watch said. "Continued killing and rape by all sides in eastern Congo shows that the U.N. Security Council needs a new approach to protect civilians," said Anneke Van Woudenberg, senior researcher at the organization. "The security council should send a group of experts to Congo to kickstart a serious civilian protection plan." Congolese forces have been battling Rwandan Hutu rebels who fled to Congo after participating in a Rwandan genocide that left at least 800,000 people dead. A U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as MONUC, backs the operation. The United Nations has said that overall, the mission is working to boost stability and protect civilians. However, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hinted at high death tolls last week, saying that the military operations have come at a "high humanitarian cost." The Congolese armed forces and the rebels have violated human rights, Ban said. The peacekeeping mission has urged the government to address the problem, he added. Human Rights Watch said the operations to oust rebels have not met expectations, and civilian casualties greatly outnumber the damage to rebels. "Government representatives said the operations would bring peace and security to the region. They have not," the New York-based agency said. War-torn Congo is rich in natural resources, including diamonds, gold and coltan, but most of its population lives in poverty because of the conflict. The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to vote soon on whether to renew the peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

chatgpt: Congo is a country that is endowed with vast natural resources such as diamonds, cobalt, copper and gold among others. Despite this, the country has been mired in conflict for several years, leading to widespread poverty among its citizens. The violence in Congo is often linked to the presence of Rwandan Hutu rebels who fled to the country after the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s. Recently, clashes between Congolese forces and the Rwandan rebels have intensified, leading to a surge in violence against civilians. Residents in the affected areas have reported gruesome attacks, including the chopping of civilians to death with machetes and the slitting of throats of others. According to reports, the Rwandan Hutu rebels have been targeting communities in response to the efforts by the Congolese military to flush them out of their hideouts in the country's eastern region. The United Nations peacekeeping mission, known as MONUC, has been backing the Congolese military operation to restore peace in the country. The mission has been in Congo for several years, working alongside Congolese authorities to protect civilians and support efforts to end the violence. In their latest efforts, the peacekeeping forces worked alongside the Congolese military to launch a counter-offensive against the Rwandan Hutu rebels, who were reportedly holed up in the hills near the border with Rwanda. The clashes between the Rwandan rebels and the Congolese military have raised concerns about the safety of civilians in the region. Reports indicate that thousands of residents have been forced to flee their homes and take refuge in makeshift camps amid the violence. Humanitarian agencies have been providing assistance to the affected communities, but there are concerns about the long-term impact of the conflict on the wellbeing of the citizens. The conflict in Congo highlights the challenges faced by the country in harnessing its natural resources to improve the lives of its citizens. The ongoing conflict has hampered economic growth and development, leading to widespread poverty and human suffering. Efforts by the Congolese government, backed by international partners, to address the root causes of the conflict and restore peace must be intensified to ensure that the people of Congo can enjoy the benefits of their country's natural wealth.
