The impact of the crash was so severe that the tractor overturned, leaving debris scattered in its wake. The scene of the accident was littered with broken glass, upturned flower pots, and mangled metal. The front garden, which had been lovingly tended to by the homeowners, was now a chaotic mess. Emergency services were quickly on the scene to attend to any injuries or medical needs. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the incident.
