chatgpt: A New York Police Department (NYPD) officer has surrendered after being caught on camera attacking a female worker of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The officer had grinned while fleeing the scene, but he turned himself in after the NYPD circulated the video and identified him as the assailant. The attack occurred on Tuesday when the officer, whose name has not been released, grabbed the MTA worker, threw her to the ground, and choked her. The disturbing incident was captured by surveillance cameras, which showed the officer leaving the scene with a smirk on his face. The video was released by the NYPD in hopes of identifying the suspect, and it didn't take long for them to receive several calls, all pointing to one man - one of their own police officers. The officer in question quickly turned himself in to authorities and has been suspended without pay, pending the outcome of the investigation. The officer has claimed that he attacked the MTA worker in self-defense, alleging that she tried to grab his phone. However, the video tells a different story, showing the officer initiating the altercation and assaulting the worker without any provocation. The incident has left many New Yorkers stunned and outraged, and the MTA workers' union has called for an independent investigation. They have also expressed concerns about the safety of their members, especially as attacks against transit workers have been on the rise in recent years. In a statement, the MTA called the attack "unacceptable" and said that they would be working with the NYPD to ensure that justice is served. Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took to Twitter to condemn the attack and express his solidarity with transit workers. "Transit workers have gone above and beyond to keep New Yorkers moving during this pandemic," he wrote. "Attacking them is simply unacceptable." While the investigation is ongoing, the incident has raised questions about police accountability and the need for better training to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. As for the MTA worker, she is said to be recovering from injuries sustained in the attack.
