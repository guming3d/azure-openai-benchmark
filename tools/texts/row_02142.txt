article: By . Annabel Grossman . A Government minister has backed a campaign to save horses from pain by allowing top-level riders to compete using bridles without the traditional metal bit. Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat minister for care services, wants a change to the rules for dressage competitions. At present, the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) demands that Olympic dressage riders use bitted bridles that go between the horses’ teeth. The horse on the left has a bit while the one on the right is bitless . The same rule is enforced at a national level in the UK and in most regional events. But many riders prefer to use bitless bridles, arguing that the bit can cause severe nerve pain, tongue lacerations, pinching and breathing problems for horses. In a letter to the national governing bodies, including the British Equestrian Federation, Mr Lamb lends his support to a campaign against bits by the Norfolk Horse Training and Equitation Club (NHTEC). The Norfolk North MP writes: ‘A constituent showed me photographs where it appeared to me the horses [with bitted bridles] were clearly in pain. The request is for people to have the choice. I cannot really see the argument against.’ The traditional bit has been used by riders since ancient times. But an internet debate about the safety of bitless bridles was sparked in March when Prince Edward’s ten-year-old daughter Lady Louise Windsor was pictured riding a pony using one. Campaigners argued that if a young Royal could ride a horse without a bit, it must be safe. NHTEC secretary Johanna Macarthur said: ‘In some ways, we haven’t moved on since Bronze Age people were riding horses with these devices wedged in their mouths. 'Metal bits can be very painful for many horses, particularly those put under pressure to perform in competitive events. It’s high time riders were allowed to choose more horse-friendly bridles.’ British Dressage issued a statement supporting the FEI rules. It said: ‘A fundamental requirement in the education of the horse is the concept of submission and this includes the willing acceptance of the indications of the rider. This also means the acceptance by the horse of the bit in its mouth, just as much as the acceptance of the rider’s weight on its back.’ British Olympic dressage gold medallist Carl Hester wrote on Facebook in December: ‘I wouldn’t mind in the slightest if I competed against a bitless competitor. It’s a personal choice.’

chatgpt: Norman Lamb, the Member of Parliament for North Norfolk, is calling for a change to the rules governing dressage competitions. The issue at hand is the use of bitless bridles, which some riders prefer over traditional bridles with bits. These riders argue that the bit can cause severe nerve pain for the horse, and that using a bitless bridle is a more humane option. However, British Dressage, the governing body for dressage in the UK, maintains that the bit is an integral part of the sport and should continue to be used. Lamb, who is an animal welfare advocate, agrees with the riders and wants to see bitless bridles allowed in competitions. He has written to British Dressage urging them to reconsider their stance on the issue. In his letter, Lamb points out that using a bitless bridle does not put the rider or the horse at a disadvantage in the competition. In fact, many top riders have successfully used bitless bridles in dressage competitions around the world. Lamb argues that dressage is about harmony and communication between the rider and the horse, and that using a bitless bridle instead of a traditional bridle with a bit can actually improve this communication. He also notes that bitless bridles are already permitted in some equestrian disciplines, such as endurance riding. British Dressage, on the other hand, says that the use of a bit is necessary to maintain control over the horse during the complex movements required in dressage. They also argue that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that bits cause nerve pain. However, many riders and animal welfare organizations disagree. They say that bits can cause discomfort and pain for the horse, and that alternative options like bitless bridles should be allowed. The debate over the use of bits in dressage competitions is likely to continue, with advocates on both sides of the issue. However, with the support of Norman Lamb and other animal welfare advocates, it's possible that we may see changes to the rules governing dressage competitions in the near future.
