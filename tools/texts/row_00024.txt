chatgpt: Animal control workers set up traps outside a house in Berwyn after receiving complaints from neighbors regarding animals causing a disturbance. The Berwyn police had to intervene and went to the house in question to investigate the issue. According to a neighbor, a family of three, including a woman who volunteers at animal shelters, lived in the house targeted. The neighbor spoke to reporters, stating that they had heard loud noises and disruptions for a few weeks, leading them to suspect an animal infestation in the property. The police and animal control personnel initially planned to use a variety of techniques to catch the animals, including live traps and baited cages. They set up traps on the property and waited patiently for results. The neighbor who reported the incident spoke to reporters and said, “I called the police because I’ve been hearing this constant scratching noise coming from the crawl space under my house. It’s been keeping me up at night, and I’m concerned about what kind of animals might be down there.” The police and animal control workers were able to place the traps and patiently waited to observe the movement of the animals. After several hours of waiting, two raccoons were successfully caught in the traps. Animal control workers were able to transport the captured raccoons to a safe location without causing harm to either the animals or any humans involved. The neighbors were relieved that the issue had been resolved without any injuries or property damage. Berwyn police reminded residents to be aware of the wildlife in their neighborhoods and to contact animal control or the police department in any case of disturbance. This case shows how important it is to have effective communication between residents, the police department, and animal control in maintaining public safety. It also highlights the importance of taking appropriate measures to resolve matters related to animal welfare, including setting up traps, catching animals and relocating them in a safe, humane manner.
