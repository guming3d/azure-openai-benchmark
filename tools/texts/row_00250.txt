article: By . Fiona Macrae . It is a practice loved by celebrity mothers such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Sienna Miller. And according to a study, taking up yoga in pregnancy can ease stress â€“ and reduce women's fear of childbirth. The first research of its kind found that a single yoga class cut anxiety in mothers-to-be by a third. Their levels of stress hormones fell and after two months of classes, the women said they were less scared about giving birth. Experts have now called on the NHS to provide free classes for pregnant women. Researchers found taking up yoga in pregnancy can ease stress and reduce women's fear of childbirth (file picture) Professor John Aplin, who specialises in reproductive biomedicine, even suggested yoga could help women cope with the pain of childbirth and reduce the number of emergency C-sections. He added: 'Perhaps we should be looking at providing yoga classes on the NHS. 'It would be relatively cheap to implement, could help mothers and their children be healthier, as well as reducing the costs of longer-term healthcare.' Yoga is popular with mothers-to-be and is often recommended by doctors and midwives, but until now no one had studied whether it is actually beneficial. The Manchester University researchers looked at two groups of women who were 22 weeks pregnant. Half did a weekly yoga class for two months and the other half attended antenatal classes. The yoga sessions were adapted for pregnancy and included relaxation techniques, as well as exercises to strengthen the body and ease pain. There were concerns that the weekly focus on childbirth in classes might actually make women more nervous. But a single yoga class cut the amount of anxiety the women felt by a third. The Manchester University researchers looked at two groups of women who were 22 weeks pregnant (file picture) Stress levels after the session were even lower than when relaxing at home, according to the study published in the journal Depression and Anxiety. And many of the women credited the techniques with keeping them calm and making the birth easier. Lead researcher Dr James Newham, who is now based at Newcastle University, said: 'We have long believed that it works but no research has been done to back up the theory. 'We have now gone some way to prove that it can help. It was no small effect. This has the potential to really help mothers who are feeling anxious about their pregnancy.' Jacqui Clinton from baby charity Tommy's, which funded the study, said: 'We already know that pregnancy yoga can help improve physical health and strength on the run up to having a baby, and this new evidence shows it may have important benefits for women's emotional health too.' The NHS advises pregnant women to stay active to help cope with labour. But a Department of Health spokesman said that the decision to run free yoga classes would need to be taken by individual hospital trusts.

chatgpt: A new study suggests that taking a yoga class can help pregnant women reduce anxiety about giving birth. The research found that a single yoga class can have a noticeable impact on anxiety levels, and after two months, women experience a significant reduction in fear about the delivery process. The study, which is the first of its kind, was conducted by researchers at the University of Manchester and was published in the journal BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth. The research involved 64 pregnant women who were divided into two groups. One group attended a weekly yoga class, while the other group received standard antenatal care without yoga. The women who attended the yoga class reported a significant reduction in anxiety after just one session. After two months of weekly classes, they experienced an even greater reduction in fear about giving birth. Meanwhile, the control group experienced little change in their anxiety levels. Experts are calling on the National Health Service (NHS) to provide free yoga classes for pregnant women. Currently, yoga classes are not part of standard antenatal care in the UK, and pregnant women must pay to attend classes at private studios. Lead author of the study, Dr. James Newham, said, "Pregnancy can be an anxious time for many women, especially if it's their first child. Our research suggests that yoga can help to reduce anxiety and improve overall well-being during this time." He added, "It's important that pregnant women have access to safe and effective interventions, such as yoga, to improve their mental health and well-being." The study is not the first to suggest that yoga can be beneficial for pregnant women. Previous research has shown that practicing yoga during pregnancy can help reduce back pain, improve sleep, and decrease the risk of preterm labor. Yoga is considered a low-risk exercise for pregnant women, and most yoga classes can be adapted for different levels of ability and trimesters of pregnancy. However, it's recommended that pregnant women consult with their healthcare provider before starting a new exercise routine. Dr. Newham and his colleagues are now calling for larger studies to be conducted to further investigate the impact of yoga on anxiety in pregnant women. Pregnancy is a time of great physical and emotional change, and many women experience anxiety about the birthing process. With the results of this study suggesting that yoga can help reduce anxiety in pregnant women, experts are hopeful that the NHS will consider providing free yoga classes to pregnant women in the future. In conclusion, the study found that attending a weekly yoga class can help reduce anxiety in pregnant women, with participants reporting a significant reduction in fear about giving birth after just one session. Experts are urging the NHS to provide free yoga classes for pregnant women as part of standard antenatal care to improve overall well-being during this time.
