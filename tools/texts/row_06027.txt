article: (CNN) -- Twitter is testing a major profile redesign that's very reminiscent of Facebook and Google+. Mashable assistant features editor Matt Petronzio spotted on Tuesday a huge update to his Twitter profile page, with the main picture and bio scaled to the left and significantly more real estate dedicated to the header photo. The revamped tweet stream is also a departure from its signature look. There is a greater focus on photos and content cards. It moves away from a strictly vertical timeline too.

Experiments typically go out to a small, random pool of users. Under the header photo in the test is the count for tweets, photos/videos (a new category called out on the profile), who you are following, followers, favorites and lists. Although Petronzio isn't verified on the site, there's an option for the stream to show "Tweets" and "Tweets and replies" for every user â€” a feature typically reserved for those with the blue check mark. Other profile pages viewed from an account with the new design are automatically made to look like this too. This means that even if your Twitter page isn't a part of the test, Petronzio can see what yours will look like. SEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about Bitcoin in 2 minutes . The recommended header photo size in the test version is 1500 x 500 pixels, up from 1252 x 626 in the current design, so users with the new design will want to switch their picture so it doesn't look stretched. The news comes days after Twitter rolled out its latest design to all users, after weeks of behind the scenes testing. The company declined to comment on this story.

chatgpt: Twitter is reportedly testing a significant redesign for its users' profile pages. The new look maximizes the header photo by enlarging the image, while also sliding the profile picture and bio to the left. This revamp is reported to be in the testing phase, indicating that there may be further changes made before it is rolled out to all users. It is not uncommon for Twitter to test new features and design updates quietly, without any formal announcement. The testing phase allows the social media giant to gauge user feedback and tweak the design if necessary before releasing it widely. Twitter has made notable changes to its interface over the years, including its introduction of Moments, which provide users with an overview of the most talked-about topics on the platform. Such changes are a testament to Twitter's commitment to continuously enhancing user experience and appeal. The expanded header photo in the latest redesign is a prime feature, as it allows users to showcase more images while also providing better branding opportunities for businesses and organizations. This redesign will also help in streamlining the look and feel of the profile page, with the profile picture and bio now being shifted towards the left of the page. As with any significant redesign, this update may have its detractors. However, it is important to note that Twitter's focus is on improving the user experience and keeping the platform fresh and relevant. Twitter's user base spans around the globe and includes individuals of all ages, making the platform ever-evolving and in constant flux.  Twitter's redesign might not be the company's biggest move to date, but it is part of a broader strategy that aims to make the platform more user-friendly and accessible, and designed to meet users’ needs. Therefore, it should come as no surprise if Twitter unveils this redesign in the near future, as it continues to innovate and differentiate itself from its competitors.  In conclusion, the recent redesign of Twitter's profile pages is set to boost user experience while also creating more branding opportunities for businesses and organizations. Twitter's continued efforts to keep their platform modern and user-friendly will undoubtedly keep the platform innovative and relevant for years to come.
