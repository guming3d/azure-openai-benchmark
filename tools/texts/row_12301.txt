article: You have to admire the pluck. Porto Montenegro, once the main base for the Austro-Hungarian navy, is now home to super-yachts, gin palaces, infinity pools, nightclubs, fleets of helicopters - and festering controversy. It's has Monte Carlo in its sights; St Tropez and Porto Banus, too. Boats, boats everywhere you look: The harbour at Porto Montenegro is the place to park your super yacht . All it needs now is a little time and a few more millions. For the rest of us, watching its development will be fun. Canadian gold mining billionaire Peter Munk, a refugee from Nazi-occupied Hungary, is the chief investor. A friend of Munk's from Toronto says that when he visited Porto Montenegro seven years ago, the site resembled Pearl Harbor after the Japanese attack. Not any more. Its first five-star hotel, The Regent, has just opened and Lord [Jacob] Rothschild, an investor, was there to witness it. 'It's a miracle.' he said. 'I look forward to coming back here again and again.' Sadly, there was no sign of his old friend Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch. Serene scene: The Regent, which opened in August this year, is Porto Montenegro's first five-star hotel . The latter has a house here but has fallen out with the prime minister Milo Dukanovic over an aluminium smelter he bought, later putting thousands of local people out of jobs. Porto Montenegro is described as the deepest natural harbour in Southern Europe and Kotor Bay is said to contain 42,000 species of fish. It is next to the town of Tivat, which has a small airport, although most visitors use Dubrovnik airport 27 miles away. Beauty of the bay: The Bay of Kotor, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was admired by Lord Byron . Nearby, the town of Kotor is a UNESCO World Heritage site with baroque, Venetian and Austrian architecture. It is surrounded by spectacular untouched mountain scenery. Porto Montenegro is still in touch with its past. Two cold war submarines, now open to the public, stand on the harbour shore, and the sawmill and repair yard have been turned into a maritime museum. Lord Byron described Kotor Bay as 'the most beautiful encounter of land and sea'. What he would make of modern Porto Montenegro we will never know. But it's some spectacle.

chatgpt: Montenegro has been the talk of the town as an emerging destination to visit in the Balkan region. With its stunning coastline, beautiful mountain ranges, and rich history, this small country has much to offer. But what is catching the attention of many tourists, especially the luxury yacht set, is the development of the Porto Montenegro marina. Located in the picturesque bay of Kotor, Porto Montenegro has become the new hotspot for the yacht set. The marina offers high-quality facilities, including berths for some of the world's largest yachts, as well as luxury boutiques, restaurants, and bars. The waterfront is also home to a five-star hotel and chic residences, which attract high rollers who wish to invest in a luxurious waterfront lifestyle. But it's not just the marina that makes Montenegro attractive to visitors. Its coast, which runs along the Adriatic Sea, is home to several historic towns such as Kotor, Budva, and Herceg Novi. The towns offer a glimpse of Montenegro's rich history, with their cobblestone streets, medieval walls, and ancient buildings. Tourists can explore the quaint fishing villages and sample some of the best Mediterranean cuisine in the region. One of the advantages of visiting Montenegro is its accessibility from the neighboring country of Croatia. Dubrovnik, Croatia's famous walled city, is only 30 minutes driving distance from the border with Montenegro. Visitors can fly into Dubrovnik airport and then drive along the scenic coastal road to Montenegro. The drive is an attraction in itself, as it offers breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea, including the renowned Bay of Kotor. Since gaining independence in 2006, Montenegro has been on the rise as a popular tourist destination thanks to its charming blend of nature, culture, and luxury. The government has been investing in infrastructure, with new airports and highways making it easier to travel around the country. The tourism sector has been growing rapidly in recent years, with more tourists coming to Montenegro each year. In conclusion, Montenegro has emerged as a chic destination in the Balkans, thanks in part to the development of the Porto Montenegro marina. Visitors can indulge in the luxurious lifestyle and yacht culture while exploring the beautiful coastal towns and sampling the Mediterranean cuisine. With its accessibility from Croatia and investment in infrastructure, Montenegro is well on its way to becoming a top travel destination in the region.
