Faced with adversity, many feel like they have the weight of the world on their shoulders. Now, perhaps, we know why. Research shows that when we feel powerless, we think objects are much heavier than they are. Scientists at Cambridge University said this might be the brain’s way of exercising caution when life seems to be spinning out of our control. Adversity: Research shows that when we feel powerless, we think objects are much heavier than they are . In one experiment, volunteers’ sense of power was measured by asking them questions such as whether they thought people listened to their views. The men and women then lifted boxes of books and estimated their weight. Finally, they answered questions about their mood. Mood and gender did not affect the results, but sense of power did. The less powerful someone felt, the more they thought the boxes weighed, the Journal of Experimental Psychology reports. Volunteers who felt powerless estimated the boxes to be around 20 per cent heavier than those who felt in control.

Another test showed it is the feeling of . powerlessness that makes things seem heavy, rather than a sense of power . giving a perception of lightness. It is thought that in tough times, we take steps to conserve vital resources. Seeing things as heavier than they are could deter us from using up precious energy. Lead researcher Eun Hee Lee said: ‘Not much was known about how power influences perceptual experiences in everyday life. ‘This research demonstrates that people’s social role, as indicated by a sense of social power, or lack thereof, can change the way they see the physical environment.’ In a similar vein, studies have shown we perceive a hill as being steeper if we are carrying a backpack or have listened to sad music. However, a sugar rush - from eating glucose - makes a slope appear more gentle, researchers have found.

chatgpt: Cambridge University researchers have conducted a new study exploring how an individual's sense of power can influence their perceptions and performance in physical tasks. The study aimed to investigate whether a person's perception of their own power affects their estimation of weight when lifting objects. In order to conduct the study, volunteers were asked about their perceived sense of power before participating in a physical task. The task involved lifting boxes of books and estimating their weight. After the task, participants were asked about their mood. The results of the study revealed that mood and gender were not found to have a significant impact on the estimation of weight. However, the sense of power felt by the volunteers did. Researchers found that the less powerful someone felt, the more they thought the boxes weighed. The findings of this study could have significant implications for understanding how power dynamics impact our daily lives. For instance, it could suggest that how people estimate weights or judge other physical tasks could be influenced by their sense of power. It is important to note that the sample for this study was relatively small, with 90 undergraduate students taking part. Therefore, larger scale research would need to be conducted in order to determine whether these findings are consistent across a broader population. Nonetheless, these findings offer valuable insights into the impact of power dynamics on our perceptions and judgements. The study provides further support for the idea that our sense of power can have a significant influence on our behaviour and decision-making processes. One possible explanation for these findings is that individuals who feel less powerful may be more likely to experience a lack of control in their lives. As a result, they may attempt to exert control over other areas of their lives, such as physical tasks, in order to compensate for this sense of powerlessness. Future research could help to shed further light on the complex relationship between power dynamics and our perceptions and behaviour. Nonetheless, these findings provide important insights into the ways in which our sense of power can impact our responses to the world around us.
