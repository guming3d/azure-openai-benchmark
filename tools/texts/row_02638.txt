Employees at a Connecticut McDonald’s called police after an intoxicated woman fresh out of rehab came through the drive-thru window with her toddler daughter in the back seat. Michelle Dion, 28, of Springfield, was arrested Wednesday evening by police in Clinton, Connecticut, after her car ran out of gas in the fast food joint’s parking lot. Dion had reportedly been in rehab as recently as last week. The baby had no injuries when taken into custody, police said. Dion left a rehabilitation facility last week, WTNH reported. It is not clear if she left a treatment plan early or completed one. ‘I’m an employee at McDonalds and we have a situation that we think a lady is driving drunk with her kid in the car,’ the quick-thinking worker told the dispatcher. The call came after Dion went to the Southern Connecticut restaurant around 7.30 p.m. after a boozy day at the beach with her two-year-old daughter, police said. Employees claimed to have smelled alcohol on her breath while helping push her car out of the drive-thru lane, according to audio of the 911 call posted by WTNH. Dion claimed to have only had ‘two glasses of wine earlier in the day,’ according to a police report cited by the station, but officers said the woman was ‘slurring her words and had ‘red, glassy bloodshot eyes.’ In court: Dion pleading not guilty Thursday to charges of DUI and risk of injury to a child .

chatgpt: An Illinois woman was arrested for drunken driving on Monday after she ran out of gas and a fast-food worker alerted authorities. Michelle Dion, a 28-year-old from Joliet, was pushing her car through the drive-thru of a McDonald's restaurant when an employee smelled alcohol on her breath and contacted the police. According to the police report, Dion failed several sobriety tests and refused to take a Breathalyzer test when police arrived on the scene in the restaurant's parking lot. She was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Dion's mother told police that her daughter had only checked out of rehab the previous week. It is unclear how long Dion had been in rehab or what led to her alcohol addiction. The incident underscores the danger of drinking and driving, which remains a serious problem in the United States. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 10,142 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes in 2019, accounting for 28% of all traffic deaths in the country. In response to the problem, many states have enacted stricter laws and penalties for driving under the influence. Most states have a legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit of .08%, and some have even lower limits for certain groups such as commercial drivers or those under 21. However, despite these efforts, drunk driving continues to be a major public safety issue. In addition to causing fatalities and injuries, it also puts a significant strain on law enforcement and emergency response services. In the case of Michelle Dion, her decision to get behind the wheel while under the influence of alcohol not only endangered her own life but also put others at risk. Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident and Dion was apprehended before any harm was done. It is not clear what penalties Dion may face for her actions, but it is likely that she will face fines, license suspension, and perhaps even jail time. Her case serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible drinking and the dangers of driving under the influence. As part of efforts to combat drunk driving, experts recommend taking advantage of alternative transportation options such as taxis, ride-hailing services, or public transportation. Additionally, friends and family members can play a key role in preventing drunk driving by intervening when they suspect someone may be getting behind the wheel while under the influence. Ultimately, the responsibility for preventing drunk driving falls on each individual. By making responsible choices and avoiding alcohol when driving, we can all help ensure that our roads are safer for everyone.
