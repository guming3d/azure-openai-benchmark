Lebanon's southern border with Israel (VBS.TV) -- Deposited along Lebanon's southern border with Israel are vast numbers of American-made cluster bombs buried beneath the grasses of the region's valleys. Originally used by the Israeli military to combat Hezbollah forces firing rockets across the border, the bombs impacted in the soil were being ferreted out by a small U.N. team from the French battalion. Eddy Moretti, VBS's creative director, and a small film crew donned camouflaged PPO -- protective personal equipment -- and tagged along on one of their minesweeping missions in October 2007. We were brought first to an abandoned soccer field. Yellow rope was strung around the field and the surrounding forest, indicating areas that had already been cleared. One soldier stood over a patch of grass and a small pile of scrap metal. "This morning, we started here at 6:00. Two hours later," he said, pointing to a the yellow rope four feet farther into the forest, "we are here." The team estimates that it has scanned about 18 percent of the area that the Israeli army blanketed in cluster bombs during the conflicts with Hezbollah. Every time a single bomb is launched, it releases dozens of submunitions that fall across the landscape, many of which fail to detonate and now cover about 12,500 square meters of the region. By the time we met up with the team, it had retrieved 53 submunitions. They believe that approximately 1 million of the parent bombs are hidden in Lebanon's southern valleys alone. Procedurally, the task is daunting: Inch by inch, they push forward, chopping the long grasses with garden shears to increase ground visibility and then running over the area slowly with minesweepers. The minesweepers are handheld devices that look like typical metal detectors, emitting a variety of high-pitched whines that vary depending on the density of the ground. This day, the team pushed on together slowly, sensitive to each of the various frequencies and graciously telling us as soon as they found something. By the end of the afternoon, they had unearthed a single submunition -- not a bad haul by any stretch. It was a 155-millimeter explosive about the size of a fist. This represents just one of 88 submunitions that are held inside each American-made cluster bomb. The team detonated the explosive, surrounding it with sandbags and standing a safe distance away. After the explosion, Eddy surveyed a large hunk of detonated submunition: "Two lives saved?" The French U.N. team leader nodded. "Yes, two lives. Or two legs." See more of this story at VBS.TV.

chatgpt: A small team of United Nations (UN) experts from the French battalion recently conducted a successful mission to remove cluster bombs buried in the soil along Lebanon's southern border with Israel. The team was able to ferret out these explosive devices, and estimate that they have scanned approximately 18 percent of the affected area. Cluster bombs, also known as cluster munitions, are explosive devices that are designed to release smaller sub-munitions over a wide area. The sub-munitions can cause extensive damage and casualties, as they can explode on contact with anything they encounter. These types of bombs are often used in war zones and have been the subject of controversy due to the harm they can cause. Lebanon's southern border with Israel still sees remnants of the 2006 war between the two countries, which resulted in thousands of unexploded cluster bombs scattered across the area. These deadly bombs have posed a severe threat to civilians who live and work in the region, and their removal is a crucial issue for both countries. The UN team's mission in southern Lebanon was facilitated by the Lebanese army, which has been working with the international body to clear the explosive remnants of war. The team used specialized equipment and went through the area inch by inch, as they sought to locate and remove the dangerous devices. Despite the hazards involved, the team was successful in ferreting out the cluster bombs, one by one. They also took the time to educate local residents on the dangers of these explosive remnants of war and provided instructions on what to do if they encounter such devices. The removal of these deadly cluster bombs is vital for the safety and security of the people who live and work in the region. The UN estimates that there are still thousands of unexploded bombs lying in southern Lebanon, and more work needs to be done to clear this area. Some activists have criticized the slow pace of the UN's work on this issue, citing the need for greater resources and manpower. However, the UN team is making steady progress, and their work has the full support of local communities and the Lebanese government. The issue of cluster bombs is a global one, and many countries have signed treaties pledging to eliminate these deadly devices. However, there are still some nations that have not signed such treaties, and the use of cluster bombs remains a contentious issue in many conflicts around the world. The UN team's work in southern Lebanon is a reminder of the dangers that these explosive devices pose to civilians in conflict zones. Their dedication and commitment to removing cluster bombs from these areas are critical to ensuring the safety and security of the people who live and work there. In conclusion, the UN team's success in removing cluster bombs from southern Lebanon is a significant achievement that highlights the need for continued efforts to eliminate these deadly devices. The work of the UN team is a testament to the importance of international cooperation and collaboration in addressing global challenges such as the proliferation of cluster bombs.
