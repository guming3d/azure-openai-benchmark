article: By . Pa Reporter . Nacer Bouhanni won stage two of the Vuelta a Espana in San Fernando in a sprint finish. The Frenchman was a comfortable winner ahead of Giant-Shimano's John Degenkolb after an excellent lead-out from his FDJ team, while several riders lost position in the tight corners leading to the finish line. Degenkolb was catching Bouhanni in the final metres but had left himself too much to do, settling for second with Roberto Ferrari of Lampre-Merida in third place. Sprint king: Bouhanni celebrates as he crosses the line to win stage two of the Vuelta a Espana . Movistar's Alejandro Valverde, the 2009 Vuelta winner inherited the leader's red jersey from his team-mate Jonathan Castroviejo, with race favourite Nairo Quintana tucked in second place. All the time gaps among the contenders remained the same, cementing Movistar's advantage from Saturday's opening team time trial with Team Sky's Chris Froome still 27 seconds back. Saturday's stage had left plenty of surprising time gaps between the general classification contenders, but Sunday's 174.4km stage was simply about staying safe for the main field while the sprinters eyed glory up ahead. The usual early break was a six-man group but featured a couple of notable names. Proud: The Frenchman took the stage comfortably after a great lead-out, and made sure everyone knew it . Garmin-Sharp, who had a dismal time trial, sent Nathan Haas up the road and he would lead them over the only categorised climb of the day to take the early King of the Mountains jersey, while there was the unusual sight of the No. 1 number in a break as Lampre-Merida's Valerio Conti - a late replacement for last year's winner Chris Horner - also went off the front. Haas and MTN-Qhubeka's Kristian Sbaragli dropped back after contesting the first climb, leaving Conti, Francisco Javier Aramendia (Caja Rural) Jacques Janse Van Rensburg (MTN-Qhubeka), and Romain Hardy (Cofidis) out in front, where they built a lead which approached five minutes. The pack slowly hauled them back in as the main GC teams made their presence felt at the front of the peloton - Movistar and Sky taking turns as they sought to keep their men safe on a some tight corners negotiated in strong winds that threatened to split the pack. They all stayed together, catching the break with a little under 17km to go and the battle began among the sprint teams to get to the front. It was FDJ who were on the nose heading into the final two turns, and that was all the advantage Bouhanni needed. Solid: It was a day to ensure a safe ride for the leading contenders, with none of the favourites gaining ground .

chatgpt: The FDJ team provided their French rider, Arnaud Demare, with a perfect lead-out to secure a second stage victory at the Vuelta a Espana today. Demare, who has now won two stages of the race, crossed the finish line first in Tarragona after being expertly guided by his FDJ teammates in the final stages of the race. Despite facing tough competition from Team Sky's Chris Froome, who remains 27 seconds behind race leader Alejandro Valverde of Movistar, Demare was able to power to victory with the help of his team. After the race, Demare was quick to thank his teammates, saying that their work in preparing him for the finishing sprint had been "perfect". The stage, which started in Lleida, was a largely flat affair, with few challenges presented to the riders until a sharp turn in the final few kilometers. This turn, which saw some riders slip off their bikes or lose time while trying to navigate it, proved pivotal for the lead-out trains of the top teams. FDJ's performance was particularly impressive, with the team taking control of the race in the final stages and launching Demare towards the finish line with precision timing. Demare's victory was made even sweeter by the fact that he had narrowly missed out on a win in stage four, where he finished second. Despite Demare's success, the overall race situation remains unchanged, with Alejandro Valverde retaining his leader's red jersey. Valverde, who is renowned for his climbing ability, will face a tougher challenge in the coming days as the race moves into the mountains. Chris Froome, who is widely regarded as one of the best climbers in the world, remains in contention for the overall victory, despite his 27-second deficit to Valverde. Froome's performance today was solid, but he will need to do more to bridge the gap with Valverde if he wants to secure a place on the podium at the end of the race. With the race now past its halfway point, the coming stages will be crucial for those riders hoping to make an impact in the overall standings. The Vuelta a Espana is one of the most prestigious races in the world of cycling, and riders from around the globe will be looking to leave their mark on this year's event. As the race moves towards its conclusion, fans will be eagerly watching to see if any of the top riders can find the form necessary to take home the ultimate prize. With just a few days left of racing, anything can happen, and the world of cycling remains as unpredictable as ever.
