article: (CNN) -- A man known for his grand 6 million-light Christmas display was found shot and killed in his home on Friday morning. A family member found John Chakalos, 87, in his home in Windsor, Connecticut, according a Windsor police department press release. The medical examiner's office ruled that Chakalos died of a gunshot wound to the head. The police are conducting an active homicide investigation, based on the condition of the body when it was found and because police did not recover a weapon at the scene, Windsor police Capt. Tom Lepore said. Windsor police were first to arrive on scene, and the department called in the Connecticut State Police major crimes squad to assist, Lepore said. Detectives are working to piece together events in the weeks leading up to Chakalos' death, Lepore said. Chakalos and his wife Rita, who died a week before Thanksgiving, were known in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, and the surrounding area for their elaborate Christmas display at the home they owned there. The Christmas exhibition takes up approximately half of the couple's 86-acre property and includes 6 million lights, said Joy Washburn, the property's caretaker. Washburn, who has known the Chakalos family for 30 years and worked for them for 25, said she begins working on the display in the second week of August. The display, which has lit up Chesterfield off and on for the past 10 years, is usually completed and ready by Thanksgiving. For the past five years, the family has invited the public to drive through the estate and requested visitors donate money or nonperishable food for Joan's Food Pantry. "Not only do they warm the heart of thousands of people who come through, they warm the hearts of hundreds of people in the community who benefit from food and cash donations," said Val Starbuck, a Joan's Food Pantry volunteer. Visitors come from as far as an hour away to view the Christmas display, Starbuck said. The donations from the display have typically been enough to keep the small pantry filled from January through April, generally the hardest months for people to heat their homes and feed themselves. The extravagant display includes a lifesize Victorian-style village, complete with houses, a hotel and a general store; a 22-foot Santa to greet visitors when they enter the property; and a Nativity scene, among numerous other decorations. "There isn't now in the woods a bush or a tree that doesn't get lights on it," Washburn said. The Christmas display will continue this season, Washburn said, but she did not know if the Chakalos family would continue to light up the neighborhood in the future. CNN's attempts to reach Chakalos' family were unsuccessful.

chatgpt: An 87-year-old man named John Chakalos was found shot to death in his Connecticut home last Tuesday. Police were alerted to the scene by a family member who had come to check on Chakalos after not hearing from him for several days. According to reports, Chakalos had been shot multiple times and police are treating his death as a homicide. Chakalos was a prominent figure in his hometown of Windsor, Connecticut, where he had lived for many years. He was also known for his extravagant Christmas light display at his home in New Hampshire, which takes up half of the family's 86-acre property. The display, which features millions of lights and attracts thousands of visitors each year, has become a beloved holiday tradition for many in the area. However, it is unclear whether Chakalos' family will continue the display in the wake of his death. Chakalos' wife had reportedly died in November, further compounding the tragedy for the family. At this time, there is no indication whether her death and Chakalos' murder are related. The couple's New Hampshire home, which they had named "Candlelight Inn," was a source of pride for Chakalos and his family. They had spent years decorating the property for the holidays, with Chakalos often taking charge of the project himself. In an interview with a local newspaper in 2013, Chakalos spoke about the joy that the display brought to so many people. "It's wonderful to see their faces light up and hear them say, 'Oh wow!' It's a good feeling," he said. Chakalos' death has sent shockwaves through the community, with many expressing disbelief and sadness at the loss of such a beloved figure. Police are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding his murder, but have not yet made any arrests. As for the fate of the Candlelight Inn Christmas display, it remains to be seen whether the family will continue the tradition. For now, the property sits dark and silent, a stark contrast to the festive display that once lit up the night sky. As the investigation continues, the community mourns the loss of John Chakalos, a man who brought joy and happiness to so many through his elaborate holiday display. His legacy will be remembered for years to come, and his loss will be deeply felt by all who knew him.
