article: (CNN) -- A worker at San Francisco General Hospital alerted a supervisor about a body in a stairwell four full days before the facility announced that a long-missing patient's body had been found in the same locale, a lawyer for the patient's family said Thursday. Haig Harris, an attorney representing the children of the late Lynne Spalding, said an official at San Francisco General called him on Thursday to tell him about the October 4 incident. The 57-year-old Spalding was admitted to the hospital September 19. She was reported missing two days later. On October 8, the body found in an exterior stairwell in the building was identified as Spalding. Hospital spokeswoman Rachael Kagan confirmed that Dr. Jeffrey Critchfield, chief of the Division of Hospital Medicine, called Harris on Thursday, though Kagan did not elaborate on their conversation. Harris said Critchfield told him that around 7:20 a.m. on October 4, a senior female staff member on the hospital's fifth floor heard banging coming from Stairwell 8. She went to check and saw another hospital staffer, who told her there was a body lying between the third- and fourth-floor landings, Harris said. The senior staffer, a supervisor, then called the San Francisco Sheriff's Department to relay the report, Critchfield told Harris, according to the lawyer. The sheriff's department oversees security on the hospital's campus. It's not known what happened immediately after that. Review ordered after body found in stairwell . Sheriff's department spokeswoman Susan Fahey would neither confirm nor deny the call or any subsequent response. She said on Thursday that she could not discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation. Authorities have not detailed how Spalding died. She was admitted to the hospital for a bladder infection. When she disappeared on September 21, she was listed in "fair condition," the hospital and sheriff's department said earlier this month in a joint statement. The statement added that hospital employees and sheriff's deputies searched for Spalding. On October 8, a member of the hospital's engineering staff, who was conducting a routine quarterly check, found her body in an exterior stairwell. The hospital and sheriff's department noted the alarmed stairwell, which exits to the hospital grounds at the bottom, "is a fire exit that is not routinely used by staff, patients or the public." CNN's Greg Botelho and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.

chatgpt: San Francisco General Hospital is once again under scrutiny after Lynne Spalding’s body was found in one of its stairwells. The discovery came four days after she was reported missing from the hospital. Now, a San Francisco General Hospital official has reportedly called a lawyer for Spalding's family to discuss the incident.  According to the lawyer, the hospital worker found the body in one of the stairwells, and a supervisor alerted the authorities. Despite this, Spalding’s body was not found until four days later. This raises concerns about how such a thing could happen in a hospital that is supposed to be responsible for the care and safety of its patients. The sheriff's department has not commented on the matter, and it is unclear whether its deputies responded to the initial call regarding Spalding's body. The lack of information has led to speculation about what might have happened, and why the hospital did not do more to find Spalding sooner. The news of Spalding’s death has caused outrage and concern among the San Francisco community. Many are calling for an independent investigation into the incident, in order to determine what went wrong and to hold those responsible accountable. San Francisco General Hospital has had its fair share of troubles in recent years. In 2013, a patient was found dead in a hospital stairwell after going missing for over two weeks. The incident led to widespread criticism of the hospital’s safety procedures and sparked calls for reform. While the circumstances surrounding Spalding’s death are still unclear, it is clear that there are serious issues with how the hospital is managed and how patients are cared for. It is imperative that the authorities take swift action to investigate this matter and to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again. The Spalding family is understandably devastated by this tragic event. The hospital and the authorities owe it to them and to the public to provide answers as to what happened and why. Only then can measures be put in place to prevent such a horrific incident from happening again in the future.
