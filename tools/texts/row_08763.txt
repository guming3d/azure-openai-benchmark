article: By . Pat Hagan . It may not be what men want to hear as they contemplate putting their feet up at the weekend. But new research shows undertaking do-it-yourself jobs round the house could be the secret to living longer. A study by Danish scientists showed men who broke into a sweat by regularly doing DIY were much less likely to die prematurely than those who sat round the house taking it easy. Men who break into a sweat by regularly doing DIY are much less likely to die prematurely than those who sit round the house taking it easy . Among men aged between 50 and 64, DIY was associated with a 23 per cent decline in risk of death from all causes, according to a report in the medical journal Epidemiology. Britain’s couch potato lifestyle is thought to be storing up an epidemic of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Research out earlier this week showed just 30 minutes of exercise a day could slash high blood pressure - a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes - by a fifth. In the UK, people are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport, running or aerobics every week. Taking part in sports, such as jogging, cuts the risk of dying for women by 25 per cent and for men by 22 per cent . Three out of four Britons fail to achieve this. In . the latest study, scientists at the Danish Cancer Society in Copenhagen . looked at nearly 60,000 middle-aged men and women to see how physical . activity affected lifespan. The volunteers were taking part in a long-term study which recorded their exercise patterns. The results showed that taking part in sports, such as jogging, cut the risk of dying for women by 25 per cent and for men by 22 per cent. Cycling had similar benefits while gardening also promoted a longer lifespan- especially in men. But the study also tracked DIY activity levels in men and found it had a powerful protective effect against premature death. The researchers said taking part in some kind of physical activity was more important than spending hours at it. Their findings did not show those spending more time exercising or doing DIY lived any longer. They said: ‘This could suggest that avoiding a sedentary lifestyle is more important than a high volume of activity.’

chatgpt: Regular DIY projects and taking part in sports could boost life expectancy, according to new research. A study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern Denmark and published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, suggests that people who participate in physical activities - regardless of the intensity - have a significantly lower risk of premature death. The research found that participating in DIY was particularly beneficial for men aged between 50 and 64. The study's co-authors noted that men in this age group who regularly tackled home improvement projects had a 28% lower risk of early death than those who did not. As for physical activities that women can do, the research revealed that female participants who took part in team sports, such as basketball, netball, and soccer, had a 36% lower risk of early death than women who did not participate in any physical activity. Additionally, jogging and cycling reduced a woman's chance of dying young by 25%, while for men, both activities reduced the risk by 22%. The study was based on data from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study, which included nearly 80,000 adults between the ages of 20 and 93 years old. Researchers followed up with participants for an average of almost 20 years, tracking instances of premature death. The key takeaway of the study was that it is more important that people regularly participate in any form of physical activity, rather than the type or intensity. The authors of the study recommended that adults incorporate 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise into their routines each week. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The organization recommends that adults engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise each week. While the study noted that the benefits of physical activity can differ for men and women, overall, regular physical activity can be a life-saving habit for anyone regardless of their age or gender. In conclusion, the study findings highlight the importance of regularly participating in physical activity, whether it's taking on DIY projects or playing team sports. The study also emphasizes that any type of physical activity can have a positive impact on health, regardless of the intensity or duration. Exercise is a key component of overall wellness and can increase life expectancy for both men and women.
