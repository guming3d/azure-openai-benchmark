Earlier reports suggested Scaccia died from a seizure after asking for strobe lights in the club to be turned off during his performance. A statement posted by Corbitt on his Facebook page said: 'My brother is gone! The only reason I am who I am is because of this man. 'If it wasn't for him I wouldn't even be in a band. RIP Mike Scaccia! The greatest guitar player I ever knew!' Scaccia was born in 1965 in Babylon, New York, and formed Rigor Mortis in 1983. The Texas-based group, who are credited as pioneers of thrash metal, added Corbitt five years later and released their self-titled debut album, having landed a major record deal with Capitol. Scaccia left the band in 1991 and joined Ministry. He recorded the group's platinum-selling album Psalm 69 the following year before leaving in 1996. He later rejoined Rigor Mortis and Ministry and had been recording and playing live with both. Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen wrote on the band's Facebook page: 'I just lost my lil' brother and my best friend – the 13th Planet compound is devastated, completely in shock and shattered . 'Mikey was not only the best guitar player in the history of music, but he was a close, close, close part of our family – and I just lost a huge chunk of my heart today. Our lives are forever changed. 'Life without Mikey is like orange juice without pulp – kind of bland. I have no words to express what this guy meant to me, my family, my career. . . . Everything! 'Get to know his lead parts - for they are in the pantheon of music! Unfortunately, most of you didn't get to know Mikey's soul - which is in the pantheon of humanity. 'He is my hero, my friend and my idol. Mikey was always beside me - my right hand man - through thick and thin, the good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful. 'Rest in peace my brother, my friend, my heart. Please pray for Mike Scaccia and Jenny, his wife and their children and his family.'
