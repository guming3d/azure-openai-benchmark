Addressing a harsh backlash from lawmakers, Google is seeking to clarify ‘the real story’ about its controversial new privacy consolidation efforts that were launched earlier this week. On Tuesday, the internet company announced it would collect data used as part of a new effort to make the consumer experience better by unifying 60 privacy policies. But eight members of Congress fired back, sending a letter to Google expressing concern that the merging of information could make it more difficult for consumers to protect their privacy. Streamlined experience: Google says its new condensed privacy policy allows for a better experience . ‘While Google suggests that the purpose of this shift in policy is to make the consumer experience simpler, we want to make sure it does not make protecting consumer privacy more complicated,’ the letter to Google CEO Larry Page read. Google, in a statement from policy manager Betsy Masiello, insisted on Thursday that users had 'choice and control.' 'We're not collecting more data about you. Our new policy simply makes it clear that we use data to refine and improve your experience on Google,' she wrote. 'We're making things simpler and we're trying to be upfront about it. Period.' Addressed: Members of Congress wrote a letter to Google CEO Larry Page, pictured, voicing concerns over the new policy . She wrote the changes have been misunderstood. She said that users don’t have to be logged in to use Google search and YouTube. When a consumer is not logged into Google, no data is collected. She also said there are several . privacy measures Google users can utilise, including ‘incognito mode’ on . Google Chrome and going ‘off the record’ on Gchat. Ms Masiello pointed out that one doesn’t have to use all of Google’s products. Google, whose offerings include its flagship search product, Gmail, YouTube and Google+ products, said it would 'mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience.' Online privacy has come under scrutiny from Washington as a handful of web giants have been accused of compromising user privacy to attract advertisers. Late last year, Facebook settled with the FTC agreeing to be regulated for a period of 20 years whenever it decides to change its privacy policy. Some bloggers have compared the new privacy policies to George Orwell's 1984 . In 2010, the FTC settled charges with . Twitter, after the agency alleged that the social networking service had . failed to safeguard users' personal information. U.S. regulators are reportedly looking into whether Google manipulates its search results to favour its own products and have expanded the probe to include Google+. Twitter voiced a complaint that the enhanced new Search plus Your World – which includes information from a consumer’s personal Google+ page – because Twitter doesn’t allow Google’s algorithms to access the micro blogging site, the San Francisco Chronicle said.

chatgpt: Last Tuesday, Google announced their decision to consolidate 60 different privacy policies into one comprehensive policy. The move was intended to simplify the user experience and provide a more cohesive approach to privacy. However, the decision was met with pushback from members of Congress who expressed concerns over the potential privacy issues. Google's new policy will allow users to access all Google products and services with a single login. This means that the same privacy settings will apply across all products and services, making it easier for users to manage their privacy. The policy is set to take effect on March 1st, 2022. While the move is expected to be beneficial for users, members of Congress raised concerns about the impact it could have on privacy. In a statement, Senator Edward J. Markey stated, "Google's consolidation of privacy policies will expose users to greater risks of having their personal information leaked or shared without their consent." Other members of Congress, including Senator Ron Wyden, also expressed concern over the change. In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Senator Wyden wrote, "I strongly urge Google to reconsider this move and to continue to maintain separate privacy policies for each of its products." In response to the concerns, Google maintained that the new policy provides users with "transparency, choice, and control." In a blog post, Google's Director of Product Management, Eric Miraglia, stated, "Our data practices will remain the same under the new policy. Users will still have choices about how their data is used and shared across our products, and can decide whether or not they want to use specific Google services." Google also emphasized that users would be given the option to delete their data if they choose to stop using any of the services. The company also noted that it remains committed to protecting user privacy and complying with all relevant laws and regulations. Despite these reassurances, some privacy advocates remain skeptical of Google's move. In an interview with NPR, Marc Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), expressed concerns over the risks associated with consolidation. Rotenberg stated, "When companies do this type of thing, it's typically to make it easier for them to collect data, to track data, and to share data." Despite the concerns, it is clear that Google's consolidation of privacy policies is set to make the user experience more seamless and convenient. The company's commitment to transparency and user choice should help to alleviate some of the concerns expressed by members of Congress and privacy advocates. Ultimately, the success of Google's new policy will depend on how effectively the company is able to protect user privacy while providing a more cohesive approach to privacy management. As users continue to rely on Google for their everyday needs, it will be important for the company to remain vigilant in safeguarding their privacy and maintaining their trust.
