According to meteorologists, the coldest temperatures of the year will hit on Wednesday, and they will reach New York City and Boston by Thursday. This frigid air mass is expected to trigger an onslaught of lake effect snow to the east of Lake Ontario, with areas from Syracuse to Watertown likely to experience up to three feet of snow by the end of the week. Local authorities have issued warnings to residents, asking them to prepare for the extreme weather conditions by stocking up on food, water and other essentials. Drivers have also been advised to stay off the roads if possible and to make sure their vehicles are equipped with winter tyres and other necessary equipment. The governor of New York has already declared a state of emergency in several counties across the state, giving state agencies the authority to assist local governments in responding to the storm. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for parts of western New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, with predictions of heavy snowfall, blowing snow and strong winds. It has advised people to stay indoors, avoid travelling and to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from the cold.
