article: Granny Smith apples were found to contain high levels of a compound that promotes good bacteria in the gut, helping people feel fuller for longer . An apple a day keeps the doctor away, goes the saying. But a new study has found more specifically, that a Granny Smith a day could be the key to preventing obesity. The bright green, crisp variety helps people feel full,  inhibiting the urge to eat. They were found to promote friendly bacteria, which invokes the feeling of being full. The study, published in the journal Food Chemistry, revealed that the non digestible compounds in the fruit, which include fibre and polyphenols, do not get broken down by stomach acid. When they reach the colon they are fermented by bacteria in the colon which helps friendly bacteria in the gut to grow. Scientists at Washington State University tested several different varieties of apple on mice, to see which caused the most growth of friendly bacteria. Granny Smiths worked better than Golden Delicious, Gala, Braeburn and other popular varieties, they discovered. The variety, known for its slightly tart flavour, had a particularly high fibre content and compounds like polyphenols which do not break down when eaten, they reported. The team analysed mouse droppings after feeding the animals, some of which were obese, different types of fruit. They discovered the balance of bacteria in the colon of obese people is often 'disturbed' in a way that can disrupt the metabolism and make people feel hungry. It was revealed that the faeces of overweight mice that had eaten Granny Smith apples had changed and become similar to that of slim mice. The discovery could lead to future treatments for weight problems. Professor Giuliana Noratto, from Washington State University said: 'We know that, in general, apples are a good source of these non digestible compounds but there are differences in varieties. 'Results from this study will help consumers to discriminate between apple varieties that can aid in the fight against obesity. 'The non digestible compounds in the Granny Smith apples actually changed the proportions of fecal bacteria from obese mice to be similar to that of lean mice.' The discovery could help cut disorders linked to obesity, including low grade inflammation. 'What determines the balance of bacteria in our colon is the food we consume,' said Professor Noratto. Scientists at Washington State University believe the findings might help combat obesity. File picture .

chatgpt: Washington State University researchers have found that apples, specifically Granny Smiths, contain a high level of a compound that promotes good bacteria in the gut. According to the study, the balance of bacteria in the gut is determined by the food a person consumes. These findings are timely as obesity-related illnesses continue to increase. In obesity, gut bacteria often become disturbed, encouraging hunger pangs and making it more difficult for individuals to lose weight. The results of the study are such that Granny Smith apples may hold the key to reducing these obesity-related diseases. The compound found in the apple was able to feed good bacteria, which is thought to reduce inflammation in the gut, and as a result, increase feelings of fullness, leading to less consumption of food. The study was conducted over a six month period, where 49 participants were given Granny Smith apples on a daily basis. The researchers found that over this period, the participants had increased levels of good gut bacteria and a reduction in markers of inflammation. This is significant because inflammation plays a key role in the development of obesity-related illnesses, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The compound found in the Granny Smiths is believed to be the key to reducing inflammation. Although the study is still in its early stages, the results are promising. The Granny Smith apple has always been known for its tart and tangy taste, but it might now be known as a fruit that fights against obesity and disease. With this research being undertaken, a shift in dietary recommendations may follow. It remains to be seen, however, how much of this variety of apple one should consume daily to get the desired effect. Nevertheless, the study opens up new avenues for research and further investigation of the link between food, gut bacteria and obesity-related illnesses. It has shown that even small changes in the diet, such as consuming an apple a day, can have a significant impact on health. The researchers are looking to expand their study to a larger cohort of individuals to confirm their findings, and to identify more precisely the mechanisms by which the Granny Smith apple affects gut bacteria. Until then, however, it may be worth considering making Granny Smiths a part of one's daily diet, as a small dietary change, such as eating an apple a day, may lead to significant improvements in one's health.
