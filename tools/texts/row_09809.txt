chatgpt: In a heart-stopping moment at the beginning of a prestigious horse race, jockey Johnny King was nearly thrown off his animal after the horse, Arbitrageur, gave a violent jerk in the starting gate. The incident left groom Aidan Wall in mortal danger as he cowered away from the flailing horse. The race, which has been held annually since 1868, draws thousands of spectators from all over the country. Nearly 600 horses competed in this year's event, including some of the most talented equine athletes in the world. Despite the scare at the beginning of the race, Johnny King was able to regain control of Arbitrageur and ensure that the horse was able to participate in the event. Although the horse was never able to quite recover from the near-disaster of his start, he performed admirably, finishing in the middle of the pack amidst cheers from the crowd. Witnesses reported that the incident was a reminder of the risks that come with working around powerful and unpredictable animals. "It's a sobering thing to see just how much danger these men and women are in when they're working with these horses," said one spectator. "You don't think about it when you're watching the races, but there's always that risk of something like this happening." Despite the danger, however, jockeys and grooms alike are drawn to the exciting world of horse racing by the thrill of the competition and the chance to work with some of the most beautiful animals in the world. "It's a high-pressure environment, but we love what we do," said Johnny King. "There's no feeling in the world like the rush of adrenaline you get when you're out there on the track, competing with other riders and trying to bring out the best in your horse." For Aidan Wall, the groom who narrowly escaped harm at the beginning of the race, the incident was a stark reminder of the importance of careful preparation and focus when working with horses. "I was lucky to make it out of there in one piece," he said. "I'll be sure to double-check everything next time, and make sure I'm fully prepared for anything that might happen."
