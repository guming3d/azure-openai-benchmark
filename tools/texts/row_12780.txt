Covered: Breast pumps and kits are now covered under insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act . The Affordable Care Act means many things for women, including birth control for all policy holders with no additional payment from the patient required. A lesser-known facet of the new so-called Obamacare law is a provision that requires insurance companies to cover the full cost of breast pumps without a deductible or out-of-pocket expense for new mothers. The cost of these devices is covered in insurance premiums, which in turn are paid by policyholders. The Washington Post notes that it was pumps, not pills, that caught suppliers off-guard after January 1, when this part of the Affordable Care Act went into law. The catch for all new mothers is that only certain breast pump models are covered, and they have to be ordered through a licensed provider. Yummy Mummy, a New York-based boutique that specializes in accessories a new mother would need, has been mulling how best to serve their clientele. Owner Amanda Cole told the Post that she and her staff have been inundated with calls, and that she’s improvising how best to handle the new business.

The business owner recently signed a contract with health giant Aetna to become a licenced provider of breast pumps. So far, around five kits are covered by insurance, as well as bottles, breast shields, and caps. ‘Now that the plan really took effect on January 1st, there’s been a marked change,’ she told the paper. Without insurance, new mothers could pay upwards of $300 for a pump, milk containers, sterilizers, and other paraphernalia. Control: As part of the ACA in effect, insurance companies must provide any FDA-approved contraception . The $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare system costs nearly $9,000 a year for every man, woman and child, according to Reuters. As the New York Times noted today, some policyholder’s insurance premiums went up by double-digit percentages in 2013 due in part to the ACA. The Times reported that Anthem Blue Cross in California has proposed raising its rates by 26 percent, and other private insurers are onboard. -Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .

chatgpt: Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are now required to provide coverage for breast pumps and other breastfeeding supplies. This new rule has generated a significant demand for breast pumps, and suppliers are finding it hard to keep up. The Affordable Care Act mandates that insurance companies must provide breastfeeding support, counseling, and equipment to new mothers. This includes rental or purchase of breastfeeding equipment, such as breast pumps and storage bags. This new requirement aims to encourage new mothers to breastfeed their babies, as breastfeeding has been proven to decrease the risk of infections and illnesses for both the mother and child. Breast pump suppliers across the country have reported a surge in demand since the implementation of this new rule. This influx of business has placed a strain on their capacity to supply breast pumps and respond to customer inquiries promptly. One such supplier, the ABC Breast Pump Company, has reported a 40% increase in sales over the past 6 months. The company is working hard to ensure that they have enough inventory to meet the growing demand, but it has not been an easy process. "We have struggled with inventory control since the increase in demand," said Amy Smith, the company's CEO. "We have had to increase our workforce to keep up with all the new orders, and we are experiencing delays in some parts of our supply chain." Breast pump suppliers are also seeing a shift in their customer base. Before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, most of their sales came from mothers who had difficulty breastfeeding or who were returning to work. Now, with insurance companies covering the cost of breast pumps, more mothers are choosing to breastfeed. "We used to cater more to working mothers and those who had difficulty breastfeeding," said Mark Davis, the owner of the XYZ Breast Pump Supply Company. "Now we are seeing a lot of stay-at-home moms and first-time mothers coming in to purchase breast pumps." Despite the challenges that breast pump suppliers are facing, they remain committed to providing new mothers with the products and services they need to breastfeed their babies. The Affordable Care Act has made breastfeeding more accessible and affordable for many families, and suppliers are proud to be a part of this important movement. In conclusion, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has generated a significant demand for breast pumps and other breastfeeding supplies. Breast pump suppliers are struggling to keep up with this new demand, experiencing delays in their supply chain and inventory control. However, they are committed to providing new mothers with the products and services they need to breastfeed their babies.
