article: Around five per cent of the world’s population suffer from hearing loss, and keeping up with conversation at a busy restaurant or in a group meeting, can be almost impossible – even if they are lip reading experts. But now there’s an app that translates speech into written words that show up on a smartphone, even when people are all talking at once. The app, called Transcense, is the brainchild of four graduate students, who have all been affected by hearing loss in different ways. Scroll down for video . The app, called Transcence (pictured) is the brainchild of four graduate students, who have all been affected by hearing loss in different ways. It translates speech into written words that show up on a smartphone, with individuals' speech shown in different colours . They are raising money on crowd funding site Indiegogo to bring their app to market. ‘We developed Transcense to end the professional and social exclusion caused by hearing loss. ‘Transcense brings meaning to the conversation and allows the deaf person to actively engage again,’ they claim. The app translates speech into words that appear on a smartphone in real-time. To do this, it connects to a number of phones and activates their microphones, to accurately capture what people nearby are saying. This diagram shows how the app connects to multiple smartphones and uses their microphones to listen and interpret the conversation, which is shown on themain user's screen . Transcense is the first mobile app that makes group conversations between deaf and hard-of-hearing people and their hearing peers, effortless, the app's creators claim. It shows users who says what around them in real-time, so they can answer in time and be part of the discussion. Transcense connects to smartphones in a room to transcribe a group conversation, such as a business meeting, a family dinner, or a moment with friends. The 'personal interpreter' is affordable, with an annual subscription starting at $150 (£94). The app then uses a voice recognition algorithm to link detect individual voices and link each of them with a colour, which makes it easy for the app’s user to see who is talking on their smartphone screen. A deaf person can also use the app to speak for them using a digital voice, or to get the attention of all the people present, via their smartphones. The graduates, from the University of San Francisco and Berkeley, have so far raised more than a fifth of their $25,000 (£15,707) goal, which they will use to develop the final Android version of their app, as well as an iOS and web version. A one-year subscription to the app is available to pre-order for $150 (£94) and will cost $360 (£226) for non-earlybirds, if the graduates reach their funding goal. The four graduates all have experience of hearing loss, because one of them was born into a deaf family, another is deaf and the other two have learned American Sign Language.

chatgpt: A new app has been developed that aims to revolutionize the way people communicate by helping to bridge the gap between those with hearing loss and those without. Transcence, created by four graduates affected by hearing loss, translates speech into written words that show up on a smartphone screen. This enables individuals to follow conversations with ease, as they can read what is being said and avoid misunderstandings. The app connects to phones and activates the microphones to capture speech. It then uses advanced speech recognition technology to convert the speech into written words. Additionally, the app uses colour-coded text to make it easier to follow who is talking. Each person's speech is displayed in a different colour, so individuals can easily differentiate between speakers. Transcence was created by a group of four graduates, all of whom have been personally affected by hearing loss. They recognized that hearing loss can lead to significant communication challenges and wanted to make it easier for those with hearing loss to participate in conversations. The app is expected to be particularly beneficial in social settings, such as noisy restaurants and events, where it can be challenging to hear and follow conversations. The app has been received positively by early users, with many praising its ease-of-use and usefulness. One user, who has severe hearing loss, remarked that the app has allowed them to be more involved in conversations than they have been previously. Transcence is available for both iOS and Android devices and can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play. A yearly subscription can be pre-ordered for $150 (£94) from Indiegogo, with the first 100 subscribers receiving a lifetime subscription for free. The developers hope to use the pre-order funds to continue improving the app and adding new features. While similar apps do exist, Transcence stands out for its simplicity and user-friendly design. It is designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, including those who are not technically savvy. The app has already gained widespread attention in the hearing loss community, with many hoping it will lead to greater inclusivity and accessibility for those with hearing loss. One of the founders, Max Maxfield said, "We are really excited about the potential of Transcence to create a more inclusive society. Our app is already making a difference in the lives of people with hearing loss, and we hope to continue to improve it and reach more people in the future. We believe that everyone deserves the ability to participate in conversations, regardless of whether or not they have hearing loss." In conclusion, Transcence is a revolutionary app that has the potential to impact the lives of millions of people experiencing hearing loss. Its advanced speech recognition technology and colour-coded text make it easier for individuals to follow conversations, providing greater inclusivity and accessibility. With a yearly subscription available for pre-order, the developers hope to continue improving the app and reach more people in the future. Transcence is a perfect example of how technology can be used for good and make a real difference in people's lives.
