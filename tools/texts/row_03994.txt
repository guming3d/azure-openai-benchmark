article: By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 8:52 AM on 4th October 2011 . Tuvalu, the fourth smallest country in the world, has called a state of emergency . The tiny Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu, located midway between Australia and Hawaii, has declared a state of emergency due to a severe shortage of fresh water. Officials said today that some parts of the country - the fourth smallest in the world with a population of 11,000 - may only have a two-day supply. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Murray McCully said his country was working with the Red Cross to deliver aid workers and supplies as quickly as possible. He said Tuvalu first declared the emergency last week and the situation had deteriorated since then. Meteorologists have warned that it is unlikely to rain until December, and workers for the Red Cross said that it has not rained properly in the country for at least six months. Usually the 10 square mile country has between 200mm to 400mm of rainfall per month. Water was scarce in the capital, Funafuti, and a number of outlying islands, McCully said, adding that he had received reports saying some places would run out of fresh water within days. And the secretary general of the Tuvalu Red Cross, Tataua Pefe, said water supplies in some parts of the country could run out as early as today. He said: 'It's not safe for consumption. Some animals have died recently and we think it's because of subterranean water.' A New Zealand defence service C-130 plane arrived today carrying two desalination units and a number of water containers, McCully said.

Tuvalu, which gained independence from Great Britain in 1978 but was visited by the Queen and Prince Philip in 1982, isn't the only Pacific island running out of fresh water after six months of low rainfall. Officials from Australia and New Zealand have said they are worried about other islands in the region, including Tokelau. McCully said his government would work with aid agencies to try and figure out a long-term response to the situation. Today is a national holiday in Tuvalu and government officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Tuvalu, formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia. Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. It comprises four reef islands and five true atolls. Its population of 10,472 makes it the third-least populous sovereign state in the world, with only Vatican City and Nauru having fewer inhabitants. In terms of physical land size, at just 26 square kilometres (10 square miles). Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world, larger only than the Vatican City, Monaco and Nauru. The country gained independence from Great Britain on October 1, 1978.

chatgpt: Emergency supplies arrived in a remote Pacific island nation over the weekend, delivered by the New Zealand Air Force. The aid was flown in to help residents in the region as they face the possibility of running out of water due to droughts and lack of rain. The drought, which has been ongoing for months, has left many residents without running water and has caused widespread damage to crops and livestock. The supplies arrived at the island's airport, where they were greeted by a team of local volunteers who helped unload the cargo from the aircraft. The supplies include 10,000 liters of water, as well as food and medical supplies. The region is at the mercy of the rain, with none forecast before December. This means that residents must continue to rely on emergency supplies to meet their basic needs for the foreseeable future. For many people in the region, this is a daunting prospect as emergency supplies are often limited and can be difficult to access. The New Zealand Air Force has been working with the government of the Pacific island nation to plan and deliver the aid. The operation was carried out in coordination with local authorities to ensure that the supplies were received by those who need them the most. The government of the Pacific island nation has been working with international aid agencies and other partners to address the ongoing drought. Experts believe that the most effective long-term solution would be to develop better water management systems and invest in sustainable agriculture practices that can help residents cope with future droughts. Meanwhile, residents in the region continue to face the daily challenge of accessing water and other basic necessities. Many have been forced to travel long distances to collect water from unreliable sources, while others have resorted to using rainwater collected in buckets, which is often poorly filtered and may not be safe to drink. To make matters worse, the drought has caused significant damage to crops and livestock, leaving many families struggling to make ends meet. Some have been forced to sell off their animals or migrate to cities in search of work and better living conditions. Despite these challenges, the people of the Pacific island nation remain resilient and resourceful. Many have come together to support each other and help their communities weather the drought. Volunteers have set up water distribution centers and community gardens, while others have provided training and resources to help farmers adopt more sustainable practices. As the country awaits rain, residents are hopeful that the emergency supplies will help them through this difficult time. The international community has demonstrated its commitment to supporting the region during this crisis, and residents are grateful for the assistance they have received.
