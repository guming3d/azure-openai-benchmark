Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, has predicted China will be the world's most 'sophisticated hacker' in his new book predicting the future of technology. His new book 'The Digital Age' co-written by Jared Cohen, who runs Google Ideas, the search giantâ€™s think tank, believe that China, is 'the most sophisticated and prolific hacker of foreign companies'. They also say that the country is the 'the world's most active and enthusiastic filterer of information', highlighting how China strongly censors information from outside, carefully selecting what its population can access. The Wall Street Journal, who reviewed the book, say that the book concentrates on how China's government and state companies are willing to use cyber crime - giving the increasingly powerful state 'an economic and political edge'. The Google pair examine how China's readiness to commit cyber crime is a 'difference in values' from other countries such as America - meaning the country will spy on big businesses compared to other states that crack down on such activity. The duo predict that China will only continue to grow in terms of influence, as their technological firms become more competitive and more advanced. According to the Wall Street Journal, the book predicts how other countries might follow China's lead in terms of hacking, so as to compete in terms of political and economical gain. Chinese authorities and Google have had a fraught relationship since January 2010, when the company said it may shut down Chinese operations due to a 'sophisticated and targeted' cyber attack. Google said at the time that it was no longer willing to censor its Chinese search engine. Rocky: Google and China have had a fraught relationship over the nature of censorship .

chatgpt: A new book published by a group of cybersecurity experts has claimed that many countries will resort to hacking to compete with China. According to the authors of the book, hacking will give powerful countries a political and economic edge over China. The rise of China as a superpower in recent years has put pressure on other nations to find ways to compete. The country's rapid growth in technological advancements and economic power has made it a formidable competitor on the global stage. The authors of the book argue that many countries are now turning to hacking as a way to level the playing field. Hacking is not a new phenomenon, but its use as a tool of statecraft has become increasingly common. Governments have been accused of using hackers to carry out cyber espionage and cyber attacks on other nations. The authors of the book claim that this trend is set to continue, with countries using hacking to gain an edge over China. One of the key arguments put forward in the book is that hacking is a low-cost, low-risk way for countries to gain an advantage. Unlike traditional forms of espionage or military action, hacking can be carried out without the need for physical presence, making it more difficult to detect and respond to. This makes it an attractive option for countries who want to compete with China but are unwilling or unable to do so using traditional methods. The authors of the book also claim that hacking can be used to influence political outcomes, giving countries a strategic advantage. By gaining access to sensitive information, countries can use it to influence elections or sway public opinion. This can have a significant impact on a country's political and economic future. The book has sparked controversy, with many experts criticizing the authors' claims. Some argue that hacking is illegal and unethical, and that any country caught using it would face severe consequences. Others point out that the use of hacking in international relations is already well-established, with countries like the United States and Russia accused of using it against each other. Despite the controversy, the authors of the book believe that hacking will continue to be used by countries looking to compete with China. They argue that as technology advances, the use of hacking is likely to become even more prevalent, making it an essential tool for countries seeking political and economic power. China has not responded to the claims made in the book, but it is likely that the country is already aware of the threat posed by hacking. The Chinese government has been accused of using hacking as a tool of statecraft in the past, and it is likely that the country is taking steps to protect itself from similar attacks. The book is likely to fuel debate about the role of hacking in international relations. While some may view it as a necessary tool for countries to compete with each other, others will see it as a dangerous and unethical practice that should be discouraged. Either way, the use of hacking is likely to remain a contentious issue for years to come.
