Channel 4 is standing by a scene in a new comedy which features a woman who asks 'we didn’t, did we?' when she wakes up in bed with a small child. The clothed woman lifts up the duvet while lighting a cigarette to discover the boy in a pilot for forthcoming show London Irish, about hard-drinking 20-somethings. A clip, shown at the launch of the broadcaster’s spring/summer season this morning, sees a woman and her flatmates wake up separately following a drunken night out. London Irish has been defended by Channel 4 over a scene which features a woman who asks 'we didn't, did we?', when she wakes up in bed with a small child . Channel 4 said later that there was no implication that anything had happened with the child, who was also clothed, in the comedy, to be shown late at night. It said that the joke was on the female character being so drunk that she could not remember the night. A spokesman said: 'London Irish is a new comedy series based on a group of 20-something Irish friends living in London always on the lookout for ‘the craic’ that will screen on Channel 4 later in the year. 'The clip, shown at Channel 4’s programme launch press event today, briefly introduced the characters as they woke facing exaggerated comedic scenarios playing on what had happened the night before. 'The joke is directed at the character’s inability, because of drink, to remember the night before.' The broadcaster’s chief creative officer Jay Hunt said London Irish was 'standout comedy'. London Irish features Sinead Keenan, of Being Human fame, and Kerr Logan from Game of Thrones . She added: 'We have a role to play in pushing the boundaries. It’s not pre-watershed.' London Irish is written by Irishwoman Lisa McGee and is described on the broadcaster's website as being about 'a hard-drinking, hard-living ex-pat community of Northern Irish twenty-somethings who live in London'. It continues: 'For these four friends it's not easy navigating their way through London life, particularly when they’re too drunk to know where they’re going, or remember where they’ve been. 'They have rubbish jobs, no money, and are surrounded by English people. In fact there's only one thing worse than living in London with the English – and that's living in Ireland with the Irish.' * Channel 4 also confirmed at its season launch that it will be broadcasting proceedings from a Scottish court following three years of negotiations. The broadcaster has been given access to the case of Nat Fraser, who was convicted for the second time of murdering his wife Arlene.
