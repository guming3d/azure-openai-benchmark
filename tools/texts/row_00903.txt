article: She could have at least bought of pair of pants that fit . And the bride wore — a thong. Ill-fitting, at that! All those millions in the bank, and you can’t even get a pair of pants to fit you right. Big things were expected from the wedding of heiress Tamara Ecclestone to her boyfriend of five minutes Jay WotsisName. And in the end, the event held in the South of France did not disappoint. Tamara’s all-white beach party was less Gatsbyesque than cr**sbyesque, but I loved the way she thundered around in her thong, drank shots, groin-danced with a pal and threw herself into the sea. It was just like a hen party in Magaluf, only with slightly nicer wine and less vomit. How absolutely lovely. And we must all wish Tamara well. Despite all that loot, the bouffant-haired socialite hasn’t had it easy! She may have found love with Thingy, but think of the humiliation dished out by long-standing boyfriend Omar Khyami. He was filmed having sex with someone else, while wearing love tokens — bracelets and jewellery — that Tamara had given him. So what did she do in revenge? She did what all girls like her do — she got a tattoo. So empowering! That’ll show him. Tamara turned to Marilyn Monroe, another doomed dame who was a disastrous chooser of men, for inspiration. The wedding party looked more like a hen party in Magaluf but with less vomit and nicer wine . On her shoulder, she now has a tattoo of a quote from the Hollywood legend, which reads: ‘Sometimes good things fall apart so better ones can fall together.’ It is what any shallow heiress would deem as profound.
