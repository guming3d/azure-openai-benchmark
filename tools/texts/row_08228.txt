chatgpt: Four-year-old girl miraculously escaped major injury after falling 25 metres from a hotel balcony on the Gold Coast. The child, who had been playing games with a babysitter, landed in a hedge which broke her fall. She was rushed to the Gold Coast University Hospital via ambulance at 11.20am in a serious but stable condition.  Medical professionals immediately attended to the young girl, who had suffered a broken leg and abdominal injuries from the fall. Following an extensive evaluation, she underwent surgery to repair her leg. Despite her injuries, medical staff are optimistic about her recovery and expect her to make a full recovery. According to witnesses, a loud thud was heard before the little girl crawled out of the hedge. Police are investigating the incident, but early findings indicate the case is non-suspicious. The investigation will focus on ensuring that the proper procedures were taken during her care and supervision. The incident has raised important questions about the care of children in hotels and other public spaces. Although a babysitter was present at the time of the accident, it is unclear if the proper measures were taken to prevent the young girl from accessing the balcony. As we head into the holiday season, it's important to remind parents and caregivers to remain vigilant and to take all necessary precautions to keep children safe. The hotel's management has released a statement expressing their sympathy for the family and their full cooperation with the investigation. They have also taken steps to increase security measures throughout the hotel to ensure similar incidents do not occur in the future. Despite the traumatic nature of the incident, the young girl's resilience and the heroic actions of the hedge are a testament to the power of hope and the importance of safety measures. Our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time, and we wish the young girl a speedy recovery.
