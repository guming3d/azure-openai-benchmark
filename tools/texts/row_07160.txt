article: By . Antonia Hoyle for The Mail on Sunday . Made In Chelsea stars Alexandra ‘Binky’ Felstead and Millie Mackintosh are both patients at Mervyn Druian’s London Centre For Cosmetic Dentistry. Dr Druian says naturally gleaming  teeth like theirs are always preferable to the artificial, fully veneered finish favoured by the girls from their rival reality show The Only Way Is Essex. He says: ‘TOWIE people tend to be bigger, more brash personalities – they want these big white teeth. It’s  one-upmanship to have the whitest teeth possible. Scroll down for video . There's a right way and a wrong way: Millie Mackintosh's natural smile is preferable to Joey Essex's veneers . ‘They often want whiter veneers than we would give them. I’d never let a patient walk out looking foolish. We have turned people away because we don’t think they need veneers.’ He adds: ‘My perfect veneers don’t look like veneers, they look like teeth. ' 'I want my patients to be told they look really well. I don’t want them to be asked what work they’ve had done.’ In addition to whitening treatments, Binky Felstead had a chipped front tooth repaired by Dr Druian after an accident last week when her car went over a bump while she was drinking from a glass bottle. Sharp situation: Binky Felstead was treated for a chipped front tooth after an car accident last week . He says: ‘We used a filling material that blended in so well it looked invisible.’ He adds: ‘Millie has only ever had whitening with us. She’s been in a couple of times and is a lovely girl with very nice teeth.’ Millie, he says, doesn’t need veneers – and nor do scores of others wanting better, brighter teeth. ‘There are lots of ways to make teeth look better. You  can try invisible braces – which a dentist can do  – or whitening.’

chatgpt: Natural teeth are more desirable than artificial veneers, according to dental experts. Dr. Alice Juritz, dentist to the stars including the "Made in Chelsea" girls, has advised against veneers, instead suggesting invisible braces or whitening as alternatives. Dr. Juritz explained that veneers can be too invasive to the natural tooth structure. "Veneers involve removing some of the natural tooth structure to make room for a shell of porcelain or composite resin, which can weaken the tooth's structural integrity," she said. "So, if you have healthy teeth, it is much better to keep them." Furthermore, veneers can also be a costly investment, with a single tooth veneer costing anywhere from $500 to $2,500, depending on the materials used. In comparison, invisible braces such as Invisalign can cost around $3,000 to $8,000 for a full treatment, and tooth whitening around $500. Dr. Juritz also advised against certain habits that could damage natural teeth, such as smoking or drinking excessive amounts of coffee or red wine. "These habits can cause staining, which can ruin the appearance of your teeth," she said. "Rather than hiding the damage with veneers, it is better to try to minimize the damage in the first place." Invisible braces, on the other hand, offer a discreet and effective way to straighten teeth without the need for invasive procedures. They use a series of clear aligners that gradually shift teeth into the desired position, and are nearly invisible when worn. Tooth whitening is also an affordable and easy way to enhance the appearance of natural teeth without the need for veneers. Professional whitening treatments can be done in under an hour, with results lasting for up to two years. In conclusion, Dr. Juritz believes that natural teeth are the best option and should be maintained for as long as possible, with braces and whitening being better solutions for cosmetic issues. It is important to consult with a dental professional before making any decisions, as each patient's case is unique.
