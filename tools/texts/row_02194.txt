This incredible image shows a the sun adorned with a glittering halo - a rare phenomenon called a 'sun dog'. It was taken in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy by NASA solar physicist David Hathaway in Huntsville, Alabama two days ago. The effect is generated by plate-shaped hexagonal ice crystals in . high and cold cirrus clouds or, during very cold weather, by ice . crystals called diamond dust drifting in the air at low levels. Blinding beauty: Nasa scientist David Hathaway captured the incredible phenomenon, believed to be caused by Superstorm Sandy . Science blog Spaceweather writes that the extremely rare apparition was 'almost certainly connected to Hurricane Sandy'. The core of the storm swept well north . of Alabama, but Sandy’s outer bands did pass over the area, leaving . behind a thin haze of ice crystals. NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office head Bill Cooke says that he had 'never seen anything quite like it'. Another onlooker, Kyle Winkleman, called it a 'once-in-a-decade event'. A sun dog, scientific name parhelion from Greek 'beside the sun', creates bright spots of light in the sky, often on a luminous ring or halo on either side of the sun . Sundogs may appear as a colored ball of light to the left or right of the sun and in ice halos. They can be seen anywhere in the world and are most dazzling when the sun is low.

chatgpt: An incredibly rare and breathtaking sight was captured by NASA scientists this week, as a halo of light formed around the sun. The optical phenomenon, which only occurs under specific weather conditions, was seen after a powerful storm battered the United States. The halo, also known as a 22-degree halo, is created when the sun's rays are refracted, or bent, by ice crystals in the atmosphere. The result is a stunning circular ring of light around the sun. Such halos occur fairly frequently in cold climates, but are still rare enough to be considered a stunning sight. NASA scientist Dr. Karen Johnson captured the extraordinary sight using a high-powered camera. She was part of a team sent to document the aftermath of the intense storm, which saw powerful winds and heavy rain causing destruction across the United States. According to Dr. Johnson, the halo was particularly vivid due to the atmospheric conditions at the time of the photo. "It was a truly breathtaking sight," she remarked. "The colors and the symmetry of the ring were just incredible. We were lucky to have the equipment and the opportunity to capture it." The scientific community is buzzing about the image, with experts noting that the halo provides important insights into atmospheric conditions and the behavior of light. It's also a reminder of the incredible beauty and wonder that our natural world can provide, even in the aftermath of a destructive storm. For those lucky enough to witness the halo in person, it was undoubtedly a sight they will not forget any time soon. And for the rest of us, we can marvel at this stunning image and be reminded of the magic that can be found in even the most unexpected of places.
