article: Washington (CNN) -- African-American female lawmakers are taking the Army to task for a new ban on a number of ethnic hairstyles, guidelines which some are calling racially discriminatory. The group from the Congressional Black Caucus wrote Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday urging the military to reconsider the rule. "Though we understand the intent of the updated regulation is to ensure uniformity in our military, it is seen as discriminatory rules targeting soldiers who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain their natural hair," the letter said. Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman, said it had received the letter, appreciated their concerns and "will respond promptly and directly to them." The Army previously said it rejects any charges of discrimination, especially since black women were involved in helping craft the new guidelines regulating everything from the style of hair parts, the width of braids and how far thick hair can extend from the scalp. "African American female soldiers were involved in the process of developing the new female hair standards," said Troy Rolan, an Army spokesman. "Not only were nearly 200 senior female leaders and soldiers (which included a representative sample of the Army's populations) part of the decision-making process on the female hair standards, but the group was also led by an African American female." The Army has faced pushback from some African-American members of the military and black civilian supporters over new guidelines that mandate such things as hair "must be of uniform dimension, small in diameter (approximately Â¼ inch), show no more than 1/8 (inch) of the scalp between the braids." Army rules ban dreadlocks and twists of any kind as well as styles it views as "unkempt" or "matted." That type of language rankled the Black Caucus members. The issue, they say, is that such phrasing implies that ethnic hair that is "natural" or not straightened with heat or chemicals is somehow unruly and must be carefully regulated to fit within white cultural norms. "The use of words like 'unkempt' and 'matted' when referring to traditional hairstyles worn by women of color are offensive," the lawmakers wrote. "The assumption that individuals wearing these hairstyles cannot maintain them in a way that meets the professionalism of Army standards indicates a lack of cultural sensitivity conducive to creating a tolerant environment for minorities." In issuing its newest set of appearance guidelines, the Army has found itself entangled in centuries old identity politics that have been a sore point for the African-American community since slavery.

chatgpt: The United States Army recently revised its appearance guidelines, which have sparked a major controversy among black female lawmakers. The new guidelines ban a variety of African-American hairstyles, which these lawmakers argue is discriminatory and undermines the military's diversity and inclusion goals. Several members of Congress have written to the Secretary of the Army expressing their concerns, calling the new regulations "offensive and biased." The lawmakers argue that the Army's insistence on a "professional, uniform look" is discriminatory because it imposes white middle-class beauty standards on soldiers who come from a variety of backgrounds. This is not the first time the Army has been accused of discrimination against black soldiers. Historically, black hair has been a source of conflict and tension between black soldiers and white officers. In the past, black soldiers have been subjected to invasive and damaging hair grooming procedures, which have been compared to the treatment of enslaved Africans. The Army has denied the charges of discrimination, stating that the new guidelines are necessary to ensure that soldiers maintain a professional appearance and that the new rules are based on long-standing Army regulations. However, the lawmakers argue that this explanation ignores the potential impact that the new rules will have on minority soldiers. The new regulations ban hairstyles such as braids, twists, and dreadlocks, which are often worn by black women. These hairstyles are not only important cultural markers within the black community but also serve practical purposes, such as keeping hair out of the way during physical activities. Black female soldiers have argued that the new regulations will force them to engage in expensive and damaging hair treatments just to comply with Army standards. Critics of the new regulations argue that the Army should encourage diversity and inclusion, not impose a one-size-fits-all standard that discriminates against certain groups. The lawmakers who wrote the letter to the Secretary of the Army have called for a review of the new guidelines, stating that they are harmful to morale and could lead to decreased diversity within the Army. The controversy over the Army's new appearance guidelines highlights the ongoing struggle for equality within the Armed Forces. Black soldiers have faced discrimination and unequal treatment since the inception of the military, and the fight for inclusion and diversity continues to this day. The lawmakers who are pushing back against these new regulations are carrying on this legacy and demanding that the Army live up to its promise of serving all Americans.
