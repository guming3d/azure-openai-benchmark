chatgpt: Germany and Portugal will open their European Championship campaign with a clash in Group G that promises to be a tough encounter. Portugal’s talismanic captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, is set to start the match despite injury concerns, while Germany have no injury worries ahead of the game. This will be Germany's 100th game in the World Cup. They are the first team to reach this milestone, and will be looking to mark the occasion with a victory over their European rivals. Die Mannschaft have a strong record in the group stages of the tournament, having lost only one of their last 18 games in this phase of the competition. Their only defeat came against Serbia during the 2010 World Cup, with 13 wins and four draws in their last 18 group matches. On the other hand, Portugal will be looking to improve their record against their opponents in Group G. They have lost both their previous matches against Germany and the USA in the World Cup. However, Portugal will have Ronaldo leading the attack and will undoubtedly be a tough opponent for Germany. The Portugal captain has scored two goals from 48 shots in previous World Cup campaigns. Germany have been able to hit the ground running in their recent World Cup campaigns, winning their opening match in each of the last six tournaments. They will hope to do so again, with the last time they failed to win their opening match being in 1986, when they drew with Uruguay in the tournament held in Mexico. Germany scored the most goals of any team in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, with 36 goals. They will look to their veteran striker Miroslav Klose to continue his impressive record in World Cup tournaments. Klose has scored 14 goals in the tournament, and only Brazilian star Ronaldo has scored more, with 15 goals. Portugal, meanwhile, will look to Joao Moutinho to deliver the assists. The midfielder delivered ten assists in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, more than any other player. Despite their recent struggles in the World Cup, Portugal will be hoping to turn their fortunes around against Germany. They have only won three of their 17 previous games against Germany, losing their last three meetings in major tournaments.  The game promises to be an exciting encounter between two of Europe's top football nations, and fans of both teams will be eagerly anticipating the outcome.
