article: Maxine Powell, the mentor behind the smooth success and individual charm of Motown Records' stars for almost five decades, died Monday, the Detroit Free Press reported. She was 98. Powell, who started as a personal development coach with Motown in 1964, was known for teaching Motown artists how to walk, talk and even think with class. She played an influential role in nurturing its future stars including Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye by giving them lessons in media relations and proper manners. Mary Wilson, an original member of Motown's Supremes, quoted Powell as saying, "One day, you may be performing before kings and queens." "And we actually did," Wilson said in a 2002 interview with CNN. "But it was because they taught us how to sit, you know, to talk, and all of these kinds of things." In a statement Monday, Motown founder Berry Gordy said Powell was tough, but "poised, professional, and very thankful" as she worked with artists. Gordy's statement quoted Powell as telling the young artists: "I love you all, but don't confuse me with your mother -- she's stuck with you, I'm not!" "Ladies, remember your gloves, walk with class like you were taught -- and always remember, do not protrude the buttocks." "She brought something to Motown that no other record company had. She was a star in her own right -- an original," Gordy's statement added. Singer-songwriter and producer Smokey Robinson also paid tribute to Maxine Powell's contribution. "She led and lived a long wonderful life. I just saw her a couple of weeks ago and she was very mentally sharp. She was an essential part of Motown," he said in a statement. "We all loved her and she will be truly missed, but the evidence of her will live on and on through all of the Motown family." Powell was one of Detroit-based Motown's first personal development coaches along with Maurice King and Cholly Atkins, according to the company's website. People we've lost in 2013 .

chatgpt: Motown Records has paid tribute to Maxine Powell, one of their first personal development coaches, who passed away on October 14th at the age of 98. Powell, who was responsible for grooming young talents like Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye, was a key figure in shaping Motown's image and brand identity. "Smokey Robinson: 'Evidence of her will live on through all of the Motown family'," tweeted Robinson, reflecting on Powell's impact on Motown's legacy. "She brought something to Motown that no other record company had," the record label said in a statement. "She was a special and gifted mentor to many talented artists." Powell's work extended beyond grooming artists' stage presence. She instilled them with self-confidence and societal graces, molding them into well-rounded individuals. This approach was unique for the time, as few record companies offered such developmental training to their artists. "In a world where women, especially black women, had to fight to be seen as smart and valuable, she held up a mirror of worth and showed them their reflection," said author Stacy Brown, who wrote the biography "Motown: The Sound of Young America." Powell's talents were first discovered in the early 1960s by Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr, who was looking for someone to polish his fledgling label's stars. Powell soon became one of the most respected and sought-after personal development coaches in the music industry. One of Powell's most well-known protégés was Diana Ross, who credited Powell with shaping her into the poised and polished performer that she became. Ross was just one of the many stars in Powell's stable. Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye are among the many other artists who benefitted from her mentorship. As Motown Records looks to celebrate its 60th anniversary this year, the label remembers Powell's impact on the company and its music. Her legacy will forever be ingrained in the Motown family, never to be forgotten.
