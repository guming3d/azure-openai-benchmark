chatgpt: Andy Murray, former world no. 1 and three-time Grand Slam winner, will be taking to the court as captain of the Manila Mavericks in the International Premier Tennis League (IPTL). The IPTL is a professional team-based tennis league that has been around since 2014 and features some of the best talent from around the world. Murray is no stranger to the IPTL, having played for the Singapore Slammers in the league’s inaugural season. This time around, he will be leading the charge for the Manila Mavericks, a team based in the Philippines and owned by boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao. Pacquiao himself has been making headlines lately, having recently won the WBO world welterweight title on Saturday night. The victory marks a historic return to the ring for Pacquiao, who had previously retired from boxing in 2019. After his big win, Pacquiao returned to his home country of the Philippines, where he met with Murray on Thursday. The two sports icons posed for photos together, with Pacquiao tweeting out the pictures to his millions of followers. Murray’s participation in the IPTL this year is a welcome addition for fans of the league, as the COVID-19 pandemic has caused numerous disruptions to the world of tennis. The IPTL, much like other sports leagues, has had to adapt to new safety protocols and travel restrictions, but organizers have managed to put together a strong lineup of players for this year’s competition. Aside from Murray, the Manila Mavericks will be fielding a formidable lineup that includes Japanese star Taro Daniel and local talent Treat Huey. The IPTL will also feature other big names in tennis like Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Serena Williams.
