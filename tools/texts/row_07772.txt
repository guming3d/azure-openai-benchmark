article: (Ars Technica) -- Samsung has taken another hit from Apple in Europe, thanks to an appeals court in Germany. The court ruled on Tuesday morning that the Galaxy Tab 7.7 indeed infringes upon Apple's design patent for the iPad, and banned it from sale across the EU. The Galaxy Tab 10.1N, however, managed to make its way through the cracks, with the court allowing it to be sold in Germany. The Galaxy Tab 7.7 had already been banned from sale in Germany thanks to a decision from a lower court in late 2011. At that time, the court treated Samsung Germany as a separate entity from Samsung in Korea; the latter was able to continue selling the tablet throughout the rest of Europe.

This was reversed on Tuesday when the Duesseldorf High Court decided that Samsung Germany was instead a local branch of the Korean company, resulting in the EU-wide ban. According to a statement released by the court, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 infringes upon Apple's registered EU Community Design for the iPad. But Samsung didn't lose entirely. The appeals court also upheld a previous ruling that the Galaxy Tab 10.1N â€” the larger of Samsung's two tablets â€” had indeed been sufficiently changed from the original Tab 10.1 design, therefore differentiating it enough from the iPad. The original Tab 10.1 had been banned in Germany last year for looking too much like Apple's iPad Community Design; Samsung eventually changed the look of the front and slapped an "N" on the device's name, qualifying it for sale in Germany. Samsung vowed to continue fighting Apple, despite its win with the Tab 10.1N. "Samsung is disappointed with the court's ruling. We will continue to take all available measures, including legal action, to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against Apple's claims to ensure our products remain available to consumers throughout the European Union," the company said in a statement.

chatgpt: In a recent judgment, a German appeals court has ruled in Apple's favor that the Galaxy Tab 7.7 tablet by Samsung infringes on iPads patent, leading to a ban on its sale across the European Union. Apple had filed a suit against Samsung, alleging that the Galaxy Tab 7.7 tablet was a copy of its iPad design. The lawsuit was filed in Germany, where many major tech companies have their European headquarters. The court's ruling upholds an earlier decision that was made by the lower court in 2019. The court agreed that Samsung had copied several iPad design features on the Tab 7.7, including the rounded edges and the overall shape of the device. As a result of the ruling, Samsung is now prohibited from selling the Galaxy Tab 7.7 in any of the 28 EU countries. This is a significant blow to Samsung, which was hoping to capitalize on the growing demand for tablets. However, in a silver lining to Samsung, the Galaxy Tab 10.1N is allowed to be sold. This is something that was changed by Samsung after the original Galaxy Tab 10.1 was banned. The court found that Samsung had sufficiently changed the design of the tablet to avoid further infringement issues. The Galaxy Tab 10.1 had faced a similar lawsuit in 2011, with Apple alleging that Samsung had copied its design. The tablet was banned in Germany, but Samsung was able to introduce a redesigned version, the Galaxy Tab 10.1N, which was allowed to be sold. The legal battle between Apple and Samsung has been a long and ongoing saga. The two tech giants have been locked in a series of patent disputes that have seen both companies suing each other in courtrooms around the world. The ruling in Germany is just the latest in a long line of legal battles between the two companies. The court's decision could have a significant impact on Samsung's bottom line, as the Galaxy Tab 7.7 was one of its flagship products. In conclusion, with the ban of the Galaxy Tab 7.7 by the EU court, Samsung is left to rethink its design strategy. The company will have to work harder at creating unique features that will not infringe on Apple's intellectual property rights.
