article: By . Oliver Todd . Follow @@oliver_todd . The Premier League is providing more World Cup quarter finalists than any other league in the world - showing England's top clubs are still some of the best when it comes to world class quality. But while English sides are proving to be the most collectively successful in Brazil so far, Bayern Munich - as they often do - are still top of the pile with 10 players left in the tournament. The German champions started the World Cup with more players than anyone else, and many of them are still in with the national team - which alone boasts seven Bayern stars - making it through to the quarter finals. Premier League's finest: Andre Schurrle and Mesut Ozil both scored for Germany in their last-16 tie . Spot on: Romelu Lukaku scored in the last round to help him and his Premier League team mates advance . Surprise package: Bryan Ruiz might have been out on loan but he's still England-based with Fulham . Blues brothers: Oscar and Ramires are among a host of Premier League players in Brazil's squad . Arsenal and Chelsea lead the way for the English, providing eight and seven players each - leaving them just behind the German champions. Both Manchester clubs, London rivals Tottenham and Alan Pardew's Newcastle all make it into the top 20 clubs too. Spain's World Cup flop appears to have cost their league giants Real Madrid and Barcelona places amongst the top ranking clubs - and if they had made it to this stage the traditional La Liga rivals could boast eight and nine participants respectively. Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid amazingly fail to make the list of the World Cup's top 20 clubs while La Liga registers as just the fifth best league in the world behind England, Germany, Italy and France. The figures fuel the long running argument over which country boasts the best league. While the Premier League has long sold itself as the best around, back-to-back all-German and all-Spanish Champions League finals have brought the claim into question. And the English clubs will undoubtedly be able to show off even more top talent after what looks to be a busy summer of transfer activity for the big clubs, although none of the players listed here will be keen to talk about that sort of thing with the focus still on international glory. It's a knockout: Robin van Persie's brilliant header helped knock out a load of La Liga players with Spain . VIDEO All Star XI: Vincent Kompany . Club: Kompany with the English champions . Country: City's captain in Brazil . Club: Debuchy playing on Tyneside . Country: Newcastle's right back .

chatgpt: The Premier League has long been touted as one of the top football leagues in the world, and this year's Champions League knockout stage has only served to strengthen that reputation. With a whopping 17 quarter finalists, the Premier League has left other leagues far behind in terms of representation in the last eight. However, there is one club that has truly dominated the tournament so far - Bayern Munich. The German giants have a remarkable 10 players still left in the competition, a testament to their squad depth and quality. They are the favorites to win the tournament, and fans across the world will be keeping a close eye on their progress. But the Premier League can still hold its head high, with two of its clubs leading the way in terms of representation. Arsenal and Chelsea are both through to the quarter finals, with the Gunners overcoming a tough test against Barcelona in the previous round. They will be looking to improve on their recent European performances and make it all the way to the final. It's not just the top clubs in the Premier League that are making waves in world football, though. Six English clubs feature in the world's top 20 World Cup performers, a clear indication of the league's strength in depth. Fans will be hoping that this success will translate into international success for the national team in the future. But there are some surprises in the remaining teams as well.

Overall, this year's Champions League knockout stage has been a thrilling spectacle for fans across the world. The Premier League's dominance in terms of representation shows that it is truly one of the top leagues in the world, while Bayern Munich's impressive squad depth makes them the favorites to lift the trophy.
