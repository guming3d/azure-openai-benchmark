Then there's the expected tears as the game goes horribly wrong . The expression of the young girl dressed as a princess is priceless as she looks on open-mouthed .

They were kicking the ball for 20 minutes before I decided to film and that's what I got.' 'He (Oliver) was fine as well, he cried for 10 seconds, then I showed him the video and he is happy!'
