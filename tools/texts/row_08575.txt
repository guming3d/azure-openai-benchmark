A council has come under fire for putting up signs warning of fines for littering in three different languages – and none of them is English. Labour-run Haringey council was accused of wasting taxpayers’ money on the signs which are ‘unintelligible’ to the majority of passers-by. The tri-lingual signs have sprung up in North London to the alarm of local residents. Rubbish: The new signs put up by Haringey council warn against littering in Polish, Kurdish and Turkish . The large signs have been attached to lamposts warning of a £75 fixed penalty for anyone caught dropping litter or throwing rubbish from their car. It status that it is an offence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and states that fines can be as high as £2,500. But the warnings are written in Greek, Turkish and Slovenian- with the only English being the name of the council under its black and orange logo. Fines: The signs warn of £75 fixed penalty charges, rising to £2,500 for anyone caught dropping litter . The signs have raised eyebrows on the streets of Haringey. Kay Carter, local resident and Conservative activist, said: ‘This is yet another appalling waste of money from Labour-run Haringey council. ‘If signs are necessary they should be in English. It's ridiculous to waste council taxpayers money on signs that target a small segment of the local population and are unintelligible to the rest.’ Earlier this year Haringey council was accused of ordering CCTV 'spy' cars to hit minimum targets for issuing penalty notices - despite the practice being illegal. The alleged policy revealed in a series of leaked emails. They showed the council's CCTV cars were told to issue at least 260 fines a day - a total of 87,360 a year. The council has denied imposing a quota for fines. A Haringey Council spokesman said: 'Littering is an offence that our residents rightly expect us to tackle, and that includes issuing on-the-spot fines to people caught littering. 'However, these are old signs that were used for a limited time in areas where a number of people caught littering did not understand English. 'We no longer produce any enforcement signs that do not include English.'

chatgpt: Haringey council, which is run by the Labour Party, has come under criticism for allegedly wasting taxpayers' money in a language-related incident. The council has warned residents of potential fines and penalties of up to £75, but ironically, the notices were published in Greek, Turkish and Slovenian, instead of English.  The move has been deemed as a gross waste of time, effort and precious public resources, given that English is the primary language spoken in the area. The incident has attracted the attention of numerous critics, who have castigated Haringey council for its poor decision-making and lack of foresight. The notices, which were intended to inform Haringey residents of the potential ramifications of certain offenses, had been plastered on lampposts and other public spaces across the borough. The notices, which have now been removed, were written in Greek, Turkish and Slovenian without an English translation, which is a potentially serious omission that could have caused confusion and misunderstanding among residents. A spokesperson for Haringey council admitted the error and expressed regret over the oversight. The spokesperson said: “We apologise for not including English translations of our latest enforcement notices. This was an error by a third-party supplier and it is now being rectified. We take our responsibilities seriously and always aim to provide information in a range of languages.” Labour Party in Haringey has also commented on the incident, stating their disappointment and acknowledging that the mishap has been unacceptable. They said: "We are disappointed in this oversight and have discussed the matter with the relevant department. We will ensure that all future notices are translated into English as well as other languages." Although the translation error may have been an unintentional mistake caused by a third-party supplier, the incident has exposed a significant oversight on Haringey council's part. The situation could have been much worse had a member of the public misinterpreted the notice, causing them to fall foul of the council's enforcement rules and regulations. In conclusion, while the council’s attempt to reach out to a wider linguistic community is commendable, it is equally important to take into account the fact that an overwhelming majority of the residents in Haringey speak the English language. The council must ensure all future enforcement notices are translated into English as well as any additional languages. It must also be more vigilant when it comes to third-party suppliers to ensure that such mistakes are never repeated.
