article: MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- In response to a spate of attacks allegedly by a drug cartel, Mexico more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling the state of Michoacan, a government spokeswoman said. Drug violence is up in Michoacan state, shown by recent attacks on police in at least a half-dozen cities. The government on Thursday dispatched 1,000 federal police officers to Michoacan state in southwest Mexico, increasing its presence to 1,300 total, Public Safety spokeswoman Veronica Penunuri told CNN. At least 18 federal agents and two soldiers have been killed since the weekend in Michoacan, the home state of President Felipe Calderon. The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest Saturday of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, whom authorities described as a high-ranking member of the drug cartel known as La Familia Michoacana. Cartel members first attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda, authorities said. When that failed, drug gangs attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities, according to authorities. The Michoacan cartel also is accused in the slaying of 12 federal police officers whose bodies were found Tuesday on a remote highway. Video from the scene showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, left by the killers. They all stated the same thing: "So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here." Since Calderon went after the drug cartels shortly after coming into office in 2006, more than 10,000 people have died across Mexico, about 1,000 of them police. The state of Michoacan, on Mexico's southwest Pacific coast, is not alone in the wave of violence sweeping the country. The border city of Ciudad Juarez set a record this weekend when its toll of drug-related deaths for the year topped 1,000, a distinction the Mexican city did not reach last year until September.

chatgpt: In response to a sudden spike in violence in Michoacan, the Mexican government has significantly increased the number of federal police officers patrolling the state. The move comes after a series of deadly attacks, which have been linked to the infamous drug cartel, La Familia Michoacana. The escalation in violence began shortly after the arrest of a high-ranking member of the cartel on Saturday. Since then, La Familia Michoacana has been accused in the slayings of at least 12 federal police officers. As a result, the government has rapidly increased the number of officers on the ground in order to combat the growing threat. According to reports, the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan has more than tripled in recent days. The influx of officers has been accompanied by a renewed effort to root out members of the cartel and disrupt their operations. Despite this response, the situation on the ground in Michoacan remains tense. The recent spate of attacks has left the local population fearful and concerned for their safety. Many have called on the government to do more to protect civilians and ensure that justice is served for those affected by the violence. The issue of drug trafficking and cartel violence is one that has plagued Mexico for decades. Despite numerous efforts by the government to crack down on these criminal organizations, they continue to operate with impunity in many parts of the country. For now, the increased police presence in Michoacan is seen as a positive step towards addressing the immediate threat posed by La Familia Michoacana. However, many questions remain about the effectiveness of these measures and what the long-term solutions to this issue may be. As the situation continues to evolve, local residents and the international community will be watching closely to see how the Mexican government responds to this latest crisis.
