Every child could leave school with essential lifesaving skills after Ministers backed a Mail on Sunday campaign to add first aid to the curriculum. Schools Minister David Laws became the first high-profile member of the Coalition to support the move, piling pressure on Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to introduce mandatory training for first aid in schools. Mr Laws said the crucial skills should be taught as a compulsory part of Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) lessons, which also cover sex education, anti-bullying and careers advice. The newspaper is campaigning to make sure all schools teach basic first aid techniques – simple acts that could save hundreds of thousands of lives every year. The skills can also be taught by older children to their younger peers. Our campaign now has cross-party support and is also backed by teachers and a number of leading charities. Mr Laws said: ‘Parents expect to see some basic standards laid out on what their children will learn in school. All children should leave school with the essential skills and knowledge that prepares them for life. ‘Liberal Democrats are clear that all schools should teach Personal, Social and Health Education, and that we would expect that to include first aid.’ Mr Laws’s statement comes after Lib Dems voted in October to include mandatory first aid training in schools in their latest manifesto. Tory Health Minister Earl Howe has also voiced his support, saying: ‘First aid is a highly valuable, potentially lifesaving skill and I encourage schools to teach pupils first aid through their PSHE lessons.’ Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on first aid, said he hoped the other two main parties would also add the proposals to their pre-Election manifestos. ‘Mr Laws is considering these proposals,’ he said. ‘Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he sees this as part of the preventative agenda.’ Other politicians backing the plans include Labour’s Julie Hilling and Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris. Ms Hilling said: ‘This is as essential as learning to read or write. Learning to save a life is precious.’ Charities including St John Ambulance and the British Heart Foundation are also behind the scheme. BHF chief executive Simon Gillespie said: ‘A future government will need to play its part by making CPR part of the curriculum – a move that already has the support of the public, teachers and doctors.’

chatgpt: Ministers in the UK have backed a campaign to add first aid to the school curriculum. This move could potentially save many lives as children could leave school with essential lifesaving skills. Many people are in favor of this initiative, including high-profile members of the Coalition government such as Mr. Laws, who was the first to voice his support for this campaign. The idea behind this initiative is to ensure that every child is equipped with the necessary knowledge to handle emergencies that might arise in their day-to-day lives. The key objective is to make sure that children are able to respond effectively to emergencies and provide medical assistance when needed.  The campaign has been gathering momentum for quite some time and has received widespread support from teachers, parents and health professionals. The plan is to train students to handle common emergency medical situations, such as choking, bleeding and cardiac arrest. The training will also include basic first aid skills, such as CPR and the use of defibrillators. Supporters of the campaign say that adding first aid to the curriculum is essential as it not only teaches vital skills, but also promotes confidence and empathy among children. It also encourages a healthier lifestyle and teaches young people the importance of taking care of their own health and wellbeing. Mr Laws, a former Minister of State for Schools, has praised the campaign for its ability to give children a broader range of skills that will prepare them for life beyond the classroom. He also notes that it will give children the opportunity to develop important life skills that could prove invaluable in future. The move to include first aid in the curriculum has also received support from leading medical experts. Dr. Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said that knowing how to perform CPR and use a defibrillator can mean the difference between life and death in a cardiac arrest emergency. The proposal has been received positively by many MPs as well. However, there are concerns about how the initiative will be funded, with some critics suggesting that schools may struggle to pay for the necessary training and equipment. Despite these concerns, the campaign to add first aid to the school curriculum has received overwhelming support from many quarters. In addition to providing children with a valuable life skill, it could lead to better health outcomes for individuals and communities as a whole. In conclusion, the initiative to add first aid to the school curriculum is a positive step towards equipping young people with valuable lifesaving skills. The move has received support from a range of stakeholders and has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of individuals and communities. Time will tell how this campaign will pan out, but the hope is that it will make a big difference in the lives of young people in the UK.
