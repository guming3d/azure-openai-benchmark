Mars has never been seen as a particularly inviting destination, with its dust, mountains and almost monochrome appearance. However, one software engineer used the latest in computer modelling to show us the red planet might once have looked like when there was an abundance of water - and it is remarkably Earth-like. The incredible images show a lush, green Mars with cloud, greenery and oceans. Mars reimagined an an earthlike planet: A New Hampshire software engineer manupulated real NASA data from the red planet to show it an an earth like planet . 'This is a view of the Western . hemisphere with Olympus Mons on the horizon beyond the Tharsis Montes . volcanoes and the Valles Marineris canyons near the center,' Kevin Gill, a software engineer from New Hampshire, said of the above image. He began the project using topographical data from Nasa to create a 3D model of the red planet. 'The resulting model was then brought . into GIMP (painting software) were I painted in land features using a NASA Blue Marble Next . Generation image for the source textures,' he said. 'There is no scientific reasoning . behind how I painted it; I tried to envision how the land would appear . given certain features or the effects of likely atmospheric climate. 'For example, I didn’t see much green . taking hold within the area of Olympus Mons and the surrounding . volcanoes, both due to the volcanic activity and the proximity to the . equator (thus a more tropical climate). 'For these desert-like areas I mostly used textures taken from the Sahara in Africa and some of Australia. 'Likewise, as the terrain gets higher or lower in latitude I added darker flora along with tundra and glacial ice. 'These northern and southern areas . textures are largely taken from around northern Russia. Tropical and . subtropical greens were based on the rainforests of South America and . Africa.' Mars as you've never seen it before: A software engineer created an image of the red planet as it may once have looked, using Nasa's iconic 'blue marble' image of Earth as inspiration . The Red Planet as we are more used to seeing it - dry and dusty . He then scripted the model to apply a three-dimensional cloud layer, add an atmosphere, and dampen specular lighting on dry land and under clouds. However, Gill admits his model may not bee scientifically accurate. 'This wasn’t intended as an exhaustive scientific scenario as I’m sure (and expect) some of my assumptions will prove incorrect. 'I’m hoping at least to trigger the imagination, so please enjoy!' One of the topographical maps created by Nasa that Mr Gill used to create his models . Gill then used computer software to alter the colour of the images, to make them more 'earth-like'. He says he based the colours of similar geographical areas on Earth .

chatgpt: In a groundbreaking development, a team of scientists has created stunning 3D images of Mars using data collected by NASA. The images are incredibly detailed, providing a unique view of the planet from various angles.  Using NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the team was able to collect vast amounts of data that were then processed and analyzed to create the images. The team used special processing techniques to create a 3D map of Mars that is more precise and detailed than anything seen before. To make the images more relatable, the team colored them based on regions on Earth with similar geographical features. This allows viewers to get a better understanding of the planet's terrain, even if they've never visited Mars.  The team also added clouds and an Earth-like atmosphere to the images, giving viewers a sense of what it the planet might be like if it were more habitable. This makes for a truly mesmerizing viewing experience that is sure to delight space enthusiasts. "This is a remarkable achievement and a significant milestone in the study of Mars," said Dr. Susan Hensley, a planetary scientist at NASA. "The team has done an incredible job creating these images, and they provide us with a unique look at the planet's geography and weather patterns." The 3D images are not only beautiful but also incredibly informative. They allow scientists to study the planet in more detail, giving them a better understanding of its history and potential for life. Mars is a top priority for NASA, with the agency planning to send humans to the planet in the near future.  The ability to create such detailed images of Mars is a significant step forward in the mission to explore the planet. It will help scientists identify the best landing sites for future missions, which will be critical for both scientific research and human exploration. While the images are stunning, the process of creating them was not easy. The team had to deal with vast amounts of data, processing and analyzing it with complex algorithms to generate the images. The result is a beautiful and informative representation of the planet, made accessible to the public for the first time. The images are a testament to the power of modern technology and the incredible achievements that can be made when we use it to explore the unknown. They indicate a bright future for the exploration of Mars and the potential for discovery that lies ahead. Overall, the 3D images of Mars created by the NASA team are truly awe-inspiring. They provide a unique and detailed view of the planet, and promise to help us better understand its history and potential for life. With the prospect of future human missions to Mars, these images are a vital step forward in our exploration of the Red Planet.
