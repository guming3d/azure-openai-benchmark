article: (CNN) -- Chile poured firefighters and police into the battle against a wildfire that swept through hundreds of homes in the Pacific coastal city of Valparaiso, leaving at least 12 dead, according to an official. Interior Minister Rodrigo Penailillo reported at least 2,000 homes had been destroyed by the blaze, leaving some 8,000 people without a place to live. Earlier, Chile's National Emergency Office's website, citing police, had said that at least 16 people were dead. It was not immediately clear why the reported death tolls were different. More than 1,200 firefighters worked to control the wind-whipped blaze in Valparaiso and the suburb of Vina del Mar, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said Sunday. The wind hampered firefighters' ability to create firebreaks, and the blaze had spread to more than 2,000 acres, Penailillo said. "It's been one of the worst fires in history," said Fernando Reseio, the fire superintendent in Vina del Mar. Bachelet said the firefighters were backed up by 17 aircraft and that additional police were being brought in to prevent looting in the areas abandoned by their residents. Many of the survivors suffered burns, and the most seriously burned patients were being transferred to hospitals in the capital, Santiago, about 75 miles away, the president said. In images broadcast by CNN sister network CNN Chile, residents could be seen fleeing the flames overnight. The network reported that the sweeping fire is endangering thousands more homes. In addition, plans were being drawn up to evacuate inmates at Valparaiso prison as a preventive measure, Mayor Jorge Castro said. The city is under a red alert, said emergency office spokesman Ricardo Toro. Earlier, Bachelet had declared a state of emergency, which legally allows armed forces to get involved. CNN's Michael Roa and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A massive fire has broken out in the Chilean city of Valparaiso, fueled by strong winds that are complicating firefighting efforts. As of today, around 500 firefighters from seven provinces are working tirelessly to contain the fire, which has already destroyed several homes and buildings. The fire began on Sunday afternoon in the hills of the city, quickly spreading to the urban area. The wind gusts have made it difficult for firefighters to control the blaze, and strong gusts have continued to fan the flames, causing the fire to spread at an alarming rate. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet declared a state of emergency in the area and has ordered the deployment of additional firefighting resources to the region. In a statement, Bachelet expressed her solidarity with the people of Valparaiso and pledged the government's full support in the efforts to control the fire. The authorities have also evacuated several neighborhoods in the area to prevent any loss of life. While there have been no reports of any casualties so far, several people have been treated for smoke inhalation. The residents of Valparaiso have been asked to stay indoors and avoid the affected areas. The authorities have also issued health warnings due to the heavy smoke that has been generated by the fire. Valparaiso, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a popular tourist destination that attracts thousands of visitors each year. The city is known for its colorful houses, steep hills, and stunning views of the Pacific Ocean. The cause of the fire is still unknown, but it is believed to have started in a forested area on the outskirts of the city. The Chilean government has assured its citizens that it is doing everything in its power to control the fire and minimize the damage. In the meantime, the residents of Valparaiso, who are witness to the devastating effects of the fire, remain hopeful for a quick resolution.
