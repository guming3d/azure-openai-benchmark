article: A U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser took evasive action to avoid colliding with a Chinese warship in the South China Sea in what sources called a highly unusual and deliberate act by China, CNN has learned. The incident last Friday, which was resolved peacefully, was the latest sign of tension around recent and aggressive Chinese territorial claims in the region involving international waters and expanded airspace. Vice President Joe Biden last week pressed Beijing over the issue, which stems from a longstanding dispute with Japan that has grown tenser. Several U.S. military officials confirmed details of the incident on the high seas involving the USS Cowpens, which has just come to light. The American warship -- which U.S. officials say was in international waters -- was approached by a Chinese Navy ship. The smaller vessel peeled off from a group of Chinese Navy ships that included the carrier Liaoning. The Chinese ship failed to stop, despite radio warning from the Cowpens that it was getting too close. The Cowpens commanding officer then issued orders for an "all stop" when the other ship was less than 500 yards off its bow, a U.S. Navy official said. The Chinese ship proceeded past the Cowpens. "It is unusual to have to take evasive action at sea to avoid a collision," the official added. While naval vessels from different countries often come close as they observe each other, the United States sees this case as one that could have led to a collision because of the time and distance it takes for an American warship to stop. "The Chinese knew what they were doing," a second U.S. military official said. During the encounter, bridge-to-bridge radio communications were maintained between the American and Chinese commanders. "Communications were professional," the second official said. Though the United States will not acknowledge it openly, the Cowpens was in position to conduct surveillance on the Liaoning, which would be a sensitive matter for the Chinese. U.S. officials insist the Cowpens remained in international waters at all times. During a visit to Beijing last week, Biden told Chinese President Xi Jinping the United States had "deep concerns" over its newly declared East China Sea air defense zone and that Washington did not recognize it. The Chinese action, Biden said in Japan before the Xi visit, raised the possibility of "accidents and miscalculation." The area in question includes uninhabited islands that have been the site of tense disputes between China and Japan, both of which claim the lands.

chatgpt: On Sunday, a U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser was forced to come to an abrupt stop in the South China Sea, after a Chinese Navy ship allegedly crossed within 500 yards of the American vessel. The incident, which occurred in international waters, is sure to raise tensions between the two superpowers. The USS Chancellorsville was transiting through the South China Sea when, according to U.S. officials, a Chinese Navy ship appeared on a collision course, requiring the American sailors to take evasive action. The U.S. commander of the guided missile cruiser, apparently fearing a collision, gave the "all stop" order. It is unclear at this stage exactly how close the two ships came to each other, but 500 yards is within the "safe distance" that is typically observed by naval vessels. The South China Sea is a contentious area, with China claiming much of the waters as its own, despite international law stating that the sea is open to all. The U.S. Navy has often sent its ships into the region to conduct so-called freedom of navigation operations, which are intended to challenge China's claims to the sea. China, for its part, has repeatedly warned the United States to stay out of the area. This isn't the first time that the U.S. Navy and the Chinese Navy have had run-ins in the South China Sea. Last year, the USS Decatur was involved in a similar incident when a Chinese Navy ship allegedly sailed within 45 yards of the American vessel. The U.S. Navy described that incident as "unsafe and unprofessional", while the Chinese government accused the United States of breaching China's sovereignty. After the latest incident, the U.S. Navy issued a statement saying that it was "operating in accordance with international law and maritime norms and standards". However, the Chinese government hasn't yet commented on the incident. It remains to be seen whether this latest encounter will result in yet another war of words between the two countries, or whether it will escalate into something more serious. The U.S. and China have been locked in a tense trade war for the past year, and tensions between the two superpowers have risen as a result. The U.S. has frequently accused China of unfair trade practices, theft of intellectual property, and human rights abuses, while China has accused the United States of interfering in its internal affairs, and attempting to contain China's rise as a global superpower. The South China Sea is just one of the many flashpoints between the U.S. and China, and given the high stakes involved, any further escalations could have serious consequences for the entire region. As such, it is in the interests of both countries to de-escalate tensions and avoid any further incidents that could lead to a full-blown crisis.
