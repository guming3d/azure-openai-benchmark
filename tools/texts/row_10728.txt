article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Variations of two deadly superbugs that had previously only been discovered in the United States have surfaced in South America. Variations of two U.S. strains of killer bacteria have cropped up in South America, researchers say. The drug-resistant microorganisms are sweeping across communities in Colombia and have the potential to unleash devastating results, according to researchers at The University of Texas Medical School at Houston. "The people of Colombia are not aware this is coming. It is killing people here and it is going to kill a lot of people there if we don't act quickly," Dr. Cesar Arias, one of the lead researchers of the study, told CNN. The study, which was carried out with the Universidad El Bosque in Bogota, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday. The bugs that have emerged in Colombia are genetically related to two strains of bacteria -- MRSA and VREF -- that have spread across the United States. MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, was once spread mainly in hospitals. In recent years, a number of people not in contact with hospitals have presented with the disease, which is a leading cause of severe skin infections in the United States. VREF, which stands for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, mainly arises in hospitals and infects people in critical care units. Both so-called superbugs can cause lethal infections and are resistant to antibiotics. There were no known cases of this type of MRSA in Colombia before 2005, and no cases of VREF before 2001, the study said. But a total of 15 MRSA infections have been reported in Colombia in recent years and some 50 cases of VREF have been identified since it was first documented in the country. The MRSA strain has also been found in Ecuador and Venezuela. For some reason, the bacteria in South America are acting in a similar way as their genetic forebears in the United States, Arias, who is an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the UT Medical School at Houston, said. They are becoming more resistant and spreading the same way, Arias explained. "The dramatic thing is the first 15 patients who had this disease presented out of hospital, and 20 percent of these patients died," he said. Researchers are tracking the cases to see how the organisms got to South America. The focus now, Arias said, is to establish the link between the two regions and to figure out how to control their spread.

chatgpt: Superbugs that are genetically related to two strains of bacteria found in the United States have been discovered in South America, raising concern about the spread of deadly infections in the region. Experts are now working to track these cases and understand how these organisms managed to make their way to South America. The germs are believed to be responsible for causing lethal infections in some cases. Scientists are concerned that these so-called "superbugs" could pose a major public health threat, particularly in countries where access to high-quality medical care is limited. The two strains of bacteria are known as CP-Ec and ESBL-Ec. These bacterias are resistant to most commonly used antibiotics, which makes them extremely difficult to treat. This resistance has raised concerns among medical experts who fear that this could result in an increase in the number of people dying from infections caused by these bacteria. Researchers are working to understand how the organisms made their way to South America. It is believed that these bacteria may have been carried by people traveling between the United States and South America, either intentionally or unintentionally. The discovery of these superbugs is the latest indication that antibiotic resistance is becoming an increasingly complex problem. Overuse of antibiotics, both in humans and livestock, is believed to be a major contributor to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. South American countries such as Brazil, Chile, and Argentina are also grappling with increasing antibiotic resistance, making the discovery of these superbugs even more concerning. Experts are now calling for improved antibiotic stewardship programs, as well as better surveillance of antibiotic resistance in South America. The use of antibiotics for both humans and animals must be carefully managed to ensure that these important drugs remain effective against harmful bacteria. This includes reducing the use of antibiotics in agriculture and improving the use of vaccines, hygiene, and sanitation measures to prevent the spread of bacteria. The World Health Organization estimates that antibiotic resistance could cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050 if urgent action is not taken. The discovery of the superbugs in South America underscores the need for immediate and ongoing action to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and protect public health. In conclusion, the discovery of genetically related superbugs in South America is a cause for worry for medical experts. The tracking of cases and exploration of how they got there is important to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Immediate steps must be taken to prevent the risk of further deaths and the spread of superbugs in South America.
