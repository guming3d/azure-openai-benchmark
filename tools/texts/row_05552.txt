article: (CNN) -- Canadian police arrested three people Sunday in connection with a daring helicopter escape from a Quebec prison. Benjamin Hudon-Barbeau, one of two escaped inmates is in custody, along with two other people, said Quebec provincial police spokesman Benoit Richard. Dany Provencal, the second inmate, is "surrounded," and authorities are negotiating to bring him in peacefully, he said. "I can tell you one thing: The two people that were inside the jail needed help to get out," Richard told CNN. The spokesman declined to identify the other two people arrested. He also declined to say where the arrests took place, under what circumstances, or where Provencal was located. The three people arrested will appear in court Monday morning. The escape happened at around 2:20 p.m. ET Sunday at a prison in Saint-Jerome, northwest of Montreal. The pilot was taken to a hospital for examination and will be interviewed by investigators, Richard said. He did not know whether the pilot had been injured and declined to speculate on news reports that said the inmates held a gun to the pilot's head, forcing him to fly. Richard told CNN the pilot is considered a witness, not a suspect. Hudon-Barbeau was cleared on appeal of a double murder, but returned to prison in connection with an attempted murder investigation, the spokesman said. He said he did not know what Provencal was convicted of. Christa McGregor, spokeswoman for the Correctional Service of Canada, said Provencal was serving a federal sentence of seven years and 10 months for various offenses including arson, break and enter, forcible confinement, unauthorized possession of a firearm, utter threats to cause harm and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle. His sentence started in September 2011, she said. After the escape, a man claiming to be Hudon-Barbeau spoke to a reporter at 98.5 FM in Montreal, by phone. "I don't want to cause any harm to anybody. I am not a killer. I never did anything bad to an innocent. I know that (the escape) wasn't the best thing to do, but I didn't want to stay in prison anymore. I am ready to die," the station reported he said. It also reported that the helicopter involved approached the prison and dropped a cable that allowed the inmates to escape. The helicopter was later found at Mont-Tremblant, also in Quebec. Once the helicopter landed, Hudon-Barbeau and Provencal are believed to have left in a car. Authorities were looking for that car, but Richard declined to provide a description of it. After the arrests, he said he didn't know whether the vehicle had been found. Officials were doing a headcount at the prison to make sure that no one else was unaccounted for, the spokesman said. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt reported from New York. Dana Ford wrote this report from Atlanta. CNN's Paula Newton and Alexander Hunter also contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Authorities in Quebec are still in negotiations with the escaped inmate Dany Provencal, who was one of two prisoners to make a daring escape from prison via helicopter on Sunday afternoon. According to reports, Provencal is believed to be hiding out in a rural area near the prison, and police are urging members of the public to stay vigilant as the search for the escaped prisoner continues. Meanwhile, police have arrested another inmate, Benjamin Hudon-Barbeau, alongside two other individuals in connection to the daring escape. It remains unclear, however, what role Hudon-Barbeau and the two other individuals may have played in the escape or if they were simply involved in aiding the escapees after their successful getaway. The escape on Sunday afternoon was a brazen act of criminality, and authorities are struggling to locate both inmates despite extensive searches being conducted by hundreds of police officers and military personnel. The inmates made their getaway via helicopter, which was flown into the prison's courtyard, allowing the prisoners to climb aboard and escape through the air. During the daring escape, a pilot was also enlisted to help fly the helicopter, though his role in the escape has yet to be fully established. Reports indicate that the pilot was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, though he is not currently considered a suspect in the escape. It is believed that Provencal and Hudon-Barbeau are both dangerous individuals, and authorities have issued a warning to the public to avoid approaching the individuals if they are spotted. Members of the public are urged to call the police immediately if they see anything suspicious or if they believe they have spotted either of the escapees. The police have warned that the inmates are highly dangerous, and members of the public should not take any risks in approaching them. The search is ongoing, and authorities are doing everything in their power to locate the escapees and bring them to justice. This brazen escape highlights the importance of prison security and the need for tight protocols for preventing such incidents from occurring. Authorities have launched an investigation into the escape and are looking into how such a security breach could have occurred. The incident has led to calls from across the country for better security measures in prisons to prevent further escapes. In conclusion, the search for the escaped inmates continues, and authorities are urging members of the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police immediately. The brazen escape has sparked an outcry across the country, and calls for better prison security are growing louder with each passing day. This is a breaking story, and further updates will be provided as the search for the escapees continues.
