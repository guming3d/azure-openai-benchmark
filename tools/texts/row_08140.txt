article: Yemen's parliament approved a controversial law Saturday that ensures President Ali Abdullah Saleh complete immunity from prosecution. The law was delayed for weeks as Saleh insisted on specific changes guaranteeing his aides partial protection from legal actions. In return, Saleh will step down from power in Yemen next month after ruling the country for more than 33 years. Yemeni Information Minister Ali al-Amrani said the law was the best option for the country and that people can now look forward for change and development. "The law was a pivotal point of debate, and now we are looking forward to February 21 (when) a president would lead the country," al-Amrani said. "Many changes took place in the law to make it accepted by all factions, but in the end, the efforts were worth it," he added. During the same session, the parliament also accepted Vice President Abdurabu Hadi's nomination for presidency. The vice president's office hailed the move and called it a success after long negotiations over the past week. The immunity law was always linked with parliament accepting Hadi's nomination for president. Saleh supporters refuse to pass Hadi's nomination until the immunity law passed. The immunity law was a key element in a Gulf Cooperation Council power transfer deal. Since the president signed the power transfer deal in November, tens of thousands of young activists have marched in provinces across Yemen. They have vowed to have Saleh tried for the deaths of hundreds of unarmed protesters. The United Nations' envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, arrived in the country last week to ease the tension after fears grew that the deal would collapse. Though the deal was hailed by opposition parties in Yemen, youth protesters and international rights groups called the immunity a violation of international law. Youth protesters continued marching on Saturday, rejecting any immunity for Saleh or those who served under him over the last three decades. Protests took place in 13 provinces across Yemen, according to the Revolution Youth Organizing Committee. The largest protests took place in Sanaa, where many continued pushing for Saleh's prosecution. "He killed many, and now the opposition wants to forgive him," said Salma al-Nusari, a youth activist in Sanaa. Blood that Saleh spilt will not be forgiven, and we will continue demanding his prosecution until our demands are met." Presidential elections are expected to take place February 21.

chatgpt: Protesters took to the streets in 13 provinces across Yemen on Saturday, according to an organizing committee. The demonstrations were sparked by outrage at a proposed power-sharing agreement that would grant immunity to outgoing President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The agreement, brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), would see Saleh step down from power in exchange for immunity from prosecution for crimes committed during his 33-year rule. The proposal has been met with fierce opposition from those who believe Saleh should be held accountable for human rights abuses and corruption. One protester, who gave his name as Ahmed, told reporters: "Saleh killed many, and now the opposition wants to forgive him. We are not forgiving him, and we will not stop until justice is served." Despite the opposition, Yemen's parliament has accepted the nomination of Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi as interim president. Hadi is expected to take over from Saleh within the coming weeks, but many protesters say this is not enough. "We want a transitional government that represents all Yemenis, not just the interests of Saleh and his cronies," said protester Fatima. "We want justice for the people who have suffered under Saleh's regime." The protests come amid a wave of unrest across the Arab world, with uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt leading to the toppling of long-time dictators. The Yemeni protest movement has been active since early 2011, calling for an end to corruption and the establishment of a more democratic government. While the proposed power-sharing agreement would represent progress towards those goals, the immunity granted to Saleh has been a sticking point for many activists. They argue that it sends the message that those in power can act with impunity, and that justice for the victims of human rights abuses will never be served. For many Yemenis, the protests on Saturday were a sign that the fight for democracy and human rights is far from over. They vow to continue demonstrating until their demands are met, and until the voices of the people are heard.
