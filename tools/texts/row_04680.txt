chatgpt: Balfour Beatty, the owners of Manston Airport in Kent, have been trying to sell the airport since August. Now, with the deadline for an agreement set for October 7, concerns are rising that the airport may have to close, putting more than 100 staff members out of work.  The airport, located just outside Ramsgate, opened in 1915 and has played a pivotal role in the region's economy ever since. Manston has a long history of military use, but after the Ministry of Defence withdrew from the site in 1999, it began operating as a commercial airport. While it never achieved the success of major airports like Heathrow or Gatwick, it attracted several low-cost airlines, which helped it to stay afloat. However, in recent years, it has faced increasing financial difficulties. The latest news that the airport may have to close has been met with disappointment and concern from many in the region who use the airport for business and leisure travel. A petition to save the airport has been launched, and supporters have been lobbying local MPs to urge the government to intervene. The airport's future has been uncertain for some time, with a number of potential buyers expressing interest but failing to come forward with firm offers. There are concerns that even if a buyer is found, they may not be able to turn the airport's fortunes around.  The owner of Manston Airport, Balfour Beatty, has declined to comment on the situation. However, local officials have said that the airport is still open for business and that they are trying to find a solution that will save it from closure. The possible closure of the airport highlights the precarious situation that many small airports across the UK are facing. With the pandemic leading to a sharp decrease in air travel, many airports are struggling to stay afloat. The situation is particularly difficult for airports like Manston, which lack the government support and financial resources of larger airports. There are concerns that if Manston Airport does close, it will have a significant impact on the local economy, with job losses and a decrease in tourism. However, some are hopeful that a solution will be found, and the airport will continue to play a vital role in the region's economy.  The deadline for a decision on the airport's future is fast approaching, and many are hoping that a buyer will come forward to save it. However, with the aviation industry facing such uncertain times, the future of Manston Airport is far from certain.
