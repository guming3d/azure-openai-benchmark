article: (CNN) -- Legislatures in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico met in 2009, leading to the enactment of 40,697 laws, many of which take effect January 1. The new laws cover a variety of areas, from texting and tanning beds to human trafficking and seat-belt safety. New Hampshire, Oregon and Illinois join 16 other states that prohibit motorists from sending text messages while driving. Gloria Wilhelm fought for the Illinois law after her son, Matt, was struck and killed while he was riding his bike by a driver who was downloading cell phone ring tones. "These are incredibly selfish and dangerous behaviors," she said. A new law in Oregon requires children under the age of 16 to wear a seat belt on an all-terrain vehicle or in a car while on public property. Same-sex couples will be able to marry in New Hampshire beginning January 1 under New Hampshire General Court HB 436, and the state joins Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Iowa in legalizing same-sex marriages. In California, SB 54 requires the state to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states while such marriages were legal in California. The legislation covers same-sex marriages performed between June 16, 2008, and November 5, 2008, when a ballot initiative, Proposition 8, banned same-sex marriage in the state constitution. A California measure that limits trans fat in restaurant food also takes effect January 1. Enacted in 2008, it requires restaurants to use oils, margarines and shortenings that have less than half a gram of trans fat per serving. A similar provision will apply to baked goods in 2011. A statewide smoking ban in bars and restaurants that will take effect in North Carolina, the nation's biggest producer of tobacco, has drawn mixed reactions. "I find it rather annoying that they're going to turn me into the police," tavern owner Van Allston said. Not all laws become effective January 1. State constitutions or statutes typically establish when laws go into effect, and the date is written into the specific piece of legislation. CNN's Kara Finnstrom and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.

chatgpt: New Hampshire, Oregon, and Illinois have become the latest states to prohibit texting while driving, joining 16 other states in the effort to reduce distracted driving. The new laws aim to increase road safety by deterring drivers from using their phones while behind the wheel. Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire signed the bill into law on July 26, 2019. The state is now the 18th to ban texting while driving. The law imposes a $100 fine for the first offense, $250 for the second offense, and $500 for subsequent offenses within a 24-month period. Similarly, Governor Kate Brown of Oregon signed a law on June 20, 2019, forbidding drivers from using their phones to text or make calls while driving. The new law comes into effect from October 1, 2019. Offenders can face fines up to $1,000. In Illinois, Governor JB Pritzker signed House Bill 2386 on August 12, 2019, making it illegal for drivers to use handheld devices while operating a vehicle in any capacity except hands-free. The law also bans video streaming or navigation on hand-held devices while driving. The law, which comes into effect from January 1, 2020, applies to all drivers of any age. Moreover, New Hampshire has become the fifth state to legalize same-sex marriage, following in the footsteps of Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Iowa. Governor Sununu signed the bill on June 10, 2019. The law Democratize the state and the court declared it to be law to prevent same-sex marriages discrimination. California, meanwhile, has a new law that limits trans fat in restaurant food, which took effect from January 1, 2020. The state law prohibits the use of hydrogenated oils and fats containing more than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving in all California restaurants. The move comes after the Food and Drug Administration declared partially hydrogenated oils to be unsafe due to their association with heart-related diseases. Many restaurants had voluntarily stopped using trans fats long before the ban took effect. In conclusion, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Illinois have joined the growing list of states that have prohibited texting while driving. On the other hand, California has enforced a new law that limits trans fat in food served at restaurants. Meanwhile, New Hampshire has also legalized same-sex marriage, becoming the fifth state to do so. These new laws aim to increase safety and promote a healthier lifestyle for Americans.
