article: Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- Clashes erupted Monday on the volatile border between Sudan and South Sudan in the run-up to a planned meeting between the nations' presidents as part of a troubled peace process. South Sudan army spokesman Philip Aguer accused Khartoum of launching aerial bombing raids on troops in Jaw, a border area where their armies have clashed previously. He said Sudanese ground forces attacked a southern base near the Heglig oil field. "They repelled the attack, they pursued them to Heglig. The SPLA is controlling part of Heglig," he said, referring to South Sudan's army. Sudan denied that its air force bombed Jaw, and said the border clashes near Heglig were "minor". Part of Heglig is disputed, along with much of the 1,200-mile border. Sudan President Omar al-Bashir is scheduled to travel to the southern capital on April 3 to meet with his counterpart, South Sudan President Salva Kiir, and sign a deal on border demarcation. Under that agreement, the countries would establish a joint committee and technical team to mark the border. Another agreement would guarantee the rights of citizens from each country living on either side of the border. The accords are considered landmark achievements, reached after eight months of negotiations that began after South Sudan broke away from Sudan and declared independence July 9. The split, which came after two decades of civil war, left a raft of unresolved issues, including how much the landlocked south should pay to transport its oil through a pipeline running across Sudan. South Sudan shut down oil production in late January after accusing its northern neighbor of stealing $815 million of its oil. Sudan said it confiscated the crude to make up for unpaid fees to use the pipeline and processing facilities in its territory. Pagan Amum, the south's chief negotiator, said the border and citizenship agreements could open the way to a deal to resume oil production. Both countries are suffering economically since the shutdown began. Upon independence, South Sudan took three-quarters of the formerly united country's oil reserves, and oil accounted for 98% of the new state's revenues. Monday's border clashes cast doubt on whether either country would honor any agreements. During talks mediated by the African Union, the countries also signed a nonaggression pact on February 10 aimed at bringing peace to the border region. Aside from clashes between government forces, both countries accuse each other of supporting militia or rebel forces in their territories. On Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland urged South Sudan to cease military support for rebels fighting the Khartoum government in Blue Nile state and Southern Kordofan state, where Monday's clashes occurred. Southern officials have repeatedly denied providing support to the rebels. Nuland also demanded that Khartoum "end aerial bombardments of civilian areas." The war has already sent more than 100,000 refugees across the border into South Sudan, and the United States and United Nations have warned that hundreds more could follow, fleeing hunger and violence.

chatgpt: Juba, South Sudan - The presidents of South Sudan and Sudan are scheduled to meet on April 3, in what is expected to be a key summit regarding the two countries’ shared border. The meeting, which will take place in Juba, South Sudan’s capital, is aimed at ensuring a clear demarcation of the border between the two nations. The issue of border demarcation between South Sudan and Sudan has long been a source of tension between the two countries. Both nations have been accusing each other of providing support to insurgents and rebels based in their respective territories. At the heart of this conflict is the need to establish a proper boundary line that both countries can agree upon. According to sources close to the negotiations, the discussions will focus on defining the boundary line between the two countries, particularly in disputed areas where friction has been particularly high. The leaders of the two countries will also work on a path towards ensuring the end of hostilities along the borders of both nations. The Sudanese delegation will be led by President Omar al-Bashir, while South Sudan's President Salva Kiir will lead the host nation. Both leaders have expressed their desire to work towards a peaceful solution to the problems facing their respective countries. President Kiir has called for calm and has urged his government to ensure that the talks progress smoothly. The issue of border demarcation is particularly acute given the nature of the border areas between South Sudan and Sudan. These are heavily populated areas that have seen frequent fighting between military forces from either side. To resolve this issue, the meeting is set to establish a framework for the mutual cooperation of the two nations to safeguard peace along their border. The main challenge facing the two leaders in their negotiations is the issue of supporting insurgents and rebels from the other side. Both governments have been accused of supporting rebels from their neighbouring countries, an accusation that both deny. Experts believe that resolving issues around the border will help to minimize the frequency of cross-border conflicts. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, following years of civil war. However, since then, the two nations have been plagued by numerous issues that have affected their relations. In addition to fighting over their border, both nations have suffered internal conflicts as well, with civil wars and insurgencies causing economic and humanitarian issues. The upcoming meeting between President Bashir and President Kiir is widely seen as a critical step towards resolving the issues between their countries. Analysts predict that, should the talks yield a positive result, it could set the stage for enhanced cooperation between two nations, with the potential for future economic and social developments. In conclusion, the meeting between President Kiir and President Bashir is crucial in establishing a strong framework of mutual cooperation between South Sudan and Sudan. It is imperative that a clear demarcation of their border is established, and this could lead to a peaceful resolution to the disputes between both countries. Observers hope that the upcoming talks will lay the foundation for long-lasting peace and an end to the conflicts between the two countries.
