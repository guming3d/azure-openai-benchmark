She said: 'We would obviously make sure if there was an issue around the children and they were becoming frightened, we do advise teachers take children back into the school and make sure they are safe. 'The incident was a couple of weeks ago, since then we have not actually seen the squirrel. 'As is the case with cats, dogs, rabbits when they do come into contact with a human, they do have sharp claws.' Squirrels can become aggressive if they feel they are being threatened or if they feel someone is trying to steal a food source. They often warn a threat by chattering their teeth as a warning towards whoever, or whatever, is in the vicinity. Mrs Bal-Richards added: 'Safeguarding children is paramount. It is uncommon for a squirrel to actually demonstrate aggressive behaviour but we are aware of the situation.'
