Murder: The teen's single mother Melanie Davis, 46, was grisly killed with a sledgehammer while she was sleeping in her bed . The ruling comes after a mental health evaluation that found the teen not disabled. Davis' mother Melanie Davis, 46, was asleep in her bed on the night of August 10 when prosecutors say her son attacked, carefully locking the bedroom door behind. He then went upstairs into his Hendersonville home's game room and set a fire they say, hoping it would consume his older brother who was asleep. His brother, who's currently staying with family friends, made it out uninjured. Police reported that Zachary Davis was found a short distance later from the, holding a notebook that contained a written confession to the crime that included, according to an affidavit, 'leaving his brother to burn in the fire that he started.' In court on Tuesday his defence argued the teen being as much victim as those affected that night, having lost his father to Lou Gehrig's disease in 2007 and struggling since.

chatgpt: A heinous crime has rocked a small town in Tennessee, leaving residents in shock and disbelief. Zachary Davis, a 17-year-old, has been charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder of his older brother. The shocking incident occurred after he allegedly set fire to their family home. The incident occurred on a quiet night when the family was fast asleep, and no one could have possibly predicted the series of events that were about to unfold. Zachary Davis reportedly poured gasoline throughout the house and set it on fire while his parents and older brother were asleep in their respective bedrooms. The family was awakened by the sound of breaking glass and smoke filling the house. They immediately rushed to safety, but unfortunately, Zachary's older brother, who was critically injured in the fire, could not make it out alive. Zachary was found outside the house when the firefighters arrived. He was immediately taken into custody and charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder of his older brother. Although his parents and the rest of the family survived the incident with minor injuries, the trauma they suffered will stay with them for a lifetime. The case was taken up by a juvenile court, where the judge found Zachary's crimes too severe to be helped by the court. This means that he will be tried as an adult in criminal court, and if found guilty, might face life imprisonment. His parents have expressed their shock and disbelief over their son's actions and are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their older son. They have requested privacy and time to grieve as they try to piece their lives back together. The incident has shaken the town and has left many questioning how someone so young could commit such a heinous crime. Mental health experts have expressed concern over the increasing prevalence of such incidents and the need for greater focus on mental health among teenagers. Parents have been urged to watch out for any signs of mental illness in their children and seek help if necessary. The incident has also highlighted the need for greater parental supervision and awareness of their children's activities. It is crucial for parents to be vigilant and aware of their children's behavior and to seek help if they notice any alarming signs of aggression or violence. The tragic incident has left a scar on the town, and the family affected will have to deal with the aftermath for a long time to come. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time, and we hope that justice will be served in the criminal proceedings to follow.
