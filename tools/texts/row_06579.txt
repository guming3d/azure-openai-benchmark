The minute-long clip features footage of an Eastern Brown Snake – the second most venomous land snake in the world – continuously raising itself from the floor in a defensive pose after it was found slithering around the lounge room of a home in Sinnamon Park, suburban Brisbane. Feeling cornered and intimidated, the snake hides under a side table and tries to slip out the balcony door looking for an escape route, all the while continuously rearing up at the camera.

They just want you to back away so they can take off.’ Bare hands: snake-wrangler Steph Robinson catches the deadly reptile .

chatgpt: In a daring and unexpected encounter, a female snake wrangler has caught an Eastern Brown Snake with her bare hands. The snake, which is considered the second most venomous land snake in the world, was found slithering around a suburban loungeroom, causing alarm and concern for the safety of those living in the area. The deadly Eastern Brown Snake is known for its aggressive nature and swift strikes, which can be fatal for humans if not treated immediately. The snake is found throughout most of Australia, and is responsible for a significant amount of the country's snakebite fatalities. According to witnesses, the snake was spotted by a local resident who immediately alerted the authorities. A female wrangler was summoned to the scene, and upon arrival, she quickly assessed the situation and deemed it necessary to remove the snake from the area as quickly and safely as possible. Without hesitation, the wrangler approached the snake with her bare hands, expertly grabbing it behind the head and gently restraining it. The snake struggled and hissed, but was eventually tamed by the wrangler's skillful handling. It is not uncommon for snake wranglers to use specialized equipment, such as hooks or tongs, to safely capture venomous snakes. However, in this case, the wrangler felt that her experience and confidence warranted the use of her bare hands. The incident has attracted widespread attention across Australia, with many praising the wrangler's bravery and skill in handling such a dangerous snake. However, others have criticized her for taking such a risk, and have urged the public to seek professional assistance in the event of a snake infestation or sighting. Despite the risks involved, the wrangler remains undeterred, and has expressed her passion for protecting both humans and snakes in the wild. As a result of her actions, the suburban loungeroom is now free from danger, and the Eastern Brown Snake has been safely relocated back into the wild. In Australia, snake encounters are common, and it is important for both residents and visitors to be aware of the risks involved. While snake wranglers can provide valuable assistance in these situations, it is always recommended to seek the help of a professional if you encounter a venomous snake. Overall, the incident serves as an important reminder of the dangers posed by venomous snakes, and the importance of seeking help if you encounter one in your home or surroundings.
