chatgpt: On Friday afternoon, patrons of Family and Cloudland nightclubs in Queensland received a controversial text message from the Katarzyna Group. The message was an anti-Labor statement with a warning to "be careful with your vote" in the upcoming state elections on Saturday. The text message was in response to Labor's proposed plan to "shut pubs and clubs early." This statement did not sit well with the Katarzyna Group, who believed that this proposed plan would have a significant impact on their business. Many outraged club-goers flooded the venues' Facebook page with complaints. They did not appreciate being targeted in such a manner and felt it was a violation of their right to choose their own political preferences. Saturday's state election is expected to see around 2.5 million Queenslanders lodge their vote. Opinion polls have suggested that the LNP will hold onto power, but this unexpected text message has brought a new level of controversy and tension to an already heated election process. The Katarzyna Group's message has been called "inappropriate" and has raised concerns over the role of businesses in politics. The message was sent out to patrons of a popular nightclub, which raises questions about whether businesses should be allowed to use their platforms to spread their political agendas. The Katarzyna Group has since apologized for the message, stating that it was not their intention to influence people's political opinions. However, many still believe that the message was a clear attempt to sway people's votes. The controversy raises important questions about the role of businesses in politics and whether they should be allowed to use their platforms to promote their political views. Most people have the right to freedom of expression, but the question is whether businesses should have the same right. It is unclear how much impact the Katarzyna Group's message will have on the state election results, but it has certainly raised some eyebrows and caused a great deal of controversy. With the election only a day away, it remains to be seen whether this message will sway people's opinions or not. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that this message has brought up important issues that need to be addressed. With more and more businesses choosing to take part in political debates and discussions, it is important to consider the potential impact that this could have on the democratic process.
