article: 10-time World Series of Poker title holder Phil Ivey denies what he did to win almost $22million at baccarat in Atlantic City and London. In an interview that will be broadcast on CBS 60 Minutes Sports Tuesday, Ivey denies he was cheating when the casino granted him special accommodations they chalked up to superstition. 'I'm viewing the casino as my opponent,' he said. 'It's my job to try to exploit weaknesses in the house and try to give myself the best opportunity to win.' Winner: Phil Ivey, who has won 10 World Series of Poker titles, is being sued by two casinos . The Borgata in Atlantic City and Crockfords in London both claim what Ivey did to win millions of dollars from them in 2012 is cheating. According to Ivey, both casinos agreed to certain conditions before Ivey sat down with a few million dollars to play. The player asked for a specific brand of playing cards, a shuffling machine, an Asian dealer and stipulated that the same card decks be used. The conditions helped Ivey use 'edge sorting' to exploit printing errors on the backs of playing cards that offset designs too far to one or the other side. Ivey's partner, Cheung Yin Sun, was with him at the baccarat table and instructed the dealer in Mandarin to rotate 'good cards' and 'bad cards' in specific ways before discarding them after a hand. The sorting machine maintained the positioning of these cards, Ivey explains, allowing him to know whether a 'good' or 'bad' card was coming based on small design imperfections. Withheld: Ivey leaves the Royal Courts of Justice, where he is fighting a lawsuit against the Crockfords casino .

Competitor: Ivey (right) stares down poker player David Moon during a hand at the 2009 World Series of Poker . In court filings, casino officials say they believed Ivey's requests were just superstition and not aimed at changing the odds of the game in his favor. The Borgata is suing Ivey to recover the $9.6million the player won, while Ivey is suing Crockfords for nearly $12 million after the London casino refused to pay. Officials with The Borgata and Crockfords didn't participate in the television interview because the companies don't comment on pending litigation. 'Some people believe that it was cheating,' Ivey said. 'I know it wasn't. The professional gamblers know it's not. I wouldn't do anything close to cheating. I mean, my reputation is everything in gambling.' Sun and two companions are also suing Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut for withholding money won using a similar 'edge sorting' tactic. Bluff Magazine records Ivey's lifetime poker tournament winnings to be just shy of $20million. In July, Ivey won his tenth World Series of Poker bracelet.

chatgpt: Renowned poker player Phil Ivey, 38, is facing allegations of cheating two major casinos at baccarat; the Borgata in Atlantic City and Crockfords in London. The casinos claim that Ivey set himself up for a statistical edge by requesting several game conditions, which they initially thought were just superstitions. Reportedly, Ivey won an astonishing $9.6 million from the Borgata Casino alone, which the establishment is now trying to recover. Similarly, Ivey emerged victorious from Crockfords as well, winning $12 million. However, the casino refused to pay up, alleging cheating. This has now led to a legal battle between the casino and the poker star. The allegations suggest that Ivey and his partner, Cheung Yin Sun, requested game conditions that changed the odds in their favor, thereby cheating the casinos. The technique they allegedly used is called edge sorting, which involves spotting asymmetries in the design of the cards that enable them to know which ones are more likely to appear. Although Ivey denies any wrongdoing and considers the accusations to be groundless, the casinos are adamant about retrieving the money. The Borgata Casino is pursuing the $10.1 million that Ivey won through a French asset he owns, while Crockfords has already denied payment and filed a lawsuit against Ivey.  This lawsuit is scheduled to proceed at the Supreme Court in London in the upcoming months, and Ivey could potentially lose millions of dollars from his winnings. Since the incident occurred in 2012, there have been multiple appeals and legal battles in both the US and the UK that have put a considerable strain on Ivey's finances. However, Ivey is no stranger to winning large sums of money. In fact, he has accumulated almost $20 million over his career from participating in major poker tournaments and securing ten World Series of Poker titles.  His success in the poker world, combined with these recent allegations, has somewhat polarized the industry. Some argue that his wealth and fame have allowed him greater access to privileges that ordinary players would never be granted, while others continue to defend his reputation as a legitimate player without any need for cheats or tricks. Overall, this controversy has raised questions and concerns about the fairness of baccarat and the broader gambling industry. In the meantime, Ivey's legal struggles continue, and the outcome of his case will undoubtedly influence the future of edge sorting and the rules surrounding it.
