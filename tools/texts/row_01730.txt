However, in 2010, tragedy struck when eight people were injured after a chairlift cable snapped, causing several skiers to fall 35ft to the snow-covered ground below. Among the victims were Michael Katz and his two daughters, who all suffered head injuries in the incident. The terrifying incident occurred on the morning of December 28, 2010. Skiers were enjoying the slopes when the cable holding the King Pine chairlift, which can carry up to four passengers at a time, suddenly snapped. Eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud bang before seeing chairs and people plummeting towards the ground. Michael Katz, a 42-year-old attorney from Rhode Island, was riding the lift with his daughters, then aged seven and nine. Katz and his daughters fell from a height of 35ft and landed in the snow below. The three of them suffered significant head injuries as a result of the fall and were rushed to hospital for medical treatment. Emergency personnel were quick to respond to the scene, with eight people injured in total, including Katz and his daughters.
