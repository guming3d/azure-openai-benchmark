article: (CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet have been evacuated as the bay turned black from an oil spill over the weekend. Authorities estimated that around 5,000 liters of crude oil have washed up on the island, having leaked into the ocean from an offshore pipeline belonging to PTT Global Chemical, Thailand's largest petrochemical producer. The total leakage is estimated at 50,000 liters. Due to its beautiful beaches and proximity to Bangkok -- the travel time from the capital is a little less than four hours by bus and then boat -- the island has long been a popular Thai weekend destination. Tourist activities on the island are largely ocean-oriented and include jet-skiing, snorkeling and banana-boating. Gallery: Oil spill on Koh Samet . Effect on tourism . It's still unclear to what extent the spill will affect local tourism, but the damage was initially reportedly limited to one beach, at Ao Phrao. There are 14 beaches on the island. "We've had some hotel cancellations on Samet," Rayong province tourism authority director Chuchart Oncharoen told the Bangkok Post. "Whether this has a long-term impact on the island depends on how quickly PTT cleans up the mess." The affected beach is on the less populated Western part of the island, where resorts have closed and tourists have been evacuated to hotels in other areas. The island is currently in its tourism low season -- the high season is from October to April. "By far the majority of tourists who go to Koh Samet stay at resorts and hotels on the eastern side of the island," Thailand travel blogger Richard Barrow told CNN. Gallery: Oil spill on Koh Samet . Spill 'worse than thought' However, an opposition MP has suggested the damage from the spill may be worse than first thought, reports Australia's ABC. "If that (50,000 litres) was the real amount, they should have already eliminated it -- they should have solved the problem fast enough before it reached Samet island," said Sathit Pitutacha, from Thailand's Democrat Party. The environmental group Greenpeace also called the spill "massive," according to the ABC, and called upon the Thai government to end oil exploration in the Gulf of Thailand. Some travelers to Phrao Bay have already posted about the unexpected change in their itineraries. "The oil completely covered the beach when we woke up in the morning," wrote Tripadvisor reviewer MatJens about his curtailed stay at Lima Coco resort, one of the popular hotels in the area that has been closed. "We rebooked to a hotel on Ko Chang and the personnel at Lima Coco were very helpful getting us there. We also got a voucher covering the days we paid in advance," wrote MatJens on Monday. A statement from PTT Global Chemical said the company had deployed booms to contain the oil as well as oil spill dispersant. It added that the Thai navy and approximately 300 workers from PTT Global Chemical are continuing to clean up the area.

chatgpt: One of Thailand's most prized weekend getaway destinations has found itself in a sticky situation. The picturesque shoreline of Koh Samet island, located off the eastern coast of Thailand, has been turned black due to an oil spill that occurred on Saturday.  Approximately 5,000 liters of oil have washed ashore since the spill, and though cleanup efforts are underway, concerns are growing over the potential impact on the island's ecosystem. Koh Samet is known for its vibrant coral reefs, tropical fish, and crystal-clear waters. The oil spill raises concerns about the possible damage to marine life and the wider ecosystem. The spill occurred on Saturday in the Gulf of Thailand, impacting the pristine sands and waters of Koh Samet's Ao Phrao Beach. The spill was first noticed by local residents and visitors in the early morning hours as black sludge began to infiltrate the shoreline.  Authorities have yet to determine the cause of the oil spill but are urging visitors to steer clear of the affected areas. Tourists and locals alike have been advised to avoid swimming or engaging in water-based activities until the situation is resolved. Environmental groups, including Greenpeace, have voiced their concerns about the potential long-term impact of the spill. "This spill may be worse than first thought," said an opposition MP, citing the potential damage to local marine life and the wider ecosystem of the Gulf of Thailand. Efforts are now underway to contain the spill and prevent further damage to the islands. Cleanup crews have been dispatched to the affected areas, and more are expected to arrive in the coming days. They are using a variety of techniques to clean up the sludge, including the use of specialized equipment, such as skimmers and absorbent pads, to soak up the oil. Despite this, concerns remain that the spill may have already caused irreparable damage. Tourism officials are concerned about the impact on local businesses, as Koh Samet is one of the most popular weekend getaway destinations in Thailand. Local businesses, including hotel owners and dive companies, are already feeling the pinch as vacationers cancel their bookings and steer clear of the affected areas. The long-term impact on the economy of Koh Samet and the surrounding region remains unclear. Authorities are urging visitors to remain vigilant, and to report any further signs of oil washing up on the island's shores. The future of Koh Samet remains uncertain, but officials are hopeful that prompt action and cooperation between authorities, local businesses, and community members can help to minimize the damage caused by this devastating oil spill.  It is a somber reminder that the convenience that oil brings to the economy should always be balanced with the responsible consideration of its impact on the environment.
