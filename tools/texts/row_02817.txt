The number of pet animals poisoned and high on marijuana is growing higher, veterinarians say. California Bay Area-based veterinarians told KTVU on Tuesday more pets are being rushed to animal emergency rooms severely ill and high on the drug. The rise in emergency cases coincides with the rise of medical marijuana, they said. Rick Benjamin from the Berkeley Dog and Cat Hospital told KTVU that marijuana toxicity is more common in dogs than cats. The rise in California medical marijuana has been linked to an increase in ER visits for pet animals, who may accidentally be poisoned eating baked goods containing THC, like in these file photos . Pet animals, like the cat seen in this file photo, need to have their stomachs pumped if they are poisoned with THC. In rare cases the drug can be fatal . 'They're making cookies and crackers and cakes that are fairly potent in marijuana, and the dogs in particular love that,' he said. He said that the main problem is that the small animals have to metabolize large quantities of the psychoactive chemical in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. 'We're seeing more I think for a number of reasons, probably one is the potency of the THC in the marijuana has increased, so that the animal consuming the pot gets more of the active drug,' Benjamin said. Benjamin told KTVU that animals need to have their stomachs pumped to filter the marijuana out of their bodies. Most animals recover -- but in rare cases it can be fatal. Symptoms of poisoning in pets can occur within 30 - 60 minutes of exposures, Michigan Live reports. They include stumbling, dilated pupils, vomiting, and glassy eyes. Other serious side effects, Michigan Live reports, include changes in heart rate, coma, tremor and seizures. The rise in pot poisoning cases in pet animals in not happening just in California. The Huffington Post reports that a 5-year study in Colorado found that pot poisoning in dogs quadrupled after the state legalized marijuana in 2000. Some have claimed that medical marijuan could be beneficial for pet animals. The Daily Mail reported in 2011 that Medical Marijuana Systems LLC had licensed a patent for Tetracan, a 'pot patch' meant to serve as pain relief for animals. Symptoms of marijuana poisoning in pets includes stumbling, dilated pupils, vomiting, and glassy eyes. Dogs, like the one in this file photo, are at a higher risk .

chatgpt: A recent study has shown a staggering increase in emergency room visits across California that have been linked to medical marijuana use in humans. While the drug has been hailed for its medical benefits, it appears that pets are paying a high price for its increased availability. Pets are getting sick from accidentally eating baked goods containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. As it turns out, animals have trouble metabolizing the drug and must have their stomachs pumped if they ingest it. In rare cases, pot poisoning has been fatal. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, there has been a significant uptick in the number of pets ingesting marijuana since California legalized the drug for medical use. The situation has reached such crisis levels that the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine has established a hotline to help pet owners deal with marijuana-related pet emergencies. Dr. Jenifer Chatfield, a veterinarian at the school's teaching hospital, has stated that the consequences of marijuana ingestion in pets range from mild disorientation to seizures and even coma. She advises pet owners to take precautions to ensure their pets don't accidentally consume marijuana products. The problem, say experts, is that many pet owners are not aware of the dangers of marijuana for their pets. They may leave their stash of marijuana-laced edibles out in the open, not realizing that their pets might mistake them for treats. In some cases, pets have even ingested the drug by eating the feces of humans who have consumed marijuana. Toxicologists say that pets that have ingested marijuana should be taken to a veterinarian immediately. The vet will induce vomiting, give the pet activated charcoal to absorb any remaining marijuana in the stomach, and monitor the animal closely. In conclusion, the legalization of medical marijuana has led to unintended consequences for pets. While the drug can be beneficial for humans, it can be deadly for pets if ingested accidentally. Pet owners must take responsibility for keeping marijuana products away from pets to prevent them from getting sick or even dying from pot poisoning. Veterinarians advise pet owners to take immediate action if their pets exhibit any signs of marijuana intoxication, as time is of the essence when it comes to preventing serious harm.
