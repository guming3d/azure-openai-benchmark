chatgpt: The River Dart Country Park in Devon has been forced to ask nearly 600 people to leave the park amid concerns over a suspected outbreak of Norovirus. Since last Friday, the park has reported a significant rise in Norovirus cases, with 91 people reportedly showing symptoms. According to the park authorities, the decision to ask the visitors to leave was made as an immediate precautionary measure, to prevent the further spread of the virus. The park management cleared the campsite of all visitors and closed parts of the park to deep clean and disinfect the areas. A team from Public Health England was called in to investigate the outbreak, and park officials are said to be cooperating fully with the agency to identify the source of the outbreak. The investigation is still ongoing, and the park authorities have asked anyone who visited the park in recent days to contact them if they experience any symptoms of the virus. The Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted easily from person to person through contaminated food, water, and surfaces. Symptoms of the virus usually occur within 12 to 48 hours of infection and include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps. While the virus is typically self-limiting and does not cause any significant long-term effects, it can be particularly dangerous for vulnerable groups, including young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. Understandably, the affected visitors have expressed their concerns about the situation, with many disappointed by the abrupt end to their holiday plans. The park authorities have apologized for the inconvenience caused but stressed that their priority is the health of their visitors and staff. An official statement from the park management read: "We are sorry to have had to ask our visitors to leave the park, but we had to take immediate action to prevent the further spread of the Norovirus virus. We are working closely with Public Health England to investigate the outbreak and identify the source of the virus, and we are taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our visitors and staff." The park is expected to reopen on a phased basis, and visitors are advised to keep an eye on the park's website for the latest information. While the incident is undoubtedly concerning, the authorities have acted quickly and responsibly, taking all necessary actions to contain the outbreak and prevent further infections.
