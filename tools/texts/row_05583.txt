article: Santa Barbara, California (CNN) -- I first heard of Dream Foundation in 1997 when the charity requested a visit to Graceland for a dream recipient. After the visit, I received a thank-you note and photo of the dreamer in front of the Graceland gates. I was moved by her experience and decided I wanted to get more involved, so I picked up the phone to find out more about the foundation. I was absolutely mesmerized and instantly attached to their unique mission of granting wishes to adults with terminal illnesses. When I was asked to be an ambassador and spokeswoman for the charity, I couldn't say yes fast enough. How could I turn down such a great cause? I've been honored to travel and represent the organization across the country at special events and corporate meetings, as well as in public service announcements, television and print interviews. But the best part of my "job" is seeing the hands-on attention and care we give to the people we serve. There's a common misperception that all the dreams we fulfill are for grand vacations. But many requests are profoundly basic: Pay a utility bill, or provide mobility with a scooter. No matter the scale of the dream -- whether it's a peaceful escape to the beach, a long-delayed family reunion or an appliance that works -- every one is touching and heartwarming because it unites people. Dreams provide comfort and closure, not only to the recipients, but to their family members as well. Ill parents often want nothing more than to see their kids smiling and having fun again. In turn, these dreams also give children an opportunity to see their parents happy, carefree and outside of the hospital's sterile environment. One dreamer really stands out in my mind: Helena, a young girl of 23 with cancer. She had a beautiful voice and wanted to be a singer. The Dream Foundation contacted Grammy award-winning songwriter Diane Warren and got permission for Helena to record a song in Diane's studio. When Helena played the recording back, it was heartwarming to see her smile and be so full of joy. The song not only made Helena happy, but her family happy as well, knowing her dream had been fulfilled. How can you beat that? After Helena passed, her husband was left with that precious recording to help remember her by. To this day, he still calls and thanks the Dream Foundation for granting his wife's wish. I've been blessed to work with Dream Foundation. The organization has impacted me in so many ways. I think when you see and experience someone's dream with them, it lives on within you. It's life-changing. We all have problems, but we have to stop thinking of ourselves and focus on the bigger picture. There are people suffering all over the world, and we can make life a little bit better -- even if only for a moment -- one dream at a time.

chatgpt: The Dream Foundation has been granting wishes to terminally ill people who are 18 years and older for more than two decades. This charity's mission is to bring joy and happiness to individuals who have been diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses and may not have much time left. The Dream Foundation was founded in 1994 by Thomas Rollerson and his late wife, Kathleen. Kathleen was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer and had a dream of meeting country music star Garth Brooks. With the help of friends and family, Thomas was able to make her dream come true. Kathleen passed away shortly after her dream was fulfilled, but her legacy lives on in the work of the Dream Foundation. The Dream Foundation has granted over 30,000 dreams to date. Most of the dreams are simple and involve spending quality time with family, have a special dinner or create special memories with loved ones. Others may involve meeting a celebrity or traveling to a dream destination. Regardless of the unique nature of each dream, the Dream Foundation helps individuals and their families to have hope, something to look forward to and moments of joy in what can be an incredibly difficult and challenging time. The Dream Foundation is a non-profit organization that relies heavily on donations from individuals and corporations. In-kind donations and other resources, such as airline miles, are always welcome also. The Dream Foundation has a limited budget, and therefore, donations support everything they do â€“ from fulfilling dreams to providing support services for the terminally ill and their loved ones. There are many ways to support the Dream Foundation. Any individual, corporation, or organization can make a cash donation on their website, become a monthly donor or fundraiser, donate airline miles or even give through a planned gift or estate. The Dream Foundation partners with many different corporations, so you can help support them by shopping online through their website or shopping at participating stores that offer donations to the Foundation. Whether you're donating your time or resources, every gift counts and makes a difference. The Dream Foundation is reliant on the support and generosity of people who care about making a difference in the lives of terminally ill individuals. Currently, the Dream Foundation is working on getting the word out about its mission and increasing donations by spreading awareness through a variety of channels. By supporting the charity with donations, individuals and corporations are helping to ensure that terminally ill individuals and their families have something positive to look forward to and an opportunity to have some joy and peace within their life. The Dream Foundation is a great organization whose mission is to make dreams come true for terminally ill individuals regardless of where they live. If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with a life-threatening disease or illness, consider reaching out to the Dream Foundation to help make a dream come true, offering people a chance to appreciate life and realize the importance of spending time with loved ones while creating positive memories.
