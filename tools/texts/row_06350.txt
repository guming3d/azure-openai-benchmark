article: By . Sophie Borland . The elderly are still being denied life-saving operations by the NHS despite new laws to prevent age discrimination, leading surgeons warn. In some areas, no-one over 75 is being offered crucial surgery for breast cancer and very few undergo bowel cancer surgery or have knee and hip replacements. This is despite legislation which came into force in October 2012 making it illegal for NHS staff to deny surgery to patients on the basis of age alone. Discriminated: The elderly are still being denied life-saving operations. In some areas, no-one over 75 is being offered crucial surgery for breast cancer and very few undergo bowel cancer surgery . The Royal College of Surgeons says there is no evidence the situation has improved since then and is urging patients to be firm with their doctors if they feel discriminated against. In a report today, produced with the charity Age UK, the college warns of a striking postcode lottery between local NHS bodies in the rates of over-65s being offered surgery for breast and bowel cancer, knee and hip replacements and hernia repair. The college examined figures for the rates of surgery in the over-65s and over-75s for all of England’s 211 new clinical commissioning groups. Women treated in the best performing areas are 37 times more likely to have surgery for breast cancer than those in the worst performing areas. Seventeen bodies did not offer any breast cancer operations to women over 75 last year while three others commissioned more than 100. Bowel cancer patients over 65 in the best performing areas are nine times more likely to have surgery than those in the worst performing areas. Similarly, hernia patients in the best performing areas are 12 times more likely to be given an operation and those needing knee and hip replacements are 17 times more likely to have surgery. The college is concerned that such stark differences between areas mean that some doctors and managers are wrongly writing off patients because of their age. Professor Norman Williams, its president, said: ‘If age is being used as a discriminator it’s absolutely wrong. You have to base the decisions on the health of the individual in front of you. ‘Surgery is incredibly effective these days and much easier for patients to get over than in the past.’ He urged patients who felt they were being unfairly denied surgery to have ‘frank’ discussions with their GP or specialist.

chatgpt: Despite laws stating that it is illegal to deny surgery based on age, some areas of the UK are not offering crucial breast cancer surgery to anyone over the age of 75. This worrying revelation comes as the Royal College of Surgeons (RCoS) has warned of a postcode lottery between NHS bodies in the treatment of over-65s. The law came into force in 2012 to prevent age discrimination in healthcare, ensuring that individuals are not denied treatments based on their age. However, the RCoS says that there is still no evidence that the situation has improved, with some areas not following this legislation by neglecting to offer life-saving surgery to older individuals. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women in the UK, with around 55,000 new cases diagnosed each year. It is more prevalent in older women, with around two-thirds of cases occurring in those over the age of 65. Therefore, denying surgery to women aged over 75 is a significant concern, as it could potentially result in unnecessary deaths. The RCoS has called for urgent action to address this issue, stating that all eligible women should be offered the surgery they require, regardless of their age. It is important to note that breast surgery is not the only treatment that is affected by age discrimination. Some individuals may be denied treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or even organ transplants, based purely on their age. The issue of age discrimination in healthcare is not new, with many experts claiming that it is a result of the ageing population in the UK. A lack of funding and resources, combined with a growing demand for healthcare, means that difficult decisions have to be made about who receives treatment. However, denying people vital surgery based on their age is not acceptable and goes against the core principles of the NHS. Postcode lotteries in healthcare are a persistent issue in the UK, meaning that individuals who live in one area may receive a different standard of care than those who live in another. This is especially problematic when it comes to treatments that are essential for people’s health and wellbeing. The RCoS has called on the government to take action to stamp out postcode lotteries in healthcare and ensure that everyone receives the same standard of care, regardless of where they live. In conclusion, the issue of age discrimination in healthcare is a serious concern, with some areas of the UK neglecting to offer crucial breast cancer surgery to anyone over 75. The RCoS has warned of postcode lotteries in treatment of over-65s and called for urgent action to address the issue. It is important that the government takes the necessary steps to ensure that everyone receives the same standard of care, regardless of their age or where they live. The UK’s healthcare system depends on it.
