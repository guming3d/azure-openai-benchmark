article: (CNN) -- Former Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto emerged victorious in the nation's presidential election Sunday, according to preliminary results. According to Finland's Ministry of Justice, with 100% of votes counted, Niinisto defeated the nation's first openly gay presidential candidate, Pekka Haavisto, with 62.6% of the vote compared to Haavisto's 37.4%. Both were vying to succeed Tarja Halonen, Finland's first female president, who cannot run for re-election. In the first round of voting on January 28, the conservative Niinisto took just under 37% of the vote. Haavisto, a pro-European Green League candidate, got 18.8%, claiming the No. 2 spot and narrowly edging out euro-skeptic Paavo Vayrynen, who had 17.5%. The winner of Sunday's vote between Niinisto and Haavisto will break a 30-year lock on the presidency by Halonen's Social Democrats. Halonen, who is completing her second term as president, defeated Niinisto, of the conservative National Coalition Party, in 2006. Both candidates are pro-Europe at a time when the European Union is facing a debt crisis that could threaten the bloc's common currency, the euro. The most vocally anti-Europe candidate, Timo Soini of the True Finns party, came in fourth last week, though his party is the third largest in parliament. Finland joined the euro when it was created, when Niinisto was finance minister. He insists Finland should stay in the eurozone despite the debt crisis that has taken some of the shine off the common currency. His party won the top share of votes in last April's parliamentary election, and leads a broad coalition government that includes the Social Democrats. Finland is one of the few remaining AAA-rated countries in the eurozone. But 2012 is expected to deliver a growth of only 0.4%, with the possibility of a new recession, its finance ministry reports. It has had to take part in the bailouts of other euro states that faced deep financial problems such as Greece and Ireland. Many Finns now see Niinisto -- who also served as deputy chairman of the European Investment Bank -- as someone who can stand up for Finland's interests in the single currency. Haavisto, meanwhile, has served as Finland's environment and development minister and has international experience working for the European Union and the United Nations in Sudan and the Middle East. Finland's president is in charge of the country's foreign policy, together with the government, and serves as commander-in-chief of its defense forces. But recent changes have seen more power being given to the government and parliament, and former President Mauno Koivisto told YLE that there was a risk of an "imbalance" between the direct public election of the president and the office's diminishing power.

chatgpt: Sauli Niinisto has been elected Finland's president, gains showed on Monday, as he secured a second term with victory in the first round of voting on 28 January. Niinisto, 69, won an overwhelming 62.6% of votes, according to preliminary results published by the justice ministry. His closest rival, Pekka Haavisto secured only 12.4% of votes. The race featured eight candidates who were pitted against each other in a bid to lead the nation. Incumbent President Niinisto faced competition from some strong contenders, including Haavisto, who served as the environmental minister under Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Haavisto's status as Finland's first openly gay presidential candidate gave him a unique edge during the election. Despite his loss, Haavisto's campaign is seen as significant in the country's political landscape. The election saw a clear choice between two former ministers. Niinisto served as Finland's finance minister in the mid-1990s before he was elected as president in 2012. He is known for his conservative views and has been credited with steering his country during difficult economic times in Europe. Niinisto has called for closer ties with the European Union (EU), and the general support for Brussels played into his re-election bid. He has stressed the importance of remaining inside the bloc, echoing the sentiments of many Finns who believe that the EU is essential for their country's economy. With tensions escalating between Britain and the EU over the Brexit negotiations, and other member states such as Italy and Hungary challenging the establishment, Finland's election is seen as a test of popular support for the bloc. Niinisto's victory is seen as a signal that a euro-positive policy remains the way forward for most Finns. He has shown himself to be well-versed in EU economics throughout the campaign, stressing how important the euro is for Finland's economy. Both Niinisto and Haavisto are socially progressive leaders who advocate gay rights, equality, and environmental protection. Looking ahead, Niinisto's second term in office will also face challenges on the domestic front. His government has faced resistance from groups who want to see more radical economic reforms and greater efforts to combat climate change. Despite these challenges, Sauli Niinisto's re-election has strengthened the Finnish political landscape and signals the people's continued support for a strong relationship with the EU.
