Staff from scandal-hit G4S are being hired by police forces to run murder and rape inquiries. Senior investigators from the firm – ridiculed for the Olympics security fiasco – are even helping overworked officers on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse case. Retired detectives are earning more than £60,000 a year in their new roles, on top of lucrative gold-plated public sector pensions. Privatisation: Police forces are recruiting from G4S for roles running murder and serious crime probes . But the move has sparked fury among critics amid concerns that it is another step on the road to privatising frontline policing jobs. Many high-ranking officers have been forced to retire as police budgets are cut by 20 per cent by Home Secretary Theresa May. Police chiefs believe rehiring them as civilians ensures their experience and knowledge are not lost. But it has led to concerns about lack of oversight because hired civilian staff do not have to co-operate with the Independent Police . Reinforcements: The Government had to draft in additional security helpers from the Armed Forces after G4S failed to fulfill its contract for the Olympic Games . Complaints Commission, the organisation that probes grievances against the police. G4S – criticised by the Government last year after 3,500 extra troops had to be deployed at London 2012 to plug a gap in trained security staff – is advertising for 'senior investigating officers' to work with forces around Britain. The G4S File: The company has a history of blunders . Civilian officers will act as a 'focal point' heading serious crime investigations, leading teams of officers conducting interviews, door-to-door inquiries and tests. However, they could not arrest suspects and will not be allowed to lead a murder inquiry before someone has been taken into custody. Applicants must have managed murder or serious crime investigations up to the rank of detective inspector in the last four years. G4S's Policing Solutions division will pocket more than £250,000 to hire staff to work on Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the wake of the Savile paedophile and sex abuse scandal. The Met has a deal with a private firm, Reed Specialist Recruitment, which will pay G4S to hire retired detectives. They will work alongside 30 police officers in the Met's abuse unit. Former Met commander John O'Connor said: 'It's appalling that G4S is recruiting for an inquiry of such a personal and harrowing nature. It's madness and an insult to victims.' Other £30-an-hour jobs include a child abuse investigator to work  with Essex Police's specialist  unit in Laindon, near Basildon, and an intelligence co-ordinator in Hertfordshire. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We support police and crime commissioners and forces considering whether the private sector can help achieve savings and better services.' G4S hit the headlines after failing to fulfill its £240million contract with Locog to provide 10,400 security guards at the Olympic Park and other venues .

chatgpt: The UK's largest investigation firm, the Serious Investigation Team (SIT), has announced that it will be hiring senior investigating officers for £60,000-a-year roles. The move comes after the firm was criticized for being unable to deal with the high volume of cases that it had to handle, leading to the deployment of troops at London 2012. The new recruits, according to a spokesperson from the SIT, will deal specifically with murder and serious crime investigations. The announcement has been welcomed by many as a sign that the firm is finally taking steps to address its shortcomings and improve its capabilities. The SIT has been criticized for its handling of several high-profile cases in recent years. In particular, the firm has come under fire for its response to the London 2012 Olympic Games, where it was unable to cope with the number of cases that were brought to its attention. This led to the deployment of troops to provide additional support. The new senior investigating officers are expected to play a key role in addressing the shortcomings of the SIT. They will be responsible for conducting thorough investigations into murders and other serious crimes, and ensuring that all cases are handled in a timely and effective manner. The announcement has been welcomed by many, including members of the public, who have expressed their concerns over the SIT's ability to deal with serious crimes. The new recruits will be expected to bring a fresh perspective to the firm, and to work closely with existing staff to ensure that all cases are handled efficiently and effectively. In addition to hiring new senior investigating officers, the SIT has also announced that it will be investing in new technology to help it deal with the high volume of cases that it receives. The firm is planning to introduce new software and other tools to improve its investigative capabilities and to streamline its operations. The move has been praised by experts in the field, who have highlighted the importance of investing in new technology to improve investigative capabilities. With the rise of digital and online crime, it is essential that firms like the SIT are equipped with the necessary tools and resources to tackle these new and emerging threats. Overall, the announcement of the new senior investigating officers and the investment in new technology are positive signs that the SIT is finally taking steps to address its shortcomings and improve its capabilities. With the support of its new recruits, the SIT will be better equipped to deal with the most serious and complex cases, and to provide the public with the justice and confidence that they deserve.
