A 28-year-old Fort Lauderdale man appeared in court on Monday facing up to 10-years in prison after a 15-year-old girl's father discovered alleged cyber-sex sessions between the pair. Marckenson Chery, who turns 29 this week, is accused of several online sex sessions with the San Francisco teenager during which he convinced the alleged victim to masturbate, show herself naked and then watch while he masturbated. The teen told Chery, whose Skype name is 'Swag likeus Robinson', that she was 15 and investigators claim that she reminded him this several times during the two months they were online. Federal agents from Homeland Security say that the California teen met Chery online in September using the anonymous online chatting site called Omegle. They then moved their relationship to video messaging service Skype and when the girl's father became suspicious in November he took her phone and discovered 143 pages of sexually explicit chat between the two. He handed this over to San Francisco police who then contacted Homeland Security Investigations agents in South Florida. Appearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday, Chery pleaded not guilty to one charge of enticement of a minor. Skype: The popular video messaging system was allegedly used by the teenager and Chery for sex sessions . His attorney, Joshua Fisher, said he did not want to comment on the allegations until he has properly reviewed the evidence. If convicted, Chery faces between 10-years to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. Joe Trias the deputy special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in South Florida said that criminals use many different apps to make sexual contact with children and teens. 'We are seeing an increase in these kinds of cases, though I'd be hesitant to call it a trend,' Trias said in a phone interview with the Sun Sentinel on Monday. 'There's such a huge variety of apps â€¦ the criminal element is always going to find ways to use them for their own purposes.' He warned parents to be vigilant with the social their children are using. 'The way one of our agents puts it is: 'Do you want a 30-year-old man in your child's bedroom at 1 a.m.?' Trias said.

chatgpt: Fort Lauderdale resident, Marckenson Chery, 29, is facing serious allegations of having engaged in months of internet sex sessions with a 15-year-old San Francisco girl. The case was brought to light after the teenager's father discovered hundreds of messages exchanged between the two and decided to report Chery. According to the police reports, Chery had allegedly met the teenager online in September and started chatting with her. He subsequently used Skype to have cyber-sex with the minor, who was unknowingly being manipulated by an older stranger. The victim's father became suspicious of his daughter's behaviours and eventually decided to check her online activities, where he discovered the extensive conversations between his daughter and Chery. As soon as he found out about the pattern of the communication, he reported Chery to the police. Subsequently, the police arrested Chery, and he is now facing severe legal consequences, which include a 10-years to life sentence in prison and a fine of $250,000. The news of this particular case sparked great outrage among the community, especially from the victim's family, who said that they were devastated by what had happened. Online child abuse and exploitation are serious offenses, and more often than not, the consequences are severe. The authorities urge parents to keep a close eye on their children's online activities and to have open conversations about sexuality and the dangers of online predators. Sexual grooming is a widespread issue, and many young people fall prey to the manipulations of older individuals who abuse their trust and engage in criminal activities. Furthermore, the police advise the public to report any suspicions or signs of abuse as soon as possible, as it could be the difference between stopping a criminal from continuing their destructive activities or allowing them to roam free. In conclusion, the Marckenson Chery case is a wake-up call to parents and teenagers about the dangers of online predators. It is a reminder of the severe consequences of taking advantage of children online, and the importance of being vigilant when it comes to digital communication. The justice system will ensure that offenders like Chery are held accountable for their actions and receive the punishment they deserve.
