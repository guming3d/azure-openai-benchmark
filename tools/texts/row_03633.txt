article: (CNN) -- Gabon's President Omar Bongo, Africa's longest-serving ruler, died Monday morning, the country's prime minister said, settling conflicting reports from government and media accounts. Gabon's President Omar Bongo, who died Monday, was Africa's longest-serving ruler. Calm was reported after the announcement, but Gabon's Ministry of Defense nonetheless announced it was closing all of the country's land, air and sea ports, according to a ministry statement. The statement, which was broadcast on state television and radio, said that in "the best interest of the nation, the Ministry of Defense calls on the population to increase their vigilance and patriotism during this difficult and painful time the country is facing." In a statement, Prime Minister Jean Eyeghe Ndong said Bongo suffered cardiac arrest at a hospital in Barcelona, Spain. "He dedicated his political life to his country and the Gabonese people, always cultivating the unity and cohesion of the Gabonese toward a true peace," Ndong said. The government declared a 30-day national period of mourning. Bongo, 73, had been receiving treatment for intestinal cancer at the Quiron clinic in Barcelona, Spain, according to the Gabonews agency. Earlier in the day, the prime minister strongly refuted initial French news reports of Bongo's death. He had vowed to lodge a protest with the French authorities about "repeated leaks in the French press." Shortly afterward, hospital officials reported Bongo's passing to Gabonese officials. Bongo took power in 1967, seven years after the West African country's independence from France. He imposed one-party rule a year after succeeding the country's first president, who died in office. He allowed multiparty elections after a new constitution in 1991, but his party has retained control of the government since then. President Obama said Bongo "played a key role in developing and shaping the strong bilateral relationship that exists between Gabon and the United States today." "President Bongo consistently emphasized the importance of seeking compromise and striving for peace, and made protecting Gabon's natural treasures a priority," Obama said in a statement Monday. "His work in conservation in his country and his commitment to conflict resolution across the continent are an important part of his legacy and will be remembered with respect." CNN's Per Nyberg and Al Goodman contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, the Defense Ministry in Gabon has announced that it is closing all of the country's ports following the death of its leader, President Ali Bongo. Bongo's passing comes as a surprise to many, particularly as the leader was being treated in Spain for intestinal cancer at the time of his death. Ali Bongo was a prominent figure in Gabonese politics, having taken power in 1967, just seven years after the country gained independence from France. Despite facing criticism from some quarters, particularly in recent years, Bongo had remained in power for over 50 years, becoming one of the longest-serving leaders on the African continent. Concerns over Bongo's health had been mounting in recent months, with many questioning his fitness to govern. Earlier on Monday, there were conflicting reports regarding the state of his health. While some sources claimed that Bongo was recovering well, others indicated that his condition was deteriorating rapidly. The Defense Ministry's decision to close all of Gabon's ports in the wake of Bongo's death has come as a surprise to many. It is unclear what the reasoning behind this move is, and some have speculated that it may be an attempt to prevent any potential unrest or disturbances from spreading. It remains to be seen what impact Bongo's death will have on Gabonese politics and society. The leader's passing has already been met with widespread mourning and tributes from both within the country and beyond. Many see his death as the end of an era, with some questioning what the future holds for Gabon and its people. Despite the uncertainty and sadness that surrounds Bongo's passing, however, there is also a recognition of the significant changes that he brought to Gabon during his time in power. From overseeing the country's modernization to playing an active role in regional and international affairs, Bongo's legacy is a complex and multifaceted one. As the country begins to grapple with the aftermath of Bongo's death, it is clear that he will be remembered as a significant figure in Gabonese history, and one whose influence will be felt for many years to come.
