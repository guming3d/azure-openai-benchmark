Shortened to Botlr, the high tech hospitality technology will ferry amenities from the front desk of the Aloft in Cupertino to any of its 150 rooms in just three minutes or less. The Starwood company is using its Silicon Valley location as a test bed for the the speedy R2D2-like drone. 'As soon as A.L.O. entered the room, we knew it was what we were looking for. A.L.O. has the work ethic of Wall-E, the humor of Rosie from The Jetsons and reminds me of my favorite childhood robot, R2-D2.' Brian McGuinness of Starwoodâ€™s Specialty Select Brands said in a press release Tuesday. The 3-foot tall robot, made by the firm Savioke, features a smart vinyl collar and even a name tag. While running everything from razors to mail to Aloft guests, A.L.O. moves at a fast clip of up to 4mph. Meanwhile, Savioke says it manuevers through elevators and communicates easily with guests and staff. 'All of us at Savioke have seen the look of delight on those guests who receive a room delivery from a robot,' said Steve Cousins, CEO of Savioke. Starwood and Savioke hope to use the robot as a way to funnel existing human staff toward more sensitive tasks rather than a death knell for bellhops. With the delivery complete, the robot then asks for a review. If the guest inputs a positive remark on the built-in screen, the robot does a happy dance. Zippy: The Botlr debuted Tuesday at Aloft's Cupertino location, where it will zip up and down elevators to deliver amenities to any of the 150 guestrooms in three minutes or less . The accomplished drone then zips back to the elevator, sends a message instead of hitting the down button and returns to the lobby where it plugs itself in and awaits a new task. So how exactly will guests experience A.L.O.? According to the New York Times, the robot will arrive to guests' doors soon after they put in a request and will automatically place a call to the room instead of knocking. When the robot's sensors indicate the door has opened, it lifts its storage bin lid to reveal the requested item. A.L.O.'s official start date is August 20. The company hopes to roll out more Botlrs soon thereafter. stiff competition: Starwood says its new robot has the work ethic of Wall-E and the likeability of R2D2 .

chatgpt: The Aloft hotel in Cupertino, California, has welcomed a new member to its team. Meet A.L.O, a robot butler, or "Botlr" for short. A.L.O debuted at the hotel on Tuesday and has quickly become a hit among guests. The automated bellhop, dressed in a vinyl collar and a nametag, is the hotel industry's first of its kind. A.L.O is programmed to assist with delivering amenities to guest rooms, such as extra towels, toiletries, and water bottles. The robot can navigate its way around the hotel and even call the elevator, all while maintaining a friendly demeanor. The concept for Botlr was developed by Savioke, a technology company based in San Jose, California. The idea behind the automated butler was to provide hotels with a cost-effective solution to improve guest experiences. With A.L.O, guests can request additional amenities from their smartphones or tablets, and the robot will deliver them straight to their room. This not only saves time for hotel staff but also provides an innovative, futuristic touch that impresses guests. According to the CEO of Aloft Hotels, Brian McGuinness, guests have been thrilled with A.L.O's arrival. "We've gotten a lot of positive feedback from guests who love the fact that they can have their amenities delivered by a robot," he said. "It's a really fun experience that adds to their stay." A.L.O is just the beginning of the Botlr revolution. Savioke plans to expand its fleet of automated bellhops to other hotels and companies around the world. The company has already deployed its robots in some of the biggest names in the hospitality industry, including Marriot and Hilton. But it's not just the hospitality industry that is looking to capitalize on the potential of robots. Many companies across various sectors are exploring the use of automated technology to improve productivity and efficiency. Experts predict that robotics and automation will play a significant role in the workforce of the future. However, the introduction of robots in the workplace has also raised concerns about job displacement. While robots like A.L.O can perform certain tasks, there are still many roles that require human expertise and intuition. It's important for companies to consider the impact that automation may have on their employees and to find ways to upskill and reskill workers to adapt to the changing technological landscape. For now, A.L.O remains a novelty and a welcome addition to the Aloft hotel. Guests can expect to see the automated bellhop making deliveries and greeting them in the hotel lobby. With its friendly demeanor and efficient service, A.L.O is a clear example of how robots can be used in the workplace to enhance customer experiences and streamline operations.
