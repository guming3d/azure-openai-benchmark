article: Kit Symons could move a step closer to landing the permanent Fulham manager's job with victory over Charlton on Friday. Symons has guided the Cottagers to four wins from seven matches since taking over on a caretaker basis from the sacked Felix Magath last month. Chairman Shahid Khan has a five-man committee to advise him over the club's next managerial appointment, with names such as Chris Hughton and Steve Clarke thought to be on the shortlist along with Symons.

But while Danny Murphy, Brian McBride and Co mull over the options, Symons has quietly gone about transforming a side who had collected just one point from their previous seven Sky Bet Championship games under Magath. One player benefiting from the former Fulham defender's spell in charge is Dan Burn, whose late equaliser secured a dramatic 3-3 draw at Rotherham on Tuesday. The 22-year-old told the club website: "We just had the desire to at least come away with something. We took a point - yes, we wanted it to be three, but it wasn't a defeat so it means we can build on that going into the Charlton game on Friday. "You can't keep getting a win, a defeat, a win, a defeat - you've got to keep the momentum going so it's really important we didn't get a defeat on Tuesday. We've got a lot of games coming up, so hopefully we can carry on." Dan Burn (right) is desperate for Fulham to continue their improvement against Charlton . Symons will hand a late fitness check to defender Tim Hoogland, who missed out in midweek through illness, while captain Scott Parker will return to the starting line-up to face his old club. A point would lift Fulham out of the relegation zone for the first time this season, while Charlton are looking for a win which would move them to within a point of leaders Derby. But Addicks boss Bob Peeters is well aware of the stark contrast between Magath's confidence-drained team and the in-form side he will face at Craven Cottage. Scott Parker (right) is set to return to Fulham's starting line-up at home to Charlton on Friday . "I saw them in one of the last games under Felix Magath, (a 1-0 defeat) at home to Wolves, and at that time they were struggling, there was no mentality, nothing in the team," he said. "Then I saw them against Bolton at home and it was another team completely - they won 4-0. So it's going to be a very tough night for us, especially because it's a proper derby." The visitors will be without suspended midfielder Yoni Buyens, while winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson and six-goal top scorer Igor Vetokele are injury doubts.

chatgpt: Fulham's interim hire, Kit Symons, has overseen an impressive improvement in the team's recent performances, picking up four wins from seven matches. Symons was appointed as the team's caretaker manager after the sacking of Felix Magath, and has since made significant strides in turning the club's fortunes around. Having won their last two matches, Fulham seem to be back on track, heading into their showdown against Charlton Athletic. The London derby is crucial for both teams, as Fulham would leapfrog their opponents with a win, thereby pushing themselves out of the relegation zone. Symons has been widely credited with the turnaround of Fulham's results, instilling a sense of belief and unity within the team. His players have responded positively to his style of management, with their confidence visibly boosted in recent appearances. Under the guidance of Symons, many team members have also been given more regular game time, and have seized the opportunity to showcase their skills. Speaking to reporters, Symons said he was proud of what he had achieved so far but was keen to reinforce that the situation remained quite fragile. "I'm happy with what we've done recently, but we are not getting carried away. We still have a long way to go, and a tough season ahead. We need to stay focused, remain calm, and take things one match at a time." Fulham's rise under Symons has been quite dramatic. The team started the season in poor form, with Magath's departure following a string of poor performances. It was clear that the club needed a change to keep themselves away from the relegation zone, and Symons was seen as an ideal candidate to provide that. Symons is well-known to the team, having enjoyed a distinguished playing career during which he made over 150 appearances for Fulham. He also has plenty of professional coaching experience, and previously managed the Welsh national team. Symons' ability to galvanize the team and build a winning mentality has been praised by supporters, with many expressing confidence that he can lead Fulham back to the top tier of English football. The team's recent performances have certainly provided cause for optimism, and if they can continue their winning run, they are likely to be a force to be reckoned with this season. As the team prepares for their match against Charlton, all eyes will be on Symons and his players. If they can continue to play with the confidence and belief they have shown in recent matches, there is no reason why they cannot overcome their opponents and take a critical step towards safety. With Symons at the helm, Fulham's future is looking brighter than it has in some time.
