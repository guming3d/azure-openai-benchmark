article: (CNN) -- Sometimes it seems that Abu Dhabi, despite being one of the richest cities on earth, is uncertain of its identity: much of its new architecture is heavily influenced by European examples rather than a desert or Gulf vernacular. British designer Thomas Heatherwick aims to change that. "Some of the parks that have existed here have been based on the romantic notion of a European park. It's as if someone went to Paris and said, 'ooh, that's a nice park,' and rolled it up and dropped it on top of the desert," notes Thomas Heatherwick, the British designer of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron and the London Routemaster bus. Heatherwick is hoping to renew the UAE capital's pride of place. His weapon of choice? A cracked, underground park that embraces both the natural aesthetic and flora indigenous to the land. "There can be a mentality that can easily exist here that sees the desert as a surface to be covered up, instead of maybe celebrating its uniqueness," says Heatherwick, who recently unveiled plans for proposed 1.3-million-square-foot Al Fayah Park. On the outside, the public space will resemble a 65-feet high mound of parched earth. Heatherwick imagines it as a space where residents will congregate to picnic, or catch an outdoor concert. Underneath the dome (which is really a patchwork of canopies held up by several columns) will live lush gardens (including date palms and a community vegetable patch), streams and pools, cafes, and a public library. "The amazing thing about living in a city, in a place where people live in close proximity to each other, are those times when you want to see your fellow citizens, when you want to be amongst them and have your mind move forward," Heatherwick notes. "Unlike in London, where you can go for a walk down the street, the extreme climate in Abu Dhabi limits your options. That kind of socializing tends to happen mainly in shopping malls," explains Heatherwick. Al Fayah Park, he hopes, will be offer the city's residents a viable alternative. The domed park will also give the otherwise flat city an undulating quality. "It's almost two stories in the middle. It's almost like Abu Dhabi's first hill," he says. To reduce the nation's carbon footprint, Heatherwick has also opted to mix concrete from desert sand, eliminating the need to rely on imports. Furthermore, the shade provided by the rooftop will also reduce the amount of desalinated water needed to irrigate the plants underneath by restricting evaporation. "The partial shade will mean we can use half the quantity of water that the current site used, and create more lushness in the process," he says.

The Al Fayah Park will be covered with a unique dome that will resemble the parched desert landscape of the region. The innovative design will help to ensure that park visitors are kept cool and shaded, even in the heat of the day.

The dome will be made of a durable material that will be able to withstand the extreme temperatures of the UAE. It is also designed to let in natural light, which will help to create a pleasant and inviting atmosphere inside. The unique design of the dome was inspired by the landscape of the region, with its endless sand dunes and rugged terrain. The park will be carefully landscaped to ensure that it is in harmony with the environment. It will feature a range of different gardens, including a desert garden, a palm garden and a children's garden. There will also be a range of pools and streams, which will help to create a cool and relaxing atmosphere. The Al Fayah Park is set to become a new landmark for Abu Dhabi and is expected to attract visitors from all over the world. It will be a place where people can come to relax, unwind and enjoy the beauty of nature in the heart of the city. The park is expected to open in the next few years, and will be a valuable addition to the UAE's already impressive list of attractions.

He is known for his unique and imaginative approach to design, and has worked on a range of high-profile projects around the world. His work is characterized by a commitment to creating spaces that are both functional and beautiful, and his designs always reflect the needs of the local community. Overall, the Al Fayah Park is set to be an exciting and much-anticipated addition to Abu Dhabi's landscape. Its unique dome design and beautiful landscaped gardens will make it a must-visit destination for anyone visiting the UAE.
