Stefan Zoleik,  from Martin, Slovakia, became a social recluse as the fatty lump grew from ear to ear. Doctors were unable to operate because of health complications. But in June last year the 47-year-old underwent a five-hour removal procedure. Scroll down for video . Stefan Zoleik, 47, is having corrective surgery in Martin, Slovakia, after a 13lb tumour grew on his neck. He is pictured last year . Medics are now hoping additional surgery will get rid of all the affected cells. The former plumber suffers from a rare condition called Madelung disease, which causes tumours to grow. The problems started in his early 20s when he noticed he was developing a large jaw. He said: 'Since the surgery last year my life has changed incredibly. I don't know why it wasn't possible for it to be done earlier but I'm just grateful that it has been done now.' Mr Zoleik pictured shortly after a successful operation that removed the massive tumor from his neck . The father-of-two had an initial operation in June last year. He is pictured from his hospital bed after the surgery . Madelung disease is a rare condition that causes tumours to grow around the neck, shoulders and upper arms. It usually affects men between the ages of 30 and 70. It can lead to a loss of neck mobility and pain. The growths can also become cancerous in rare circumstances. Their exact cause is unknown. One benefit of the operation is that it stopped people staring at him in the street. Mr Zoleik, a husband and father-of-two, said: 'I'll finally be able to go for a beer with friends without people turning their heads and pointing at me. 'My family were really surprised how well I looked when they came to visit me in the hospital after the operation. 'Over everything else it was my family who helped me the most. They supported me both before and after the surgery, and are my rock that also gave me the strength to recover.' The retired plumber said: 'I'll finally be able to go for a beer with friends without people turning their heads and pointing at me'. Pictured as a young man before the condition took hold . Mr Zoleik's family said although they were used to his appearance, they were happy he had managed to gain a face that he wanted to show the public. Igor Homola, a plastic surgeon from the Martin University Hospital, said that despite the initial operation changing Mr Zoleik's life they still have to do the corrective surgery. He said: 'Even after surgery there will be cells that have kept on growing and we now need to operate to remove those  to fix it.'

chatgpt: Stefan Zoleik, a 47-year-old from Slovakia, has been living with Madelung disease for several years. This rare medical condition causes fatty deposits, also known as lipomas, to develop in various parts of the body. These lumps can grow to considerable sizes, causing discomfort, pain, and mobility issues. Last June, Zoleik underwent initial surgery to remove one of the lipomas that had formed on his body. This operation was successful, but there were still several other growths that needed to be treated. Zoleik's medical team at Martin University Hospital in Slovakia is now completing corrective surgery to address these remaining lumps. Madelung disease primarily affects men between the ages of 30 and 60, and the exact cause of this condition is still unknown. The lipomas associated with Madelung disease typically appear in specific locations, including the neck, upper arms, upper back, and upper chest. In some cases, these lumps can also form on other parts of the body, such as the belly or thighs. The fatty deposits associated with Madelung disease can put pressure on the surrounding tissues, causing pain and discomfort. In severe cases, they can even interfere with the normal functioning of organs and nerves. As a result, many people with this condition require surgical intervention to remove the growths and improve their quality of life. Zoleik's surgery at Martin University Hospital is part of a larger trend of medical advancements in the field of lipoma treatment. In recent years, doctors have developed new techniques and technologies that make these operations safer and more effective. For example, many surgeons now use a liposuction-like tool to extract the fatty deposits, which reduces the risk of bleeding and scarring. Despite these advances, however, Madelung disease remains a challenging condition to treat. There is no known cure for this disorder, and many patients require ongoing surgery to manage their symptoms. Additionally, the psychological impact of living with a visible medical condition can also be significant, leading to depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Zoleik's case highlights the importance of continued research and development in the field of rare medical conditions. While Madelung disease may be relatively uncommon, the impact it has on the lives of those who experience it is significant. By investing in new treatments and technologies, medical professionals can help individuals like Zoleik to live healthier and more fulfilling lives, free from the limitations of their condition. In conclusion, Stefan Zoleik's battle with Madelung disease has been a challenging one, but with the help of medical professionals at Martin University Hospital in Slovakia, he is now on the road to recovery. While this rare condition remains a medical mystery, new treatments and technologies offer hope for future patients. As medical research continues to progress, we can only hope that more effective treatments will be developed to improve the lives of those who suffer from Madelung disease, and other rare medical conditions like it.
