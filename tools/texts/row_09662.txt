article: (CNN) -- As more technology goes mobile, "where" has become one of the key pieces of context in daily life. And the answers to "where" increasingly are provided through geographic information systems (GIS), a technology that is being explored, debated and celebrated today in public. It's GIS Day, and events are being held in 45 U.S. states and 59 countries. Find a GIS Day event near you . GIS is an umbrella term to describe tools used to gather, transform, manipulate, analyze and produce information about real-world places. It's used to create maps and 3-D models, and to provide information to create more accurate reports and make better decisions. It also powers popular interactive services like Google Street View, or GPS features that help apps on your smartphone know what you mean by "nearby." The point of GIS Day is to demonstrate uses of GIS that are making a difference in society, from getting driving directions on your cell phone to geocaching games to the global response to the Haiti earthquake. Presentations, demonstrations and discussions will cover such far-ranging topics as transportation, defense,  education, agriculture and more. Every event is unique. I'll be attending the GIS Day event at the University of California, Berkeley, where I'm hoping to try out the free app GeoBeagle on my Android phone in a geocaching exercise. Some GIS Day events (like the UC Berkeley one) are conference-style and geared toward adults. But many are specifically kid- and family-friendly. For instance, Myford Elementary School in Irvine, California, is hosting a GIS Day event that includes first-graders making "map hats" and fourth- and fifth-graders playing geo-"Jeopardy." Most events are free and open to the public. GIS Day grew out of Geography Awareness Week, an annual campaign launched in 1987 by the National Geographic Society to promote geo-literacy and draw attention to "the importance of geographic understanding in ensuring our nation's economic competitiveness, national security, environmental sustainability, and the livability of our communities in the 21st century." Of course, GIS technology isn't all roses and sunshine. When GIS-enabled devices or systems know where you are and where you've been, it opens substantial concerns about privacy, safety, security and equity. GIS technology can pave the way for the more effective or equitable delivery of products and services, or it can empower communities to better look after their own local interests. But it can also enable new types of discriminatory "redlining," or encourage overeager law enforcement agencies to snoop. How much locative information is OK to share, and who should have access to it? Where to draw that line will probably be one of the most important "where" questions discussed at today's GIS Day events.

chatgpt: GIS Day event at the University of California, Berkeley is set to take place on November 18, 2020, with the aim of demonstrating the power and potential of geographic information systems (GIS) to aid society. The event, which is part of the annual Geography Awareness Week campaign launched in 1987, will bring together experts in GIS technology, academics, students, and members of the public, to explore the latest trends and developments in geospatial technology. Amy Gahran, a renowned technology writer and analyst, is set to attend the event and share her insights on how GIS technology can be used to improve society. Speaking ahead of the event, Gahran emphasized the potential of GIS technology in solving some of the world's most pressing problems, including climate change, poverty, and global health. She said, "GIS Day is a great opportunity to showcase how GIS technology can be applied in different domains, from urban planning and natural resource management to disaster risk reduction and public health. With the growing availability of geospatial data and tools, there's tremendous potential to use GIS to inform policy, drive innovation, and improve people's lives." GIS technology has already proven its value in a number of areas, from disaster response and emergency management to environmental monitoring and resource allocation. By leveraging geological and other spatial data, GIS technology allows organizations to make better decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve the delivery of services. For instance, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, GIS technology enabled first responders to quickly identify areas of need and allocate resources more efficiently. Similarly, in the fight against COVID-19, GIS has played a critical role in tracking and managing the spread of the disease, as well as in identifying populations that are most at risk. The University of California, Berkeley, will be hosting a range of activities and presentations on GIS Day, including a keynote speech by leading GIS expert Dr. Michael F. Goodchild. The event will also feature hands-on workshops, a GIS mapping competition, and a showcase of GIS projects from across the campus and wider community. The University's Department of Geography, which is leading the event, hopes that the event will showcase the potential of GIS technology to a wider audience and raise awareness of the role of geography in addressing social and environmental challenges. Dr. Darin Jensen, a GIS specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, expressed his enthusiasm for the event, saying, "GIS Day is a great opportunity to showcase the latest developments in GIS technology and to highlight the role of geography in addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges. We're excited to bring together experts and enthusiasts from across the campus and wider community to share their insights and experiences, and to explore ways in which GIS can be used to drive positive change." With GIS technology playing an increasingly important role in business, government, and civil society, GIS Day provides an important platform to highlight the potential of this technology and to inspire the next generation of GIS professionals. As Gahran notes, "GIS is an increasingly relevant and valuable field in today's world, and events such as GIS Day help to showcase the possibilities of this technology and to encourage more people to get involved."
