article: Luxury French label Louis Vuitton has launched a new tote, and it doesn't appear to be very practical. The leather bag, which costs $2,790 and is printed with Louis Vuitton's classic LV monogram design, features three large 'frayed asymmetric cut-outs,' better known as holes, on either side. Designed by Comme des Garçons founder Rei Kawakubo as part of the brand's Iconoclasts collection, it comes with a fabric insert to prevent your belongings spilling out - the same sort of drawstring dust bag traditionally used to store and protect the outside of an expensive tote, not line the inside. Scroll down for video . Holey Moly! The leather bag, which costs $2,790 and was guest-designed by Comme des Garçons creator Rei Kawakudo, features three large 'frayed asymmetric cut-outs,' better known as holes, on either side . '[Rei Kawakubo], creator of Comme des Garçons, applies her radical, refined aesthetic to a House icon... with boldly conceived asymmetrical cut-outs and raw-edged details to produce this provocative Bag with Holes,' the website description reads. 'Sleek and capacious, the bag is a natural for travel in durable Monogram canvas. The practical insert pouch keeps belongings secure.' And Ms Kawakubo's design isn't the only unusual offering from the Iconoclasts all-star line-up. Celebrated shoe designer Christian Louboutin created a very extravagant gold-studded shopping cart, complete with his signature red accents - yours for $23,300. 'It abounds with delightful details and allusions, from the rounded Toron handles and red calf-hair back panel, to the brass corners inspired by House trunks and the metal Siamoise ornament that is so Louboutin,' its description reads. And a collection featuring the term 'icon' wouldn't be complete without participation from Chanel legend Karl Lagerfeld. The eccentric designer has crafted a five-piece range themed around boxing, with chain-strapped totes starting at $3,400 and a 'price upon application' life-sized trunk; one of only 25 made. '[Mr Lagerfeld's] Boxing Trunk is fitted with a signature punching bag and stand, while a separate suitcase, also in Monogram, holds boxing gloves and a mat. 'With its capacious interior and removable shelving, the trunk can also serve as a chic travel closet.' Definitely worth the money then.

chatgpt: Louis Vuitton's new Iconoclasts collection has unveiled a set of designer bags that have caught the attention of fashion enthusiasts. Among these, the most intriguing bag is one designed by Rei Kawakubo. Kawakubo, who is the founder of fashion brand Comme des Garcons, has come up with an interesting design that defies conventional handbag rules. The bag looks like it has been cut and pasted into an interesting, abstract shape using different pieces of leather. However, the overall look is cohesive and seemingly effortlessly chic. The bag is perfect for those who like to stand out from the crowd and want to make a bold fashion statement. The new collection is geared towards a younger, more diverse audience that is interested in pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo. In addition to Kawakubo's bag, the collection includes a Karl Lagerfeld punching bag and a Christian Louboutin shopping cart. The Karl Lagerfeld punching bag is an interesting and slightly surreal creation. Made from black leather, the bag has been created to look like it has been well-worn and used. This design choice adds an extra layer of intrigue and curiosity to the piece. On the other hand, the Christian Louboutin shopping cart is a more literal interpretation. It looks like an actual shopping cart, but has been designed to fit with the luxury aesthetics of the brand. The cart even includes a detachable mirror, which is sure to come in handy for avid shoppers who want to try on shoes or other accessories on the go. The Iconoclasts collection is a breath of fresh air in the often too-polished world of luxury fashion. It's exciting to see designers breaking the mold and experimenting with new shapes, ideas and materials. The collection is slated to hit stores soon and is sure to be a hit with fashion lovers who crave something that is a bit edgy and different from the norm. In conclusion, the new Louis Vuitton Iconoclasts collection has pushed the envelope with its bold, innovative and unconventional designs.
