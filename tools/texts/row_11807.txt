article: (CNN) -- A report issued Monday by Pennsylvania attorney general's says that more could have been done to put convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky behind bars earlier, but the investigation stalled for months at a time in the three years that a case was built against the former Penn State football defensive coordinator. The report does not accuse anyone -- most notably the former attorney general, current Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett -- of doing anything maliciously to delay the investigation. Instead, it says that investigators from different agencies failed to communicate and share information and that search warrants and subpoenas were not issued as quickly as they could have been. For example, almost three years before his arrest, Sandusky was interviewed by a social worker, but police were not invited to the interview. "This was a notable failure, particularly since at no point later in the investigation did law enforcement manage to interview Sandusky," the report said. The report also faults investigators for not finding a 1998 police report at Penn State for nearly two years despite the fact that several people in law enforcement were aware of it. Police also waited two years before contacting Sandusky's children's charity, the Second Mile, the place where he met almost all of his victims. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 boys. His arrest came with charges including conspiracy and perjury against three Penn State officials, including the former university president. And the scandal led to the firing of legendary Penn State coach Joe Paterno. The report does not talk about Paterno's role in the scandal â€” a widely debated topic among Penn State loyalists and fans who are trying to restore his reputation. Attorney General Kathleen Kane promised a review of her predecessor's handling of the case when she took office in 2012, and Monday's report is the conclusion of that two-year review. Corbett declined to respond to the report. Investigators from the Pennsylvania State Police, along with various child welfare agencies, disputed that the actions of their staffs contributed in any way to the delay in the investigation, but instead said that the initial case was too weak to stand alone in criminal court, especially given Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community. Former Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley, former Vice President Gary Schultz and former President Graham Spanier are all awaiting trial on charges related to an alleged cover-up of Sandusky's crimes from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Prosecutors say that e-mails show the ex-Penn State officials knew about two reports of Sandusky abusing boys in the locker room showers on campus, but did not report the second one to police. That second incident was witnessed by former assistant coach Mike McQueary, and the case could go to court later this year, although it has continuously been delayed since the 2011 arrests.

chatgpt: A report released today by the Pennsylvania attorney general's office implicates several investigators and agencies in a failure to communicate and share information, leading to the possibility that former Penn State coach, Jerry Sandusky, could have been put in prison much earlier. The report states that while it does not accuse anyone of intentionally delaying the investigation into Sandusky, missed opportunities to gather evidence and build a case against him abound. Sandusky was ultimately convicted in 2012 of 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 boys. However, the report highlights numerous instances where investigators could have acted differently and potentially prevented more children from being abused. According to the report, investigators from the Pennsylvania State Police, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, and the Department of Public Welfare all failed to communicate effectively with one another. They did not share information, and missed opportunities to coordinate their efforts. "This lack of communication and coordination likely allowed Sandusky to continue his abuse of children for years," the report states. One example given in the report involves a 1998 investigation into Sandusky's behavior. Despite being aware of allegations of inappropriate behavior with young boys, investigators did not charge Sandusky at the time. The report says that if investigators had been more thorough and aggressive in their pursuit of evidence, they might have been able to prevent future abuse. Another key issue identified in the report is the failure of investigators to pursue allegations of abuse made against Sandusky by a high school student in 2001. The report states that investigators from the Centre County District Attorney's Office did not follow up on the allegations or share information with investigators from the Pennsylvania attorney general's office. The report notes that this failure to act likely allowed Sandusky to abuse more children in the years that followed. However, the report is careful not to accuse anyone of deliberately delaying the investigation. "We do not find any evidence that there was a 'cover-up' of the Sandusky abuse," the report states. "Rather, we believe that the investigation was hindered by a lack of communication and coordination among investigators." The release of the report comes as Penn State continues to deal with the fallout from the Sandusky scandal. The university has already paid out millions of dollars in settlements to Sandusky's victims, and has made significant changes to its policies and procedures in an effort to prevent future abuse. In response to the report, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro issued a statement saying that the investigation into Sandusky's behavior was "flawed from the outset." He expressed his hope that the report will lead to improved communication and coordination among investigators in future cases. "We have an obligation to do better," Shapiro said. "We owe it to the victims of this terrible abuse, and to all Pennsylvanians who expect and deserve a justice system that works for them."
