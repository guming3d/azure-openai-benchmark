article: (CNN) -- To look at, Lake Kivu seems, well, innocent. Situated on Rwanda's western border, it is both a prominent food source in the country, and -- increasingly -- a tourist hotspot. Hotels have rushed to set up along the coast to cater to the influx of visitors, no doubt lured in by the lake's idyllic beach setting. "The lake is very important to tourism," says Innocent Twagirumukiza, founder of Green Hills Ecotours. "When people finish visiting mountain gorillas, or other national parks around Rwanda, this is a good place to come and relax," he adds. What these tourists may not know, however, is that because of the area's volcanoes and anaerobic bacteria in the water, Lake Kivu is a storehouse for 60 billion cubic meters of methane gas, and susceptible to underwater eruptions. It is one of three "exploding lakes" in the world. Though these types of eruptions, known as overturns, can potentially pose a risk to the local community (in 1986, a similar lake in Cameroon released a bubble of CO2 that killed 1,746 people), Lake Kivu is safe, thanks in part to the efforts of the Rwandan government. "I don't use [the term "exploding lake"]. It's just a lake that has methane gas and needs degassing," says Olivier Ntirushwa, the manager at Kibuye Power Plant in northwest Rwanda. Not only does the "degassing" keep the lake safe, it provides electricity for the region. In 2008, Rwanda launched a pilot project to extract methane gas from the lake and use it as a power source. "This is a source of power, a source of energy that's free. It's our lake, so why not use it like that?" says Ntirushwa. Currently, only 20% of Rwandan homes have power, and Ntirushwa estimates it will take at least 1,000 megawatts to power the country by 2020. While the project is still in the early stages (the plant currently extracts a mere 2.4 megawatts of power), Ntirushwa sees an enormous amount of potential. "This lake has the power to produce up to 800 megawatts. We only do 2.4, so imagine how much is left," he says. The methane resides 250 meters underneath the lake, and to extract it, engineers lower a pipe to just about the layer of dissolved gas. Once captured, the gas is purified and dried. Overall, it's a cheap method for creating electricity. "It's a very rewarding job, because it's the first time [it's been done]. It's a new technology, and the people of Rwanda are very excited about it. Being a pioneer, being the first doing this, it gives some us respect."

chatgpt: Rwanda's Lake Kivu is rapidly emerging as a tourism destination. The lake's unique feature of being one of only three "exploding lakes" in the world is attracting visitors from near and far. However, beneath its serene surface lies an invisible killer made up of methane and carbon dioxide, which could unexpectedly erupt and suffocate everything in its path. Thanks to the creativity and ingenuity of Rwanda, the lake danger has been defused. Rwanda has been able to learn from the tragedies at Cameroon's Lake Nyos in 1986 and Lake Monoun in 1984. The lakes erupted, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people and thousands of livestock. Methane gas had been accumulating unnoticed in these lakes for years, and when it eventually burst out, it suffocated everything in its path. Learning from the experience of the past is the reason why Rwanda was able to take proactive measures to deal with the threat of Lake Kivu. They have found a way to harness the threat of Lake Kivu's gases by turning it into a power source. They used the methane that was bubbling up from the depths of the lake to generate electricity. This process helped to stabilize the levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the lake, which prevented any potential eruption.   Rwanda's conversion of Lake Kivu into a clean energy source has brought significant benefits to the country. Lake Kivu's energy generation capacity has exceeded Rwanda's power needs, enabling them to sell the excess energy to neighboring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi. The conversion of Lake Kivu into a clean energy source also has immense potential for Rwanda's economic growth. The lake's development as a tourism destination has already begun to inject money into the country's economy. Lakeside resorts and safari lodges are being constructed and soon to open, providing visitors with a perfect place to explore the beauty of the area, both at the lakeside and the surrounding national parks renowned for gorilla treks, golden monkey sightings, and nature walks.  Rwanda's investment in Lake Kivu is not just economically beneficial, but it also serves a broader goal of sustainable development. Rwanda, being one of Africa's smallest and most densely populated countries, strongly believes in a green future. The energy generated from Lake Kivu reduces Rwanda's reliance on fossil fuels and plays a significant role in reducing the country's environmental impact. In conclusion, Rwanda's proactive response to the threat of Lake Kivu's gases has turned it from a potential danger into an asset for the country. It's an inspiration to other countries experiencing similar challenges, as it shows what is achievable through innovation and creative problem- solving. With Lake Kivu now generating clean, renewable energy and Rwanda's burgeoning reputation as a tourist hotspot, there is a bright future ahead, and Rwanda has indeed shown that taking innovative steps can solve any problem.
