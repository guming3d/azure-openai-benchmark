Falling sick at sea can be an expensive nightmare for cruise passengers who may find themselves facing expensive medical bills, a new report warns today. Passengers who need to see a doctor on board their cruise ship complain of being hit by charges they feel are excessive, according to the investigation by Which? Travel. The report says that to many holidaymakers used to getting free NHS health care at home, the medical costs on board cruise ships come as a painful shock because they are all charged at private healthcare rates. Passengers on cruise ships feel they are being ripped off by cruise companies' on-board medical services . A survey by Which? found that one in five of the 1,368 members who had been on a cruise reported that they had visited the ship’s doctors. They faced an average bill of £233 -- but 12 of the claims were for £500 or more and one reported a charge of £6,500. Three in ten of those who saw a doctor had to foot the entire bill themselves as they could not claim any of the cost back on their insurance. one passenger who forgot to take enough blood pressure pills with her on a P&O cruise found that her forgetfulness cost her £154.. File picture . Nearly one in five said they could claim part of the cost back and had to pay the excess while four in ten said they could claim all the cost back but had to pay the excess. The majority of these charges were for one-off visits as six in ten people saw the doctor only once. Which? Travel says that one passenger who forgot to take enough blood pressure pills with her on a P&O cruise found that her forgetfulness cost her £154. Another passenger was presented with a bill for £2,500 after being admitted to the ship’s medical centre with pneumonia. Although her insurance policy covered £2,000 she had to make up the £500 difference. 'These are not isolated cases “ said Which? Travel. 'Our members reported huge variations in how much they had to pay on cruise lines.' Angela Smith, commercial manager for Healix Risk Rating, which advises insurers on medical risks says that these charges can come as a shock to holidaymakers used to receiving free health care in the UK. She told the magazine: 'If someone is required to pay £70 on board a ship to see a doctor, this won’t break the bank. 'However, a hefty medical claim that requires hospital treatment will. Very few people can afford £10,000 or £100,000 to pay these expenses. ' Which? Travel asked five of the biggest cruise lines in the UK market - Cunard, Fred Olsen, P&O, Princess and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line (RCCL) to tell them their medical charges, and they all said costs were in line with UK private medical care.

chatgpt: Cruise lovers seeking medical aid from the ship's doctor were slapped with an unexpected fee, according to recent reports. Passengers had to pay an average of £233 for treatment, which came as a shock to many who were used to free healthcare from the National Health Service (NHS). The charges are particularly concerning for those who couldn't claim back the cost on their travel insurance, leaving them with a sizeable bill to pay. As cruise ships generally operate in international waters, they are not subject to any particular country's healthcare system. This means that passengers must pay for any medical treatment they receive on the ship, with fees varying depending on the provider. Many travelers may assume that their travel insurance will cover the cost of any medical expenses, but this is not always the case. Some policies only cover certain types of medical treatment, leaving some costs uncovered. The high cost of medical treatment on a cruise ship can be particularly alarming for older passengers, who may have pre-existing medical conditions or require regular check-ups. Even a routine appointment can still result in a significant fee, which may be difficult for some travelers to absorb. While cruise operators do advise passengers to take out travel insurance, the onus is on the individual to ensure they have adequate coverage. This can be particularly challenging for older passengers, who may find it harder to secure travel insurance due to their age or pre-existing medical conditions. The issue of healthcare costs on cruise ships is a hotly debated topic, with many calling for greater transparency from providers. Cruise companies have defended the charges, stating that they are necessary to cover the cost of providing medical care in a remote environment. However, some cruise lovers are calling for a reform to the system, arguing that passengers should not have to pay such high fees for medical treatment. Many have taken to social media to share their experiences and raise awareness of the issue. The high cost of medical treatment on cruise ships is just one of many hidden fees that can catch passengers off guard. From mandatory gratuities to unexpected port taxes, the total cost of a cruise can quickly add up. Despite these challenges, cruising remains a popular way to travel for millions of people around the world. The allure of exotic destinations and luxury amenities continues to draw travelers from far and wide, and many are willing to pay the price for the experience. For those considering a cruise, it's important to do your research and carefully consider all of the potential costs. Taking out comprehensive travel insurance and budgeting for unexpected expenses can help ensure that your cruise is a smooth and stress-free experience.
