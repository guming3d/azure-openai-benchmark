article: Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A UK terror suspect whose trial on terror charges reconvened Wednesday in Kenya served jail time with one of the men who carried out the 2005 London bomb attacks and may have been influenced by him, a British intelligence report reveals. The report, which was shared with Kenyan counterterror authorities and was obtained by CNN, suggests that Jermaine Grant developed a relationship with the London bomber, Jermaine Lindsay, while they were held at a London facility. British intelligence officials believe Grant was radicalized during that prison term. He is facing three counts of conspiracy to commit a felony. A source said the facility where Grant and Lindsay met was Feltham Young Offenders Institution, the same prison in which U.S. "shoe bomber" Richard Reid was allegedly radicalized, and where July 21 attack leader Muktar Said Ibrahim did time. Grant was being held at Feltham for non-terror-related offenses, the source said. Grant is accused of having connections with the al Qaeda-linked Somali group Al Shabaab, and then being dispatched as part of a cell to carry out attacks in Kenya's port city of Mombasa. He's suspected of targeting hotels frequented by Western tourists in the city. Police allege he worked with Lindsay's widow, British national Samantha Lewthwaite, who is also wanted by Kenyan police on terror charges but remains at large. Grant, who was arrested in late 2011, is being tried in a court complex within a maximum security prison because Lewthwaite hatched a plan to break him out, Kenyan authorities say. The alleged jailbreak plot has contributed to numerous delays in judicial proceedings. Kenyan counterterror police say they found the same kind of bomb-making materials as were used in the London bombings at the last known residence of Lewthwaite in Mombasa. Among the seized items police presented to reporters were firearms, munitions and chemicals including hydrogen peroxide. 'Bomb-making materials' The court in Mombasa heard Tuesday that British counterterror officers who flew in to monitor proceedings had brought with them a large volume of evidence prepared by the counterterrorism team of London's Metropolitan Police. Grant's defense team asked the court to give them more time to study the evidence, which was provided to them that day, saying they would need to consult technical experts. Lawyer Chacha Mwita also objected to the court hearing the testimony of three Metropolitan Police officers before the defense team has time to study the reports. Warda Breik, believed to be Grant's Kenyan wife, is also charged in the case. She arrived in court Tuesday flanked by close family members, including her mother. The July 7, 2005, bombings targeting London's public transit network killed 52 people and the four bombers. London bomb survivor says humanity can beat despair .

chatgpt: Kenyan police believe that UK terror suspect Jermaine Grant may have had links to one of the 7/7 bombers, according to a report from British authorities. The report suggests that Grant, who is currently standing trial in Kenya for plotting an attack on Mombasa, had known Jermaine Lindsay, one of the attackers responsible for the 7/7 bombings in London. Grant and Lindsay had served time together in jail, where they allegedly became friends. The new report suggests that the two may have discussed potential terror attacks during their time together. This discovery has led authorities to believe that the two may have been plotting an attack in Kenya, alongside Lindsay's widow, Samantha Lewthwaite. Lewthwaite, also known as the "White Widow," has been on the run since 2011 and is considered one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. She is believed to be connected to a number of terror plots in East Africa and is thought to have been involved in the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi in 2013. The report suggests that Grant and Lewthwaite were working together to plan an attack on a hotel in Mombasa. Grant, a British national, has been arrested multiple times in Kenya on terror-related charges. He was first arrested in 2011 and accused of being in possession of explosives. He was later arrested again in 2012 and accused of planning an attack on a hotel in Mombasa. Grant was also accused of working with Lewthwaite on this plot. The case against Grant has been ongoing for several years, with prosecutors making repeated attempts to convict him. However, their case has been hindered by a lack of concrete evidence linking Grant to any terror plot. The new report may change this, giving prosecutors a new avenue to pursue. The discovery of a possible link between Grant and one of the 7/7 bombers is likely to raise concerns about the extent of networks linking terror groups across the world. It also underscores the ongoing threat posed by individuals with extremist ideologies, who are able to move across borders and support one another in planning and executing attacks. Kenyan authorities continue to work with their British counterparts to investigate the possible links between Grant and Lindsay. The trial against Grant is ongoing and is likely to continue for some time, as the authorities attempt to gather further evidence to support their case. With the ongoing threat of terrorism in East Africa and around the world, it is clear that security services must remain vigilant and work together to prevent any future attacks. The discovery of a link between Grant and the 7/7 bombers underlines the importance of international cooperation in this effort.
