chatgpt: The BMW Championship was dealt a blow today as Keegan Bradley, former US PGA Champion, withdrew from the event. Bradley's decision came after he dropped his ball when it became embedded in its own pitch during the event. Bradley, 28, was unsure if he had handled the situation correctly, and decided to call it quits instead of risk any further penalties. The incident occurred on the 10th hole at the Olympia Fields Country Club, where Bradley had been competing since the tournament began on Thursday. In an interview after his withdrawal, Bradley explained that he preferred to withdraw instead of risking a penalty. He acknowledged that his unfamiliarity with the rules surrounding embedded balls may have played a role in his decision. "I just wasn't sure if I had handled the situation correctly," Bradley said. "It's a shame to have to withdraw, but I didn't want to risk it." Bradley's withdrawal is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the American golfer. After winning the US PGA Championship in 2011, Bradley has struggled to maintain his form, and has been out of the top 30 in the world rankings for some time. Despite this setback, Bradley is still considered one of the best golfers in the world, and his presence was sorely missed at the BMW Championship. Industry insiders are hoping that the golfer can bounce back from this setback and re-discover his form in time for the next big event on the calendar. The BMW Championship continues, with a host of top golfers competing for the top prize. While Bradley's withdrawal is a disappointment, organisers have ensured that the event remains as exciting as ever, with a host of notable performances from players around the world. With the final days of the tournament still to come, golf fans can expect plenty of action and excitement.
