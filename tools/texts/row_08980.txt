chatgpt: Former "Mr. Selfridge" actress Amanda Abbington, 41, has been declared insolvent in the High Court in London. The actress, who is best known for her role as Mary Morstan in the hit BBC show "Sherlock," is said to owe £120,000 to creditors. Abbington has revealed that she had to borrow money from friends and family to pay her bills, and that she had struggled to make ends meet since splitting with her partner and "Sherlock" co-star Martin Freeman in 2016. The couple, who were together for 16 years and have two children together, also share a £900,000 home in Hertfordshire. The home is said to be in Mr. Freeman's name, and Abbington is reportedly relying on him to help her sort out her financial issues. According to court documents, Abbington's insolvency was caused by a combination of factors, including a lack of work in the acting industry and the cost of raising her children. Since "Mr. Selfridge" ended in 2016, Abbington has struggled to find steady work in the industry. She has had small roles in various TV shows and films, but nothing that has brought in a significant income. Abbington's financial struggles have been compounded by the fact that she has been the primary caregiver for her two children. This has made it difficult for her to take work that requires her to be away from home for long periods of time, and has limited her options for earning a steady income. Despite these challenges, Abbington says she is determined to get back on her feet. "I'm not giving up," she said in a recent interview. "I'm still fighting, and I'm still looking for work. I've had some setbacks, but I'm not going to let them defeat me." Abbington's struggle highlights the challenges faced by many actors in the industry, who often struggle to find regular work and make a living wage. It also sheds light on the difficulties faced by single parents, who must balance the demands of raising children with the need to earn a living. As for her future plans, Abbington says she is focused on finding work and getting her finances back on track so that she can provide for her children. She is also working to raise awareness of the challenges faced by actors and single parents in the industry, and to advocate for better support and resources for those who are struggling financially.
