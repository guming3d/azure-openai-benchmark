article: (CNN)  -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report. The Texas Transportation Institute reports commute times saw a small dip in 2007. Rising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation's largest university-based transportation research facility. "It's temporary, but real," said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. "As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There's fewer people going to work." The institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007. The organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by "every measure, congestion has increased substantially" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007. Researchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline. Congestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a "rare break in near-constant growth," the report said. Because the changes were nominal, some people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said. "Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice," Fette said. Among the report's other findings: . • American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler. • The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That's more than $750 per person. •  The amount of wasted fuel from sitting idle with the motor running topped 2.8 billion gallons or three weeks' worth of gas for every traveler. Congestion has slowed but, said the report's authors, that means only that things are getting worse slower, "hardly a positive goal statement." The Urban Mobility Report data base includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- Northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s. In every case, when the economy rebounded, so did the congestion problem, the report said. That means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up. Americans might then have fatter pocketbooks, but they'll go back to staring through their windshields a bit longer. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.

chatgpt: According to the latest report from the Texas Transportation Institute, the number of hours spent in traffic by commuters decreased in 2007, leading to less wasted fuel on the country's roads. The research indicates that the slowdown in the U.S. economy played a critical role in reducing congestion in metropolitan regions across the nation. However, despite the positive news, the Institute's data highlights that workers still lost an entire week's worth of job time stuck in traffic. The Institute's report states that the average commuter spent 36.1 hours in traffic jams in 2007, down from 36.6 in 2006. The research indicates that the reduction in traffic was due to job losses across the nation, which led to reduced traffic volumes. The Institute's report states that those workers who did make it to their jobs found it easier to commute than they did in the past, especially in larger metropolitan areas. One significant factor that contributed to the decline in traffic volume was the rise in fuel prices. As gas prices reached record highs, many drivers were forced to stop using their cars as much as they did in the past. The Institute determined that this led to a significant decrease in fuel consumption, which had a positive impact on the environment. Many experts believe that the decline in traffic congestion could also be attributed to the adoption of flexible work schedules and telecommuting. As more employers offer their workers the option to work from home, the number of cars on the road declines. However, despite these positive developments, commuters continue to suffer from lost work time due to traffic congestion. According to the Institute's report, the average commuter lost over one full work week (39 hours) sitting in traffic in 2007. The study's findings have been met with mixed reactions among U.S. drivers. Some believe that the slowdown in the economy led to too many job losses and other hardships, making it difficult for people to provide for their families. Others, however, see the reduction in traffic congestion as a welcome development that could potentially save money on fuel and reduce their environmental impact. Despite the positive trends in 2007, transportation experts caution that the roadway network remains overwhelmed and will continue to hinder the economic and environmental goals of the nation unless significant investments are made. In conclusion, the Texas Transportation Institute's report indicates that the U.S. experienced a decline in traffic congestion in 2007, leading to less wasted fuel and time by commuters across the nation. However, the study also highlights worrying trends that suggest that Americans continue to lose an entire week's worth of working time due to traffic. These data underscore the importance of continued investment in transportation infrastructure to reduce the burden of road congestion on American drivers.
