'We never compromise on taste,' Leslie Mohr, the company’s nutrition, health and wellness manager, said in a statement about the changes, which will affect more than 250 products, including Nestle Crunch, Butterfinger and Baby Ruth.

For example, the Red 40 and Yellow 5 additives used to make the crispy golden center of Nestle's Butterfinger bars will eventually be replaced with annatto, which comes from the seeds of achiote trees.
