Britain's most senior family judge was yesterday asked to annul 180 divorces granted to Italian couples after they were exposed as being fraudulent. Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, heard that couples from the devoutly Roman Catholic country had assumed fake residencies in the UK to avoid the lengthy and often costly Italian divorce process. The scam was exposed when court officials realised that, in 179 of the cases, one of the divorcing parties had given the same home address in High Street, Maidenhead, Berkshire, which was not a residential property, but a post office box, the High Court was told. Quickie split: Italian couples have been found to go abroad to divorce to avoid the lengthy and expensive process in their home countries . The petitioner in the 180th case gave an address in Epsom, Surrey. All the spouses being divorced claimed to live in Italy. Simon Murray, for the Queen’s Proctor – the lawyer whose job is to protect the integrity of the divorce process – is asking Sir James to overturn the decrees nisi and decrees absolute that have been granted in all 180 cases. Couples wishing to get divorced in Italy face a mandatory three-year legal separation period, but they can avoid this by taking advantage of European Union legislation that recognises divorces granted in any member state. After obtaining foreign residency, they can in many countries file for divorce after six months. Romania, in particular, has reportedly become a destination of choice for Italian divorce tourists. But it is illegal to use a bogus residency for these purposes. Until lies do us part: The scam was exposed when officials notices that in 179 of the cases, one of the divorcing parties had the same Berkshire address. Mr Murray said: ‘Italian couples were charged some 4,000 euros in each case for a fast-track divorce, with a post office box in Maidenhead being used to establish residency. It seems that this was a fraud. The decrees should be rescinded. ‘It is a requirement of the law of England and Wales that a person seeking a divorce in the English and Welsh courts has been habitually resident in England for a period of at least one year immediately before issuing a petition of divorce, or that the respondent was habitually resident within the jurisdiction. ‘The English and Welsh courts have no jurisdiction to consider divorce applications by parties who are both resident abroad.’ Mr Murray said that, of the 180 couples, all but two said they would not oppose their divorces being rescinded. He added that a representative of the Italian government was in court to observe proceedings, along with Thames Valley Police officers. The hearing continues.

chatgpt: In a shocking revelation recently made by the Italian authorities, it has come to light that as many as 180 couples in the country have obtained a divorce through fraudulent means. The couples in question had faked their residency in order to avoid the costly divorce procedures that would have been applicable had they been genuine Italian residents. According to reports, the fraudulent couples had created false documents to show that they were residents of countries other than Italy, and then applied for a divorce in that country. The Italian authorities have now uncovered the fraud and have retroactively invalidated the divorces granted to these couples. The authorities have been able to identify the fraudulent cases by conducting thorough investigations into the individual divorce cases. They found extensive evidence of fraud in these cases, including false documentation and falsified residency records. The Italian authorities have taken a strong stance against the fraudulent couples, stating that they will not tolerate any cheating of the country's legal system. The couples involved may also face legal action for committing fraud and perjury. This revelation has come as a shock to many Italians, who view the sanctity of marriage as an important social institution. The Italian divorce process is known for being complicated and expensive, leading many couples to avoid it altogether. However, the use of fraudulent means to obtain a divorce is considered a serious offense in the country. This is not the first time that fraud has been uncovered in the Italian divorce process. In 2017, a similar case involving fake residency records was uncovered, leading to the nullification of dozens of divorce cases. The Italian authorities have since tightened their procedures for verifying the residency of divorce applicants. The fraudulent divorces have also raised concerns about the need for greater transparency and stricter regulations in the Italian divorce process. Many experts have called for further measures to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure that the country's legal system is not manipulated. It remains to be seen what further actions the Italian authorities will take to address this issue. However, the exposure of the fraudulent divorces is a clear indication of the government's commitment to upholding the integrity of the country's legal system. In conclusion, the recent revelation of 180 fraudulent divorces in Italy has caused outrage among many Italians. The use of fake residency records to avoid costly legal proceedings is viewed as a serious offense and may carry legal consequences for those involved. The authorities have taken a strong stance on the matter, and further measures may be implemented to prevent such activities in the future.
