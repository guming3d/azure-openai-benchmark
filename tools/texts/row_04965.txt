article: By . Michael Gadd for MailOnline . Tim Howard already has Champions League ambitions for Everton and says the club should aim for no less than silverware as they prepare for a return to the Europa League under Roberto Martinez. The Toffees' fifth place finish with a record 72 points earned the side automatic passage into European club football's second tier and after Friday's draw, a place in group H with Lille, Wolfsburg and Krasnodar. Now the US keeper, lauded as a hero in his home country after the World Cup in Brazil, says his club side has no choice but to be ambitious. Ambitious: Tim Howard says Everton should be aiming for silverware and the Champions League, no less . Well-rounded: Howard holds the Nike Ordem ball, the brand's most innovative, technologically advanced and aerodynamically tuned ball to date . 'We're in Europe again, so that will be good to have those big nights at Goodison but I think ultimately, at the end of the season we have to be lifting a trophy, I think that's important,' Howard said during a photo shoot with Nike's Ordem ball. 'Which one that is, it's difficult to say in August, but certainly that's the aim and the focus and we have a big enough squad to cope with the demands of Europe, different cup competitions and most importantly the Premier League.' Everton has opened the Premier League season with two disappointing 2-2 draws against promoted Leicester and Arsenal, who ended last season one place ahead of them. In both matches Howard's side were 2-1 up going into the closing moments only 80th and 90th-minute equalisers turning three points into one. Still, Howard is certain he is the last line of defence for a stronger side than the one which impressed many last year. Romelu Lukaku, on loan from Chelsea at Goodison last year, is now a permanent fixture while the arrival of Samuel Eto'o also from the west London giants adds even more quality in the final third. Late blow: Oliver Giroud heads the 90th-minute equaliser past Howard for Everton's second 2-2 draw of 2014 . Howard continues: 'Outside of that, we want to get into the Champions League - we think that we can do that, we were just short of that last year but again as I said we're stronger this season so we feel like we can do it.' First they need to turn draws into wins though and their next hurdle could hardly be tougher as they host Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday. If fit, Eto'o could debut immediately against his old club while Lukaku is also in some doubt with injury.

chatgpt: Everton's goalkeeper, Tim Howard, has set his sights high for the upcoming season as he hopes his team can lift a trophy by the end of it. The Toffees will be playing in their first ever Europa League campaign under the guidance of Roberto Martinez. They will be competing in Group H, against Lille, Wolfsburg, and Krasnodar. Despite facing strong competition in the group stage, Howard is determined to lead his team to success. Speaking to the press, he stated that Everton's target must be next year's Champions League.  "We have a very strong squad, and we're ready to compete at the highest level," said Howard. "Our aim is to win a trophy this season, and that would be a huge accomplishment for everyone at the club. But we also have to keep in mind the bigger picture, which is to qualify for the Champions League next year." Everton will have their work cut out for them, as they will have to balance their domestic and European campaigns. However, Howard believes that the team has what it takes to succeed on both fronts. "We know that playing in Europe can be challenging, but we're up for the task. We have a great manager who has experience in this competition, and he knows how to navigate through it. Our squad is also deep enough to handle the extra fixtures, so I have no doubt that we'll be able to give it our all." The Toffees will kick off their Europa League campaign against Wolfsburg, where they will be looking to make a strong start. A win in the opening game would give them the confidence they need to go on and achieve their targets for the season. "This first game is crucial for us, as it sets the tone for the rest of the campaign," Howard explained. "We need to come out strong and show Wolfsburg what we're capable of. If we can get a positive result, then that will give us the momentum we need to keep pushing forward." With the likes of Romelu Lukaku, Ross Barkley, and Leighton Baines in their squad, Everton certainly have the firepower to compete on all fronts. If they can maintain their focus and determination throughout the season, they could well be in with a chance of achieving their lofty goals. The Europa League has long been considered a stepping stone to the Champions League, and Howard is hoping that Everton can use this as a platform to achieve their ambitions. "We know that qualifying for the Champions League won't be easy, but we're ready to give it our all. We have the talent, the desire, and the belief to make it happen. We just need to take it one game at a time and keep working hard." The Toffees will have their work cut out for them, but with Howard leading the charge, they will certainly be a force to be reckoned with. It remains to be seen whether they can achieve their targets, but one thing is for sure – they will be giving it their all along the way.
