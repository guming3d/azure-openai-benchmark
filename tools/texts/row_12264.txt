article: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An explosion outside the home of Afghanistan's former vice president killed at least eight people Tuesday, government officials have said. The explosion was near the Kabul residence of former vice-president Ahmad Zia Massoud, Afghan President Hamid Karzai told reporters. Massoud was not harmed in the attack. Among those killed were one of Massoud's guards and an assistant, the former vice president's aide said. Forty others were wounded in the blast. The explosion broke windows in a hotel a few blocks away. Tuesday morning's explosion occurred as the Afghan president was at a nearby anti-corruption convention. Karzai issued a statement condemning the attack, calling it inhumane and cowardly. The president called for a full scale investigation. Massoud is a notable figure in Afghan politics. Not only was he a vice president of the county under Karzai, but his brother the late Ahmed Shah Massoud was heralded as a leader in the fight against the Taliban. Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the Northern Alliance, the Taliban's main opposition, was killed September 9, 2001, by a bomb inside a video camera during an interview at his headquarters with Tunisian al Qaeda operatives posing as journalists. Meanwhile the International Committee of the Red Cross visited three Afghan security forces being held captive by the Taliban for the first time, the agency said Tuesday. The two visits occurred in late November in Badghis province in northwestern Afghanistan, the agency said. "This is the first time since the beginning of the current conflict that the ICRC has visited people detained by the armed opposition," said Reto Stocker, head of the ICRC's delegation in Kabul. "We plan to conduct and repeat visits in other regions, and hope to visit people held by other armed opposition groups, with the aim of ensuring that everyone detained in relation to the armed conflict is treated humanely." The ICRC says it regularly visits detained people in conflict zones to assess their conditions and treatment. The agency say it currently currently visits 136 places of detention in Afghanistan. -- CNN's Tim Schwarz and Fred Pleitgen contributed to this report .

chatgpt: A deadly explosion rocked northern Afghanistan on Monday, killing at least two people, one of whom was a guard of former Afghan Vice President Ahmad Zia Massoud, according to local authorities. The blast occurred just as Afghan President Hamid Karzai was attending an anti-corruption convention nearby, causing chaos and panic at the scene. However, the former Vice President Massoud was not harmed in the attack. It is still unclear who was behind the attack, but the Taliban has been known to carry out similar attacks in the past. An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the explosion. Meanwhile, news reports have emerged that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited three hostages of the Taliban in November. The organization confirmed the reports, stating that it had visited the captives to assess their wellbeing and deliver messages to their families. The ICRC has been working tirelessly to secure the release of hostages held by armed groups in Afghanistan, and this visit marks a significant development in their efforts. The identities of the hostages have not been revealed, but they are believed to be civilians who were kidnapped by the Taliban in different parts of the country. The Taliban has been known to kidnap civilians and government officials alike, using them as bargaining chips in negotiations with the government. The group has also carried out numerous attacks on civilians and government targets in recent years, as it seeks to regain power in the country. Afghanistan has been experiencing a surge in violence in recent weeks, as the Taliban continues to carry out attacks despite ongoing peace talks with the government. The talks, which began in September, have made little progress so far, with both sides accusing each other of stalling the negotiations. The violence has caused concern among Afghans, who fear a return to the brutal regime of the Taliban, which ruled the country from 1996 to 2001. The international community has also voiced its concern, with many countries urging the warring parties to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In the meantime, authorities in Afghanistan are working to maintain security and stability in the country, despite the constant threat of attacks from the Taliban and other armed groups. The investigation into the latest explosion is ongoing, and more information is expected to come to light in the coming days.
