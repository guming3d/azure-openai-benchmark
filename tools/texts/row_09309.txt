He's famous for his wit and dry sense of humour - and he clearly hasn't lost any of it. The 91-year-old Duke of Edinburgh left a policeman chuckling yesterday as he walked to church in Sandringham, Norfolk. No-one was near enough to hear what he said, but Prince Philip appeared to be back to his playful best after having suffered bout of illness last year. The Duke braved the wind and rain to walk 400 yards to St Mary Magdalene church from Sandringham House with an equerry while the Queen, 86, went by car. Playful: The Duke of Edinburgh attended a Sunday morning church service at Sandringham Church, Norfolk, yesterday and walked past this policeman . She decided to break with Royal tradition by extending her winter break, it was revealed yesterday. The monarch normally returns to London every year within a day or so of Ascension Day on February 6, the anniversary of her taking over the throne on the death of her father. But this year the Queen has decided to continue her stay on her 20,000-acre estate in north Norfolk for a few more days. The Queen, who was wearing a white coat and accompanied by a lady in waiting, was cheered by a crowd of around 50 well-wishers as she arrived in her state Bentley. She collected flowers from around half a dozen children after the 40 minute service. An onlooker said: 'It was a real surprise to see the Queen. Normally she returns to London alone and leaves Prince Philip at Sandringham so he can continue to enjoy the shooting up here.

It is unusual because she is normally a stickler for routine.' While the pheasant shooting season ends on February 1, the prince still enjoys going out shooting hares with his friends. It is believed that he went out on a hare shoot on Saturday. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: 'There is no particular reason for the Queen choosing to stay up at Sandringham. 'She has had some engagements in Norfolk. It is just the way the diary has fallen. She is back with a full programme of events this week.' The Queen normally spends Ascension Day quietly at Sandringham where her father King George VI died in 1952.

chatgpt: Prince Philip Appears in Good Spirits After Illness, Queen Breaks Royal Tradition with Winter Break Extension Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, appeared to be in high spirits following a bout of illness last year as he joined Queen Elizabeth II for their annual winter break at Sandringham. The couple, who have been married for over 70 years, were spotted taking a stroll around the estate and chatting with staff and members of the public. Last year, the Duke was admitted to hospital for a hip replacement surgery, which forced him to miss several public appearances. However, he was back to his playful self during the recent break, cracking jokes with Prince Charles and other members of the Royal family. The Queen, meanwhile, has decided to extend her winter break, breaking with Royal tradition. Typically, Her Majesty stays at Sandringham from mid-December until early February, but this year, she will remain there until February 6. This means that she will miss the annual Commonwealth Day service in London, which falls on March 9. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said that the Queen's decision to extend her break was due to "her feeling in need of a longer period of rest and recuperation." They also confirmed that a reduced programme of engagements would be arranged for Her Majesty in the coming months. The decision to break with tradition has sparked a debate among Royal watchers, with some suggesting that it is a sign that the Queen is slowing down and preparing to step back from her public duties. However, others believe that it is simply a reflection of her changing needs as she approaches her 94th birthday in April. Regardless of the reason behind the extension, the Queen's decision is likely to have implications for members of the Royal family who will have to take on additional duties in her absence. Prince Charles, who is next in line for the throne, is expected to step up his public engagements, while other members of the family, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, are also likely to take on more responsibilities. The news comes just weeks after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced that they would be stepping back as senior members of the Royal family and working to become financially independent. The couple's decision has shaken the institution of the monarchy, and many are still wondering what the long-term implications will be. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Royal family, it is clear that Prince Philip and the Queen are still going strong. Their recent appearance at Sandringham was a reminder of the enduring nature of their relationship, and a testament to their commitment to the institution of the monarchy. As the Queen prepares to celebrate her 94th birthday this April, it is clear that there are changes on the horizon for the Royal family. However, one thing remains constant: the love and respect that the Duke and Queen have for each other, and for the institution that they have dedicated their lives to serving.
