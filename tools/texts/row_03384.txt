Albinism is a genetic condition, which affects the production of melanin affecting the skin, hair and eyes. The lack of pigment in the iris causes sufferers to often have red or grey coloured eyes, but also affects the retina leading to vision problems. It is thought that the condition affects 1 in 17,000 people in the US.

chatgpt: Louise, a baby girl, was born with albinism, a condition that negatively impacted her vision. Due to the impairment, the sweet little girl had never been able to clearly see her mother's face. But thanks to modern technology, Louise was given the gift of sight through her own pair of glasses. The moment Louise received her glasses was captured on camera, and it was truly heartwarming. The video shows her looking on in amazement as she recognizes her mother for the first time. It's a beautiful moment that has touched the hearts of many around the world. Albinism is a genetic disorder that affects people of all races and ethnicities, but it's particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa. It occurs when the body is unable to produce enough melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin, hair and eyes. Individuals with albinism often have vision problems, including nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), photophobia (sensitivity to light), and strabismus (eye misalignment). However, as in the case of Louise, proper eyewear can remedy many of these problems. According to the National Institutes of Health, people with albinism may benefit from wearing prescription lenses or corrective glasses to improve visual acuity, reduce glare, and correct any eye misalignments. For Louise, her new glasses have given her the ability to see her mother's face and the world around her. It's a small but significant moment that has brought joy to her family, friends, and followers around the world. The video of Louise's first time seeing her mother has gone viral, with thousands of people commenting on how touching it is to witness such a beautiful moment. In a world where there is so much negativity and sadness, it's heartening to see a little girl's life changed for the better. Louise's newfound sight is a reminder of the power of modern medicine and the importance of access to healthcare. It's also a reminder of the importance of kindness, compassion, and community. As for Louise, her future is bright, thanks to the miracle of modern technology. With her new glasses, she can now see the world in all its beauty and wonder, and for that, we can all be grateful.
