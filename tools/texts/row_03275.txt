article: Douglas Engelbart, whose invention of the mouse transformed the way people interact with computers, has died. Engelbart died Tuesday night at his home in Atherton, California, SRI International -- the research institute where he once worked -- said in a statement. He was 88. "Doug's legacy is immense â€” anyone in the world who uses a mouse or enjoys the productive benefits of a personal computer is indebted to him," Curtis R. Carlson, SRI's president and CEO, said in a written statement. Decades ago, Engelbart came up with the idea we now know as a mouse. His first prototype, which featured a carved out wooden block, wheels and a tiny red button, looks quite different from the sleek plastic designs now seen in homes and offices around the world. A radar technician during World War II, Engelbart worked at the Stanford Research Institute during the 1960s. It was there that a vision of people sitting in front of a video screen, interacting with a computer, came to him. "I knew enough engineering and had enough experience as a radar person to know that if a computer can punch cards or print paper, it can draw anything you want on a screen," he told CNN in 1997 after receiving a $500,000 prize for American innovation. Engelbart invented and patented what he called the "x-y position indicator," receiving a $10,000 check for the invention. He told CNN he couldn't recall who on his team had decided to call it a mouse. At the time, it wasn't easy to convince fellow scientists to follow his vision, Engelbart said. But he persisted. Later, he went on to found the Doug Engelbart Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to boosting the collective ability to solve complex, urgent problems on a global scale. "Sometimes I reflect on how naive somebody has to be in order to get visions -- and plug away at them -- that ultimately proceed, and how many other people with visions that are as naive just fall off the cliff," Engelbart told CNN in 1997. In addition to the computer mouse, Engelbart's work at SRI from 1957 to 1977 helped develop tech innovations such as display editing, online processing, linking and in-file object addressing, use of multiple windows, hypermedia, and context-sensitive help, the institute said. "Doug was a giant who made the world a much better place and who deeply touched those of us who knew him," Carlson said. "SRI was very privileged and honored to have him as one of our 'family.' He brought tremendous value to society. We will miss his genius, warmth and charm." Engelbart is survived by his wife and four children. People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .

chatgpt: On Tuesday night, Douglas Engelbart, known for inventing the computer mouse, passed away at his home in California at the age of 88. Engelbart's revolutionary invention in 1963 led to a pivotal shift in the development of personal computing and enabled a new era of user-friendly interaction with machines. Engelbart began his research at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park, where he and his team worked on a range of computing innovations. Among his achievements, Engelbart helped develop the use of graphical user interfaces, hypertext and, of course, the computer mouse. According to SRI International, Engelbart's passing is a great loss to the scientific community. "Anyone in the world who uses a mouse or enjoys the productive benefits of a personal computer is indebted to him," said Curtis R. Carlson, the CEO of SRI International. The computer mouse was first demonstrated publicly in 1968, during the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. Engelbart used a wooden shell to demonstrate his invention, rolling it across a table while a cursor moved across a screen. It was a simple demonstration in principle, but the technology behind it would change the way people use computers forever. Engelbart's work did not stop with the computer mouse, however. He also sought to make computing more accessible to all people, regardless of their background, by developing technologies such as email, video conferencing, and collaborative document editing. Many of the ideas he pioneered during his career would later become standard features in modern software and digital tools. Even with all of his contributions to computing, Engelbart often kept a low profile throughout his life, preferring to focus on his research and innovation rather than personal recognition. However, the impact of his work cannot be understated. Today, the computer mouse is a ubiquitous technology used by millions of people around the world, and Engelbart's legacy lives on. Despite his passing, Engelbart's work will no doubt continue to inspire future generations of inventors and scientists. As a visionary who helped shape the course of computing history, Engelbart's contributions have left an indelible mark on the world, and his memory will be honored by all those who use his inventions, now and in the future.
