article: (CNN) -- Longtime men's college basketball coach Rick Majerus, who led Utah to the NCAA final in 1998, died Saturday from heart problems. He was 64. Majerus recently left Saint Louis University, where he had coached for the past five years, for health reasons. "Nobody loved basketball and teaching kids more that Rick," Billikens interim head coach Jim Crews said in a statement. "His passion for the game and the coaching profession was unparalleled. Rick was a true friend and was always there when needed. I, along with so many others, am going to miss him." Majerus had ongoing health problems for years, dating back to his days as Utah's coach. Saint Louis director of athletics Chris May said the Billikens team was informed Saturday afternoon that Majerus' condition was deteriorating. The school announced November 19 that Majerus would not return to coach because of his heart condition. In 25 years, Majerus coached at four schools, taking 12 teams to the NCAA tournament. He had just one losing season. His record was 517-216, which included two 30-win seasons and 15 20-win seasons. Majerus got his start at Marquette as an assistant to Al McGuire. He was at Marquette from 1983 to 1986 and then at Ball State from 1987 to 1989. The apex of Majerus' career came at Utah, where he went 323-95 from 1989 to 2004. In 1998, he led the Utes to the NCAA championship game, losing to Kentucky. Three of Majerus' players at Utah were NBA draft picks -- including Keith Van Horn as the No. 2 overall pick in 1997. "Rick left a lasting legacy at the University of Utah, not only for his incredible success and the national prominence he brought to our basketball program, but also for the tremendous impact he made on the young men who were fortunate enough to play on his teams," Utah Director of Athletics Chris Hill said in a statement. "His standard of excellence extended beyond the basketball court and into the academic and personal success of his players. He will be deeply missed and we grieve for his family and all of his friends." During Majerus' final stop, at Saint Louis, the Billikens went 95-69 under his tenure. Last season, Majerus led Saint Louis to the round of 32 in the NCAA tournament. It was the program's first NCAA tournament win since 1998. "Coach Majerus put his heart and soul into the Billiken program, and for that we will be eternally grateful," May said in a statement. "What I will remember most about Rick's tenure at SLU was his enduring passion to see his players excel both on and off the court. Wins and losses meant a lot to him, but no more than to see our student-athletes succeed in the classroom. He truly embraced the term 'student-athlete,' and I think that will be his lasting legacy."

chatgpt: The basketball world is mourning the loss of coaching legend Rick Majerus, who passed away at the age of 64. Majerus was known for his deep love of the game and a dedication to teaching children that went unmatched in his profession. "Nobody loved basketball and teaching kids more than Rick," said a Saint Louis coach who had the honor of working alongside Majerus. "He was a true mentor to so many young players and he will be deeply missed." Majerus was highly regarded in the basketball community for his impressive 25-year coaching career, during which he had just one losing season. He coached for several programs including Marquette, Utah, Ball State, and Saint Louis University, where he spent his final five seasons. At Utah, Majerus compiled an incredible 323-95 record from 1989 to 2004, cementing his legacy as one of the all-time greats. But it was not just his success on the court that made him an exceptional coach. Majerus was known for emphasizing the importance of success in the classroom as well. He believed that his job as a coach was not just to create winning teams, but to help players prepare for success in all aspects of their lives. This philosophy was evidenced by his commitment to academic success. Majerus was a great advocate for his players, and would always make sure they were meeting academic requirements before focusing on basketball. He even went so far as to teach a remedial English course at Utah in order to help his players succeed in their studies. Majerus' dedication to his players was not just limited to their academic success, however. He was known for building deep, meaningful relationships with his players, often staying in touch with them long after their playing days had ended. His players universally spoke of him as a mentor and friend, someone who had a profound impact on their lives. Many of Majerus' former players and coaching colleagues expressed their grief and condolences upon news of his passing. Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, who played for Majerus at LSU in the 1980s, said "Coach Majerus was like a father figure to me. He believed in me when no one else did and I will always be grateful for that." While Majerus may be gone, his legacy in the basketball world will continue to live on. His impact on the game and on the lives of the players he coached is immeasurable, and the lessons he taught will continue to inspire generations of sportsmen and women for years to come.
