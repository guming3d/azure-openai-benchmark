Anna Palmer is one of three candidates vying for preselection in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven at next year's Queensland election.

Anna Palmer is one of three candidates vying for preselection in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven at next year's Queensland election . 'There's an independent committee of three people, of which I'm not a member, who'll decide who the candidate will be,' Mr Palmer told AAP. 'We've got two other candidates who are pretty good - she may be selected or she may not be.' But Mr Palmer could not immediately say who the other contenders were. He said he wouldn't have discussions with the other two candidates, because 'it would be a conflict of interest, as you could appreciate'. Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer says his wife will run as candidate in his party . But he said his wife vying for preselection wasn't a conflict of interest. 'She's entitled to do what she wants to,' he said. He also hit back at Dr Douglas' cronyism claims, saying the Queensland MP's own wife, Susie Douglas, ran for the party as a federal candidate in the seat of McPherson last year. 'Everyone that's a member of my family, who works for our company or is a member of the party is entitled individually to stand for what they want to,' he said. Mr Palmer said his wife decided to nominate for preselection because she had an interest in politics and was keen to see the party regain Gaven at the 2015 poll. The Palmer United Party (PUP) leader said she won't be favoured over other candidates and he won't have any say in his wife's political future . He said he was yet to decide whether PUP would run a candidate in Yeerongpilly against now-independent Carl Judge, who also quit the PUP earlier this month, leaving the party without a presence in state parliament. Mr Palmer said the party would run candidates in most Queensland seats. He said he'd already endorsed Ted Shepherd in Mudgeeraba, Steve Anderson in Maryborough and Jeremy Davies in Kawana. Dr Douglas said on Thursday that he doubted PUP would run any candidates at all. 'I think the opportunity to do so has come and gone,' he said. It is currently held by former PUP state leader Alex Douglas, who quit in August to become an independent, alleging a culture of 'jobs for the boys' within the party.

chatgpt: Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer has announced that his wife, Anna Palmer, will run as a candidate in the upcoming Queensland election. Anna is one of three candidates competing for preselection in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven. Clive Palmer is known for his business ventures and outspoken political views. He founded the Palmer United Party in 2013 and served as a member of parliament for the party until 2016. The party's popularity waned after this time, and it is now only represented in the Queensland parliament. Anna Palmer, a former journalist, has been involved in the Palmer United Party for several years. She has previously served as the party's Queensland secretary and has also worked as Clive Palmer's media advisor. If she is successful in obtaining preselection as the candidate for Gaven, it will be the first time she has run for political office. The announcement of Anna Palmer's candidacy follows the resignation of former Palmer United Party state leader Alex Douglas. Douglas, who had previously been a member of the Liberal National Party, joined the Palmer United Party in 2013. He was elected to the Queensland parliament representing the party, but resigned in 2014 citing concerns over Clive Palmer's leadership. In August of this year, Douglas again made headlines when he resigned from parliament altogether to become an independent. He cited concerns over the lack of democracy within the Palmer United Party and accusations of bullying and intimidation as his reasons for leaving. The resignation of Alex Douglas has impacted the Palmer United Party's popularity in Queensland. In the 2015 state election, the party won a significant proportion of the vote and was able to secure seats in the parliament. However, with the resignation of Douglas and other high-profile members, the party's future is uncertain. Anna Palmer's candidacy in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven will be seen as an attempt by the Palmer United Party to maintain its presence in the Queensland parliament. However, it remains to be seen whether her candidacy will be successful or whether the party will be able to regain the support it once enjoyed. The Queensland election is due to be held in October 2020, giving the Palmer United Party and its candidates some time to campaign and build support. However, with the party's recent troubles and the departure of key members, it will be a challenging task for the party to regain its previous levels of popularity. In conclusion, the announcement of Anna Palmer's candidacy in the upcoming Queensland election is a significant move for the Palmer United Party. However, it remains to be seen whether she will be successful in her bid for preselection and whether the party will be able to maintain its presence in the state parliament. The resignation of former state leader Alex Douglas has left the party weakened and uncertain about its future, and only time will tell whether it can regain the momentum it once had.
