Controversial: Incoming Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has already upset Israel with comments made in a television interview two days before his inauguration . Iran's president-elect has dashed hopes of a period of calm with Israel after he described the country as a 'wound' that needs to be removed from the Middle East. Hassan Rouhani made the contentious comments in a state-run television interview about the occupation of Palestinian land just days ahead of his inauguration as Iran's new leader. According to Iranian press reports, he said: 'The Zionist regime is a wound that has sat on the body of the Muslim world for years and needs to be removed.' The comments, made on Quds Day, an annual event held in Iran to support Palestinians and denounce Israel, were described as 'hostile' by Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu. He said: ‘The true face of Rouhani has been . revealed sooner than expected ... this is what the man thinks and this . is the Iranian regime’s plan of action. 'A nation that threatens to destroy the state of Israel must not be allowed to have weapons of mass destruction,' he said in a statement. The comments echo those made by outgoing president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who threatened Israel in his final speech as leader warning that a 'ferocious storm' would strike the nation. But Rouhani has been quick to distance himself from the comments, with officials claiming that 'unidentified news agencies' had distorted his remarks. The US and its allies suspect Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability. Tehran says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes, but Israel regards it as a threat to its existence and refuses to rule out military action. With the election of an apparently more pragmatic president, it had been hoped Western countries might see a better chance for diplomacy and strike a deal to curb Iran’s uranium enrichment programme and avoid any conflict. Hitting out: Mr Rouhani allegedly described Israel as a 'wound' that needs to be removed from the Middle East . Rouhani's predecessor Ahmadinejad also addressed Israel on Qods Day in his last speech as president. He said: 'You planted wind in our region and you will reap the storm. I swear to God that a ferocious storm is coming and it will uproot the Zionist entity.' Earlier, the ‘Supreme Leader of Iran’, Ayatollah Ali Khameni issued a fatwa against the minority Baha’i community  - calling on Iranians to avoid Baha’is and labelling them a ‘deviant and misleading sect’. The edict illustrates that despite Rouhani’s  promises to rule with moderation and ensure the rights of religious minorities, ultimate power in Iran rests with the Supreme Leader. Angry: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back at Mr Rouhani's comments .

chatgpt: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's recent comments in an interview on state television have caused ripples in the political circles of the Middle East, particularly in Israel. In the interview, Rouhani commented on Iran's relations with the West and expressed concerns about Israel's nuclear program. The Iranian president's remarks have angered Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a vocal critic of Iran's nuclear program for years. Netanyahu has condemned Rouhani's statement, saying that it shows Iran's true intentions and its desire to eliminate Israel. Netanyahu has a history of being a fierce critic of Iran's nuclear program, and he has repeatedly warned the international community about Iran's intentions. In his recent statement, Netanyahu said that Rouhani's comments were a clear indication that Iran poses a threat not only to Israel but to the entire world. Rouhani's predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had threatened Israel in his last speech, which did little to ease tensions between the two countries. However, Rouhani has since claimed that his comments were "distorted" by the press. Many experts believe that Rouhani's comments were a direct response to the recent tensions between Iran and the West, particularly the United States. Iran has been under significant pressure from the US since the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and imposed economic sanctions on the country. Rouhani's comments suggest that Iran is open to dialogue with the West but is concerned about Israel's nuclear program, which he believes is a significant threat to the region's stability. Rouhani has also called for an end to US sanctions, which he claims have been devastating for the Iranian people. Despite Rouhani's attempted clarification, Netanyahu's reaction highlights the ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel. The two countries have long been at odds, with Israel being a vocal critic of Iran's nuclear program and Iran being a supporter of Israel's enemies, particularly Hezbollah in Lebanon. The recent tensions between the US and Iran have only added to the uncertainty in the region, with both countries engaging in aggressive posturing. The US has sent additional troops to the region, citing concerns about Iran's alleged involvement in attacks on American assets in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Iran has shown no signs of backing down and has continued to pursue its nuclear program, following the US's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. The situation in the Middle East remains volatile, with tensions between Iran and Israel, as well as between Iran and the US, showing no signs of abating. Rouhani's recent comments have only added to the uncertainty, and it remains to be seen whether the two countries can find a way to ease tensions and prevent a potential conflict.
