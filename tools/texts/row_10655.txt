article: It seems that McDonald's has finally realized how tone-deaf its internal employee resource website was. It has shut it down. The final straw? A tip on the site to employees to avoid McDonald's fare. A graphic on the site shows a meal with a cheeseburger, fries and drink under the caption "Unhealthy choice." Next to it is a picture of a sub, a salad and water under the caption "Healthier choice." The latest embarrassment is among a string that's cropped up since the McResource Line website went live. A McResource budget-planning guide for its employees was ridiculed in July for being out of touch. "For starters, it didn't account for food and gasoline," CNNMoney reported. "The second line on the sample budget leaves room for income from a second job, which many called an admission by the fast food giant that its workers can't live on its wages alone." And then earlier this month, NBC News reported that the site offered a guide on how much one should tip a pool cleaner, housekeeper, and even an au pair. The only problem: The University of California Berkeley Labor Center and University of Illinois released a study in October that said 52% of families of fast food workers receive assistance from a public program like Medicaid, food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The fast food giant found itself again having to deflect unwanted attention from its internal site this week after CNBC reported that McResource ostensibly advises McDonald's employees to not eat at McDonald's. "Fast foods are quick, reasonably priced, and readily available alternatives to home cooking. While convenient and economical for a busy lifestyle, fast foods are typically high in calories, fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt and may put people at risk for becoming overweight." Visitors to McResource Line on Wednesday were greeted with this statement: "We are temporarily performing some maintenance in order to provide you with the best experience possible. Please excuse us while these upgrades are being made." McDonald's confirmed the site had been taken down in a statement posted on its website. "A combination of factors has led us to re-evaluate and we've directed the vendor to take down the website. Between links to irrelevant or outdated information, along with outside groups taking elements out of context, this created unwarranted scrutiny and inappropriate commentary. None of this helps our McDonald's team members." Bill Clinton and McDonald's: Let's forgo the fries and fight the fat .

chatgpt: McDonald's has once again found itself in hot water after its employee resource website, McResource Line, offered advice that fast food can be unhealthy. The controversial advice has since led the fast food giant to shut down the site for "maintenance". This is not the first time that McResource Line has come under fire for offering questionable advice. In July, the site's budget-planning guide was ridiculed for being out of touch with the realities of living on a minimum wage salary. The site has also advised employees on how much to tip a housekeeper or a pool cleaner, causing further controversy. Some critics argue that the company's advice on fast food being unhealthy is a bit rich coming from a business that sells fast food. However, McDonald's has long been aware of the health implications of its menu offerings and has made efforts to offer healthier options. In recent years, the company has introduced salads, grilled chicken sandwiches, and other lower-calorie options in response to public demand for healthier food choices. Despite these efforts, McDonald's has struggled to shake off its reputation as a purveyor of unhealthy fast food. The latest debacle with McResource Line will only add to the criticism of the company's practices. In response to the controversy, McDonald's released a statement, saying that the company remains committed to the well-being of its employees and their families. The statement went on to say that the site had been temporarily shut down for maintenance and would be back online soon with more helpful resources for employees. Many industry experts, however, feel that McDonald's needs to do more to address the underlying issues that led to the controversy in the first place. The fact that the company's employee resource site gave out questionable advice on fast food being unhealthy is indicative of deeper problems within the company's culture and policies. According to one industry analyst, the problem stems from McDonald's focus on profits at the expense of employee well-being. If the company wants to avoid similar controversies in the future, it needs to reorient its priorities and start investing more in its employees. Ultimately, the controversy around McResource Line highlights the challenges that McDonald's and other fast food chains face in balancing profits with public health concerns. As consumers continue to demand healthier food options, companies like McDonald's will need to adapt or risk falling behind their competitors. While the company has made some progress in this area, it still has a long way to go to convince the public that it truly takes their health and well-being seriously.
