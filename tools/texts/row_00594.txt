Platinum: Taylor Swift accepted the Dick Clarke Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards and made a plea for music to be 'consumed in albums' 'That music is valuable and music should be consumed in albums and albums should be consumed as art and appreciated,' she continued. The remarks were similar to those she made after pulling her three albums from Spotify earlier this month. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Swift had put Shake it Off, the lead single from her new album 1989, up for streaming as she tried to stay 'open minded' about changes in the music industry. 'It didn't feel right to me. I felt like I was saying to my fans, "If you create music someday, if you create a painting someday, someone can just walk into a museum, take it off the wall, rip off a corner off it, and it's theirs now and they don't have to pay for it."' The criticism was expanded upon by Aloe Blacc, who stated in Wired that the song 'Wake Me Up,' which he co-wrote and sang for Avicii, earned only $12,359 from Pandora, in spite being played 168 million times. Swift opened the festivities Sunday with a fiery performance of 'Blank Space' that echoed her lampooning of the 'crazy ex' theme from her recently released music video. Jilted: Swift also performed 'Blank Space,' creating an even more outsized parody of the 'crazy ex' cliche than the music video for the single . Who's crazy now?: Swift pulled her entire catalog from streaming service Spotify earlier in the month and also became the first - and only - artist to have an album certified platinum in 2014 . She was later presented with the Dick Clark Award for Excellence, in the same month she became the first artist to go platinum in 2014. She was given the award by Diana Ross, and said she was 'so honored' to share the stage with the acclaimed diva. About Clark, she praised him because 'he fought for music to be at the forefront of our minds and on our televisions as much as possible.'

chatgpt: Pop superstar Taylor Swift was recently honored with the prestigious Dick Clark Award for Excellence at the 2014 American Music Awards. The award recognized Swift's impressive achievements as a singer, songwriter, and overall entertainer.  Swift's album 1989, which was released in October of 2014, has also been a major success. It was the first and only album from 2014 to go platinum, an impressive feat given the challenges facing the music industry in recent years.  In her acceptance speech for the Dick Clark Award, Swift reflected on the importance of hard work and dedication in achieving success. "I'm so overwhelmed and grateful for this moment," she said. "To the fans who went out and bought over a million copies of my album in the first week, you have taught me so much about what it means to work hard and stay dedicated." Swift's comments about hard work and dedication echo her earlier statements about the challenges facing musicians in the digital age. In November of 2014, Swift made headlines when she pulled her entire catalog from the popular streaming service, Spotify.  The move was seen by many as a bold stance against the low royalty rates paid to musicians by streaming services. In an op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal, Swift wrote: "Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for." Swift's decision to pull her music from Spotify was not without controversy, with some critics arguing that it was a shortsighted move that would ultimately hurt her career. However, Swift remained steadfast in her belief that musicians should be fairly compensated for their work. Despite the controversy surrounding her decision to leave Spotify, 1989 has continued to be a major success. The album has spawned several hit singles, including "Shake It Off" and "Blank Space," and has solidified Swift's position as one of the most popular and successful artists of her generation. In her acceptance speech for the Dick Clark Award, Swift thanked her fans for their continued support throughout her career. "It's been an incredible year, and I'm so grateful for everything that's happened," she said. "To the fans who have been there for me since the beginning, thank you so much. You have made all of this possible."  As Swift looks ahead to the next chapter in her career, it is clear that hard work, dedication, and a commitment to her principles will continue to guide her path. And with 1989 already breaking records and winning awards, it seems that Swift's success is only just beginning.
