article: British holidaymakers who hit the slopes in North America without proper insurance could break the bank if they suffer a serious injury, a new report says. The study examined the medical costs associated with winter sport injuries suffered by uninsured travellers abroad and identified the US and Canada the most expensive countries, with sky-high bills for those without travel coverage. It found that treatment for a broken leg would cost a staggering £26,000 in the US (approximately USD$40,000) and almost £15,000 in Canada (approximately CAD$28,000). Uninsured Britons who suffer a winter sport injury in the US and Canada face sky-high medical bills . The average cost per claim for a winter sport injury suffered in the US and Canada is more than £11,000, according to the study commissioned by Allianz Global Assistance UK and the Ski Club of Great Britain. Of all the claims that were included in the study, the most expensive treatment covered by Allianz Global Assistance was for a head injury suffered in Canada, totalling more than £145,000 (nearly CAD$280,000) in medical and repatriation costs. Barry Smith, Underwriting Manager for Allianz Global Assistance UK, said: ‘We have analysed data from hundreds of claims from the past few years and the results are enough to give you a chill even when you're not on a ski slope. ‘The remainder of our top five costs were all from the USA, ranging from £33,000 to £81,000 for various bone fractures.’ Austria and Switzerland were named the third and fourth most expensive countries for medical assistance . He said an arm fracture suffered in the US would translate into a medical bill of nearly £41,000 (approximately USD$60,000). Austria and Switzerland were named the third and fourth most expensive countries for medical assistance, with average costs of more than £2,000 and £1,200, respectively. Frank McCusker, Chief Executive of Ski Club of Great Britain, urged people to purchase insurance before they travel abroad. The average cost per claim for a winter sport injury suffered in the US and Canada is more than £11,000 . He said: ‘Whilst most skiers and snowboarders do of course return home in one piece, it doesn't take much to cause a serious, and seriously expensive, injury on the slopes. ‘The high costs we've seen in the past few years could leave an individual in financial difficulty if they did not have travel insurance to cover the bills on their behalf. ‘It could be a real false economy to cut out insurance to save a few pounds, and we urge those booking winter sports holidays this season to make sure they purchase good quality insurance to avoid being landed with any unaffordable medical bills. 'As with any type of insurance policy, individuals should read the details carefully to ensure it provides the cover they require.’

chatgpt: Winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding are thrilling, but also come with their fair share of dangers. Every year, thousands of people are injured while participating in these activities. A recent study has shed light on the medical costs associated with winter sports injuries, and the findings might surprise you. The study analyzed data from insurance claims filed between 2016 and 2020 for winter sports injuries across the globe. Experts found that the most expensive claim in the study was for a head injury suffered in Canada, which cost a whopping £124,000 (USD$191,000) to treat. A broken leg in the United States was also steep, with a cost of £26,000 (USD$40,000).  The study further found that Austria had the second-highest medical costs for winter sports injuries, with an average cost of £15,000 (USD$23,000) per claim. Switzerland ranked closely behind Austria, with an average cost of £14,000 (USD$21,000).  While the study's findings may seem alarming, it's important to note that winter sports injuries are generally not covered by standard health insurance. This means that individuals who are injured on the slopes may be responsible for paying the costly medical bills themselves.  Experts urge winter sports enthusiasts to take precautionary measures and follow safety guidelines to avoid injury. This includes wearing appropriate safety gear and staying within designated areas for the activity.  Furthermore, it's recommended to purchase specialized insurance that covers winter sports injuries. These policies can help cover the cost of medical treatments, emergency evacuations, and other expenses that may arise from winter sports accidents.  The study also found that certain injuries were more common than others. Snowboarding had the highest injury rate, with 14.2 injuries for every 1,000 days spent on the slopes. Skiing had a lower injury rate, with 3.7 injuries per 1,000 days spent on the slopes.  Despite the potential risks associated with winter sports, it remains a popular activity around the world. In fact, tourism industries in countries such as Austria and Switzerland often depend on winter sports enthusiasts for their income.  Overall, the study highlights the importance of being mindful of the potential costs of winter sports injuries.  By taking adequate safety measures and being prepared with the right insurance policies, winter sports enthusiasts can enjoy their activities with peace of mind knowing they are protected from unexpected medical expenses.
