A Swiss firm has unveiled radical plans to launch a space shuttle from the top of an Airbus passenger jet. Swiss Space Systems says the system will be a far cheaper way to launch satellites - and says it can sell launches for £7m, around a quarter of the price currently charged. The firm claims its system, which could launch satellites weighing upto 250kg, could take to the air in 2017. Scroll down for video .

The system is likely to face competition from Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, which has announced plans for a version of its Galactic space system, called LauncherOne, that could also deliver satellites into orbit at low cost. It has produced a design that will be air-launched from Virgin Galactic’s carrier aircraft WhiteKnightTwo, the same mothership that will launch the company's SpaceShipTwo on suborbital passenger flights.

chatgpt: Swiss aerospace company S3 has announced an ambitious plan to launch satellites for a fraction of the current cost. The firm claims it can launch satellites for just £7m, which is less than a quarter of the current price. This could revolutionize the satellite industry and open up opportunities for businesses and organizations that previously couldn't afford to launch their own satellites. S3's technology involves launching an unmanned shuttle from the top of a modified Airbus A300 at 26,000 feet. This approach offers many advantages over traditional satellite launches. Firstly, it eliminates the need for a costly and complicated launch pad. Instead, the shuttle can be attached to the top of an existing aircraft and launched from there. This reduces costs and simplifies the launch process. Secondly, the shuttle doesn't need to carry the heavy fuel required for a full rocket launch. Instead, it can rely on the plane's engines to get it to the desired altitude before launching. This means the shuttle can be smaller and lighter, further reducing costs. S3 has already tested its technology in the lab and is now moving on to field tests. The first test launches are scheduled for 2017, and the company has plans for spaceports around the world. These spaceports will be used to launch satellites for commercial and government clients. One of the biggest advantages of S3's technology is its flexibility. The shuttle can be designed to carry a variety of payloads, from small communication satellites to larger Earth observation satellites. This means that businesses and organizations of all sizes can benefit from low-cost satellite launches. S3's CEO, Pascal Jaussi, is optimistic about the company's future. He believes that S3's technology will change the satellite industry forever. "Our goal is to make space accessible to everyone," he says. "We believe that by reducing the cost of satellite launches, we can open up a whole new world of possibilities." While S3's technology is still in the early stages of development, it has already attracted interest from investors and clients. The company raised £1.5m in seed funding earlier this year and has already signed contracts with several clients. The satellite industry has traditionally been dominated by a few large players, and prices have remained high as a result. However, with S3's technology, smaller companies and organizations now have the opportunity to enter the market. The potential applications of low-cost satellite launches are vast. They could be used for everything from monitoring climate change to providing internet access to remote areas. S3's technology could also have military applications, such as providing reconnaissance or surveillance capabilities. S3's low-cost satellite launches are just the latest example of how innovation and technological advances are disrupting traditional industries. As new companies emerge with new ideas and approaches, the possibilities for innovation and growth are endless. In the world of satellite launches, S3 is leading the way. With its low-cost technology and ambitious plans for spaceports around the world, the company is poised to change the satellite industry forever.
