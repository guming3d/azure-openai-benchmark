Heroin addicts should be handed free tin foil, to encourage them to smoke rather than inject the drug, the Government’s drug tsar said. Prof Les Iversen, chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, said inhaling heroin was safer than injecting it - because it removes the risk of catching dangerous diseases from needle sharing. Drug addicts can already access free needles and syringes from the NHS, and Prof Iversen said tin foil should be added to the list of approved paraphernalia. Prof Les Iversen said using foil to inhale heroin was safer than injecting it. This photograph is posed by a model . He said: ‘We recommended that aluminium foil should be part of legal paraphernalia. 'Heroin addicts and other injecting drug addicts can already obtain needles, sterile water and alcohol wipes etc legally so we’ve suggested that foil should be added to that list. ‘Foil can be used as a way of smoking heroin instead of injecting it and is thus considered safer, avoiding the hazards of injecting with possibly contaminated needles. ‘We’ve been subjected to a number of questions from the Department of Health about the safety of smoking versus injecting, and we are still waiting a response. 'We’ve been promised one by the end of the month.’ The Home Office insisted heroin is 'extremely harmful' but ministers will consider the advice. Prof Iversen said aluminium foil should be part of legal paraphernalia . Figures last month showed heroin usage had stabilised at 0.1 per cent of the population in 2010-11. But the number of people using methadone, which is prescribed by doctors as an alternative to heroin, has gone up from 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent over the last two years. Prof Iverson said the provision of foil to heroin users would reduce the risk of infection, cutting costs for the NHS. He added: ‘I think it’s a good idea because it avoids the harms associated with injecting drug use, both infection at the site of injection and also the danger of transmitting viral and bacterial disease. ‘That can certainly lead to a large charge for the National Health Service and if we can find a safer way I think we should use it.’ A Home Office spokesman said:  'Heroin and crack cocaine are extremely harmful and cause misery to communities across the country. 'The government is considering the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and will respond in due course.'

chatgpt: The head of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, Professor Les Iversen, has suggested that aluminium foil should be considered as an essential item in the legal paraphernalia. Speaking at a recent conference, Prof. Iversen argued that incorporating it into the kit would help save the National Health Service (NHS) money by reducing the spread of infections related to drug use. Aluminium foil has long been a tool for drug users to smoke various substances. However, the way it is used can be dangerous, leading to cuts, burns, and other injuries. This can result in infections that are costly to treat and are a significant burden on the healthcare system. "By making aluminium foil part of the legal paraphernalia, you make it safer for people to use drugs," said Professor Iversen. "It would also help prevent infections, which is crucial for saving the NHS money." Prof. Iversen's idea has already gained support from organizations that advocate for harm reduction measures. The National AIDS Trust, for example, supports the use of aluminium foil as a way to reduce the spread of HIV among drug users. This is particularly important given that the UK saw a rise in HIV diagnoses last year, with one in 50 people living with the virus reportedly being a drug user. "Aluminium foil is a safe and cheap alternative to other smoking devices, such as pipes or needles, and it can help save lives," said Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust. "Making it available as part of legal paraphernalia is a sensible and practical step that can help prevent new infections and reduce the burden on the NHS." However, not everyone is in favor of the proposal. Some argue that it could send out the wrong message and suggest that drug use is being encouraged, while others believe that it would also encourage more drug-taking. "We should not be enabling people to take drugs – we should be doing all we can to help them quit," said John Jolly, chief executive of the addiction charity Blenheim CDP. "Aluminium foil could give the impression that drug use is safe and acceptable, which would send out a harmful message to vulnerable people." Despite these concerns, Professor Iversen maintains that his proposal is a pragmatic and sensible approach that would help prevent infections and save the NHS money. "We need to be realistic about the way people use drugs and find ways to reduce the harm that they can cause," he said. "By making aluminium foil part of the legal paraphernalia, I believe we can make a real difference and help make drug use safer and less costly for all."  In the end, whether or not Professor Iversen's proposal is accepted remains to be seen, but the debate around it highlights the ongoing need to find ways to reduce the harm caused by drug use and ensure that the healthcare system is not unduly burdened by the consequences.
