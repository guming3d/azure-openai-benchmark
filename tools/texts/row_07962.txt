The story plays out like a Hollywood film – separated at birth, adopted by different families on two different continents, and the shock of discovering there was someone halfway across the world that exactly resembles them. But that’s exactly what happened for suspected identical twins Anaïs Bordier, a French fashion design student living in London, and Samantha Futerman, an American hoping to break into acting in Los Angeles. Now, the ‘twins,’ both 25, have started a Kickstarter page to fund a documentary to chronicle their first meeting and their subsequent adventures together – and, of course, they’re hoping to get a DNA test to find out once and for all if they are identical twins.

Ms Bordier wrote Ms Futerman on Twitter, saying that she discovered both of them shared the same November 1987 birthday. Both were born in Seoul, South Korea, and they shared an uncanny resemblance. ‘I received a message via Twitter that would erratically change my life,’ Ms Futerman told Mashable. ‘At first glance, I saw only my own face staring back from “her” profile picture.’ Growing up: Bordier grew up in France while Futerman spent her childhood in New Jersey .

Ms Bordier was adopted by French parents and grew up as their only child outside of Paris, and knew that Ms Futerman grew up with two biological brothers in New Jersey. The two first chatted on Skype – and can be seen in their Kickstarter video reacting to one another for the first time. They also found a shared love of cheese, as well as ‘an apparent Napoleon complex.’ As of Wednesday afternoon, they have already surpassed their $30,000 goal, with more than $34,450 raised for their meet-up, documentary, and DNA testing. More than 800 people have donated to their cause.

chatgpt: Anais Bordier and Samantha Futerman share the same birthday, the same facial features, and a potential life-changing discovery. The two young women believe that they were separated at birth in South Korea nearly three decades ago. Now, they are raising money to meet face-to-face and make a documentary about their experience. Bordier had always known she was adopted, but it wasn't until she saw a YouTube video of actress Futerman that she realized they looked strikingly similar. After some research and a DNA test, Bordier discovered that she and Futerman shared the same DNA, effectively proving that they were identical twins. Futerman was equally shocked to receive a message from her long-lost sister, and within months, the pair was video chatting and sending messages to each other daily. However, despite their newfound connection, the distance between New York City and London, where the two currently live, has made it difficult for them to meet in person. Compounding their situation, Bordier and Futerman have been met with skepticism by those who doubt the validity of their claims. As a result, the two women have decided to create a documentary about their separation and eventual reunion, which they hope will serve as proof of their story. "We want to make a documentary to share our story and all the challenges that come with it," Futerman explained in an interview with the Today show. "So many people have reached out to us with their own stories, and we want to shed light on this issue." Additionally, the pair hopes that their story will help other long-lost siblings who have been separated at birth. They plan to use the documentary as a tool to help raise awareness about the plight of orphaned children and the need for better adoption practices. To fund the documentary, the sisters have launched a Kickstarter campaign in hopes of raising $30,000. The campaign is off to a strong start, with over $10,000 donated in the first few days. Bordier and Futerman are hopeful that their documentary will shed light on a little-known issue and help other siblings who have been separated at birth. They remain close despite the distance between them, and their determination to be reunited in person reflects the incredible strength of sibling bonds. As they continue to navigate the complexities of their situation, they serve as an inspiration to all who have faced adversity and remain steadfast in their pursuit of the truth.
