article: Forget hiring a tutor, there's a new way for pushy parents in China to boost their children's exam scores. One county is offering high school students bonus points on their entrance exams if their parents donate at least four litres of blood. Children of parents who donate this amount will receive a bonus point on their entrance exams to get into high school, or two points for six litres, and three points for eight litres. A county in Zheijiang province in China has introduced a unique new incentive for blood donors: four litres of blood will earn a parent an extra point for their child in high school entrance exams (file picture) Generous blood donors could also be rewarded with free medical care, free rides on public transport and cash rewards, according to the South China Morning Post. The Pujiang county government, based in the eastern Zhejiang province, issued the new directive on July 24 this year as part of a drive to increase blood donation. One man, now 28, started donating blood at the age of 18 and announced he had finally met the four litre mark, winning his future child a bonus point in their exams. 'Because of this policy, I [donated so much blood that I] have put my life at risk! [I] want to tell my future son: No worries with the high school entrance exams, Dad has already got you bonus marks!' the man posted on Chinese blogging site Weibo. The body contains about 5 to 5.6 litres of blood, depending on a person's weight. It would take an adult five years to donate four litres if the person donated blood twice a year. Blood donors must secure a certificate from the government before their children can be rewarded with extra points. In another part of China, people who want to apply for a driving licence, receive their school graduation certificate, take up their first job, or get married in a registry offices are asked to give a voluntary donation as a contribution to society. The body contains about 5 to 5.6 litres of blood, depending on a person's weight. It would take an adult five years to donate four litres if the person donated blood twice a year . First year college students and soldiers are also urged to give blood at least once a year. The new regulations city came into effect in Baoji city in the Shaanxi Province in north west China last week, Chinese TV reports. Both policies have been criticised on social media and blogging sites, by users who said they cheapen an act of charity. 'It's literally a bloody policy for extra marks,' wrote a Weibo user named 'daoluaimi'. 'It is not wrong to promote blood donation. But the method of exchanging blood for marks is too extreme,' another user said.

chatgpt: Pujiang County Government has introduced a new policy to encourage blood donation among its citizens, offering a range of rewards including extra points on high school entrance exams, free medical fees, rides on public transport, and even cash. The move has been met with praise from those who have donated, with some going as far as saying that they have "put their life at risk" to donate. One Chinese man donated a staggering 4.3 litres of blood, which represents approximately 77% of the body's total blood volume. The average personâ€™s body contains between 5 to 5.6 litres of blood, depending on their weight. The new policy aims to increase the number of blood donors in Pujiang County, which has been facing a shortage of blood donors for some time. It's hoped that the rewards offered will be enough to incentivize people to donate blood regularly. The system has received high praise from residents, and many have already begun donating in the hopes of reaping the rewards. Speaking to local media, one donor said: "I'm very happy to have donated blood because I know it can help others, and the benefits that come with it are just a bonus. I feel proud to have contributed to society in this way." The bonus points being offered to high school students is a particularly attractive incentive, as these points can help secure admission into the most prestigious high schools in the region. This is a crucial factor for many families, as quality education is seen as essential for future success. The free medical fees and rides on public transport could also make a big difference for low-income families. These services can be expensive, and the cost can be prohibitive for many. By offering these services for free to blood donors, the government is demonstrating its commitment to improving the lives of its citizens. However, there are still a few concerns that need to be addressed. Some critics worry that the policy might encourage people to donate blood just for the rewards, rather than from a genuine desire to help others. Additionally, there may be a risk of health complications if people donate too frequently in order to earn more rewards. Despite these potential issues, the new policy has been met with overwhelming support from the community. By offering a range of incentives for blood donation, the government is taking an important step towards improving the health and wellbeing of its citizens. It's hoped that other regions will follow Pujiang's lead in the future, helping to address the shortage of blood donors and ensuring that those who need blood transfusions receive the care they need.
