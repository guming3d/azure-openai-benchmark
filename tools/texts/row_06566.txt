article: Tottenham cruised to victory in their Europa League Group C clash thanks to Harry Kane's hat-trick and a double from Erik Lamela. Sportsmail's Gerard Brand picks out the key points at White Hart Lane. Europa League winners will reach the Champions League, but Mauricio Pochettino still mixes it up. He's made on average 8.4 changes for each European tie; last season they made 6.4. Harry Kane marked his return to the Spurs side with a hat-trick at White Hart Lane . The Argentine boss has made 42 changes in their five European games so far this term, but he hasn't necessarily picked weaker teams. On Thursday night he brought in Jan Vertonghen, Ben Davies, Emmanuel Adebayor, Andros Townsend, Harry Kane and Mousa Dembele after the 4-1 defeat to Manchester City, six players with 197 international caps between them. Andros Townsend was restored to the starting XI following Saturday's 4-1 defeat at Manchester City . Asteras are the Swansea City of Greece. Why? Rising through their national system at the same blistering pace, they won the fourth division in 2005, the same year Swans were promoted to League One. Spurs marked the 10th anniversary of Bill Nicholson's passing with a commemorative programme celebrating the legendary manager's life. A memento for fans of that era, and the kids who gained entry for a fiver (£1.50 more than the programme.) Bill Nicholson had a 36-year association with Tottenham as a player and then manager . Despite the reduced prices (£25 adults, £5 juniors), there were plenty of empty seats at White Hart Lane. Strange considering each Europa League game is arguably more important to Spurs than their top flight encounters. There were plenty of empty seats for Tottenham's Europa League Group C clash . Turkish fans made some noise in north London recently, and despite the small Greek support, Asteras fans were typically boisterous, congregating to give their heroes an ovation 55 minutes before kick-off. Asteras fans gave their players a good reception before kick-off . 'Right now, the league table isn't crucial to us,' said Pochettino in his programme notes. Well, Mauricio, points make prizes, and Spurs haven't had this bad a start since Juande Ramos was sacked in 2008. Mauricio Pochettino insists he's not concerned by Tottenham's poor start to the season . Bizarrely, Asteras had seven Argentinians in Thursday night's squad, all in that perfect age of 24 to 29. Wealthy owners Dimitrios Bakos and Ioannis Kaimenakis believe the key is South Americans at their peak, and who could blame them? Forward Pablo Mazza was among seven Argentinians in Asteras's matchday squad .

chatgpt: Harry Kane returned to the Tottenham Hotspur side with a bang, scoring a well-taken hat-trick in a 4-0 win over West Brom at White Hart Lane. Kane had not played since injuring his ankle in September, but showed no signs of rustiness as he took the game to the Baggies' defence.  The England international opened the scoring midway through the first half, taking advantage of some slack defending to fire into the bottom corner. He doubled his side's advantage just before half-time, slotting home from close range after a lovely team move.  Kane completed his hat-trick just after the hour mark, capping off a lovely passing move by lashing the ball past Ben Foster in the West Brom goal. His third goal was particularly impressive, highlighting his ability to finish with both power and accuracy.  But Kane's day was not done there. Spurs were reduced to ten men when goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was sent off for a rash challenge on West Brom's Salomon Rondon. Kane, who had been taken off shortly before, was forced back into the fray as the home side attempted to see out the game.  Despite Spurs' numerical disadvantage, they continued to dominate proceedings, with Erik Lamela scoring a screamer from outside the box to cap off a comfortable win. The Argentine's goal was a fitting way to end a superb team performance, with Spurs demonstrating their quality in all areas of the pitch.  Kane's return will be a huge boost for Tottenham, who have struggled for form in his absence. The striker's goalscoring prowess has been sorely missed, with Spurs often struggling to put the ball in the back of the net. But Kane's performance against West Brom showed that he is back to his best, with his clinical finishing helping Spurs to secure a vital three points.  Manager Mauricio Pochettino will be delighted with his side's display, particularly given the circumstances. Spurs were without several key players, including Dele Alli and Jan Vertonghen, but still managed to dominate a side who have proven to be stubborn opponents in the past.  The win moves Tottenham up to sixth in the Premier League, just five points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. With Kane back in the side, Spurs will be hopeful of mounting a serious challenge for a top-four place in the coming weeks.  In conclusion, it was a fantastic performance by Tottenham Hotspur as they brushed aside West Brom with ease. The return of Harry Kane will be a huge boost for the team and fans alike, as Spurs look to climb up the Premier League table. The striker's clinical finishing was on full display against West Brom, and his hat-trick will have delighted his manager and teammates. Tottenham will now turn their attention to their next match, as they look to build on this impressive victory.
