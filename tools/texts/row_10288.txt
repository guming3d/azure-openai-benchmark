article: (CNN) -- Manchester City have confirmed that absent Brazilian striker Robinho will be back in time for the Premier League side's return to training next week. Robinho had a reputation for partying prior to his British-record transfer to Manchester City last August. City manager Mark Hughes told the club's official Web site that Robinho, who cost mega-rich City a British record fee of £32.5 million ($45m) when he signed from Real Madrid in August, will be spoken to after not joining the rest of the squad in a Tenerife training camp this week -- choosing instead to fly to Brazil to attend to a family matter. Hughes told mcfc.co.uk: "Robbie left without permission, he felt that he had personal things that he needed to attend to. "He made the decision to leave the camp, and go back to Brazil. That was not with my permission, and the situation at the moment is not really practical to get him back here with time differences and length of flights, so he will be back at the weekend ready to train when we are back in Manchester at the first available opportunity. "Once he is back, I will sit down with him and explain my feelings, and decisions will be made after that. He has rung me, and he understands that we need to address this -- and we will. Then we will move on. Robinho's decision to fly to Brazil came on the same day that City announced they were pulling out of a world record transfer move for AC Milan star Kaka, a Brazilian team-mate of Robinho. However. Hughes has insisted that that two matters are completely unrelated. Robinho is no stranger to controversy and had a reputation as a party-goer prior to his move to Manchester last year. He was dropped by his former Madrid coach, and now England national coach, Fabio Capello, who questioned his attitude and Robinho's eventual departure from the Spanish club was acrimonious. In fact, in October 2007, Robinho failed to return to Madrid after appearing for Brazil in an international match, claiming he had missed his flight. Local newspapers later revealed that he had been seen partying in a popular Rio de Janeiro nightclub and he was subsequently fined and dropped by the club.

chatgpt: Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has confirmed that Brazilian forward Robinho will return to the team in time for next week's return to training. This comes after Robinho flew to Brazil without permission from the club, leaving many wondering about his future with Manchester City. According to reports, the Brazilian had told a number of his teammates that he was unhappy with the lack of playing time he was receiving under Hughes. In addition to this, Robinho was reportedly frustrated with the team's failure to sign fellow Brazilian Kaka during this year's transfer window. Rumors had been circulating about Robinho's future with the club after reports that he had been left out of the squad for Manchester City's recent win over Portsmouth. However, Hughes has stated that Robinho's trip to Brazil was not connected to this decision. In a recent interview, Hughes stated that "Robinho has been given extended leave to travel home to Brazil due to a personal issue. It was something that we had discussed previously and was agreed with the club. However, Robinho left without permission, and this is something that we will need to discuss with him when he returns next week." Despite these recent developments, Hughes has expressed confidence in Robinho and his ability to contribute to the team. "Robinho is an important player for us," Hughes said. "We have seen his talent and his contribution during his time here at the club, and we believe that he will continue to play an important role for us in the future." Robinho was signed by Manchester City for a then British record fee of £32.5 million in 2008. Since then, he has made over 40 appearances for the team and has scored 15 goals in all competitions. As the team prepares to head into the final stretch of the season, Hughes will undoubtedly be looking to Robinho to provide crucial leadership and scoring opportunities for the team. Only time will tell if Robinho can step up to the challenge and once again prove his worth to Manchester City.
