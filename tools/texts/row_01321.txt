Van Briesen's death is a tragic reminder of the dangers that can lurk in the ocean. While Hawaii's beaches are known for their beauty and serenity, they can also be treacherous.

Of those, 108 were visitors to the state. This highlights the importance of being aware of ocean risks and taking precautionary measures when swimming in the ocean. The incident has sparked conversation among locals and officials about the need for better ocean safety measures. The Hawaii Tourism Authority has reminded visitors to be aware of potential hazards and to always follow warnings and guidelines. The Van Briesen family has set up a GoFundMe page to cover medical and funeral expenses. The page has already raised over $50,000, a testament to the love and support shown to the family during this difficult time. Friends and family remember Van Briesen as a loving wife and mother who always put her family first. She was an active member of her community and loved to volunteer her time with various charities. Her death has left a void in the lives of those who knew her, and she will be deeply missed. Tragedies such as this highlight the importance of living life to the fullest every day. Van Briesen's sudden passing serves as a reminder to cherish the time we have with our loved ones and to always take precautions when enjoying the beautiful scenery around us.
