article: (CNN) -- Police are no longer looking for a woman in connection with a fatal shooting and crash that left three people dead on the Las Vegas Strip. "Yenesis Alfonso, also known as Tineesha Howard, is no longer considered to be a missing person and is no longer a person of interest" in the homicide investigation, Las Vegas police said in a statement late Wednesday. The 22-year-old was never named as a suspect, but detectives wanted to talk to her in connection with the case. The police statement says the investigation is ongoing. Police didn't say why she was no longer considered a person of interest. Authorities had previously identified Ammar Asim Faruq Harris, 26, as a suspect in the shooting. He is at large, though a black Range Rover police say he was driving during the early-morning shooting has been impounded. Police consider Harris to be armed and dangerous, and say he has an extensive criminal history, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. He has several tattoos, including a small heart -shaped one below his right eye and a large one of an owl that covers his neck and part of his chest. A woman who said she is Howard's mother told CNN that her daughter and Harris have dated for about a year. Miladys Garcia said she recognized Harris from an image that police issued, but that she knew him by a different name. In the shooting and crash, Kenneth Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, was driving his Maserati around 4:20 a.m. Thursday when someone in a Range Rover shot at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard. Cherry, who was shot in the chest and arm, later died at a hospital. The Maserati continued into the intersection with Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, CNN affiliate KVVU said. A passenger in the taxi -- identified by the Clark County coroner's office as Sandra Sutton-Wasmund, 48, of Maple Valley, Washington -- also died. All the deaths have been ruled homicides, according to the coroner's office. The fire closed a block and a half of the Strip near some of its biggest draws: Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo. Police collected surveillance video from the casinos. CNN's Tina Burnside and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Police have officially declared Tineesha Howard, also known by the name Yenesis Alfonso, a person of interest in the fatal shooting and crash incident that occurred last Monday. According to law enforcement officials, Howard was inside a black Range Rover at the time shots were fired, which led to the death of three individuals. The incident took place on a busy street in downtown Los Angeles. Surveillance cameras captured the Toyota Corolla rushing towards the Range Rover, with the driver of the Corolla firing multiple gunshots at the vehicle's occupants. The Range Rover driver lost control of the car, slamming into a nearby building, which resulted in multiple fatalities. A police spokesperson claimed that Howard was uncooperative and reluctant to answer their questions about her involvement in the incident. They also revealed that she had a previous arrest record and was currently on probation for possession of illegal substances. Howard had been under police observation as part of their investigation into the case but has since refused to cooperate with the authorities. Investigators are still trying to determine what led to the shooting and who might be responsible for it. They are also investigating whether it was a targeted attack or a random act of violence. The identities and personal details of the individuals who were killed in the crash have not been released by the authorities. The shooting and crash in the middle of a busy street have understandably left the local community in shock and disbelief, particularly residents who witnessed the tragedy unfold. Many have expressed their sadness, and some have even taken to social media to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the incident. Police are urging anyone with information that may help solve the case to come forward and speak to investigators. The authorities have released a statement promising to pursue the perpetrators of the crime and bring them to justice. In the meantime, the investigation is ongoing, and the search for the people responsible for this heinous act continues. Despite the authorities' appeal for help, the community remains on edge, fearful that such senseless violence may happen again.
