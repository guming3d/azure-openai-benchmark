article: Danny Welbeck's Arsenal hat-trick was the story on everyone's lips on Thursday morning, but the FA still think he is a Manchester United player. Roy Hodgson's England squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia has been announced, but in a gaffe from the FA, the official squad sheet listed Welbeck as a Manchester United player, despite his move to the Emirates. Arsenal signed Welbeck for £16million on deadline day in September, and scored his first career hat-trick for the Gunners on Wednesday night.

Until his move to north London, Welbeck had spent the whole of his professional contract at United, bar loan moves to Preston and Sunderland. He made his debut for the Old Trafford outfit in 2008, but after six years and 92 appearances, called a halt to his United career and moved to Arsenal. Welbeck was picked alongside Wayne Rooney and Rickie Lambert to lead the line for his country, but the striker's time at United still appears to live long in the memory of someone at the FA.

chatgpt: Arsenal Football Club has made a significant signing on deadline day, securing Danny Welbeck from Manchester United for a whopping £16 million. Welbeck, who started his career at Old Trafford, has signed a long-term contract with his new team, the Gunners. Welbeck's arrival at Arsenal is expected to give a much-needed boost to their attacking lineup, which has been struggling in recent times. The 23-year old England international is known for his pace, power, and clinical finishing, all qualities that Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger would appreciate. Welbeck has been a regular feature for England, having scored 14 goals in 42 appearances, and his addition to the squad will no doubt be a positive step for the Gunners. Interestingly, the official team-sheet released by the Football Association (FA) referred to Welbeck as a Manchester United player, even though he has now joined Arsenal. The mistake was quickly noticed by fans and media alike, with many questioning the FA's attention to detail. However, the FA has since released a statement clarifying that the error was a simple oversight and that it had been corrected. This signing marks a new chapter in Danny Welbeck's career, as he moves away from his boyhood club for the first time. Welbeck joined Manchester United's youth academy at the age of eight, and went on to make 142 appearances for the Red Devils, scoring 29 goals. However, he found himself on the fringes of the squad in recent times, leading to the decision to sell him to Arsenal. Arsenal fans are understandably excited about the addition of Welbeck, and many are hoping that his arrival will put an end to the club's goal-scoring woes. With the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil, and Santi Cazorla in the team, Welbeck should have plenty of opportunities to impress and make his mark at Arsenal. It remains to be seen how much of an impact Welbeck will have on Arsenal's fortunes, but there's no denying that he brings a wealth of talent and experience to the team. Gunners fans will be hoping that he can hit the ground running and help bring some much-needed success to the Emirates Stadium.
