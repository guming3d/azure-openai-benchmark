article: Tokyo (CNN) -- Two U.S. airmen and a Japanese surfer remained missing Monday after a powerful typhoon swept past the southern part of the country. The two airmen were among four who were washed out to sea as a group of them took photos of big waves on a beach on the island of Okinawa on Sunday afternoon, according to the Japanese Coast Guard. One airman managed to make it back to the beach, but another was found in the water and confirmed dead later Sunday, the coast guard said. The search for the two missing men was hampered by rough seas, said Kadena Air Base, the U.S. military installation where they were serving. All three names are being withheld until the Air Force can notify next of kin. Surfer goes missing near Tokyo . The seas were churned up by Typhoon Phanfone, which made landfall in central Japan early Monday. It packed sustained winds as strong as 130 kph (81 mph) when it hit land near the city of Hamamatsu, after having moved up the country's southeastern coastline. A 21-year-old university student went missing at lunchtime Sunday while surfing off the coast of Fujisawa, a beach suburb of Tokyo, the coast guard said. Unleashing fierce winds and torrential rain, the typhoon brought widespread disruption to Tokyo and other areas near its path. Thirty-nine people have been injured, authorities said. Hundreds of flights canceled . More than 1.2 million people throughout a wide area of central and eastern Japan have been advised to evacuate to shelters, Japanese fire and rescue officials said Monday. More than 7,000 others have been ordered to relocate. Air transport was paralyzed, with more than 400 domestic flights canceled, affecting more than 50,000 people. Bullet trains between Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's second biggest city, were also disrupted. Elementary and junior high schools in large areas of central Japan were closed to avoid the heavy rain and strong winds. The storm had moved out into the Pacific Ocean by Monday afternoon, and meteorologists said conditions should improve by nightfall. Risk of mudslides . But the typhoon left behind the danger of mudslides and flooding in mountainous areas. Officials have expressed particular concern about the situation at Mount Ontake, a volcano that suddenly erupted last weekend, killing dozens of hikers. The typhoon has caused search efforts to be suspended for about a dozen people who remain missing on the volcano, the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported. The high accumulation of volcanic ash on the mountain, combined with the forecast of heavy rain, increases the danger of mudslides.

chatgpt: Typhoon Phanfone hit Japan with a vengeance on Monday, causing widespread devastation and leaving millions of people stranded. The typhoon, which was classified as a Category 4 storm, brought powerful winds of up to 140 miles per hour, torrential rains and waves as high as 60 feet, battering the central coast of the country. According to officials, more than 1.2 million people were advised to evacuate to shelters as the storm approached. Those living in low-lying areas or near rivers were especially warned to evacuate, as flooding was expected. However, despite the warnings, many people chose to stay in their homes, leaving them vulnerable to the storm's wrath. As the typhoon made landfall, the U.S. military reported that two of its airmen were missing after they were swept from a beach on Okinawa. One of the airmen was later found dead, while the other remained missing. A Japanese surfer is also missing after disappearing in waves near a Tokyo suburb. In addition to the damage caused to buildings and infrastructure, the typhoon disrupted air and train travel across the country. More than 300 flights were cancelled, leaving many passengers stranded at airports across the country. Train services were also disrupted, with many lines suspended as a result of the storm. Local officials have warned that the situation is likely to worsen in the coming days as heavy rains are expected to continue throughout the week. They have called on residents to remain vigilant and prepare for the possibility of further floods and landslides. The Japanese government has also issued a statement urging citizens to take all necessary precautions and follow the advice of local officials. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said that he is closely monitoring the situation and has promised to provide all necessary resources to affected areas. Typhoons are common in Japan, and the country is well prepared to deal with them. However, the severity of Typhoon Phanfone has caught many people off guard, and has led to widespread destruction and loss of life. As the country begins the long process of rebuilding, many are left wondering how long it will take for life to return to normal. The full extent of the damage caused by Typhoon Phanfone is still being assessed, but one thing is clear â€“ the people of Japan will need all the help they can get to recover from this devastating natural disaster.
