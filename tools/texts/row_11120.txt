article: Carolina Panthers star defensive end Greg Hardy, who has been granted a new trial this fall after a domestic violence conviction in July, has taken a voluntary leave with pay until his legal matters are resolved, the team announced Wednesday. "We understand Greg's decision," Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman told reporters. "And given the circumstances, it's very important that he concentrate on his legal issues. We believe this is the right course of action at this time for both Greg and the Carolina Panthers." Authorities say Hardy in May choked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced in July to 18 months of probation and a 60-day suspended sentence for the misdemeanors with which he was charged. The 6-foot-4, 275 pound defensive end says he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict rendered by a Mecklenburg County judge in North Carolina. He was granted a jury trial that is scheduled for mid-November. "I understand that I need to step away from football right now and take care of this legal matter. I am entitled to due process and my day in court, and that's where my focus should be," Hardy said in a statement released by the team. "I appreciate the Panthers for giving me this opportunity and look forward to being back with my teammates as soon as possible. " Gettleman said that Hardy will be placed on the NFL's exempt/commissioner's permission list, which allows in special circumstances for players to be paid while on leave.  He can still use the team's facilities but cannot attend practice. Peterson won't play until legal matters resolved . The players' union said it worked with the league, the Carolina Panthers and Hardy on the matter. "We support this decision and hope the best for him and his family," the NFL Players Association said in a written statement. Hardy, who led the team last season with 15 sacks and was a Pro Bowl selection, missed Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions after the team placed on the inactive list. He played in the season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and had four tackles.

chatgpt: Greg Hardy, the Carolina Panthers' defensive star, has announced that he will be taking leave from the team in order to focus on his legal defense. Hardy was convicted by a judge back in July on misdemeanor charges relating to a domestic violence case. Authorities allege that Hardy assaulted and threatened to kill his then-girlfriend, and he now faces a jury trial. The trial has not yet been scheduled, but Hardy is taking precautions in order to build a strong legal defense. He stated: "I'm at a position right now where I can't let anything affect me. I can't focus on anything right now other than getting my life together." Many have criticized Hardy's decision to take leave from the team, as he is an integral part of the Panthers' defense. However, his legal issues cannot be ignored. Panthers coach Ron Rivera has stated that the team will stand by Hardy, but that it is important for him to take the time to focus on his defense. Hardy's legal troubles are not new. In 2014, he was involved in a highly publicized incident in which he was accused of assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Charges were eventually dropped after the victim failed to appear in court, but the incident led to widespread criticism and speculation about Hardy's character. In light of his current situation, Hardy recognizes the importance of putting his legal troubles behind him. He stated: "I just want to put all this stuff behind me and continue to be a great teammate and a great football player." Hardy has been a highly effective player for the Panthers, recording 15 sacks in the 2013 season alone. Fans and teammates alike will undoubtedly miss Hardy's presence on the field, but everyone involved recognizes the importance of addressing his legal situation. For now, Hardy will take leave from the team and focus on building a strong defense in preparation for his upcoming trial.
