article: Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock remembers the first time he clapped eyes on Yannick Bolasie. 'I remember he played up front for us when I was at QPR in a practice match and I remember saying to Flavio (Briatore, who owned QPR), "I can get this lad on Â£2,000 a week and he's worth a shot, he won't cost anything". 'And he said: "No you can't sign anyone, I'm selling the club". I'll never forget it. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Tottenham 0-0 Crystal Palace . Yannick Bolasie takes a tumble as he battles for the ball with Spurs defender Ben Davies during the match . Crystal Palace were unlucky not to take three points from a game that, at times, left Neil Warnock bewildered . 'So I said to Bolasie: "If I were you I'd go south and get games under your belt". He got a contract offer (at Plymouth Argyle) and never forgets that.' Thankfully for Warnock, he can finally work with the talented winger. Spurs have 10 points from a possible 24 at White Hart Lane this season . And where would Palace be without their mesmeric attacking midfielder? He was at his bewildering best on Saturday as Palace left Tottenham unlucky not to have recorded a shock win. One piece of skill in the left-hand corner, that left Eric Dier and Ryan Mason for dead, was particularly outrageous. 'It's obvious I've been working with him in training,' joked Warnock. 'Some days he does a trick and you laugh at him, it's laughable. It's spontaneous. You never see him practise it.'

Pochettino complained that Palace were given one day more rest after the midweek fixtures . Bolasie signed a three-year deal in the summer but has been promised a further improvement to his contract should he continue to produce these kind of displays. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino even pinpointed the 25-year-old as Palace's most potent attacking threat ahead of Saturday's clash. Not that it helped nullifying the Congo international's impact. Pochettino provided another explanation as to why his side struggled against Warnock's men. 'When you compete in the same condition as the opponent then it's not a problem,' he said. 'We played Chelsea on Wednesday, but Palace played Aston Villa on Tuesday and had one day more (to recover). I don't complain about it but when you have one less day to prepare then it's difficult. 'We don't feel the Premier League helps us. This week we play Thursday in Istanbul, arrive home very late and then have a trip to Swansea. 'The Europa League is a very tough competition because it kills all the teams.'

chatgpt: Crystal Palace Earn Credible Draw Against Tottenham Crystal Palace earned a credible 0-0 draw at Tottenham on Saturday in a game that saw both teams create chances but ultimately fail to convert them. Despite Tottenham enjoying the lion's share of possession, Palace looked dangerous on the counter-attack and were unlucky not to take all three points. Palace winger Yannick Bolasie was at his bewildering best during the match, using his pace and skill to trouble Tottenham's defence throughout. Bolasie's performance was pivotal to Palace's attacking play and manager Neil Warnock heaped praise on the winger after the game. Warnock said, "He was outstanding today. He looked like he could create something out of nothing every time he had the ball. He's a real threat for us and it's great to have him in the team." Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, on the other hand, bemoaned the Premier League scheduling, which saw his team play just three days after a tough Europa League fixture. Pochettino said, "We had a difficult game on Thursday and the Premier League should have given us more time to recover. It's not fair on the players." Despite Pochettino's complaints, Tottenham looked sharp throughout the game and created plenty of chances. Both Harry Kane and Erik Lamela were denied by the woodwork, while Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni made several important saves to keep the score level. The draw leaves both teams on eight points after six games, with Palace edging ahead of Tottenham on goal difference. The result will be seen as a positive one for Palace, who have struggled for form in recent weeks, and will give them confidence going into their next game against Chelsea. Tottenham, on the other hand, will see the result as a missed opportunity to push further up the table. The North London club have made a solid start to the season, but will be disappointed not to have taken all three points at home against Palace. The game was played in front of a sell-out crowd at White Hart Lane, with both sets of fans creating a fantastic atmosphere. Tottenham supporters were in good voice throughout, while the Palace faithful will have been encouraged by their team's battling performance. Despite the lack of goals, the game was an entertaining one with both teams playing good football. Crystal Palace will be delighted with their performance, while Tottenham will be left wondering what might have been. In the end, however, a draw was probably a fair result and both teams will be looking to build on their performances in the coming weeks. Tottenham face a tough away fixture at Arsenal next, while Palace will be hoping to carry their momentum into their next game against Chelsea.
