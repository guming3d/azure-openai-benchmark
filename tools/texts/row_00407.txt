chatgpt: In their Group C opener, Colombia faced off against Greece and it was Pablo Armero who put his team 1-0 up with an impressive goal. The left-back picked up a pass from James Rodriguez before driving a powerful shot past Greek goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis to give Colombia the lead. Celebrations were in full swing for Colombia as Armero led his team-mates in a dance, which was performed by defender Cristian Zapata during a previous event for Colombia's sponsors Adidas. The dance was met with much enthusiasm from the Colombian players and fans, with Zapata even joining in from the stands. Armero's goal and subsequent dance were just one of many memorable celebrations to have taken place at the World Cup over the years. Sportsmail has picked a few of the most notable ones, including Roger Milla's iconic dance and Brandi Chastain's shirtless celebration. In the 1990 World Cup, Cameroon's Roger Milla became an instant sensation when he broke out into his trademark dance after scoring against Colombia. Milla's dance, which involved him running to the corner flag and swaying his hips, has since become iconic and is regarded as one of the most memorable celebrations in World Cup history. Meanwhile, in the women's game, Brandi Chastain's shirtless celebration after scoring the winning penalty in the 1999 World Cup final is still talked about to this day. Chastain pulled off her shirt and fell to her knees in celebration, with her sports bra becoming an instant symbol of female empowerment and athleticism. Other notable celebrations include Bebeto's cradling of an imaginary baby after scoring against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup, and Tim Cahill's corner flag punch after scoring against Netherlands in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup. As for Colombia, their victory over Greece was a great start to their World Cup campaign. Although they failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Colombia has a strong footballing history and has provided some of the most memorable moments in World Cup history, including the legendary goal scored by Carlos Valderrama against Germany in 1990. With plenty of games still to be played in this year's World Cup, there will no doubt be more incredible celebrations to look forward to. Teams will be hoping to channel the spirit of past celebrated moments and create their own iconic memories to be looked back at for years to come.
