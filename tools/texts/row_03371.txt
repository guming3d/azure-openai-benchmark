article: Mentally ill: Claude Alexander Allen III was ruled guilty but mentally ill in the murder of his friend . The son of a former top aide to President George W. Bush has pleaded guilty to hacking a friend to death with a tomahawk last year. Claude Alexander Allen III, 21, will be sent to a state psychiatric facility after mental health examiners concluded that he was suffering 'complex delusions and disorganized thinking' when he brutally murdered Michael Phillip Harvey in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in May 2013. Allen is the oldest son of Claude Allen II, who served as the assistant to the President for domestic policy from 2005 until 2006. The elder Mr Allen resigned after he was arrested for shoplifting. A subsequent investigation revealed that he had been taking items from store shelves in Target and Hecht's and 'returning' them - racking up $5,000 in a year. All this, despite earning a salary of $160,000 from the White House. The Washington Post reports that the younger Allen was at his parents' home with Harvey and another friend on May 23, 2013 when he became convinced that Harvey was trying to hurt him. A state psychiatrist's report says that Allen's psychotic delusions led him to believe that Harvey was a member of a rival gang and that he might attack. Allen also believed that Harvey had been stealing from him and was trying to make him sell drugs. Top aide: Allen's father Claude Allen II was assistant to President George W.

Allen then grabbed a 'tactical tomahawk' that he had bought online and hit his friend Harvey in the head and neck five times until he was dead. Allen then told his other friend 'I took care of the person who broke in,' prosecutors said, according to the Post. After Allen pleaded guilty to first-degree murder on Tuesday, Judge Terrence McGann found him not criminally liable, based on reports from psychiatrists. Allen will be sent to the Clifton T. Perkins psychiatric facility, where he will be held until a judge finds that he is no longer a threat to the community.

chatgpt: Claude Alexander Allen III, a 21-year-old man from Maryland, was deemed not legally responsible for the brutal murder of his friend, Michael Phillip Harvey. Allen, who hacked Harvey in the head and neck with a tactical tomahawk five times, was found to have suffered from complex delusions at the time of the crime. The case, which took place in August 2019, has garnered national attention due to Allen's family ties. His father, Claude Allen II, served as President George W. Bush's assistant for domestic policy in 2005 before being forced to resign in 2006. The elder Allen was arrested for shoplifting and stealing $5,000 worth of merchandise shortly before his resignation. His son's case has raised questions about whether the family's past may have played a role in his mental state. During the trial, Allen's defense team argued that he had been suffering from severe psychosis at the time of the murder. They highlighted his history of mental illness and his belief that he was acting out of self-defense. The prosecution, however, argued that Allen's actions were premeditated and that he had gone to great lengths to cover up his crime. They presented evidence that he had attempted to clean up the crime scene and dispose of the murder weapon. Ultimately, the jury sided with the defense and ruled that Allen was not legally responsible for the murder. He was committed to a psychiatric facility, where he will undergo treatment for his mental illness. While the verdict may bring some closure to the families involved, it is unlikely to put an end to the questions surrounding the case. Many are left wondering how Allen's mental health went unchecked for so long and whether his family's political past played a role in his release. For now, the case stands as a reminder of the importance of mental health awareness and the need for better access to mental health services. As the country struggles to address the growing mental health crisis, cases like Allen's serve as a stark reminder that there is still much work to be done.
