article: (CNN) -- Seeking to alleviate concern about rising oil prices, Saudi Arabia's oil minister said his country and other OPEC members have the capacity to produce surplus oil, Saudi Press Agency reported. Saudi Arabia alone has a surplus of about 4 million barrels per day, the agency quoted Minister Ali al-Naimi as saying. It was not clear from the news agency's report whether al-Naimi meant that Saudi Arabia is already producing an extra 4 million barrels or that it can, if the need arises. On Tuesday, 87 countries -- including Saudi Arabia -- signed a charter to limit price fluctuations and stabilize the market. The move came as oil prices jumped 6%. Prices spiked as high as $98 a barrel earlier in the session, as the crisis in Libya sparked concern that the turmoil roiling the Middle East could spread to other producing countries -- including Saudi Arabia. "Now it's starting to look like the entire region's on fire, and it looks like it could spread to other parts of the region," said Peter Beutel, oil analyst with energy risk management firm Cameron Hanover. "This thing is getting worse and worse and worse, and it could spread to Saudi Arabia, and that's the big fear." Libya's importance with regard to oil prices doesn't hinge so much on its oil-producing and exporting capabilities, said Beutel. To put things in perspective, Libya produces about 1.6 million barrels of crude per day, compared with Saudi Arabia's daily production of 8.4 million barrels and worldwide production of 87 million barrels, he said. But now the monarchy of Saudi Arabia, one of the United States' strongest allies and an island of stability in an otherwise tempestuous region, faces an uncertain future. "Markets have always relied on Saudi Arabia to act as the swing producer, boosting output if supplies were disrupted elsewhere," said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman. The International Energy Agency, an industry group based in Austria, said Tuesday that it "stands ready, as always, to make oil available to the market in the event of a major supply disruption if alternative supplies cannot readily be made available via normal market mechanisms." And OPEC has also said it stands ready to hold an emergency meeting to raise its output if needed.

chatgpt: 87 Countries Sign Charter to Limit Oil Price Fluctuations Oil prices soared by 6% on Tuesday, marking a noticeable spike in the global oil market. Experts in the industry have attributed this sudden rise to the strong demand from developing countries like China and India, coupled with the increasing political tensions between the United States and Iran. The rapid fluctuations in the cost of crude oil have long been a source of concern for both the producers and the consumers of the commodity. In an effort to curb these fluctuations, representatives from 87 different countries signed a charter pledging to limit price swing. The charter, known as the "Oil Fluctuation Control Accord," was signed at a summit held by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was held in Vienna on Tuesday. The mission of the accord is to stabilize oil prices at a fair level, so both producers and consumers can benefit. Libya, which produces 1.6 million barrels of crude oil per day, was one of the countries that signed the agreement. The North African nation has been grappling with internal conflicts and disputes over oil production, causing oil prices in the country to vary significantly over the past few years. The accord also includes major oil producers like Saudi Arabia, which has the capacity to produce 8.4 million barrels of crude oil per day. The country has been ramping up production in recent months in a bid to counteract the U.S. sanctions on Iran, which have caused a significant drop in that country's oil exports. Leaders from OPEC member countries, including United Arab Emirates, Equatorial Guinea, Kuwait, and Angola, reiterated their commitment to limiting oil price fluctuations during the summit. Ministers from the non-OPEC member countries, including Russia, were also present at the conference. The agreement is expected to have a significant impact on the global oil market, as it brings together several of the world's leading oil producers and consumers. The charter includes provisions for regular consultations and reviews, ensuring that the signatory countries can take appropriate steps to ensure stability in the market in the future. Despite the positive outlook, however, analysts have warned that there are still several factors that could hinder the success of the accord. From political turmoil in several countries to economic downturns, there are several challenges that signatory countries will have to overcome to successfully limit the price fluctuations in the global oil market. Nevertheless, the signing of the Oil Fluctuation Control Accord marks a significant step forward in the quest to stabilize the oil market and to ensure that both producers and consumers can benefit from a fair and consistent price for crude oil.
