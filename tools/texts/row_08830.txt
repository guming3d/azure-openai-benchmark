article: All her life, the elderly worshipper had been inspired by her church’s fresco of Jesus with his crown  of thorns. So when the plaster portrait began to crumble owing to damp, the woman in her 80s decided not to stand idly by. Without consulting the authorities at the Sanctuary of Mercy Church in Borjanos, southern Spain, she marched in with oil paint and brush, and started work on her own private restoration project.

chatgpt: In Zaragoza, Spain, an elderly woman's attempt to restore a 19th-century religious artwork has infuriated the locals and art experts alike. The woman, in her 80s, took it upon herself to restore the damaged fresco without any professional assistance or experience in art restoration. The artwork is located inside the Sanctuary of Mercy Church, a historic religious site in Spain that attracts art enthusiasts from around the world. The fresco, which depicts Christ crowned with thorns, has been damaged for years due to moisture and dampness. It was set to be restored by professionals, thanks to a generous donation from the granddaughter of the original artist. However, the elderly woman, who reportedly wanted to "help out," took matters into her own hands and attempted a restoration that has left the artwork completely disfigured. Several local reporters and art enthusiasts who visited the Sanctuary of Mercy Church were shocked to find the once-beautiful fresco now a grotesque rendition of its former self. The woman's "restoration" was clumsy, with large and uneven brushstrokes and an amateurish attempt to add facial features to the image. Photos of the botched artwork have gone viral on social media, with many expressing their outrage at the woman's actions. The elderly woman has since apologized for her actions, stating that she did not realize the extent of the damage she was causing or the importance of the artwork. Local authorities are currently deciding whether to press charges against her for vandalizing a historic artwork. Meanwhile, art experts in Zaragoza are assessing the extent of the damage and what can be done to restore the fresco to its former glory. It may take a team of professional restorers, and it's likely to be a lengthy and expensive process. Unfortunately, this incident highlights the dangers of amateur art restoration and the importance of leaving such work to trained professionals. The Sanctuary of Mercy Church's incident is a stark reminder of the need to respect and preserve our cultural heritage.
