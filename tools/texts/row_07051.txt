When police and paramedics arrived, they were faced with an unbearable stench and rotting food strewn across floors. In an upstairs bedroom, they found Mrs Lockard with human feces on her body and filthy bedsheets covered in waste and blood. Rotten food covered the floor of the room, according to the officer who witnessed the scene.

The brothers, who also had poor hygiene, said they had changed their ill mother's bedding and bathed her about two weeks before.
