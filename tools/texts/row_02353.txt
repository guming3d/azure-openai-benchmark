Recent statistics revealed that there are more than 425 million gadgets in the country, while there are only 311.5 million people living there.  Laptop and desktop computers have remained the primary means for Americans to access the internet. However, smartphones and tablets have been catching up quickly, thanks to the convenience they offer their users. With their portability, people can browse the internet, check their emails or social media accounts, or complete other tasks online while on the go.

The adoption rate of smartphones and tablets is increasing quickly and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. The adoption rate of these devices is not surprising, given their growing functionalities and the growing number of apps available for download. The smartphone has become an essential tool for daily life, used for everything from communication to entertainment and work. Tablets are also becoming more popular as people seek a more robust screen size for everything from browsing the web to watching movies on-the-go. With the rise in mobile connectivity, businesses also must take notice of the trend, as consumers demand more mobile-friendly and responsive websites. It's essential for businesses to optimize their sites for these devices to ensure they can reach a wider audience.
