article: (CNN) -- It's been three years since Japan was hit with its worst-ever earthquake, causing serious damage to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 9 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami sent three of Fukushima's reactors into melt-down, shocking the world. Japan, a fully industrialized country with high safety requirements, was facing a nuclear disaster of a similar scale to the deadly 1986 Chernobyl accident, in Soviet Ukraine. As a result, many countries decided to review their energy policies. Before the accident, 442 nuclear power reactors in 30 countries produced 14% of all world's electricity. This number dropped to just 11% in 2012, as 15 reactors exited service -- mainly in Germany and Japan. Today, 435 reactors operate in 31 countries, and a further 68 are under construction. After the Fukushima disaster, Japan pulled back its nuclear ambitions, ordered large-scale inspections and introduced new safety regulations. All of its 48 remaining reactors have been kept offline and a proposal to restart the program awaits parliament's approval. Germany shut down eight of its oldest reactors almost immediately after Fukushima, focusing instead on renewable energy, and phase-out all of its nuclear power by 2022. Switzerland adopted a similar approach when the government decided not to build any new reactors and phase out its nuclear production by 2034. This was despite a national referendum in which a majority of people voted in favor of more reactors. But not all countries got scared. Both France, which has the world's highest share of nuclear power for its electricity production, and the U.S., the world's largest producer, reaffirmed their positions on the power source. Both countries continue to invest heavily into safety improvements. All four "BRIC" countries are boosting their nuclear power production, with India aiming to supply 25% and Russia 45% of their electricity from nuclear power by 2050, and Brazil planning to build five new reactors by 2030. China is facing pressure to cut its pollution levels and reliance on coal. China already operates 20 reactors and aims to more than triple its nuclear capacity by 2020.

chatgpt: The Fukushima nuclear disaster, which occurred on March 11, 2011, shook the world's confidence in nuclear power. It was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986 and caused the deaths of over 15,000 people as well as a devastating loss of property and livelihoods. In the aftermath of the disaster, many countries began to reevaluate their reliance on nuclear power. Germany, for instance, decided to shut down all of its oldest nuclear reactors, and it has since made plans to completely phase out nuclear power by 2022. This decision was made in the face of significant pressure from environmental groups and the general public. Many Germans were understandably terrified by the specter of another Fukushima happening close to home. While developed nations like Germany are moving away from nuclear power, emerging economies like China and India are investing heavily in it. China alone has plans to build up to 60 new nuclear reactors in the coming years. This is partly driven by the need to reduce pollution from fossil fuels, but the global desire for low-carbon energy sources is also a driving factor. Although nuclear energy is not nearly as popular as it once was, it still has its advocates. Nuclear power plants offer a steady, reliable energy source that doesn't produce the same harmful emissions as burning fossil fuels. A well-run nuclear power plant can also produce a great deal of energy without taking up much space, making it an attractive option for countries with limited space to build large-scale energy infrastructure. The Fukushima disaster has reminded us of the risks associated with nuclear energy. But that doesn't mean it can't be a useful tool for countries looking to reduce their carbon footprint. With the right safeguards in place, nuclear power can be a valuable part of our energy mix. Overall, the Fukushima disaster has certainly changed attitudes towards nuclear power. But it hasn't completely killed off the technology. While some countries are moving away from it, others see it as a crucial part of their energy strategy for the coming decades. The debate over nuclear energy will no doubt continue in the years to come, but it's clear that the risks and benefits of nuclear power are still being weighed against one another by governments and energy experts around the world.
