article: (CNN) -- The eruption of a volcano in Guatemala was diminishing Friday, emergency officials said, though a heightened alert for the communities near the Volcan de Fuego remained in place. "For the moment, all that are seen are weak and moderate explosions as well as flows of lava that also diminished in length," the government said on its website, citing the National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology. "People are returning to their houses now that the activity has lowered," said David de Leon, a spokesman for CONRED Guatemala, which organizes disaster relief. But, he added, "We tell them it might be necessary" to leave again, should the volcano's activity spike. Though 35,000 people might theoretically have been affected by the columns of ash and smoke that rose from the "Fire Volcano," only 5,000 live southwest of it, the direction that was threatened, he said. On Thursday night, only about 800 people sought refuge at the four shelters set up by the Red Cross, said a Red Cross spokesman, Vinicio Sarazua Santillan. "Many of the people who were evacuated decided to go back to their houses, and others never left," he said. He predicted that the shelters would be empty Friday night "if the volcano continues in tranquility." Sarazua said that a number of people refused to evacuate out of fear that their belongings could be stolen. But, he said, as of Friday afternoon he had heard no reports of looting. De Leon said he also had heard no reports of looting. A government photo of Volcan de Fuego showed a massive wall of smoke that was lighter where it rose into the sky, and dark gray as it drifted. The average height of the column of smoke had decreased from about 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) to 700 meters, the agency said. Still, civil protection authorities kept in place the heightened "orange" alert. The volcano began spewing ash at 10 a.m. Thursday and was continuing to belch late in the afternoon near the country's former capital, Antigua, said Carmen Maria Caballero of the Guatemalan Red Cross. CNN iReporter Harby David Marroquin had been working at a nearby golf course when he saw nature's pyrotechnics and shot video on his iPhone. It showed white smoke pouring out of the top of the 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) volcano. Listening to the volcano gives him peace of mind, Marroquin said. "You feel an indescribable energy, and this time was no different." Three people were treated at mobile health centers for respiratory problems, according to de Leon. Thursday's eruption marked the sixth -- and the strongest -- this year, Caballero said. "It's a very active volcano," she added, but said that did not necessarily mean Thursday's eruption would last longer than others. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the volcano is one of Central America's most active. Is Yellowstone atop a supervolcano that can threaten Earth?

chatgpt: After Guatemala's Volcan de Fuego, also known as "Fire Volcano," erupted on Thursday, officials have announced that they are now seeing weaker and moderate explosions. The government has stated that the volcano's activity is decreasing, which is a positive sign for those who live nearby. Despite the decrease in activity, authorities have kept a heightened alert in place to ensure that residents are aware of any potential danger. The government is closely monitoring the situation and has urged those living in close proximity to remain vigilant and prepared for any necessary evacuations. The eruption of Volcan de Fuego began on Thursday, sending a massive plume of ash and smoke into the air, prompting officials to evacuate about 4,000 people from nearby villages. The dramatic images of the eruption quickly spread across social media, capturing the world's attention. Fortunately, no casualties have been reported as rescue teams have worked around the clock to evacuate residents and provide aid to those affected by the eruption. The National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED) stated that around 2,900 people have been relocated to temporary shelters. "We are highly concerned about the current situation, and we are working tirelessly to ensure the safety of everyone living in the area," said CONRED's spokesperson. "We are closely monitoring the volcano and will continue to provide updates as they become available." The eruption of Volcan de Fuego is considered to be one of the most spectacular and dangerous in recent times, as it is Guatemala's most active volcano. The last time it erupted was in 2018, killing more than 190 people and causing widespread devastation throughout the region. The eruption has also caused a significant impact on the nation's economy, as nearby coffee and avocado farms have been severely affected. The government has pledged to provide assistance to farmers and local businesses affected by the eruption. "I am deeply saddened by the devastation caused by the eruption of Volcan de Fuego. My thoughts and prayers are with the communities affected by this natural disaster," said Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei. Despite the recent decrease in activity, authorities have warned that the situation can change at any moment, and residents must remain prepared for any potential emergency. In conclusion, the recent eruption of Volcan de Fuego has caused significant devastation and upheaval for those living nearby. However, the decrease in activity is a positive sign, and authorities are working to ensure the safety of all residents in the area. The government's ongoing efforts to provide aid and support to affected communities highlight the resilience and strength of Guatemala during challenging times.
