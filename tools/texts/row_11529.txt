It was a penalty, there is no conspiracy theory and Jose Mourinho is finally being seen for what he is; an excellent coach who is a graceless and immature man who needs to learn how to lose. In football there are some things which are indisputable, some fouls which stand out as obvious and red cards which nobody can deny – Ramires' assault on Sebastian Larsson in this game being a case in point. However there are a lot of incidents which fall into the ‘grey area’ category and no matter how much they are debated agreement cannot be found. Sunderland’s penalty was just such an incident. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Jose Mourinho . Down: Cesar Azpilicueta fouls Jozy Altidore to give away a penalty during Sunderland's win against Chelsea . Tough call: Jozy Altidore and Cesar Azpilicueta collided in the area with referee Mike Dean pointing to the spot . Cesar Azpilicueta slid in to challenge Jozy Altidore and made no contact with the ball. The striker’s foot came down on Azpilicueta’s outstretched leg which caused him to lose balance and go to ground. In such circumstances and with the game close to ending I used to try and err on the side of caution and only award stone-wall penalty kicks. However if an assistant flags and indicates a penalty then you support him. Mike Dean followed that protocol after his assistant, Stuart Burt, did exactly that. Slap: Chelsea midfielder Ramires could face disciplinary action after slapping Sebastian Larsson in the face . Unpunished: Mike Dean was just a few feet away but his attention appeared to be elsewhere . Making a case: Larsson speaks to referee Mike Dean about the incident . The more times I look at the replay the harder I find it to state unequivocally what the correct decision should be. At the end of the game Mourinho thought he was being ‘clever’ by complimenting Dean and then his boss, Mike Riley. All listening knew what he meant by the comments but the FA will struggle to charge on ‘interpretation’ of words and rising above such puerile antics is the best way to deal with them. Mourinho must now contemplate the rest of the domestic season without the rash Ramires as it is clear from replays that despite his position Dean was looking away as the Brazilian struck his opponent. As for Rui Faria the FA MUST act very strongly and show that such disgraceful behaviour is completely unacceptable. Down in the dumps: Jose Mourinho reiterated his thoughts in his post-match press conference . Off you go: Mourinho (right) holds back his assistant coach Rui Faria after he was sent off by Dean (left) Anger: Chelsea's assistant coach was infuriated by Mike Dean's decision to give Sunderland a penalty .

chatgpt: Mike Dean, the referee of the Premier League match held on Saturday between Sunderland and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, has received praise for his decision to award a penalty to Sunderland. However, the game ended in a heated manner when Chelsea's Ramires assaulted Sebastian Larsson, the Sunderland midfielder. Furthermore, Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has come under scrutiny for blaming officials for the team's loss, and assistant coach Rui Faria may also face disciplinary action. Sunderland scored the match's only goal via a penalty kick, which was awarded by Mike Dean after Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta took down Sunderland striker Jozy Altidore in the box. The decision was met with approval from the fans, players, and pundits alike, with many acknowledging the referee's correct decision. However, the game ended in a heated manner when Chelsea's Ramires was shown a red card for a violent conduct charge. The incident occurred in stoppage time, with Ramires making a reckless challenge on Sunderland's Sebastian Larsson. The Brazilian midfielder is set to miss the remaining games of the season as a result of his actions. Many have criticized Ramires for letting his emotions get the better of him, especially as his team was already a goal down. Furthermore, Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has come under scrutiny for his comments following the match. Mourinho has a history of criticizing referees, and he was vocal again after the defeat. The Portuguese coach blamed officials for his team's lack of success, arguing that they have cost Chelsea points throughout the season. However, many have called out Mourinho for his behavior, stating that he must learn to take defeat gracefully and not place blame on others. The incident that occurred on the touchline during the match is also being investigated, with Chelsea's assistant coach Rui Faria potentially facing disciplinary action. Faria was shown a red card by the referee after confronting the fourth official, Mike Jones. The assistant coach was reportedly unhappy with a decision made by Jones and let his emotions get the better of him. The Football Association (FA) is now investigating the incident, and Faria may face disciplinary action for his behavior. The incident has raised the issue of the need for respect towards officials in football. Many have called for stricter punishments and greater respect for referees, as they have a difficult job and deserve to be treated with respect. Fans and players have a responsibility to behave in a manner that reflects the spirit of the game, and officials should be able to do their job without fear of retribution. In conclusion, Mike Dean was correct to award Sunderland a penalty, and Ramires will receive punishment for his assault on Sebastian Larsson. Jose Mourinho must learn to take defeat gracefully and stop blaming officials for his team's lack of success. Additionally, the FA must take action against Chelsea assistant coach Rui Faria for his actions on the touchline. The incident has once again highlighted the importance of respect towards officials and the need for greater accountability in football.
