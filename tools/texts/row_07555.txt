article: (CNN) -- Haitian President Michel Joseph Martelly said late Friday he had accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Garry Conille, thanking him for his service and promising to move quickly to replace him. Conille just assumed the position in October after being ratified by the country's Senate. His reasons for stepping down were not immediately clear. "This morning, Prime Minister Garry Conille presented me with his letter of resignation, I accepted it. I take this opportunity to thank him for his commitment. Of course, I regret that the resignation occurs in the context of where the country stands," said Martelly. The president asked domestic and foreign investors to keep calm and promised that the country's leaders are "committed to harmonizing our efforts for a quick resolution of this situation and proposing a new prime minister." "Haitian people, you know you can count on me, as I can count on you. I made you promises; I will respect them," Martelly said. Conille, a former United Nations development specialist, served as chief of staff for former President Bill Clinton when the latter served as special U.N. envoy in Haiti. In that role, Conille was involved in international aid delivery to Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010. "This resignation comes at a time when the Haitian people are eager to embark decisively on the path toward reconstruction, economic growth and the strengthening of the country's rule of law institutions," the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. "The secretary-general urges the Haitian authorities to act in the interests of the Haitian people and appoint a new prime minister as soon as possible," he added. Conille, a gynecologist, earned a master's degree in health administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He worked for the U.N. Development Program and is a protege of economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. When he assumed the position in October, Conille was welcomed in many corners as someone knowledgeable about development challenges with experience in working with the global community. Martelly's two previous prime ministerial nominees-- businessman Daniel Rouzier and lawyer Bernard Gousse -- had been rejected by the Haitian Senate. The inability to form a working government raised concerns about Haiti's ability to move forward after the earthquake. The United Nations estimates the January 2010 earthquake affected nearly 3 million people and killed about 220,000. More than 1.5 million people were left homeless in a country that was already the poorest in the Western hemisphere and wracked by crisis.

chatgpt: In a bid to calm investors' fears and reassure the Haitian people, President of Haiti, Jovenel Moïse, called for calm amidst the country's political turmoil. The president's remarks came on the heels of the United Nations' call for Haitian leaders to appoint a new prime minister as soon as possible. Haiti remains wrought by socio-economic issues and political instability, compounded by the devastation of a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that rocked the nation in 2010. With the recent change in leadership, the country has seen an upsurge in political unrest, which has caused local and foreign investors of the country to worry about its economic stability. The newly-appointed Prime Minister, Garry Conille, only took up office in October, but his tenure has already been rife with challenges. The UN called for the appointment of a new PM, citing a breakdown in dialogue between the current PM and President Moïse. The president's call for calm, therefore, aimed to allay the concerns of investors, who could be deterred by Haiti's tumultuous political climate. In his address to the nation, President Moïse stated that the country was working towards addressing its internal issues and that Haiti would weather the current storm. He stressed that the country was taking steps to stabilise its economy and financial situation, and urged investors to remain calm and not be swayed by rumours and misinformation. The President also expressed his solidarity with the Haitian people, encouraging them to keep faith in their country and have confidence in the government's ability to lead them to greater prosperity. He reiterated that the country needed to work together to confront its challenges and find solutions for long-term stability. Meanwhile, the UN's request for the appointment of a new prime minister highlights the urgency of the situation in Haiti. The country has been plagued by high inflation, violence, and political unrest, creating an environment of instability that could harm efforts to rebuild the nation after the 2010 earthquake. The international community has called on Haiti's leaders to work together towards instituting reforms and effecting change, so as to create an environment that will foster economic growth and improve the lives of the people. While the future of Haitian politics and economy is uncertain, the President's address serves to offer some reassurance that the country is taking steps towards stability amidst its current challenges. In conclusion, Haiti's recent political turmoil has sparked concern among investors and civil society. While the country faces significant challenges, the President's message of hope and reassurance signifies that the country is committed to surmounting its issues and finding long-term solutions for improvement.
