A company that helps businesses handle personnel issues denies it forced one if its employees out of his job after it was discovered he had posed nude in Playgirl magazine. Daniel Sawka filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in May 2013 against Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Inc. alleging sexual harassment. The company responded in a court filing Monday. Sawka worked as a regional sales manager for ADP, which offers workforce management services, including payroll services and human resources management, for other companies and says it has more than 610,000 clients around the world. Sawka, who worked for ADP in Windsor and later in Milford, alleges he was subjected to constant jokes and ridicule at work after a woman in his office discovered he had posed nude in the early 1990s in a lumberjack-themed spread for Playgirl and found the photos online. Jokes included 'a comment about homosexual men viewing the photos and what they would be doing while viewing the photos,' according to the lawsuit. '(ADP) employees would say 'timber' or 'lumberjack' in reference to the plaintiff and the plaintiff's photos.' Sawka, 49, said his co-workers continued to download the pictures at work even after he implored them not to and to 'leave me alone.' He said company employees brought the issue up during a dinner in New York honoring Sawka for his job performance and during a company outing to a New York Yankees baseball game. He said he went to the company's personnel department in February 2011 and was promised the company would take appropriate actions. His body was joked about, reports ABC News, including his genitals' and one comment was made about 'what homosexual men viewing the photos would be doing while viewing the photos.' He alleges the company failed to end the ongoing sexual harassment and he was 'constructively discharged,' a legal term meaning the conditions were so intolerable he was forced to leave the job in March 2011. 'The sexual harassment ... that included managers participating in the sexual harassment, condoning it, and failing to stop it caused (Sawka) to be treated unequally when compared to similarly situated sales managers,' the lawsuit says. The company, in its response, denies there was a 'pattern and practice' of jokes, sexually charged comments and ridicule. It also says it 'exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any alleged harassing behavior.' Sawka, who lives in Durham, is seeking damages for lost pay and benefits and emotional distress. A telephone call seeking comment from his attorney on Monday was not immediately returned. Sawka is suing ADP for 'sexual harassment ... that included managers participating in the sexual harassment, condoning it, and failing to stop it' and wants back and front pay, bonuses, personal days, lost pension/retirement benefits, and emotional distress .

chatgpt: A former employee has opened up about his experience of being sexually harassed at his workplace. Daniel Sawka, 49, claimed that he was subjected to constant ridicule and harassment following the discovery of his nude photos from the early 1990s, which were discovered by a female co-worker at ADP. According to Sawka, his colleagues continued to download and share the images even after he repeatedly pleaded with them to stop and leave him alone. He alleged that the harassment persisted, and the company failed to put a stop to it. Sawka eventually quit his job due to the ongoing trauma. In the 21st century, it is essential to understand that sexual harassment is a significant problem in the workplace. Organizations need to create a safe and conducive work environment for their employees, and take necessary measures to prevent any form of harassment. Employers must take stringent action against employees who indulge in harassing behaviors, regardless of their position in the company. It also crucial for employees to understand their rights and report any such incidents to the management. Sawka's accusations against ADP are a testimony to the critical need for such measures to be put in place. The persistence of harassment in the workplace is a serious concern that needs to be addressed by all employers. In Sawka's case, it appears that ADP failed to take the necessary steps to create a safe working environment for its employees. The lack of prompt action by the organization has resulted in distress for Sawka, which ultimately led to him quitting his job. It is vital for organizations to offer a harassment-free workplace, devoid of unwelcome advances, comments or behavior that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment. Such behavior can undermine employee dignity and productivity. Regardless of an employee's gender or position, every employee has the right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Employers need to proactively educate and create awareness among their employees, and set up a system through which employees can report incidents of harassment. The consequences of harassment in the workplace can be dire, not just for the employee, but also for the company, both legally and financially. It is therefore up to employers to take necessary actions and create a safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment. In conclusion, the case of Sawka raises significant concerns with regards to the measures taken or not taken by employers to create a safe and respectful work environment. Employers must put in place effective measures to prevent and curb sexual harassment in the workplace. Employees need to be made aware of their rights and encouraged to come forward in case of incidents that violate these rights. This will aid in fostering a safe and inclusive work environment and a more productive workplace.
