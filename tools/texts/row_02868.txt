Within hours of Ginner’s stepping down, Vice President for University Advancement Rebecca Dukes also resigned. She had been criticized for failing to challenge the remarks during the original meeting. An informal complaint had been made by a Latina administrator present at the meeting. She then filed a formal complaint in August after she wasn't informed of any resolution. Students have staged protests to voice disapproval with the way the school has handled the accusations.

Ginner denies having ever made the statements and says she is dedicated to supporting organizations that help Latinas, the San Jose Mercury News reported. ‘Although many efforts are already underway, a great deal of work lies ahead as we seek to be the welcoming, inclusive community all Spartans aspire to,’ said University President Mo Qayoumi following the resignations. Students are now demanding that he issue an apology letter to the original complainant and implement mandatory anti-racism trainings. Tower Foundation board chair Amir Mashkoori said Ginner's resigned to stop diverting attention from the university. ‘The fact that Wanda agreed to step down reflects genuine concern for the university and her desire to avoid being a distraction,’ Mashkoori said. The resignations come a year after four San Jose State University students were charged with misdemeanor hate crimes for abusing a black roommate. A report on that incident found the university was slow to respond to the students' cruel taunts and abuse, which included writing racial slurs on a whiteboard, hanging a Confederate flag in their suite, and barricading him in his room.

chatgpt: Donar Wanda Ginger, a long-time faculty member of San Jose State University, has resigned from her position following a backlash over her alleged comments regarding the ability of Latinas to be successful. Despite denials of making the statement, the university found itself engulfed in student protests, which ultimately led to Ginger's departure. The controversy began back in February, when one student filed a formal complaint against Ginger, who was teaching a course on diversity and inclusion. The student alleged that Ginger had made derogatory remarks about the ability of Latinas to succeed in life, suggesting that they lacked the necessary DNA to be successful. At the time, the university conducted an investigation into the matter, which found no evidence of wrongdoing on Ginger's part. The student, however, was not satisfied with the outcome and continued to press the university for action. Months went by, and it wasn't until last week that the situation finally boiled over. Students organized a protest, demanding that the university take action against Ginger and Vice President for University Advancement, Rebecca Dukes, whom they criticized for failing to challenge Ginger's remarks back in February. The university president ultimately decided to act, accepting Ginger's resignation and announcing that Dukes had also stepped down from her position. In a statement, the president acknowledged the difficulties faced by Latinx students on campus and pledged to do more to ensure that all students feel welcome and supported at San Jose State. For her part, Ginger continues to deny making the offending comments. In a statement released through her lawyer, she noted that the accusations against her were "simply untrue" and that she had always been committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity. Despite her denials, however, the incident has highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by underrepresented students in higher education. Latinx students, in particular, often struggle to find support and feel valued on predominantly white campuses, where they may face discrimination and even hostility. As for San Jose State, the university will likely face continued scrutiny over its handling of the situation. Some students have expressed concern that the university took too long to act, and that more needs to be done to hold those in positions of power accountable for their actions. Moving forward, it remains to be seen how San Jose State and other universities will address issues of diversity and inclusion, and how they can ensure that all students have an equal chance to succeed. For now, the resignation of Donar Wanda Ginger serves as a reminder of the importance of speaking out against discrimination, even when it may come at personal cost.
