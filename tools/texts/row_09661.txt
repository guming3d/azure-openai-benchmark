article: Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Three Kenyan political leaders accused of crimes against humanity following the country's disputed 2007 elections had their first appearance Thursday before the International Criminal Court at The Hague. Another three are scheduled to appear Friday. The court's top prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, named the six as suspects in December, claiming they organized violence that left more than 1,000 people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands more. Former Agriculture Minister William Ruto, opposition leader Henry Kosgey and radio journalist Joshua Arap Sang appeared Thursday.  Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta, Cabinet Secretary Francis Muthaura, and former national police chief Hussein Ali are set to appear Friday. The two groups of three come from opposite sides of the political dispute in Kenya. Ruto, Kosgey, and Sang face four counts of crimes against humanity: murder; deportation or forcible transfer of the population; torture and persecution. The judge set a date for them of September 1 to hear arguments as to whether they should go to trial. Judge Ekaterina Trendafilova quashed their attempts to plead their cases Thursday. When asked whether he understood the allegations, Ruto said he did, but that "the allegations sound like they came from a movie." Trendafilova warned the suspects that they should refrain from political activities relating to the case. "It has come to our knowledge," she said, "that there are some movements towards triggering the violence in the country by way of some speeches. Such type of action could be seen as an inducement and could constitute a breach of conditions." She warned that if the suspects continued in such a vein that the summons could be turned into "warrants of arrest." By late April, the two sides need to meet to start sharing evidence, the judge said. Last month, Kenya challenged the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, saying its own authorities will investigate and prosecute the cases on Kenyan soil. The Netherlands-based court calls itself, on its website, "an independent international organization ... established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community." Kenya's disputed presidential election sparked chaos that escalated into ethnic violence pitting supporters of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki against those of challenger Raila Odinga, who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. Muthaura, Kenyatta and Ali are accused of committing or contributing to the killing, rape and other acts of violence against supporters of the opposition Orange Democratic Movement. Ruto, Sang and Kosgey are accused of being co-perpetrators in the murder, deportation and commission of other offenses against supporters of Kenya's Party of National Unity. E.J. Hogendoorn of the International Crisis Group said the case is "a major victory, especially for civil society in Kenya, and it is potentially a significant step to the end of impunity in Kenya."

chatgpt: Three individuals have appeared before the International Criminal Court (ICC) to face charges of organizing violence that led to the death of over 1,000 people in Kenya following a disputed election. The accused, whose identities have not been disclosed, are among six people who have been charged for their alleged role in the violence. The accused made their first court appearance at The Hague, Netherlands, where the ICC is based. The case has been described by one of the accused as sounding like something out of a movie due to the seriousness of the allegations. The violence that rocked Kenya in 2007-08 was sparked by a disputed presidential election that pitted supporters of two political parties, leading to deadly clashes that lasted for months. The ICC alleges that the accused organized and coordinated the acts of violence that resulted in the deaths of over one thousand people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of others. Kenya has challenged the jurisdiction of the ICC, arguing that the case should be heard in its own courts. In 2013, Kenyaâ€™s parliament passed a motion calling on the government to withdraw from the ICC. However, the government later withdrew the motion, stating that it was committed to cooperating with the court. The ICC has faced criticism for its focus on African countries, with some African leaders accusing the court of targeting them unfairly. However, the court has defended its actions, stating that it is committed to ensuring that those responsible for serious crimes are held accountable. In addition to the three individuals who have appeared before the ICC, three others are still at large and their whereabouts remain unknown. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for the three, but they have yet to be apprehended. The ICC has been investigating the situation in Kenya since 2009, and the case has been closely followed by human rights groups and international observers. The case is expected to be closely watched as it could set a precedent on whether the ICC has the jurisdiction to prosecute those accused of crimes committed in a country that challenges its jurisdiction. The trial is expected to be lengthy and complex, and the prosecution will have to present strong evidence linking the accused to the crimes. The court has encouraged the accused to cooperate with the prosecutors and to ensure they receive a fair trial. The ICC has a mandate to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and other serious crimes that threaten the international community. While the court has faced challenges and criticism over the years, it continues to play a vital role in holding those responsible for serious crimes accountable for their actions.
