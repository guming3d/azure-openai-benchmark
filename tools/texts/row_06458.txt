He said: 'I am always willing to give players chances but they have to take them. I can't do that for them. The possibility is there and all the youngsters have to know that.

chatgpt: Neil Warnock, the newly appointed manager of Crystal Palace, has criticised Manchester United for their mishandling of Wilfried Zaha, who rejoined Palace on a season-long loan earlier this summer. He also claimed that his new club does not have time for young players, a statement which directly contradicts the promises made by Louis van Gaal, the United manager, that young players will be given a chance to shine this season. Warnock, who has a history of being open and forthright with his opinions, did not hold back in his criticism of United's handling of Zaha. "I think he was just messed around," he said, "and eventually he was so disillusioned that he had to leave the club. It's a shame, because he's a very talented player who could have become a star at United if he had been given a proper chance." Zaha, who was signed by United in 2013, has struggled to make an impact during his time at Old Trafford, making just four first-team appearances before being sent out on loan to Cardiff City last season. Warnock, who also brought Andy Johnson back to Palace, believes that United failed to recognise Zaha's potential and did not give him the guidance he needed to succeed. Warnock's comments are particularly interesting given his stance on young players at his new club. Speaking at his first press conference as Palace manager, he claimed that he has no time for young players and that he is only interested in bringing in experienced professionals who can get results. While this approach may be surprising to some, it is worth noting that Warnock has always been a manager who values experience over youth. During his previous spell at Palace, he built a team that was packed with seasoned professionals, many of whom were well into their thirties. Louis van Gaal, however, has taken a different approach to team-building at United. The Dutchman has made it clear that he intends to develop a squad that is based on youth and energy, rather than experience and caution. In recent pre-season games, he has given a number of young players the chance to impress, including Tyler Blackett, Reece James and Andreas Perreira. Van Gaal has claimed that he will continue to give young players a chance this season, despite Warnock's comments. "We have a lot of talented young players in the squad," he said, "and I intend to give them all the opportunity to develop and show what they can do." It remains to be seen whether Warnock's preference for experience or Van Gaal's faith in youth will prove to be the more successful approach, but one thing is clear: Zaha will be hoping that his loan spell at Palace will give him the chance to prove United wrong and show what he is capable of on the Premier League stage.
