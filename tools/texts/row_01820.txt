Speaking to the paper, a royal source said: 'He hasn't made a final decision yet on his future but he is there or thereabouts. 'His tour of duty can finish any time between the end of March and September and the expectation is that it will be over towards the latter half  of that period.' A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Duke had reached the stage in his service called tour review. It means he will sit down with his superiors to discuss his next step. The spokesman added: 'The review happens about six months from the end of the tour. 'An individual might move on before the end date of their tour, depending on the availability of personnel, they may stay in post or they may even be asked to stay on longer, if required. 'There are no hard and fast rules.' Change: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to move out of the farmhouse where they have been able to live a normal life on Anglesey .
