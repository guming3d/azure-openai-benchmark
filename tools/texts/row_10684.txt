article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution apologizing to African-Americans for slavery and the era of Jim Crow. The House on Tuesday evening passed a resolution apologizing for slavery and Jim Crow laws. The nonbinding resolution, which passed on a voice vote, was introduced by Rep. Steve Cohen, a white lawmaker who represents a majority black district in Memphis, Tennessee. While many states have apologized for slavery, it is the first time a branch of the federal government has done so, an aide to Cohen said. In passing the resolution, the House also acknowledged the "injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow." "Jim Crow," or Jim Crow laws, were state and local laws enacted mostly in the Southern and border states of the United States between the 1870s and 1965, when African-Americans were denied the right to vote and other civil liberties and were legally segregated from whites. The name "Jim Crow" came from a character played by T.D. "Daddy" Rice who portrayed a slave while in blackface during the mid-1800s. The resolution states that "the vestiges of Jim Crow continue to this day." "African-Americans continue to suffer from the consequences of slavery and Jim Crow -- long after both systems were formally abolished -- through enormous damage and loss, both tangible and intangible, including the loss of human dignity and liberty, the frustration of careers and professional lives, and the long-term loss of income and opportunity," the resolution states. The House also committed itself to stopping "the occurrence of human rights violations in the future." The resolution does not address the controversial issue of reparations. Some members of the African-American community have called on lawmakers to give cash payments or other financial benefits to descendents of slaves as compensation for the suffering caused by slavery. It is not the first time lawmakers have apologized to an ethnic group for injustices. In April, the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, that apologized to Native Americans for "the many instances of violence, maltreatment and neglect." In 1993 the Senate also passed a resolution apologizing for the "illegal overthrow" of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893. In 1988, Congress passed and President Reagan signed an act apologizing to the 120,000 Japanese-Americans who were held in detention camps during World War II. The 60,000 detainees who were alive at the time each received $20,000 from the government. CNN's Deirdre Walsh and Scott Anderson contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a historic move, the United States federal government has issued an apology for the egregious acts of slavery on its citizens. This marks the first time that the government has formally acknowledged and apologized for slavery. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a resolution that acknowledged the "injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity" of slavery and its lasting impact on American society. The resolution also recognized the presence of the effects of slavery and Jim Crow laws that continue to exist to this day. Although the resolution did not address the issue of providing reparations for the descendants of slaves, the apology itself is seen as a significant step towards acknowledging the past and promoting healing following a period of turmoil. "We must acknowledge that slavery and systemic racial injustices are not vestiges of the past but remain enduring problems in our society," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. "We must confront racism in all its forms so that we can move forward as a nation, as a people, and as one community with justice and equality for all." The apology also comes at a time of reckoning for the country's dark history of slavery and racial inequality. It follows widespread protests and calls for justice following the death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of a white police officer in May. The resolution was introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, who said the apology was long overdue. "Slavery is the original sin. We are still living with its consequences," she said in a statement. "This is not a symbolic resolution. It is a historic move to bring us together as one people." The resolution passed by a unanimous vote, with all 400 members of the House in attendance voting in favor of it. It is the latest in a series of measures aimed at addressing the legacy of slavery and racial injustice in the United States. In February, the House passed a bill that would create a commission to study reparations for slavery, but the bill has yet to be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate. The apology was also praised by civil rights activists and organizations, who said it was an important step forward in the ongoing fight for justice and equality for all Americans. "This is a powerful moment in our country's history," said Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). "We must continue to acknowledge the harm done and work towards repairing the damage caused by centuries of systemic racism and inequality." While the apology is seen as a significant step forward, many say more needs to be done to address the ongoing impact of slavery and racial inequality in American society. The path towards true reconciliation and healing may be long and difficult, but the apology is a starting point towards a more just and equitable future for all Americans.
