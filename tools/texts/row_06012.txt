The driver of the car, a man from Brighton, was left seriously injured with a broken leg and was taken to hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the two passengers in the car managed to escape the accident with only minor injuries.

Coastguard teams immediately deployed a helicopter to the area to assist with the rescue effort. Twenty-one firefighters, along with hazardous rescue experts, were also called to the scene to help with the difficult operation.

Once the car was secured, the driver was carefully extracted and taken to the nearby hospital for treatment of his serious injuries.
