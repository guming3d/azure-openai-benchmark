Most people tend to use irons to remove creases from their clothing and bed linen. But one enterprising artist chose to mimic his artistic heroes by doing quite the opposite - using his trusty domestic tool to purposefully crease a white sheet. The technique helped the artist create replicas of masterpieces by classic Dutch painters van Gogh, Rembrandt and Vermeer. Scroll down for video .

The works have all been skilfully recreated to be used in an advert for electrical company Philips in Russia. One of Vincent van Gogh’s most renowned works, Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe, is one of the piece's interpreted by the artist using his iron. Known for his distinctive self-portraits, this particular piece captures van Gogh after he famously cut off part of his own ear - although historians have debated whether he was maimed by somebody else. Completed in 1889, the year before his death, the painting shows van Gogh smoking a pipe and wearing a hat. It is currently part of a private collection.

Girl With a Pearl Earring is widely regarded as Johannes Vermeer's best work. It is usually housed in the Mauritshuis gallery, based in The Hague, although the famous painting is currently part of the gallery's touring collection in Japan. A novel of the same name was written by author Tracy Chevalier in 1999 based on the fictional character. A film adaption of the book was released in 2003, starring Scarlett Johansson. The last painting reworked by the artist was Rembrandt’s Self-Portrait with Beret and Turned-Up Collar. The self-portrait has been housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC since 1937, having been painted by the artist in 1659.

chatgpt: Amsterdam's iconic Rijksmuseum is known for its vast collection of Dutch masterpieces, boasting an impressive array of works by renowned artists such as Vincent van Gogh, Rembrandt, and Johannes Vermeer. However, the museum has recently decided to put an unusual twist on some of their best-loved paintings, with the launch of a new interactive exhibition that brings these works to life in an unexpected way. The exhibition, titled "Living Masterpieces," uses cutting-edge technology to animate selected paintings from the museum's permanent collection. Visitors to the exhibition can watch as these masterpieces come to life before their eyes, with animations that reveal hidden details and tell the stories behind some of the most famous paintings in the world. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the museum's newly animated version of van Gogh's "Almond Blossom." The famous painting has been brought to life in a whole new way, with the delicate blossoms shaking and swaying in a gentle breeze, and the artist's signature swirling brushstrokes given a sense of movement that is unlike any static painting. Elsewhere in the exhibition, visitors can watch as Rembrandt's haunting "Night Watch" is transformed into a fully immersive experience, with figures from the painting stepping out of their frames and interacting with each other in real-time. While some may argue that such an approach risks detracting from the original works themselves, the museum insists that the exhibition is simply a new way of engaging visitors with art. "We're not trying to replace the original masterpieces in any way," explains a spokesperson for the Rijksmuseum. "Rather, we believe that this exhibition allows people to appreciate these paintings in a new and exciting way. We hope that it will inspire visitors to look at art with fresh eyes and engage with these works on a deeper level than ever before." The exhibition has been a hit with visitors, who have praised the museum for its innovative approach to bringing art to life. "It's like nothing I've ever seen before," says one enthusiastic visitor. "I've been to a lot of art exhibitions in my time, but this is something really special. It's like the paintings have been given a breath of fresh air, and you can really feel the life behind them." As well as bringing works by van Gogh, Rembrandt, and Vermeer to life, the exhibition also includes interactive elements that allow visitors to create their own masterpieces, using the same techniques and styles as the Dutch masters of old. Whether you're a long-time art lover or a newcomer to the world of Dutch art, "Living Masterpieces" offers a unique and immersive way to explore some of the greatest works of art ever produced.
