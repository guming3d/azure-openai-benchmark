chatgpt: Sedgefield Veterans, a group of former military personnel in County Durham, have been holding services every time a soldier is repatriated back to the UK. This tradition has been in place for years as a way to honor and pay respect to fallen soldiers. However, a rare exception was made after the horrific killing of Lee Rigby in Woolwich. Rigby, a Fusilier in the British Army, was brutally attacked and killed by two Islamist extremists in May 2013. The incident shocked the nation and sparked a wave of grief and anger among the public. In the days that followed, various communities and groups around the country held vigils, memorials, and other events to remember Rigby and show support for his family and fellow soldiers. One such group was Sedgefield Veterans, who had been informed of Rigby's repatriation to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. The group, led by Royal Marine veteran Trevor Coult and former army medic Graham Routledge, decided to attend the repatriation ceremony at the air base on May 24. Speaking to local media after the event, Coult said it was important for them to be there to show solidarity with Rigby's family and fellow soldiers. "We wanted to pay our respects to Lee and show our support for the military community," he said. "We knew it was a deviation from our normal routine, but we felt it was the right thing to do." Routledge added that the group had received positive feedback from other veterans and members of the public who had also attended the ceremony. "It was a somber occasion, of course, but there was also a sense of unity and pride among those who were there," he said. "We were honored to have been a part of it." Since then, Sedgefield Veterans have continued to hold their regular services whenever a soldier is repatriated to the region. The group, which was formed in 2012, has become a well-known and respected presence at repatriation events across the country. Their simple, yet powerful, tribute involves standing in silent solidarity as the hearse carrying the deceased soldier passes by. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the mental health and well-being of military veterans, particularly those who have served in combat zones. Sedgefield Veterans are among the many organizations and groups that have been working to support and assist veterans in need. Their commitment to honoring fallen soldiers is just one example of the important work they do. As the nation remembers the sacrifice of Lee Rigby and other fallen soldiers, groups like Sedgefield Veterans will continue to play an important role in ensuring that their service and sacrifice is never forgotten.
