Martinez (centre) let in five goals in his previous appearance - against Reading in the Capital One Cup . A product of Arsenal's youth system, Martinez had played just twice for the club - his last appearance came in the kamikaze 7-5 Capital One Cup win over Reading two years ago. Martinez spent a period on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last year. He played 15 times for the Owls but the Champions League tie in Anderlecht will be the biggest match he has been involved in since his arrival in England. Like our Arsenal Facebook page. Emiliano Martinez? Doesn't sound born and bred north London? You're right, but he's been part of the Arsenal set-up for four years now so is no stranger to the capital. He arrived from Argentinian club Independiente in 2010, joining Arsenal's youth system. He must be a talent for Arsenal to bring him all the way from South America? By all accounts he is. He's very highly-rated among the academy staff at Arsenal, playing regularly for the Under 21s, and was expected to make a significant impact at first-team level. He is a former Argentina youth international to boot. So it's not gone according to plan then? Not quite. Despite his talent, he has found it tough to dislodge Wojciech Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski (now at Swansea) in the Gunners squad since graduating from the academy. He may have thought he'd be promoted to second-choice keeper following Fabianski's exit, but David Ospina's signing means he remains as third choice. So he's played twice for Arsenal. How did they go? Not great, he's conceded six goals in those two previous appearances for the club, both coming in the League Cup. He helped Arsenal to a 6-1 win over Coventry in September 2012 before conceding five more in the 7-5 win over Reading a few weeks later. He hasn't played since. Still, 100 per cent win record, though. That's not much first-team experience though, is it? True. But he spent the back end of last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, where he made 15 appearances, in which he kept two clean sheets.

chatgpt: Emiliano Martinez, Arsenal's third-choice goalkeeper, is set to make his Champions League debut on Wednesday night. The Argentine has only made two first-team appearances for the Gunners, both of which were in domestic cup competitions, and conceded six goals in total. Martinez's first appearance for Arsenal came against Coventry in a Capital One Cup match in September 2012, where he conceded one goal in a 6-1 victory for the Gunners. His next appearance would not come until over a year later, in a League Cup match against Reading, where he conceded five goals in a shock 7-5 defeat for Arsenal. Despite his lack of game time, Martinez has remained a loyal member of the squad and has been praised by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. "He is a very good goalkeeper who has the potential to play at the highest level," Wenger said in a press conference ahead of Wednesday's match. Martinez's unexpected Champions League debut comes as a result of both Wojciech Szczesny's suspension and David Ospina's recent thigh injury. The 24-year-old may seize the opportunity to prove himself as a reliable backup option to the Arsenal goalkeeping duo. Arsenal's opponents on Wednesday night are Olympiacos, a Greek club with a strong attacking lineup. Olympiacos have already scored four goals in their two group stage matches, and Martinez will face a tough challenge in keeping them at bay. Martinez's inclusion in the Arsenal starting lineup is a sign of the faith that Wenger has in his squad depth. Arsenal have faced numerous injuries this season, including long-term absences for key players like Jack Wilshere, Francis Coquelin, and Danny Welbeck. Despite these setbacks, Arsenal are still in a strong position in both the Premier League and the Champions League. The Gunners sit in second place in their Champions League group, level on points with Olympiacos but with a better goal difference. A win for Arsenal on Wednesday night would put them in a strong position to progress to the knockout stages of the competition. For Martinez, the match is an opportunity to show that he is ready to step up and contribute to Arsenal's success. The goalkeeper will be looking to keep a clean sheet and help his team secure three points. If he can do so, he will have taken a significant step forward in his Arsenal career.
