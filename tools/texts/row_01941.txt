article: By . Alexandra Klausner . One artist created an intricate model of a fast food restaurant entirely out of wood . Roxy Paine created the piece 'Carcass', an installation comprised of two large scale dioramas at the Kavi Gupta gallery in Chicago. This is part of 'Apparatus', Paine's first solo show in Chicago. Paine's replica leaves no detail behind and is equipped with a deep fryer and a soft serve ice-cream machine. What's missing however,  are big logos and any semblance of food. The other diorama is meant to resemble a control room with an unknown function, reports thisiscolassal.com. The models are made of birch, maple, glass, and are accented by fluorescent lighting. 'Paine transforms the environments on display by using the diorama’s traditional experience as a tool to create a contemplative experience where what we see behind the glass transitions between being real and being a mere shell of something real,' says the gallery's website. The gallery's website explains that in the Greek language diorama quite literally translates to, 'through that which is seen.' 'Roxy Paine introduces a new chapter in his work, a series of large scale dioramas. Inspired by spaces and environments designed to be activated via human interaction, a fast-food restaurant and a control room, the dioramas present spaces and objects which are hand carved from birch and maple wood and formed from steel, encased and frozen in time, void of human presence, making their inherent function obsolete,' explains the website. The spaces the artist creates are reliant on the viewer's 'human interaction' to give them a function and are otherwise devoid of meaning. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wood you eat in this kitchen?

chatgpt: New York-based artist Roxy Paine has created two impressive wooden installations that are on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The intricate models depict a fast food kitchen and a control room, both of which are designed to play with the viewer's perception of reality. Paine's installations, quite literally called "Diorama," draw inspiration from the Greek term which means "that which is seen." But unlike traditional dioramas which are often used for educational purposes, Paine's works require the viewers to engage with them in order to fully understand their meaning. The fast food kitchen installation is a sight to behold, with its intricate attention to detail and use of a variety of materials. The installation is made of birch, maple, and glass, with fluorescent lighting accents adding to its sleek look. From a distance, the diorama looks like a perfectly functioning fast food kitchen, complete with food stashed in refrigerators and cooking utensils on the counters. But as viewers approach the installation, they begin to see small imperfections that reveal the artificial nature of the display. The utensils, for example, are glued to the counters, and the food is made of plastic. This contrast between the realistic depiction and the artificial components is what gives the installation its unique meaning. Paine's second installation, the control room, follows a similar theme. The sprawling room is filled with switches, levers, and lights that mimic the control room of a factory or power station. The artist uses a combination of wood and glass to create an effect that is both realistic and surreal. Like the fast food kitchen, the control room is meant to play with the viewer's perception of reality. The switches and levers produce no electricity, and the lights have no real function. They are merely props, designed to give the viewer the sense of being in a control room while simultaneously reminding them that they are not. Paine's installations are a testament to the power of art to challenge our perceptions of the world around us. By using realistic depictions of everyday objects and spaces, and contrasting them with artificial elements, the artist forces viewers to think more deeply about the world they inhabit. The installations are a must-see for anyone interested in the power of art to transform the way we think and see.
