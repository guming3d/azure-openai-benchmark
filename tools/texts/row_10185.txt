A British inventor has made a 'tsunami survival' capsule, and is to test it by going over Niagara Falls. Aerospace engineer Julian Sharpe, 50, believes his disaster-proof pod will save people from tidal waves, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and super storms. And he is so confident of the life-saving aluminium ball that he will ride it down the world-famous 167ft waterfall. Survival: Former Boeing engineer Julian Shape has designed a pod which will keep people safe during natural disasters including tsunamis and hurricanes . He said: 'We can tell people how strong it is, but until you've proved that it's saved a life they might not believe you.' Mr Sharpe claims the sphere will protect him from the massive impact, which will be similar to being rear ended by a car at about 20 mph. He believes the capsule will keep people safe in natural disasters, such as the tsunamis which hit Thailand and Japan. In a tsunami the main danger is not drowning in the fast flowing water but being crushed by the debris which is swept along. He said: 'Since it's a sphere, when you do run into something it's just going to glance off. 'In most cases, you're probably going to be a bit lighter than those objects so those objects will just go along their way and kind of move you.' Drop: Mr Sharpe is to prove how strong the pod is by going over Niagara Falls . Mr Sharpe was born in Carmarthern, West Wales, but now lives in Seattle in the United States. The former Boeing engineer has taken his prototypes to the Yokohama Expo in Kanagawa, Japan, and sponsors have commissioned further production. Now Mr Sharpe and his business partners are hoping to sell different models of the capsule for between £650 and £3,250 . Disaster: British search and rescue teams on the ground in Ofunato, Japan, where they were flown in to help search for survivors of the county's biggest earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2011 . He claims the capsule will keep up to six people safe for several hours while it is buffeted by a Tsunami's powerful wave. He said: 'After the tsunami in Japan, we decided we had to develop it and get it out there for the masses. 'There are 135 countries worldwide exposed to the tsunami wave. 'If you can save one life, it would be worth producing it.'

chatgpt: Julian Sharpe, a renowned innovator, has created a groundbreaking solution to help people survive natural disasters. The invention, known as the "pod," is a sturdy aluminium capsule designed to keep six people safe for hours. The inspiration behind the pod was the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and its subsequent impact overturned Sharpe's life's goal. In an exclusive interview, Sharpe shared his motivation for creating the pod, stating, "I wanted to develop something that could help people when they are most vulnerable. A lot of casualties in natural disasters happen due to a lack of protection and shelter, and I wanted to change that. The pod has the potential to save countless lives in times of crisis." The pod is not only tough on the outside, but it also has a compact and efficient design that boasts of a ventilation system, an emergency light, and basic supplies such as food and water. Sharpe and his team are not satisfied with just the pod's design and wish to test how much protection it offers. Their solution is to go over one of the most colossal waterfalls in the world - Niagara Falls. The test will involve the pod plunging down the 167-foot-tall Niagara Falls, simulating a high-intensity natural disaster, and will evaluate the pod's durability and survival capabilities. Sharpe believes that the pod can withstand the impact and keep people safe, and this test will only strengthen his belief. The experiment has garnered traction in the media, with hundreds of people eager to watch and learn more about the pod's potential. Sharpe has also received support from major organizations that have offered to finance his venture. The test is set to take place next month, and Sharpe is confident that it will be a success. "I believe the pod is the answer to a problem that has plagued society for centuries. If we can prove its effectiveness, it can be a game-changer for millions of people worldwide," he exclaimed. In conclusion, the invention of the pod by Julian Sharpe is a significant step towards countering natural disasters' impact. Its sturdy design and efficient features make it an ideal solution for protecting people during crises. The upcoming test at Niagara Falls will serve as a marker for the pod's durability and survival capacity and will determine its potential in facing natural disasters. Millions are now closely monitoring the pod and Sharpe's imminent experiment, eagerly waiting for its success.
