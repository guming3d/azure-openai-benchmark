A boy of seven unwittingly ran up a £1,300 bill on a 'free' iPad app after he downloaded expensive extras in error. Heidi Drager bought her son Jack the Tap Zoo app which she downloaded from Apple's App Store but days later her bank statement showed he had run up £1,300 of 'in-app' purchases. Jack had apparently been collecting 'virtual' animals with golden coins whose charges range from £1 to £79.99. Ms Drager, 32, of Barnsley, South . Yorkshire, said: 'It was a free download. We read the terms and . conditions and made sure it looked suitable. There was nothing to say . there was any cost involved.' She added: 'It all happened over four . days. Poor Jack was crying his eyes out because he didn't realise he was . doing anything wrong. 'It is not his fault. I think people really need to be aware that this is happening. A lot of these free apps are directed at children.' The App Store carries a warning at the top of the page for Tap Zoo saying it allows 'in-app' purchases and that users may want to disable the feature. Ms Drager says she did not see the warning when she downloaded the app for her son. Apple has now agreed to refund the bill. An Apple spokesman said: 'We are proud to have industry-leading parental controls. 'Parents can easily use our parental control settings to restrict app downloading and turn-off in-app purchasing. 'In addition to a password being required to buy an app on the App Store a re-entry of your password is now required when making an in-app purchase.'

chatgpt: A mother from Swansea has spoken out about her son's troubling experience with in-app purchases on his mobile phone. The youngster, referred to as Jack, reportedly spent over £100 on various in-app purchases without realizing that he was spending real money. According to his mother, the incident occurred over four days. Jack was crying his eyes out because he didn't realize he was doing anything wrong. It wasn't until the mother received a shocking credit card bill that she discovered her son's expensive habit. The mother is now urging parents to monitor their children's mobile phone usage, particularly in relation to in-app purchases. She acknowledged that her son's case served as a wake-up call for her, and she hopes that her story will serve as a cautionary tale to other parents. In-app purchases are a common feature in many mobile games and applications. They allow users to buy virtual items or currency using real money, often with the promise of enhancing their experience or providing them with an advantage in the game. However, children may not fully understand that they are spending real money and can easily rack up large bills without realizing it. This is not the first time that in-app purchases have caused controversy. In 2014, Apple was forced to refund millions of dollars to parents whose children had unwittingly spent money on in-app purchases. The company eventually changed its policies, making it harder for children to make purchases without their parents' permission. It is clear that parents must be vigilant when it comes to monitoring their children's mobile phone usage. In-app purchases may seem harmless, but they can quickly add up and cause significant financial strain. As for Jack's mother, she is relieved to have caught the issue before it spiraled out of control and hopes that other parents will learn from her story.
