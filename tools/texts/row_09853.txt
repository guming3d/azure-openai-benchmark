Detective Constable Phil Kennedy said: 'Both defendants knew they were in touch with a 15-year-old girl, but that did not stop them from their campaign of online grooming. 'The discovery of nine indecent images at Peat’s house illustrates that he had no issues with child sex offending. Indecent images of this nature endorse the abuse of children. 'Today’s outcome illustrates that Greater Manchester Police, working closely with partner agencies such as the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP), is committed to tackling the issue of online abuse.'
