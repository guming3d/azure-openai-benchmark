chatgpt: A couple from Illinois has been charged for the death of their 78-year-old mother, Janet Mackozdi. Michael and Jassy Anglin are facing allegations of neglect that led to Mackozdi's death due to hypothermia. It is believed that she was 'forced to live' in a shipping container on the couple's property where the temperature is reported to have dropped below freezing. The couple, instead of seeking help for Mackozdi, tried to mislead authorities by driving her to the hospital three hours after the time of her death. As a result, authorities started investigating over their attempts to cover up the cause of death. Mackozdi's death has left the community in shock, including her neighbor Brenda White, who said that she would have never thought such a thing could happen in her neighborhood. "You just never know who your neighbors really are," she added. According to a statement by the Mercer County Sheriff's Office, the couple has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, criminal neglect, and obstruction of justice. Involuntary manslaughter is defined as unintentionally causing the death of another person while criminally neglecting someone is failing to provide necessary care or shelter to a person in your custody. Obstruction of justice refers to any interference, obstruction, or impediment in the administration of justice. The Anglin's bail has been set at $1 million each as the investigation into Mackozdi's death continues. It has been reported that Mackozdi was in generally good health before she was forced to live in the shipping container. Friends and neighbors have expressed their condolences for Mackozdi and have offered their support to her family. The county officials, including the prosecutor and the sheriff's office, have called the case 'tragic and disturbing.' A spokesperson for the County also said that this case stresses the importance of keeping an eye on your loved ones and elderly neighbors, especially during harsh weather conditions. The Anglin's have yet to release any statement regarding the charges or Mackozdi's death. They are set to appear in court in the coming weeks, and if found guilty, they could face several years in prison. The community remains in shock and disbelief over the tragic event. Mackozdi's death is a reminder to pay attention to our loved ones and look out for the elderly and vulnerable members of our local community.
