Jailed: Jonathon Mills, 46, has been sentenced to five years in prison for fraudulently billing an elderly woman for building work . A cowboy builder has been jailed for five years after conning an elderly woman out of her entire £120,000 savings. Jonathon Mills, 46, from Heathfield Newton Abbot, Devon, befriended the victim after she contacted him having seen his advert in a local publication. Over the next two years he then issued her with forty invoices totalling charges of £119,722.14. The victim's family finally contacted authorities after they discovered all the money in the victim's bank account had gone. An expert building surveyor told Exeter Crown Court that the work was only worth . around £24,000, if all that Mills charged for had been completed. The surveyor also identified that some invoices showed work had been charged for twice on a number of different occasions. Evidence showed one of the most . outrageous examples was for a shed for which Mills charged more than £3,500 to build a small two sided outhouse in her . garden. Acting as an expert witness for the prosecution, the surveyor stated: 'In many invoices parts of the . building were supposedly opened again and quite often to apparently deal . with very slightly different issues, yet I find it impossible to . believe that the need for later rectification work was not actually . picked up and done at the earlier time. This is a recurring theme in the . invoices.' Conman: Mills charged the elderly woman £3,500 to build this simple garden shed . Mills, who was jailed for similar offences in 2001, also carried out gas work . for her even though he was not Gas Safe registered, which is a legal . safety requirement. He was sentenced to five years in prison, the maximum penalty for the offences committed after pleading guilty to unfair trading and fraud offences following an investigation by Devon and Somerset Trading Standards Service. Steve Gardiner, Special Investigations Unit Manger for Devon and Somerset Trading Standards Service, said: 'The level of dishonesty and the appalling abuse of trust involved in this case is truly shocking, so it is excellent news that our Trading Standards Team have successfully worked with Devon and Cornwall Police and the Regional Scambusters team in order to bring Mr Mills to justice. 'Mr Mills is a skilled conman and an accomplished liar who deliberately targeted a vulnerable widow, befriending her and gaining her trust. 'He then took advantage of that friendship for his own gains until her money ran out.' Devon County Council launched the investigation, supported by Devon and Cornwall Police and the Regional Trading Standards Scambuster Team, following concerns raised by the victim’s family when they discovered that all the money from her bank account had gone.

chatgpt: A 46-year-old man from Devon named Jonathon Mills was sentenced to five years in jail at the Exeter Crown Court for billing his victim 40 times the actual worth of his work. Mills was found guilty of overcharging, duplicating, and in some instances, not carrying out work. He was convicted after an expert witness told the court that the work he carried out was worth at most £24,000. The court heard that Mills billed a vulnerable victim, whose identity was not revealed, for work that he falsely claimed to have done. According to the prosecution, the victim was left financially ruined after Mills took all of her savings. It was revealed that Mills billed the victim for work that was overpriced, inappropriately charged, or never done. The victim's family raised the alarm after discovering that all of her savings had been depleted. They raised concerns about the large number of bills that Mills had sent them, which covered a wide range of services from gardening to cleaning. During the trial, an expert witness told the court that the actual value of the work carried out by Mills was a mere fraction of the amount he charged. The witness said that the value of the work carried out by Mills was worth no more than £24,000. This was significantly lower than the £225,000 that Mills had billed the victim for. In her statement to the court, the victim said that she had trusted Mills completely and was left shocked and devastated when she discovered the true extent of his deception. She said that she had believed that Mills was a reliable and honest individual who would never break her trust. However, the reality was that she was robbed of everything she had worked hard for. The victim's family also spoke of their devastation and anger at the way Mills had treated their loved one. They said that they had no idea that Mills was charging such exorbitant fees and that they trusted him completely. In sentencing Mills, Judge Peter Johnson said that he had taken advantage of a vulnerable victim and that his actions were despicable. He said that the level of deceit was staggering and that Mills had shown no remorse for what he had done. This case highlights the importance of vigilance when hiring contractors or tradespeople. It is always essential to obtain multiple quotes and verify the credentials of the individuals or companies before engaging their services. Victims of such fraudulent contractors should not feel ashamed or embarrassed about coming forward, as they are not alone, and there are many support mechanisms in place to help them.
