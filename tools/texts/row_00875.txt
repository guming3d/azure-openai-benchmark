Joshua Stephens, 22, a 'sadistic' father who hit his newborn daughter and admitted he had an overwhelming desire to cause her pain . A sadistic father has been jailed for four years after he beat his newborn daughter and told police he wanted to cause her pain. Joshua Stephens, 22, was violent towards the unnamed baby for the first six weeks of her life before he confessed to his wife about what he had done. Among the most brutal acts he carried out, Stephens held a pillow over the child's face and forced her head under water while giving her a bath. Stephens, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, was told by a judge that he posed a significant risk to the public after hearing that he had slapped the girl 'as hard as you would hit a man'. After admitting to his wife what he had done, Stephens went to a police station and told officers he had an overwhelming desire to hurt his daughter. He was jailed for four years and told he must serve an extended licence period of four years upon his release after pleading guilty to cruelty to a child and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Sentencing Stephens on Wednesday, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: 'It is obvious that these incidents occurred as a result of your sadistic desire to cause pain and distress to your daughter. 'This was a gross breach of trust on a vulnerable child.' The horrifying abuse came to light on September 4 last year when Stephens hit the youngster 'as hard as he could' when she woke up crying for a feed. His daughter was left with a bruised cheek from the blow. His wife was out of the room at the time and he admitted what he had done when she returned. Sentencing Stephens at Leeds Crown Court (pictured), Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: 'It is obvious that these incidents occurred as a result of your sadistic desire to cause pain and distress to your daughter' He also told his wifeâ€™s father about what he had done before going to a police station and telling an officer: 'I hit my daughter and smothered her.' He underwent a psychiatric assessment and told a doctor that he had a history of self harming from the age of 14 and had strong urges to punch objects and use knives. The doctor diagnosed Stephens as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and was prone to impulsive and unpredictable behaviour. Judge Marson added: 'There is at the moment a significant risk of serious harm to the public.'

chatgpt: Joshua Stephens, a 22-year-old man from Alabama, has been sentenced to four years in prison for assaulting a six-week-old baby girl. The incident, which occurred earlier this year, saw Stephens repeatedly subject the infant to violent abuse. He was only caught after confessing the details to his wife. According to court documents, Stephens was alone with the baby girl on several occasions when he became overwhelmed with anger and frustration. He would then physically assault her, leaving marks and bruises on her body. However, he managed to keep the abuse hidden from his wife for some time.  It wasn't until he slapped the baby girl that Stephens confessed to his wife about his horrendous behavior towards the infant. His wife immediately alerted the police, who took him into custody for questioning. During the investigation, Stephens admitted to the assault and other acts of cruelty towards the baby girl. He expressed remorse for his actions and reportedly told investigators that he loved the baby girl and did not intend to hurt her. Despite his confession, Stephens received a four year jail term for assault and cruelty. Judge Theodore S. Brown, who presided over the case, called the abuse "heartbreaking" and "unforgivable". He emphasized that Stephens' actions not only harmed the baby girl but also impacted all those who loved her and would care for her in the future. The case highlights the importance of speaking out against violence and abuse, particularly when it comes to children who are unable to defend themselves. It also serves as a reminder of the severity of the consequences for those who perpetrate such heinous acts. While the baby girl in this case will hopefully receive the care and support she needs to recover from her physical injuries, the emotional scars inflicted by Stephens' cruelty may last a lifetime. The hope now is that the justice system will continue to hold individuals like Stephens accountable for their actions in order to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.  In the end, the sentence handed down to Stephens may not be enough to fully restore justice for the victim and her family. But it sends a clear message that violence and abuse, particularly against those who cannot fight back, will not be tolerated in society.
