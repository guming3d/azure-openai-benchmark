Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- American soldiers returning from Haiti in the early '20s and '30s came home with arresting tales of voodoo potions, black magic, and living-dead zombies. They published their stories in mass-market pulp novels, which in turn inspired horror movies and eventually made their corporeal way to our supermarket aisles during Halloween. But back in Haiti, zombies are real still. Late last year, just prior to the devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that ravaged the country, VBS producer Santiago Stelley-Fernandez, a camera crew, and I headed to Port-au-Prince in search of the undead, known locally as Nzambi. We had investigative forbearers. In 1937, American folklorist and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston traveled to Haiti and encountered the case of Felicia Felix-Mentor, a woman who villagers claimed had died in 1907 at the age of 29 but had returned to the living 20 years later. Hurston investigated the rumors and discovered evidence that powerful drugs were used to replicate a death-like state. See the rest of Nzambi at VBS.TV . In 1982, scientist Wade Davis traveled to Port-au-Prince to research the ethnobiological base of the Haitian zombie, procuring the secret poisons used in the procedure and discovering that the undead are far from a folkloric myth, like vampires or werewolves. He concluded that voodoo priests were employing a concoction of tetrodotoxin, a chemical derived from the puffer fish that produces paralysis and can mimic death -- it is 100 times as deadly as cyandide, and something I have a longstanding interest in. After zombification, a mind-controlling drug made from a plant called Datura stramonium was administered to the patient. Despite unlocking the chemical basis of this phenomenon, however, Davis maintained that zombification was not created purely through these poisons, but indeed relied on a tradition of voodoo sorcery hundreds of years old. Thirty years later, and under the guidance of a massive local man who had survived fourteen bullets to the face, I was off to conduct my own zombie investigation. I traveled the countryside, spoke with sorcerers, and collected (and consumed) samples of the legendary poison. I went heavily armed into places that require you to be heavily armed. After months of labor, rigorous chemical analysis of the samples, several incidents that had our entire party mortally afraid, and untold numbers of night visions at the hands of total zombie preoccupation, we're finally ready to share our findings.

chatgpt: Stories of zombies in Haiti have long been a fascination of many, inspiring films and shaping our concept of what a zombie is. But what is the true story behind the idea of the “Haitian zombie?” Anthropologist Wade Davis has dedicated his life to studying Haitian zombies, and his work has shed light on the reality of the phenomenon. A new documentary from Vice’s VBS channel aims to explore this topic further, traveling to Haiti to conduct their own investigation. Wade Davis’ study of Haitian zombies began in the 1980s, when he traveled to Haiti to learn more about the country’s culture and beliefs. He quickly became fascinated by the stories he heard about zombies – seemingly dead individuals who would later rise from the grave and be forced to work as slaves. Davis spent years studying these stories, searching for the roots of the phenomenon and the truth behind the myths. Through his research, Davis discovered that Haitian zombies were not the brain-eating monsters we see in popular culture. Instead, they were individuals who had been poisoned with a toxic powder known as tetrodotoxin. This poison, which is obtained from pufferfish, can cause paralysis and mimic death. Once the victim was buried, a bokor, or voodoo sorcerer, would dig up the body and revive them, turning them into a kind of slave. Davis’ work helped to demystify the Haiti zombie phenomenon, showing that it was not the result of dark magic or curses. Instead, it was the result of a toxic substance used by bokors to control others. His research also led to the development of antidotes for tetrodotoxin, which could be used to save the lives of victims who had been wrongly assumed dead. Vice’s VBS channel brings its own perspective to the story, traveling to Haiti to conduct their own investigation into the phenomenon. Their documentary, which was released in 2019, follows journalist Ben Anderson as he meets with experts on Haitian culture and explores the country's dark side. Anderson also meets with bokors, some of whom claim to be able to use magic to control the minds of others. As he delves deeper into the subject, Anderson becomes increasingly skeptical of the supernatural explanations for zombie phenomenon and finds that it is rooted in more practical concerns. The VBS documentary provides a fascinating look at the history and current state of the Haiti zombie phenomenon. It also highlights the work of experts like Wade Davis, whose dedication to understanding and demystifying this topic has been invaluable. While zombies may be a popular subject in films and pop culture, their reality in Haiti is a complex and sobering one. The continuing interest in the subject shows that we are still hungry for answers and understanding, as we seek to uncover the truth behind this timeless mystery.
