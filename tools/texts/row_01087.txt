To be launched at London Heathrow Airport in September, it is designed to be more spacious, comfortable, quieter and greener than other planes of its kind. Passengers are also promised a ‘clean, purer and draught-free’ quality of cabin air thanks to a new filtering system which changes the air every three minutes and uses special filters to allow 15 different temperature control zones. It does this by creating a ‘curtain of air’ which descends softly from the top to the bottom of the cabin from where it is re-filtered and re-circulated. British Airways is the first airline in Europe to operate both the Airbus A380 and the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

The double-decker superjumbo plane can theoretically carry up to 800 people – provided all the passengers are squeezed into narrow economy-sized seats.

The A380’s first superjumbo long-haul return flight from London to Los Angeles, California, is on September 24, priced from £621 in economy to £2,550 in business and £3,799 in First.
