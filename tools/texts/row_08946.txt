chatgpt: Scotland's youngest ever Commonwealth athlete, Toni Shaw, delivered an impressive performance at Tollcross International Swimming Centre on Friday as she fought her way to a bronze medal in the women's S9 100m butterfly. Shaw, just 14 years old, produced a spectacular final stretch to earn Scotland their second medal of the day, finishing behind New Zealand's Sophie Pascoe and Australia's Madeleine Scott. Pascoe, a 15-time Paralympic medallist, claimed gold with a time of 1:05.09, while Scott clocked in at 1:08.31 to take silver. Shaw, who was born with a condition called proximal femoral focal deficiency that causes one of her legs to be shorter than the other, was delighted with her achievement, becoming the first Scottish para-swimmer to win a Commonwealth medal since 1994. "I'm just so happy. I never expected to come here and medal, so this is just amazing," she said. "I just kept my head down and kept pushing until the end, and it's paid off." Shaw finished fourth in her heats, but produced an excellent performance in the final, touching the wall in a personal best time of 1:09.51. She was initially announced as finishing in fourth place, but after an inquiry from the Scottish team, she was elevated to bronze after officials disqualified Canadian Aurelie Rivard for a false start. Shaw's medal was the second won by Scotland at the Tollcross pool on Friday, with Ross Murdoch winning bronze in the men's 200m breaststroke. Shaw's performance was all the more remarkable given her age, with her youth setting her apart from the other swimmers in the field. She is expected to be a major part of the Scottish para-swimming team for years to come, and her success has been hailed as a major boost for the sport in Scotland. "It's just fantastic for all of us," said Scottish para-swimming coach Chris Gilchrist. "For Toni to come out and do what she did at just 14 years old is amazing. It bodes well for the future of para-swimming in Scotland."
