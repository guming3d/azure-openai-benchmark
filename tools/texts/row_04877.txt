article: New York Citi Bike riders are at risk according to a new audit exposing spotty maintenance checks, poor cleanliness and defective docking stations. Comptroller Scott Stringer released his report Thursday looking at if New York City Bike Share, which manages the scheme, is in compliance with its Department of Transport contract. According to maintenance data, only 28per cent of the 6,000 two-wheelers in Manhattan and Brooklyn were inspected in November 2013, 34per cent in December 2013 and 38per cent in January 2014. Transportation hazard: New York Citi Bike riders are at risk according to a new audit, exposing spotty maintenance checks, poor cleanliness and defective parking stations . 'With every missed maintenance check, the safety risk of undisclosed bike defects increases,' Stringer said. Common defects were said to include missing or broken seats and pedals, flat tires and damaged wheel rims. Of the 29 docking stations sampled in February 2013, the audit showed that only 11 were inspected as required and the remaining 18 were inspected less than twice a week or not at all. And while the contract requires a response to cleanliness complaints within 48 hours for stations, and 96 hours for bikes, the audit found only 60per cent of the sampled complaints for stations were completed within the required time frame. Of the bike cleanliness complaints, 83per cent remained open for an average of 79 days. In addition to problems with maintenance, cleanliness and docking stations, the audit  found stations with disconnected credit-card machines. The accompanying mobile application was also revealed to be unreliable, and in many cases did not reflect the actual number of physically available bikes and open docks. As of last August, Citi Bike riders took about 34,000 rides per day, making the program what Stringer calls a 'critical component of our transportation network.' Shoddy maintenance: According to data, only 28per cent of the 6,000 two-wheelers in Manhattan and Brooklyn were inspected in November 2013, 34per cent in December 2013 and 38per cent in January 2014 . However, the comptroller said improvements must be made to comply with the New York City Department of Transportation. 'New York City Bike Share's management of Citi Bike left too many New Yorkers in the lurch,' Stringer said. 'While Citi Bike has become part of our urban landscape, auditors found that the bike sharing program's spotty maintenance, poorly-cleaned bikes and substandard docking stations inconvenienced riders and discouraged growth in the system.' The private program is named for Citigroup, which spent $41 million to be its lead sponsor. The Bikeshare Holdings company recently announced its plan to purchase Alta Bicycle Share, the parent company of New York City Bike Share - promising an infusion of capital for improvements. In addition, plans are in the works to expand the City Bike system. New York City Bike Share cited worker layoffs and staffing issues to explain many of the problems exposed in Stringer's audit. The investigation ran from May 27 2013 through May 31 2014.

chatgpt: Comptroller Scott Stringer released a report on Thursday revealing that the New York City Bike Share, which manages Citi Bike, is not in compliance with the Department of Transportation. In the report, auditors investigated the operations of the bike-sharing program and found several issues that jeopardized rider safety. The problems ranged from spotty maintenance checks to poor cleanliness and defective parking stations. Some of the main issues identified in the report included the lack of proper maintenance checks for the bicycles in the Citi Bike program. The report found that many of the bikes were not maintained on a regular basis, which resulted in a number of mechanical issues that could lead to accidents. In addition to the issues with bike maintenance, the report also cited poor cleanliness as a major concern. The auditors found that many of the bike stations were dirty and filled with garbage, which could attract pests and create unsafe conditions for riders. Another issue identified in the report was the defective parking stations. Many of the stations were found to be malfunctioning, which made it difficult for riders to properly dock their bikes. This could result in overcrowded stations and poor access for riders trying to find a bike. The report called for significant improvements to be made to the Citi Bike program to ensure rider safety. The auditors recommended that the New York City Bike Share increase its staffing levels to ensure that maintenance checks are performed on a regular basis. They also suggested that the management improve the cleanliness of the bike stations and replace any defective parking stations. Responding to the report, the New York City Bike Share cited staffing issues as an explanation for many of the problems exposed in Stringer's audit. They agreed to take action to address the concerns raised in the report and stated that they were committed to ensuring the safety of riders in the Citi Bike program. Despite the issues highlighted in the report, the Citi Bike program has been a popular addition to transportation options in New York City. Since its launch in 2013, the program has attracted over 18 million riders and has expanded to over 12,000 bikes in more than 750 stations across the city. The popularity of the program has been driven by several factors, including the convenience of bike sharing, the cost-saving benefits of using bikes over other modes of transportation, and the positive impact on the environment. However, the concerns raised in the report highlight the need for continued oversight and improvements in order to maintain the safety and high standards of the Citi Bike program. In conclusion, Comptroller Scott Stringer's report on the New York City Bike Share highlights serious concerns about rider safety due to spotty maintenance checks, poor cleanliness, and defective parking stations. The report calls for significant improvements to the program in order to ensure the safety of riders. The New York City Bike Share has acknowledged the issues raised in the report and is committed to taking action to address them. Despite the challenges, the Citi Bike program remains popular and has become an important part of transportation options in New York City.
