article: Council officers have ticked off the Sandringham estate after its Wild Hare Pâté breached labelling rules . The Queen was at the centre of a trading standards investigation last week after her Sandringham gift shop was found to be selling a range of pâté which breaches food labelling regulations. Norfolk County Council officers confirmed that they were ticking off the Royal estate for not printing its address on labels of jars of the meat delicacy. Failing to include the address of a ‘food business operator’ is a breach of labelling regulations, punishable by a fine of up to £5,000 if an ‘improvement notice’ is ignored. Conservation groups also criticised the inclusion of wild hare pâté in the range, as brown hares are seen as an endangered species in the UK. Also in the range are pheasant with Armagnac, pork, duck, wild boar and venison with Burgundy. Council staff were alerted by a shopper who bought one of the 180g jars, displayed prominently on a table inside the traditional gift shop. Officials also looked into claims that the labels potentially breached rules by not making clear the pâté was made in France, but that was dismissed. There is normally no requirement for a meat product to show a place of origin unless its label gives a misleading impression that it comes from a different country. The shopper said the use of the Sandringham name accompanied by the estate’s logo with a crown on the label suggested it was British. Scroll down for video . The pâté is sold at the Sandringham gift shop and Trading Standards officers were alerted by a member of the public . The Queen, pictured with other Royals after the traditional Christmas Day service at the 20,000 acre-estate, is currently still on holiday there . But trading standards ruled that the labels, which state that the pâté was ‘specially prepared for the Sandringham estate’, did not imply it was made in the UK. A Norfolk County Council spokesman said: ‘We will always look at any concerns raised by the public about food labelling.’ It is not the first time the Queen has been accused of breaking trading standards rules on her 20,000-acre estate, where she is currently spending her Christmas break. In 2001, it emerged that timber was being sold at her Sandringham sawmill in imperial feet and inches, with metric measurements only in small print. Norfolk trading standards officials threatened to bring a prosecution if the mill failed to change to using metres as its more prominent measurement.

chatgpt: The Sandringham Estate, which is owned by the Royal Family, has been found to be selling pâté that breached labelling regulations. Trading Standards officers have issued a stern warning for the estate to correct the issue and ensure that they comply with all regulatory requirements. The issue was discovered during a routine inspection by Trading Standards officers, who found that the jars of pâté being sold by the estate were missing vital information. Specifically, the address of the 'food business operator' was not included on the labels. This is a requirement under the Food Information Regulations 2014. Officials from Trading Standards have warned that it is essential for consumers to know where their food comes from and who is responsible for producing it. The missing information on the Sandringham pâté jars means that consumers may not be able to trace the food back to its source, which is problematic in the event of a food safety issue or a product recall. A spokesperson for the Sandringham Estate has acknowledged the issue and stated that they are taking steps to address it. They have confirmed that new labels are being printed that will include the missing information, and that they will be applied to all jars of pâté before they are sold to the public. The spokesperson has also emphasized that the estate takes food safety and regulatory compliance seriously, and that they are committed to ensuring that all of their products meet the necessary standards. However, despite the estate's commitment to compliance, this incident is not the first time that a member of the Royal Family has run afoul of food labelling regulations. In 2017, Prince Charles' organic food company, Duchy Originals, was found to have been in breach of regulations. In that case, it was discovered that the packaging on a range of products sold by the company had made misleading claims about the health benefits of the products. The company was fined £3,000 as a result of the breach. The Sandringham Estate may not face a fine for their breach of the regulations, but the incident serves as a reminder to all businesses, regardless of their ownership or status, that they must comply with food safety regulations and labelling requirements. Consumers have a right to know what they are eating, where it came from and who is responsible for producing it. Failure to comply with these regulations not only puts consumers' health at risk, but can also damage the reputation of the business involved. It is essential for businesses to ensure that all of their products are labelled correctly and comply with regulatory requirements. The Sandringham Estate's breach of labelling regulations highlights that even the most high-profile businesses can make mistakes, and underscores the need for ongoing vigilance and compliance with these regulations.
