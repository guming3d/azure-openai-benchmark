article: By . Anna Edwards . The end of the Syrian chemical weapons crisis and the stronger pound sent wholesale prices tumbling . With soaring energy bills and the cost of living rising, there is finally some good news for British households - petrol prices have tumbled. Drivers are paying the lowest average price for petrol in more than two and a half years, according to a study. The AA Fuel Price Report found the average pump price of petrol fell from 132.16p per litre last month to 130.44p. It had risen to a high of 138.38p in the second week of September before the end of the Syrian chemical weapons crisis and the stronger pound sent wholesale prices tumbling, the motoring organisation said. The cheapest price for supermarket petrol in built-up areas ranges from 126.7p in towns with strong competition to 131.9p in those without, usually small market and coastal towns like Clacton-on-Sea, Trowbridge and Newark. Last week, however, some non-supermarket fuel stations in London's Streatham and Mortlake areas were able to sell petrol at 124.9p a litre. The cost of diesel also continued to fall, down from an average of 139.12p a litre in mid October to 137.78p now. It had also hit a late summer high in the second week of September, reaching 142.88p. At about 7p a litre more expensive than petrol, diesel's differential is largely consistent with the November price gap over the past two years. A family with two petrol cars was spending the equivalent of £252.54 a month on fuel in September, now it's £238.05 . Edmund King, the AA's president, said: . 'On average, 28 per cent of AA members buy a set amount of fuel each . time they go to a petrol station. 'This rises to 40 per cent for younger drivers and 44 per cent for lower-income ones. In September, a £30 spend bought them 21.7 litres and now it buys them 23 - a boost equal to a free 10-mile round trip to work. 'A family with two petrol cars was spending the equivalent of £252.54 a month on fuel in September, now it's £238.05. 'A company with 100 Ford Mondeos was spending typically £10,000 to fill them up with diesel in mid September, now it's around £9,640. 'Last week, it was officially recognised that lower pump prices helped to bring inflation down to 2.2 per cent. 'You cannot understate the importance of lower pump prices. That is why, when the independent retailers say they would get significant savings from delaying the payment of fuel tax, the AA wholeheartedly supports the move if it helps the remote rural and other small petrol stations to survive.' He added: 'But in the many towns where our members and other drivers complain about pump prices being 5p a litre higher than a few miles up the road, extra relief for the retailers should be reciprocated with fairer pump prices.'

chatgpt: The British wholesale prices experienced a sharp drop as the Syrian chemical weapons crisis came to an end, and the pound strengthened, according to recent reports. This news brought relief to many, as a possible escalation of the situation could have led to disastrous consequences for the global economy. The resolution of the Syrian chemical weapons crisis was widely welcomed by the international community. The conflict had been a major point of concern for several years, with the potential to spark a regional or even global war. The news of the resolution was even more welcome for British businesses, which had been hit hard by the economic uncertainty caused by the conflict. As news of the resolution spread, wholesale prices fell sharply, bringing welcome relief to many. Many British businesses are expected to benefit from the stronger pound as well. The pound's value has risen significantly in recent months, thanks to improving economic conditions in the UK. This has been welcome news for many British exporters, who have struggled with a weaker pound for several years. With the stronger pound, they can now sell their products overseas for higher prices, which should help to boost their profits. Another welcome development for British consumers was the continued fall in the cost of diesel. This fuel has long been a major expense for many British drivers, especially those who rely on their vehicles for work. The price of diesel had reached a high point in mid-October, with an average price of 139.12p per litre. However, since then, prices have fallen significantly to an average of 137.78p per litre. This is welcome news for those who rely on diesel for their vehicles, as it will help to reduce their overall costs. However, it is worth noting that the price of diesel can be highly volatile, and it is difficult to predict where it may go next. Overall, the news is a welcome development for many British businesses and consumers. The resolution of the Syrian chemical weapons crisis is an important step towards reducing global tensions, while the stronger pound and falling diesel prices should help boost confidence and spending in the UK economy. However, it remains to be seen how these trends will develop in the coming months. While the current news is positive, there are still many challenges facing the UK economy, and it will take some time to fully assess the impact of these recent developments. Nevertheless, for now, many businesses and consumers across the UK will be breathing a sigh of relief, as they anticipate a brighter economic outlook.
