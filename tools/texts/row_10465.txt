article: With the rain pouring and the wind howling, the conditions perhaps weren’t the best for cycling - even on an A or B road. But one cyclist was today labelled a ‘dummy’ by traffic police after officers had to escort him off the London-bound M1 motorway near Redbourn, Hertfordshire, next to cars travelling at 70mph. Cycling on motorways in Britain is illegal - but that didn't stop the unnamed rider trying his luck on a bicycle with no lights, wearing a green hooded jacket, black trousers and a dark backpack. Not the best idea: Officers had to escort the man off the London-bound M1 near Redbourn, Hertfordshire . Police officers spoke to the man, who was on his way to London, and he will now take a train instead. A Hertfordshire Constabulary spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We were alerted just before midday today of a man travelling southbound on the M1 on a pushbike. ‘We did a very slow escort off with him at the next junction, which was junction 9 at Redbourne. We gave him words and advice, and I believe he's now getting a train. He was planning to go to London.’ Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit said on Twitter: ‘Somebody thought it was ok to cycle to London on the M1, escorted safely off at Redbourn. #dontbeadummy.’ Unimpressed: Officers spoke to the man, who was on his way to London, and he will now get a train instead . In June police spoke to another cyclist after escorting her off the M1 near Milton Keynes to an overhead bridge. Cycling on motorways is banned under section 253 of the Highway Code. Other road users prohibited to travel on motorways include riders of motorcycles under 50cc, horse riders, certain slow-moving vehicles, agricultural vehicles and powered wheelchairs. One famous example of cyclists on UK motorways came during the 2002 Commonwealth Games, when two members of the Kenyan cycling team were stopped on the M61 near Bolton. Greater Manchester Police pulled over George Ochieng, 23, and Arthur Kamu, 27, who had spent 45 minutes cycling in full kit on the hard shoulder at up to 40mph, travelling more than 17 miles. Mr Ochieng said that he and his team-mate were unaware of British laws banning them from cycling on motorways. A police spokesman confirmed the force understood it was a ‘genuine mistake’.

chatgpt: A cyclist has found himself in trouble with the law after being discovered travelling illegally on the M1 near Redbourn in Hertfordshire. Police officers were alerted to the cyclist's presence on the motorway after a passing driver saw him cycling on the motorway and immediately reported the incident. Officers quickly arrived on the scene and escorted the cyclist off the motorway. The cyclist, whose identity is yet to be revealed, was described by police as "a dummy" for his reckless behaviour. It is unclear whether the cyclist had intended to cycle on the motorway, or if he had accidentally found himself on the wrong road. However, regardless of his intentions, it is clear that cycling on a motorway is illegal and poses a significant danger to both the cyclist and other drivers on the road. After being escorted off the motorway, the cyclist was spoken to by police officers. According to reports, he will now take a train to London instead of cycling on the motorway. While it is unclear what consequences the cyclist may face for his actions, it is likely that he will face some form of punishment. It is also possible that he may be required to pay a fine for his illegal behaviour. Following this incident, police are reminding cyclists to be aware of the rules of the road and to avoid cycling on motorways at all costs. Cycling on a motorway is not only illegal, but it also poses a significant danger to the cyclist's safety. It is important that cyclists always plan their routes carefully and ensure that they are travelling on roads that are safe and suitable for cycling. This incident has once again highlighted the importance of road safety and the need for both cyclists and motorists to be aware of the rules of the road. The police have urged anyone who witnesses dangerous or illegal behaviour on the roads to report it immediately, in order to help prevent accidents and keep everyone safe on the roads. In conclusion, cycling on a motorway is not only illegal but also extremely dangerous. This incident should serve as a reminder to all cyclists to be aware of the rules of the road and always prioritize safety. While it is unclear what consequences the cyclist may face for his actions, it is clear that he put his own safety and that of others at risk by cycling on the motorway. It is important that cyclists always plan their routes carefully and ensure that they are travelling on roads that are safe and suitable for cycling.
