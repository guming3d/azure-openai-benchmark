It means Pirlo is highly likely to finish his career at Juventus as his renaissance as one of the more inventive midfielders in world football continues. Even though the Italians only went through on penalties, he dismantled England in the Euro 2012 quarter-finals and will attempt to do the same when the pair meet in Manaus. Pirlo is due to meet Brazilian Juninho Pernambucano on Wednesday in a bid to fine-tune his delivery from set pieces this summer. Juninho, who spent eight years in Europe at Lyon, has been invited to Italy’s training base two hours west of Rio de Janeiro to meet Pirlo, who wrote in his autobiography how he would spend hours scrutinising the Brazilian’s free-kick technique. ‘That man made the ball do some quite extraordinary things,’ wrote Pirlo. ‘He never went wrong. Never. I checked out his stats and realised it couldn’t just be chance.’ And Prandelli may need that extra bit of invention after a chronic winless run stretching back to September. Everything he can get: Cesare Prandelli needs Pirlo to run games for the struggling Italians in Brazil .
