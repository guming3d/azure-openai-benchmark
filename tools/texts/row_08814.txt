His father Tony, 28, said: 'If it had bitten him a couple of inches lower it would have ripped his throat out.' Riley Fox was in his neighbour’s garden with five other children when the animal called Mac (right), believed to be a Rhodesian Ridgeback-pitbull cross, clamped its jaws around his face . The child was attacked last week by the dog called Mac - which has since been put down. His mother Sam, 22, was at another neighbour’s house having a cup of tea at the time of the attack.

'One of the neighbours was dragging the dog off him. He was covered in blood. They were holding towels up to Riley’s face, three of them were soaked in his blood.' He added: 'When I got back it was just horrific - his cheek was hanging off his face, his eye and lips were all sliced open. He very nearly lost his eye.' Mr Fox added that they waited 25 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, when his son was taken to Alder Hey Children's hospital in Liverpool where he underwent emergency surgery. He said: 'When they were treating him they found a piece of the dog’s tooth in his face.' Mr Fox said his son was due to start school next month and had been very brave. He said: 'We don’t want him to have a complex about dogs. His nan and grandad used to have a big German Shepherd so he’s grown up with dogs.' The dog’s owner has since apologised and the dog has been destroyed. He said: 'He was at work, it was a relative who should have been keeping the dog under control.' He added: 'There should be a register for these dogs and they shouldn’t be allowed around kids.' Cheshire Police said they were investigating the attack.

chatgpt: A disturbing incident has taken place in Widnes, Cheshire, where a pitbull cross attacked a little boy named Riley Fox while he was playing. Pictures captured after the attack show the extent of the damage done to the young child's face, which escaped being bitten only by a hair's breadth from his neck. The Rhodesian Ridgeback-pitbull cross managed to clamp its jaws around little Riley's face, but thankfully, the injuries were limited to his face only. The attack could have been much worse, had the dog bitten his neck or throat. The pictures captured after the attack show the extent of the injuries that Riley sustained. His face has been cut open, and the wounds are so severe that it is hard to imagine what Riley must have gone through during the attack. The scars that the child has sustained may last a lifetime and serve as a reminder of the horrific attack. According to local media reports, the incident happened when Riley was out playing in his backyard. The dog, owned by a neighbor, managed to break free from its leash and attack Riley. The attack took place in a matter of seconds, and the pet had Riley's face in its jaws before anyone could react. The police were called to the scene, and they were horrified to see the injuries that Riley had sustained. The dog was then seized by the authorities, and it has since been put down. The owner of the dog has been cooperative with the investigation, and no charges have been pressed against them at this time. Riley's family has released a statement saying that they are grateful for the support that they have received from the community. They have also urged the public to be aware of the dangers of owning a dangerous breed of dog, and to take proper precautions to keep themselves and their families safe. The incident is a reminder that there are certain breeds of dogs that can be dangerous, and that owning such dogs carries its own set of risks. While pitbulls and other dangerous breeds can be trained to be good pets, it is important to take extra precautionary measures to ensure that the dog does not pose a threat to other people, especially children. Local authorities have also expressed concern over the increase in the number of people owning dangerous breeds of dogs. They have urged people to take a more responsible approach to owning pets and to take extra steps to ensure that these animals do not pose a threat to the public. In conclusion, the attack on little Riley is a stark reminder of the dangers of owning a dangerous breed of dog. While experts debate whether it is the breed or the owner's responsibility to ensure that the dog is not a danger to others, it is clear that incidents like this one demonstrate that some dogs can be dangerous, and that extra precautionary measures are needed to keep people safe. The authorities and the public must work together to ensure that such incidents are prevented in the future.
