article: (CNN) -- Looking to sell the public on your plan to combine Twitter with beer drinking? Well, there are worse places to push the idea than South by Southwest Interactive, the annual gathering known as "spring break for geeks." (Or for "tech hipsters." The line is getting blurrier and blurrier these days.) The Tweet-A-Beer mobile app is rolling out this week at SXSW, the Austin, Texas, festival that has helped launch such social-networking staples as Foursquare and Twitter. Tweet-A-Beer, from Portland's tenfour, combines your Twitter and PayPal accounts so you can beer a buddy on the Internet "to ensure that distance, agoraphobia and gang rivalries no longer prevent you from sharing a pint." Hear that, Web-savvy Crips? Buy a Blood a Bud and watch the healing happen. Tweet-A-Beer uses Chirpify, a Twitter payment app. Once signed up, a user enters the screen name of another Twitter user and the app credits $5 to their PayPal account. You can also enter a message -- the app suggests a reason for the sudsy gift or maybe a suggested meeting place and time -- and it will appear in a tweet. The recipient clicks "Claim Beer Money" and -- voila -- their PayPal account is $5 to the good. OK, so, technically, we suppose you could use those five bucks at iTunes or Amazon, for online gambling of dubious legality or, well, most anything. But there must be some bad karma associated with not buying an e-beer when a buddy has taken the time to tweet it your way. "Seriously, we recommend using it for beer," reads the app's website. "Because ... it's beer." Chirpify takes a 10-cent fee from the recipient's account to cover the transaction. Tenfour and PR-firm partner Waggener Edstrom say they make no money on the beerfest. "We made this thing because we're thirsty," they write.

chatgpt: South by Southwest (SXSW) is known for being the launching pad of innovative products and ideas, and this year is no different. One of the most exciting products to make its debut at the festival is the Tweet-A-Beer mobile app. The app combines Twitter and PayPal to create an easy and unique way for users to buy someone else a cold one. Tweet-A-Beer works by linking a user's Twitter account with their PayPal account. Once the accounts are synced up, a user can send a tweet to the recipient they want to buy a beer for. The recipient then receives a notification that they have been offered a beer through the Tweet-A-Beer app. The recipient can then accept the offer, and the app will handle the transaction. The app is powered by Chirpify, a Twitter payment app that is able to handle the transactions securely. Chirpify takes a 10-cent fee to cover the transaction, but other than that, Tweet-A-Beer is free to use. The developers of Tweet-A-Beer are excited about the potential of the app. They believe that it will encourage people to be more social and give them an easy way to show their appreciation for someone else. While there are other types of gift-giving apps on the market, Tweet-A-Beer is unique in that it is combining two existing services in a new way. The creators of the app recognize that it may not be for everyone. Some people may feel uncomfortable linking their Twitter and PayPal accounts, while others may simply not be interested in buying someone else a beer. However, they are confident that there is a market for their product. Overall, Tweet-A-Beer is an exciting new addition to the world of mobile apps. It offers a fun and unique way for people to reach out to one another and share a drink. The app is rolling out at SXSW this week, and it will be interesting to see how it is received by festival goers.
