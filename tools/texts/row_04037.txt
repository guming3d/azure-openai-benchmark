chatgpt: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has admitted that he needs time to get back into his best form after injuries. Despite featuring in six out of seven Premier League games this season, he has only started five games.  The England international, who has been plagued by injuries throughout his career, said that missing a lot of football has affected his form. "For a player of my age, I've missed a lot of football," he said in an interview. Wilshere's latest appearance for Arsenal was in their 2-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Despite the loss, Wilshere believes his side played well and is confident they can bounce back in their next game. "We played well, we had chances, we just didn't take them," Wilshere said. "We're disappointed to lose but we can take positives from the performance. We're a good team and we'll bounce back." Wilshere's comments come as Arsenal continue to struggle in the Premier League. The Gunners have only managed to win two out of their seven league games so far this season, leaving them in seventh place in the table. Despite their poor start to the season, Wilshere is confident that Arsenal can turn their form around. "We're not far off," he said. "We just need to keep working hard and the results will come." Wilshere's return to form will be crucial for Arsenal as they look to improve their league position. With tough fixtures coming up against Watford and Everton, the Gunners will need all their players firing on all cylinders. If Wilshere can stay injury-free and recapture his best form, Arsenal will have a much better chance of improving on their current position in the league table. However, for a player who has missed so much football, it may take time before he is truly back to his best.
