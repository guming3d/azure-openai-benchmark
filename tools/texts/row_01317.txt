The soldier's name was not immediately released. He was listed in stable condition on Sunday afternoon at the base hospital. No other details about his condition were immediately available. A bear (not pictured) attacked a soldier from the Alaska National Guard on Sunday morning as it was defending its two cubs . The soldier was participating in a land navigation exercise, according to Guard spokeswoman Maj. Candis Olmstead. The exercise involves giving soldiers compasses and maps and timing them as they make their way alone to hidden locations on the course. The soldier was going through the woods when he encountered the bear and her cubs late Sunday morning. 'He dropped to the ground, covered his head and remained still,' Olmstead said. The bear approached the soldier, swatting at him and biting him before retreating after about 30 seconds. The soldier blew a safety whistle, alerting medics stationed nearby, Olmstead said. The soldier was not armed at the time of the mauling, and Olmstead said she didn't know if he was carrying bear spray. Jessica Gamboa was mauled by a bear two months ago at the same military base in Alaska . Sunday's attack was the second mauling at the base in about two months. Jessica Gamboa was badly mauled May 18 as she jogged on a trail and encountered a bear and her two cubs. Gamboa, the wife of a soldier stationed at the base, has said she didn't scream or fight during the attack, and the bear left her bleeding in an embankment. She sustained cuts to her neck, arms and legs, a torn ear and neck fractures. She was rushed to a hospital by a soldier who was driving by when he saw her walking down the road holding both hands to her bleeding neck. It was not immediately clear whether the same bear was involved in both maulings.
