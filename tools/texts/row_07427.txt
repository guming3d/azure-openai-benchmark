article: (CNN) -- Russia's lower house of parliament has approved a resolution recognizing that Josef Stalin's regime was responsible for the 1940 massacre of more than 20,000 Polish officers, signaling a thawing of relations between Poland and Russia, state media reported. In a written statement, Poland's Foreign Ministry said it welcomed the resolution titled "Katyn Tragedy and Its Victims,"  adopted by the State Duma of the Russian Federation on Saturday. "Acknowledging the Stalinist totalitarian regime's accountability for this unprecedented massacre is the Russian Parliament's important gesture, signifying that we are making progress on the way to reconciliation between our countries and peoples," said the statement. "This gesture proves that there is no turning back from the truth-based dialogue between Poland and Russia," the statement said. Documents that had been stored in secret archives for years show that the "massacre was committed on the direct orders of Stalin," a draft of the declaration says, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. The masterminding of the Katyn Massacre has been a lingering, contentious issue between the two former communist nations. The World War II massacre, in which an estimated 20,000 Polish officers were murdered at point blank in the village of Katyn, has tainted Russian-Polish relations. The Duma's Friday vote comes as Russian President Dmitry Medvedev prepares to travel to Poland in December. For decades, the Soviet government blamed the killings on Nazi Germany. In 1990, Russia finally admitted to what many in Poland had long suspected: The Soviet Union secretly murdered as many as 22,000 Polish soldiers and civilians in the early days of World War II in an attempt to pre-emptively suppress a Polish rebellion against communist rule. That year, Russian prosecutors also launched a criminal case into the killings, but that case was closed in 2004. Since then, the country has handed over some investigation files to Polish officials. This year, a 2007 film about the massacre aired on Russian television for the first time. But some Russian lawmakers say the issue is still in dispute. Communists, who opposed the declaration, claim German authorities actually executed the Polish soldiers. The party's leader has dubbed attempts to blame Stalin part of "Soviet history falsification" as part of an "ideological war," RIA Novosti reported. Former Polish President Lech Kaczynski was killed in a plane crash earlier this year when he was headed to a memorial at the massacre site. Kaczynski, 60, had been traveling with a Polish delegation to Russia to commemorate the massacre's 70th anniversary. His wife and several top military officials were also killed in the crash.

chatgpt: Poland has welcomed a declaration by the Russian State Duma on Friday which announced that the Red Army had committed the massacre of more than 20,000 Polish officers during World War II. The 1940 murder of Polish soldiers has long been a major point of contention between Poland and Russia, and the resolution from the Duma may be seen as a step towards reconciliation. However, the Communist Party has disputed the declaration. As per their assertion, it was German authorities who executed the Polish officers, not the Red Army. This alternative interpretation has been a diplomatic sticking point for many years. For its part, the Polish foreign ministry has said that the Russian statement was a significant development. "Poland welcomes the resolution by the Russian State Duma on the Katyn massacre, which was a horrific crime against the Polish people. It is a positive step towards our relations," the ministry said in a statement. The declaration from the Duma stated that the "massacre was committed on the direct orders of Stalin," and that the Soviet Union bore full responsibility for the incident. This is a reversal of the previous Soviet position on the matter, which blamed the Germans. The Katyn massacre occurred in 1940, when the Soviet Union invaded Poland. Over 20,000 Polish officers were taken prisoner and transported to different camps, where they were subsequently executed. The killings were carried out over several weeks, and the bodies of the victims were buried in mass graves in the Katyn forest in western Russia. The Soviet Union initially claimed the massacre was the work of the Germans, who were then occupying Poland. However, the truth of the matter was not revealed until 1990, when then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev admitted that the Soviet Union was responsible for the killings. The massacre has been a source of tension between Russia and Poland ever since, and this declaration from the Duma may be a positive step towards improving relations. However, the Communist Party's position on the matter is still a diplomatic obstacle, and it remains to be seen whether a fully satisfactory resolution can be reached. In conclusion, the resolution from the Russian State Duma on the Katyn massacre is a significant development for Russia and Poland. While the truth about the murder of over 20,000 Polish officers has been known for many years, the admission by the Duma that the Soviet Union was responsible for the massacre is a step towards reconciliation. However, the Communist Party's dispute of the declaration shows that there is still much work to be done before the two countries can fully bury the hatchet on this issue.
