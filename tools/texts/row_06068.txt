article: Romelu Lukaku's last-gasp goal forced an FA Cup third round replay as Everton came from behind to draw 1-1 with Barclays Premier League rivals West Ham. Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein takes you through the talking points from Tuesday night's clash at Goodison Park. TOFFEES TRIO KNOW WAY TO WEMBLEY . Everton haven't won a major trophy for 20 years but three of their starters on Tuesday night already have FA Cup winners' medals. Gareth Barry could add another FA Cup medal to his cabinet if Everton go the distance . Thirty-seven-year-old defender Sylvain Distin was in the Portsmouth team that lifted the cup in 2008, Gareth Barry played for Manchester City when they were triumphant in 2011 and goalkeeper Joel Robles was in the Wigan line-up when they shocked City at Wembley in 2013. Everton sub Arouna Kone also played for Wigan in that final. NO-NONSENSE REID SHOWS HIS CLASS . Winston Reid was his usual uncomplicated self despite speculation over his future. The 26-year-old New Zealander is a defenders' defender and had to be at his most alert with opponent, Romelu Lukaku, even bigger and stronger than he is. Reid's reading of the game was excellent and saved his goalkeeper Adrian with one clearance, the question is whether he has enough finesse on the ball for a club like Arsenal as he enters the last six months of his contract at Upton Park. West Ham defender Winston Reid did enough to keep Romelu Lukaku at bay until the dying seconds . Recent FA Cup history favoured West Ham who had not lost to Everton in the competition since 1957 when future managers Malcolm Allison and John Bond were in their line-up. The most famous cup meeting between the clubs came in a 1980 semi-final replay when Frank Lampard Sr scored the winning goal for Second Division Hammers. NO ROMANCE AT GOODISON . The lack of atmosphere at Goodison was in contrast to what neighbours Liverpool experienced at AFC Wimbledon the previous evening. Plenty of empty blue seats made it feel more like an under-21s development game; Tuesday nights under the floodlights should be reserved for FA Cup replays, not third round ties made-for-TV. There were plenty of empty seats at Goodison Park as just 22,236 fans attended the FA Cup clash . It wasn't warm on Merseyside, but certainly not freezing. Maybe you could just about excuse Everton's Bryan Oviedo from wearing gloves, he is from Costa Rica close to the equator. But was it really necessary for Kevin Mirallas, a Belgian international whose formative football years were spent in northern France with Lille, to cover up on such a benign evening. Costa Rican Bryan Oviedo can be forgiven for wearing gloves during the game . Belgian international Kevin Mirallas wore gloves on a not-so-cold night at Goodison in the FA Cup .

chatgpt: In an exciting FA Cup second round encounter, West Ham United and Everton played out a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park. James Collins gave the Hammers the lead with a towering header in the second half, but Romelu Lukaku's injury time equaliser forced a replay to decide who will progress to the next round. The match started with both teams showing attacking intent, but it was Everton who created the first chance of the game. Kevin Mirallas was played through on goal but his shot was straight at West Ham goalkeeper Adrian. The Hammers responded soon after, with Enner Valencia's long range effort forcing a good save from Joel Robles. The game was evenly matched for most of the first half, with both teams cancelling each other out in midfield. Everton's Gareth Barry and James McCarthy were having a strong impact on the game, making crucial tackles and interceptions in front of the backline. The second half started with West Ham looking more dangerous in attack, and they were rewarded in the 56th minute. A corner kick from the left flank was whipped in by Dimitri Payet, and James Collins rose highest to power his header past Robles and into the net. Everton responded by upping their tempo, with Lukaku and Mirallas looking more dangerous on the ball. But the home side were unable to make their possession count, as West Ham's defence held firm. With the game reaching its final minutes, Everton threw everything forward in search of an equaliser. Their efforts were finally rewarded in the 91st minute, when Lukaku got on the end of a through ball and slotted it past Adrian to send the home fans into raptures. The equaliser was certainly deserved for Everton, who had more possession and created more chances throughout the game. But West Ham will be disappointed that they couldn't hold on for the win, after putting in a solid defensive performance for most of the game. The draw means the two sides will have to replay the match to decide who progresses to the next round of the FA Cup. Everton will be confident of their chances, especially given their impressive Cup record in recent years. Gareth Barry, Sylvain Distin and Joel Robles have all won the Cup before with other clubs, and their experience could prove critical in the replay. West Ham, on the other hand, will need to regroup and come up with a different game plan if they are to win the replay and progress to the next round. All in all, it was an entertaining Cup tie between two evenly matched teams. The replay promises to be just as exciting, with both teams looking to make it through to the third round and keep their Cup hopes alive.
