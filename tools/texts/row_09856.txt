article: (CNN) -- A judge, who was suspended after an online video showing him beating his teenage daughter went viral, was reinstated by the Texas Supreme Court. Judge William Adams was back working Wednesday at Aransas County after his suspension was lifted by the state's high court, a court clerk said. The state's Commission on Judicial Conduct earlier ruled that Adams would receive a public warning for the incident, which cleared the way for the suspension to be lifted. The move to allow the judge back on the bench angered Adams' former wife and daughter. "My first feeling is extreme sadness," said Hallie Adams, the former wife. "I feel sad for the public. I see the justice system is failing and justice review system is failing." Hillary Adams, the judge's daughter, was also upset. "I'm embarrassed to live in Texas," said the girl who was the buzz on the Internet last year after releasing the beating video. Adams was suspended last year after the 2004 video went public. It showed him beating his then-16-year-old daughter because she downloaded online music and games. The beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the Internet "to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time," Hillary Adams, wrote on the Internet posting. She said she released the video after being harassed by her father. "It was the straw that broke the camel's back," she said last November. "It wasn't any huge happening or anything." She said she told her father she had the video, "and he didn't seem to think anything of it, and basically dared me to post it." The video posting said, "Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself. Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again. His 'judgment' is a giant farce. Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter." The 7 1/2-minute video is punctuated by cracks of the man's belt and the girl's screams and cries. At one point, the man says to his near-hysterical daughter, "What happened to you, Hillary? Once you were an obedient, nice little girl. Now you lie, cheat and steal." At another point, he yells at her, "You want to put some more computer games on? You want some more?" William Adams has acknowledged that the man in the video was him. As a judge, William Adams handles misdemeanor cases, including family-related and juvenile court issues.

chatgpt: After a controversial video of Judge William Adams of Texas went viral in 2011, showing him viciously lashing out at his then-16-year-old daughter, Hillary Adams, Adams took a leave of absence from the bench. However, after a long period of absence, Judge William Adams is back to work, as confirmed by one of his clerks. The judge, who handles misdemeanor cases in Rockport, Texas, was absent from court for several weeks, according to local residents. The video, which was originally recorded in 2004, went viral in November 2011, after Hillary Adams uploaded it to YouTube. The clip shows Judge Adams repeatedly lashing his daughter with a belt while cursing and berating her during a disciplinary hearing. The video sparked outrage across the country, and calls for Adams to resign quickly followed. At the time, Adams issued a statement apologizing for his actions, but he did not resign. He said he had been "under extreme stress" at the time and that he had "since apologized and made amends to my daughter." However, the incident continued to haunt the judge and his reputation, even years later. Many people refused to forget about the abuse that occurred in the video, and calls for Judge Adams' resignation continued, forcing him to take a leave of absence from the bench in 2013. Now, several years later, it is unclear what motivated Judge Adams' return to work. Some believe that his absence was related to the controversy surrounding the video and the subsequent fallout. Despite the public uproar and demands for his resignation, Judge Adams has been able to return to work and continue his career. While some may argue that this is unjust, others may believe that Judge Adams has paid his dues and deserves a second chance. Regardless of one's personal opinion, the video featuring Judge Adams' abuse of his daughter continues to serve as a powerful reminder of the pressures and limitations of the judicial system, as well as the impact of personal and emotional stress on individuals. It is a story that remains relevant and important to this day, and one that will continue to shape public debates about the ethical responsibilities of those in positions of power for many years to come.
