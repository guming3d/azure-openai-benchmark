In December, Miss Cunningham announced her engagement to Andrew Goy by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online. The engagement, which was then confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, comes just weeks after the couple were first pictured in Leeds city centre. There have also been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child. Last month, Miss Cunningham also revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her baby daughter by sending him the wrong DNA result. She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day. But the mother-of-three mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man. Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders.
