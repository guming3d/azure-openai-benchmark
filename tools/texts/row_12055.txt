chatgpt: Portsmouth, VA – Matthew Wayne Strawn, a 21-year-old man from Portsmouth, Virginia, is facing charges for allegedly biting a child in the ICU unit of Portsmouth Naval Medical Center. According to reports, the incident occurred on Wednesday night and left hospital staff and the child's family shocked and horrified. The victim, a young child who has not been identified, was reportedly in critical condition at the time of the incident. Family members had gathered around the child's bedside when Strawn suddenly lunged forward and bit the child on the arm. Hospital staff quickly intervened, and Strawn was restrained and removed from the premises. Local police were called to the scene, and Strawn was placed under arrest. The motive for the attack is unknown at this time, and it is unclear whether Strawn had any prior relationship with the child or their family. Authorities are investigating the incident and have not yet released any further details. The child's condition is said to be stable, and they are recovering from their injuries. The family has declined to comment on the incident, but hospital staff and witnesses have expressed shock and concern over what happened. "This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in a hospital setting where patients are already vulnerable," said Hospital Spokesperson Mary Johnson. "Our thoughts are with the child and their family during this difficult time." Strawn is currently being held at Portsmouth City Jail on charges of malicious wounding and assaulting a law enforcement officer. He is scheduled to appear in court later this month. The incident has sparked outrage and concern among the local community, with many calling for increased security measures at the hospital. Officials have not yet commented on any plans for additional security measures, but hospital staff have reassured patients and their families that their safety is their top priority.
