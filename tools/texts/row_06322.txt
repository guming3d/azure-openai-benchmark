Officers knew he was wanted for questioning regarding the stolen vehicle, and he was identified as a suspect for a robbery the night before. According to Acting Police Chief Jason Edmiston, Rodriguez slid into the driver’s seat after the car pulled over to the side of the road, and took off. After leading officers on a three-block chase, Rodriguez ran a red light, slamming into a 1999 Volkswagen Jetta in the intersection, the Tri-City Herald reports.

Broyles’ passenger, 27-year-old Robert Swales, was treated for minor injuries at a nearby hospital. He was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia, the Hermiston Herald reports. Rodriguez was slapped with a litany of charges - 19 in all - including four counts of robbery, one count of both burglary and assault, and four counts of pointing a firearm at another person. For the incident alone, he was charged with two outstanding felony warrants, one felony for causing his passenger injury, alluding police in a vehicle and by foot, unlawful possession of a firearm, and reckless endangerment. Mr Edmiston said they were thrilled to get Rodriguez off the streets. He said in a statement: ‘Mr Rodriguez is clearly a scourge to society. 'We are very fortunate nobody was seriously injured based on the numerous poor decisions made by Mr Rodriguez.’
