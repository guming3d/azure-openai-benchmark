The woman are said to have enticed the men to have sex, then threatened to report the encounter to police as rape if they failed to pay substantial sums as part of the 'honeypot' operation (file picture) Police in South Korea say they have cracked a 'honeypot' operation where female gang members would have sex with married men then blackmail them. In each case, the women are said to have enticed the men to have sex, then threatened to report the encounter to police as rape if they failed to pay substantial sums. Police in Chungcheong Province arrested five people on Monday who are accused of extorting around £25,000 from three victims. In one case, on New Year’s Eve, Mr. Lim, 31, was having a drink with a friend when some women joined them at their table. Mr. Lim went to a motel with a woman by the name of Ms. Jeon. It is alleged she ended up accusing Mr. Lim of rape, demanding £3,500 in compensation which he paid. She then demanded a further £60,000 saying ‘if you don’t pay, I’m going to call the police’, investigators say. Mr. Lim suffered a brain hemorrhage on January 13 and is said to remain in an unconscious condition. However, a police report revealed that the woman who slept with Mr. Lim was part of a criminal gang’s ‘honeypot’ operation. They have arrested five individuals on suspicion of using sex to lure victims and steal their valuables. Among those arrested for theft and making threats were three women, all of whom have since been released. Police say that the gang is suspected of stealing £25,000 from three separate victims during a one month period last December. All of the victims of the ‘honeypot gang’ were either friends or acquaintances of the suspects. The gang even went so far as to report one of the three victims, 58-year-old Mr. Jeong, to the police for rape after he failed to pay the demanded £40,000. In one case a man was approached by a woman who was part of a criminal gang's 'honeypot' operation while he was having a drink with a friend on New Year's Eve (file picture) The police report also mentioned how the gang planned ahead for cases where they would actually accuse the victim of rape, using disposable cell phones with which they wouldn’t contact their accomplices. After obtaining confessions from the gang about their threats to the three victims, the police have begun examining similar cases from the same period. ‘We have heard about other honeypot operations run by gangs in the area, so we are expanding our investigation,’ said a representative from the North Chungcheon Province Police Department, ‘since targets of this crime can suffer greatly, even losing their families, we advise extreme caution.’

chatgpt: A gang of women who allegedly seduced men and then extorted money from them has been arrested in Chungcheong Province, South Korea. The group of women reportedly threatened to accuse the men of rape if they did not pay up. According to police reports, the gang managed to extract £25,000 from three men before they were caught. The victims fell prey to the women while in bars or nightclubs, where the women would engage them in conversation and lure them to a nearby location. Once they had the victim's confidence, the women would lure them back to a hotel room or another private location, where they would perform sexual acts on them. Following the encounter, the women would then demand payment from their victim, threatening to accuse them of rape if they refused to pay. Police investigations revealed that the group, which comprised eight women aged between 20 and 30 years old, had been running the scam for at least six months. Members of the ring were arrested after one of their victims reported them to the police. Upon their arrest, the women were found to be in possession of hotel room keys, condoms, and other items that suggested they targeted men in bars and nightclubs. The women have since been charged with attempted extortion and are currently being held in custody. The arrest of the women has come as a shock to many in the Chungcheong Province, a region known for its conservative culture. Social media has been abuzz with comments from locals who are horrified by the gang's actions. Many are calling for harsher punishment for sex crimes, while others are calling for increased awareness of such scams. Some women have also taken to social media to express their concerns about how the incident could harm the #MeToo movement in the country. This incident has highlighted the growing problem of sexual extortion in South Korea, with several similar cases reported in recent years. According to local media reports, many women in South Korea feel unable to report such incidents due to the social stigma attached to sex crimes. The issue of sexual harassment and assault has been a topic of debate in South Korea in recent years, with many women coming forward to share their experiences of abuse. The #MeToo movement gained momentum in the country in 2018, with many women sharing their stories on social media. However, incidents like this show that more needs to be done to ensure that women feel safe and supported when they come forward to report such crimes. The government needs to do more to increase awareness of such crimes and to ensure that victims are not victimized further when they come forward to report them. In conclusion, the arrest of this gang of women in Chungcheong Province has shed light on the issue of sexual extortion in South Korea, and has once again highlighted the need for greater awareness of sexual crimes in the country. It is time that the government takes proactive measures to ensure that women feel safe and supported when they report such incidents. Only then can South Korea truly become a safer place for women.
