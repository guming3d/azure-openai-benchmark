article: (CNN) -- Apple has settled a lawsuit filed by parents who say their kids downloaded free games from the mobile App Store and then proceeded to rack up hefty bills buying in-game extras. Under the proposed settlement of a 2011 class-action lawsuit, Apple will offer a $5 iTunes gift card to any U.S. parent who claims that their child paid for extras without their knowledge. The company will offer larger credits, or cash refunds, for people who can show that their bills were larger than $5. On Friday, the deal will go before a federal judge, who is expected to approve it. The proposed settlement, first reported by legal-news site Law360 and tech blog GigaOM, does not state how much Apple will pay overall or how many users are affected. Apple will create a website for people interested in cashing in on the settlement and send an e-mail notification to roughly 23 million customers. People who want more than $5 must show that a larger amount was racked up by their kids in any 45-day period. Those who can show more than $30 in purchases may choose a cash refund instead of an Apple credit. Purchases made until the date of the settlement would be eligible for refunds. An Apple spokesman said the company would have no comment on the proposed settlement. In the past few years, this "freemium" business model has become increasingly popular in mobile and social gaming. Zynga games like "FarmVille" led the way for games that are free to download and play but then require players to pay small fees for in-game upgrades or premium content. Those fees can add up quickly. The lawsuit came after media reports of several cases in which kids' in-game purchases led to parental sticker shock. Kevin Ofel, an editor at GigaOM, wrote that he got a 2010 iTunes bill for $375 after his kids spent money on the game "TapFish," a virtual aquarium that can be loosely described as "FarmVille" under water. The lure of digital fish is apparently a strong one. A Florida father reported that his 7-year-old amassed a $613 bill playing the same game. On its iTunes page, the latest version of the game, "TapFish 2," lists "top in-app purchases" ranging from 99 cents up to $19.99. The game is listed as appropriate for children 4 and older. The settlement notes that Apple offers paid content on free games that are rated appropriate for children older than 4, 9 and 12 in its App Store. In 2011, Apple revised its in-app purchasing policy, requiring users to re-enter their account password before paying for enhancements within games. The lawsuit was filed after that policy change, with plaintiffs arguing that it didn't go far enough since minors could still make purchases.

chatgpt: Technology giant Apple has reached a settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed by parents over in-game iTunes purchases by kids. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 by parents alleging that their children had racked up huge in-game bills for "freemium" games like "TapFish". The settlement, which was announced on Thursday, will require Apple to offer credits or cash refunds to affected parents. Under the terms of the settlement, anyone who can demonstrate that their child made in-app purchases without their knowledge or consent will be eligible for a cash refund. Parents who can show bills for at least $30 will be entitled to a refund for the full amount, while those with bills between $5 and $30 will receive an iTunes credit of up to $30. Additionally, anyone who simply complains of unauthorized purchases made from within a children's game will automatically receive $5 in iTunes credit. For parents who incurred a larger bill, Apple will provide them with a more comprehensive refund or credit. Specifically, parents who can show in-game purchases of $30 or more will be eligible for a full refund. Parents with lesser claims can still receive an iTunes credit, with the amount of credit varying in proportion to the size of their claim. This settlement marks a significant financial outlay for Apple. The company has previously faced criticism over so-called "freemium" games, which allow players to download a game for free but then require them to make in-game purchases in order to advance. While these purchases are meant to be made with adult supervision, it is often easy for children to access them without their parents' knowledge or consent. Widely regarded as industry leaders in gaming apps, Apple has taken steps to make it more difficult for children to make in-game purchases without their parents' knowledge. For example, in 2013, the company introduced "Ask to Buy," a feature that allows parents to approve or deny their child's in-game purchases. However, the issue of unauthorized in-app purchases has not gone away entirely. In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reached a settlement with Apple over the same issue, requiring the tech giant to refund $32.5m to consumers. This latest settlement is indicative of a growing trend towards increased accountability in the gaming industry. With gaming companies like Apple under increasing scrutiny, it is clear that they will need to be diligent in their efforts to ensure that all in-game purchases are made with the knowledge and consent of the purchaser. In the meantime, parents should be careful to monitor their children's in-game activity and set up in-app purchase restrictions where possible. As this latest settlement demonstrates, it can be all too easy for children to rack up significant charges for in-game purchases, even when playing games that are meant to be free.
