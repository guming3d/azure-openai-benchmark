chatgpt: A piece of history has been sold at auction in the UK, as a boxed fruit slice that was originally served at Princess Elizabeth and Duke of Edinburgh's wedding reception in 1947 was sold for a remarkable £560.  The slice, which was presented in its original royal case from Buckingham Palace, also included a compliments slip from the Queen and her husband.

In May 2011, a piece of the wedding cake of Prince William and Kate Middleton sold for a staggering £1,917. This cake, made by Fiona Cairns, was an eight-tiered fruitcake and featured cream and white icing with a delicate floral design.

After all these years, the slice still retained much of its original flavor and was much enjoyed by those in attendance at the auction. The tradition of giving wedding guests a slice of the cake as a memento has continued through the years, although the nature of the cake itself has certainly changed.
