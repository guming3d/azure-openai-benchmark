Gonzalez shared his Wellington home with his wife and three young children and would often go out into their backyard . A police report about the incident, in November 2013, included testimony from a dog expert who said that the dog was constantly in an uncomfortably submissive posture, with his head and ears down while Gonzalez abused him and touched himself. Gonzalez's wife then rushed outside and confronted her husband. The animal, which bore marks of physical trauma afterwards, tried to escape multiple times unsuccessfully and 'did not like what was happening'. Though Florida did not have a law against bestiality for many years, sexual activity with an animal and animal cruelty are both first degree misdemeanors (dog similar to the one abused) The man originally pleaded not guilty before striking a deal with prosecutors. Sexual activity with an animal is a first degree misdemeanor in Florida, punishable by up to a year in prison or a $1,000 fine. Animal cruelty is also a first degree misdemeanor and punishable by a year in prison or up to a $5,000 fine. Cruelty that 'results in the cruel death, or excessive or repeated infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering' is a third degree felony and punishable by up to five years in prison. 'We wish there was stronger laws. We wish people would immediately go to jail and stay there,' Capt. Dave Walesky, Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control, toldÂ WPEC. 'It just doesn't make sense why people do things like that. There's no reason to justify something like that,' he said. Florida is the number one state for animal abuse crimes, according to Pet-Abuse.com. The state officially passed a law banning bestiality in 2011, after many years without one. As of early last year 12 states and the District of Columbia did not have specific laws against bestiality, according to AL.com. However, many cases of bestiality are prosecuted under animal cruelty charges.

chatgpt: In a shocking animal abuse case out of Palm Beach County, Florida, 61-year-old Marc Gonzalez was sentenced to 100 days in jail for his cruel treatment of a dog he shared with his wife and three children. According to court documents, Gonzalez abused the dog on the patio of the family's residence, causing the animal to suffer from physical trauma. The dog, who has not been named, repeatedly tried to escape from the home in an effort to avoid further harm. Gonzalez's abuse of the dog was discovered by a concerned neighbor who heard the animal's cries and reported the matter to animal control authorities. An investigation was launched, and the dog was removed from the home and placed in the care of a local animal rescue organization. In court, Gonzalez pleaded guilty to one count of animal cruelty, acknowledging that he had mistreated the dog and caused it significant harm. His wife and children were not charged in connection with the case. The judge in the case expressed his dismay at Gonzalez's actions, noting that animal abuse is a serious crime that will not be tolerated. He emphasized the importance of treating animals with kindness and respect, noting that they are beings with emotions and feelings that deserve to be treated with compassion. In addition to his jail sentence, Gonzalez was also ordered to complete 500 hours of community service and pay a fine of $2,500. He is also prohibited from owning any pets in the future. Animal welfare advocates applauded the judge's decision, noting that it sends a strong message that animal abuse will not be tolerated in society. They urged pet owners to treat their animals with kindness and care, noting that pets are valuable members of our families who bring joy and happiness to our lives. Meanwhile, the dog at the center of the case is said to be making a full recovery and has been placed in a loving foster home where it is receiving the care and attention it needs. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of reporting animal abuse and neglect, and of the need to hold those who harm animals accountable for their actions.
