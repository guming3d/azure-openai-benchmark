There will be no mail delivery on Saturdays and the U.S Postal Service could sell non-postal products if President Obama's newly unveiled plan to save the agency more than $20 billion goes ahead. The plan would also involve refunding $6.9 billion the mail carrier says it overpaid into a federal retirement fund and restructuring a massive annual payment to prefund health benefits for retirees. While Congressional lawmakers are in favour of a five-day mail delivery service, the proposals still could face opposition. Reduced service: There will be no mail delivery on Saturdays if Obama's controversial plan to save the struggling postal service $20 billion goes ahead . Republican Darrell Issa has refused to consider revamping the prepayment or returning retirement fund money. Issa, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, has offered an amendment that he says brings the savings in his USPS bill to more than $10 billion per year through cuts and restructuring. Lawmakers in Congress have already agreed on the need to overhaul the agency, but several bills take different approaches. Issa's plan, which allows USPS to override contracts and cut the workforce, could spark arguments in Congress when a subcommittee takes up the bill on Wednesday. Big changes: The plan would refund $6.9 billion the mail carrier says it overpaid into a federal retirement fund . The Postal Service has watched its core business of delivering mail plummet as consumers send email and pay bills online. The agency has said it will be unable to deliver mail by the end of next summer if it does not downsize drastically. "The administration recognizes the enormous value of the U.S. Postal Service to the nation's commerce and communications, as well as the urgent need for reform to ensure its future viability," a White House document states. Controversial: Many lawmakers in Congress back five-day mail delivery, but the plan's proposals still could face opposition in Washington . The Postal Service relies on revenue from stamps, packages and other services, not tax dollars, to fund its operations. The agency lost more than $3 billion last quarter. The agency expects to default on the $5.5 billion retiree health payment due at the end of September unless Congress provides relief. Lawmakers have indicated they want to extend the due date for the payment. Issa's bill would end Saturday mail and set up groups to close facilities and cut costs if the agency misses payments. The amendment doubles the amount the agency would have to save by closing processing facilities and phases out delivery to front-door mail slots. The plan to rescue the ailing service, introduced alongside a deficit-reduction package, would refund the $6.9 million it claims it overpaid into a federal retirement fund.

chatgpt: The United States Postal Service (USPS) is considering eliminating Saturday mail delivery to cut costs as part of a broader effort to improve its financial outlook. The proposal is one of several potential cost-saving measures the Postal Service is considering as it struggles to stay solvent. The USPS has been grappling with declining revenue for years, as email and other electronic communication tools have replaced much of the traditional paper-based mail. In recent years, the agency has cut thousands of jobs and consolidated dozens of processing facilities to save money. However, many experts believe that more drastic measures are needed to help the Postal Service avoid a financial crisis. One of the most controversial options under consideration is to eliminate Saturday mail delivery, which would save billions of dollars each year. Supporters of the proposal argue that most Americans wouldn't even notice the difference, as many people now rely on electronic bill paying and other forms of electronic communication. However, opponents say that eliminating Saturday delivery would hurt businesses that rely on the Postal Service, particularly small businesses in rural communities. The USPS is also exploring other ways to generate revenue, including selling non-postal products such as clothing and office supplies. Some critics argue that this move would undermine the agency's core mission of delivering mail, but supporters say that it could help offset the Postal Service's substantial losses. In addition to these potential changes, the USPS is also facing another financial challenge: a $6.9 billion overpayment into a retirement fund. The agency has been in a legal battle over this issue for years, and there are now indications that a settlement could be reached soon. If the settlement is approved, the Postal Service could see a sizable refund of several billion dollars. However, some experts warn that the agency will need to use this money wisely if it hopes to avoid further financial problems in the future. Despite these challenges, the USPS remains a vital part of America's infrastructure, delivering billions of pieces of mail each year to homes and businesses across the country. If the agency is able to find new sources of revenue and implement cost-saving measures, it could be well-positioned to continue serving Americans for many years to come. However, the road ahead will be a challenging one, as the Postal Service faces significant obstacles in today's ever-changing digital age.
