article: The French government is coming under fire from World War II vets - nearly all of them in their 90s and 100s - who say the European nation is breaking its promise to fly them to Normandy to celebrate the 70th anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, 1944, 73,000 American troops landed in northern France and eventually helped liberate the nation from four years of Nazi occupation. Now, at least one US Congressman says France is reneging on its obligation to the few remaining veterans who stormed the beachheads on Normandy. Some 73,000 Americans landed in France on D-Day and helped to liberate the nation after four years of Nazi occupation . Representative Michael Grimm told the New York Post that France should keep its promise and foot the bill for combat veterans who fought in Normandy to fly to France. 'Our chief-of-staff heard it from the French Embassy in DC - that they would be flown out to France,' spokesman Nick Iacono told the newspaper. But a French Embassy spokesman told the Post that the nation had never made such a promise. 'France was supposed to pay for our airfare, hotel and transportation,' Theresa Tarangelo told the Post. 'Now they’re telling us they have nothing to do with it . . . It’s really frustrating.' Ms Tarangelo's father,  Felice John Tulli, landed on Normandy on D-Day Plus One. His unit didn't face the intense firefight of those who breached the Nazi beachheads, but he still saw heavy action as the Allies drove the Nazis out of France. He is now 90 years old.

US Army Master Sergeant Manuel Perez, whose job is to coordinate between D-Day families and the French government, said it was 'common knowledge' that the French government would pay travel expenses for veterans and their spouses to fly to France for the D-Day commemorations this year - up to $7,000 in travel expenses. After all, he says, the government did it for the 60th anniversary of D-Day in 2004. Now Mr Tulli and his family are pooling their finances so that he can be in Normandy to honor the men he served with one last time.

chatgpt: Controversy has arisen around an annual ceremony held by the French government to commemorate the events of Operation Overlord, the historic landing of American troops in Normandy on June 6, 1944. Congressman Michael Grimm claims that the French government promised to fly veterans of the operation to France to participate in the event, but the French embassy disputes this claim. Now, a number of veterans who were invited to attend the ceremony find themselves in a difficult position. Without the promised flights, they may be unable to participate in the event marking the 77th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Operation Overlord was the largest seaborne invasion in history, with over 156,000 troops crossing the English Channel to take part. Among these troops were around 73,000 Americans, who played a significant role in the success of the mission. Despite the key role that American troops played in the operation, the question of whether the French government made a promise to fly American veterans to the annual ceremony remains contentious. Congressman Grimm claims that this promise was made, but officials from the French embassy have denied it. In a statement, the embassy stated that "The French government has never promised to fund or organize any trip to France for veterans of Operation Overlord or their families". However, it is unclear whether this statement constitutes a direct response to Congressman Grimm's claims. Without clarity on whether the French government did actually make a promise to fly veterans to the ceremony, the fate of the veterans who were invited to attend remains uncertain. If the promise was made and then broken, those who were invited may feel disappointed and disheartened by the events. For many Americans, the events of Operation Overlord and the D-Day landings remain a deeply important part of their own personal histories, as well as the history of their country. The loss of any opportunity to participate in events commemorating these events could be seen as a significant blow. Whether the French government ultimately accepts responsibility for the promise, or whether Congressman Grimm's claims prove to be unfounded, it is clear that the controversy surrounding this year's ceremony has cast a shadow over the event. While veterans and their families may still choose to attend the event, the issue of the broken promise may be difficult to shake off.
