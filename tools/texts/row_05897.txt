Watching television could stunt a child’s emotional development, researchers have warned. Sets in children’s bedrooms or left on as background noise could be particularly damaging. Researchers believe the viewing of one-dimensional programmes on a screen and a lack of interaction with people means children take longer to develop an understanding of others’ thoughts and emotions. Concerns: Sets in children's bedrooms could be very damaging (file picture) This can make it harder for children to interact with other youngsters and raise the odds of them getting into fights and scrapes. Researchers put more than 100 boys and girls aged between three and six through a battery of tests designed to assess how well they understood other’s intentions and feelings. This ability, known as the ‘theory of mind’, develops rapidly between the ages of three and five and allows a child to realise that others have had different experiences and hold different views to their own. Leaving a television on in the background can be a distraction and lead to fewer conversations, the researchers found. This, and whether the child had a TV in their bedroom, were both strongly linked with a weaker theory of mind, according to the report published in the Journal of Communication. Long-term effects: Researchers from Ohio University said viewing one-dimensional programmes can mean children take longer to understand thoughts and emotions . Ohio State University researchers said this may be because parents who rely on television to educate their children spend less time interacting with them. However, the US-based research team did find that children benefited if their parents talked to them about the programmes they were watching. In their report, the researchers concluded: ‘Television may have a direct effect on theory of mind development by presenting the child with uni-dimensional portraits of characters and situations that only require superficial processing to understand.’ Dr Amy Nathanson, of Ohio State University, said: ‘When children achieve a theory of mind, they have reached a very important milestone in their social and cognitive development. Children with more developed theories of mind are better able to participate in social relationships. ‘These children can engage in more sensitive, co-operative interactions with other children and are less likely to resort to aggression as a means of achieving goals.’

chatgpt: Ohio University researchers have released a new study that suggests the presence of electronic devices in households can lead to a decrease in social interaction. The researchers found that having a television or other device constantly on in the background was even worse than having devices in individual rooms. According to the study, using electronic devices in the bedroom, as well as having them on as background noise, decreased the amount of face-to-face conversation in households. This decrease in interaction can lead to weakened relationships among family members, as communication is crucial for healthy relationships. The study also found that those who regularly had background noise, such as having the TV on in the background, were more likely to be distracted during conversations, which could lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities for connection. While these findings are not necessarily surprising, they do highlight the growing issue of technology's impact on human relationships. With the increasing prevalence of smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices, it is important to be mindful of how these devices can affect our interactions with others. Experts suggest setting limits on device use, such as having designated times for screen time and ensuring that devices are not used during mealtimes or other important moments. It is also recommended to have regular conversations about technology use and its impact on relationships. The study's lead researcher, Dr. Jessica Logan, emphasized the importance of taking steps to mitigate the negative effects of technology on social interaction. "We're not saying that people should completely eliminate technology from their lives," Logan said. "But it's important to be aware of how technology use can affect our relationships and take steps to ensure that we are still engaging in meaningful interactions with those around us." The study's findings have important implications for families, particularly those with young children. Children who grow up in households with limited face-to-face interaction may struggle with important social and emotional skills later in life. Overall, the study provides important insights into the impact of technology on human relationships. As technology continues to play an increasingly important role in our lives, it is important to be mindful of its effects and take steps to ensure that our relationships remain strong and healthy.
