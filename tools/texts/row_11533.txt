article: Standing at only 5ft 2in tall and using a customised gun with pink cartridges, 16-year-old Amber Hill admits she is ‘not your typical shooter’. She was taught to shoot by her grandfather when she was nine years old and is a rising star in the sport. And yesterday she made her Commonwealth Games debut at Glasgow 2014, missing out on a place in the women’s skeet semi-final, in which competitors fire at clay discs, after a tense shoot-off. 'Not your typical shooter': Amber Hill is pictured yesterday releasing two pink cartridges from her gun . The BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year now has her sights set on the Rio 2016 Olympics. She bowed out of the Games gracefully, tweeting: ‘Thanks for all the support everyone! Missed out on a place in the final in the shoot-off but been a great experience.’ She recently spoke about competing in a male-dominated sport, saying: ‘My nails are bright, I have a sprayed gun and pink cartridges. I’m not a typical shooter. ‘I am still really girly, but sport is a big part of my life. I don’t see why I can’t have a mix of both, even though it is a male-dominated sport.’ In action: Miss Hill, pictured with her spray-painted gun, made her Commonwealth Games debut yesterday . The Berkshire schoolgirl burst on to the shooting scene in 2012 when she equalled the women’s world record. Last year she became the youngest ever winner of a senior gold medal at a skeet world cup in Mexico. She said: ‘This is my first Commonwealth Games. I’ve never been to a competition of this scale so I’ve definitely learned a lot.’ Good sport: The Berkshire schoolgirl missed out on a place in the women's skeet semi-final.

Miss Hill joined her grandfather Bill Rogers on a shoot when she was still in primary school. ‘My granddad’s influenced me so much,’ she said. ‘He’s done everything – he comes every week to training, to competitions.’ Mr Rogers told the BBC: ‘I think she can go to the top. She’s just a natural shot. The first time she picked up the gun, I could see she could shoot.’

chatgpt: Amber Hill, a 16-year-old British shooting star, made her first-ever Commonwealth Games appearance at Glasgow 2014. The young athlete displayed tremendous potential but was edged out of the semi-finals in the women's Skeet event. Despite the setback, Amber is already preparing to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Hill’s Commonwealth debut was full of promise as she scored an impressive 68 out of 75 targets in the qualification round, earning her a spot in the semi-finals. Unfortunately, she scored only 12 in the semi-finals and was unable to secure a place in the final. Despite the disappointment, Hill was incredibly dignified and remained focused on her future goals. “I’m really happy with how I’ve shot this week,” Hill said. “I have had a great experience competing at my first Commonwealth Games, and I’m looking forward to working hard and seeing what the future holds.” The future undoubtedly looks bright for the teenage shooter who has her sights firmly set on the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Hill has already achieved significant success in her fledgling career. She is a two-time winner of the Italian Grand Prix and has broken numerous national records. Hill's experience at the Commonwealth Games will surely spur her on to even greater heights. “I’m back to training on Monday,” Hill said. “There’s a lot of hard work to do between now and Rio, and I’m excited to get started.” Hill has a strong support network around her, including her trainers, family, and teammates. They are all thrilled at her progress so far and have no doubt that she has the talent and drive to succeed. “Amber is an incredibly talented athlete,” said one of Hill's trainers. “She puts in so much hard work and dedication into every training session. I have no doubt that with her skill and determination, she will achieve great things in the future.” The next two years leading up to the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will undoubtedly present challenges for Amber Hill. But she has already proven her tenacity and her determination to succeed. If her outstanding talent and work ethic are any indication, we can expect to see a great many triumphs from this rising shooting star in the years to come.
