article: A pair 17,000-year-old skeletons have been brought to life by a sculptor who has spent seven years creating silicone models of them by studying their pre-historic bones. Elisabeth Daynes has created 'Chancelade Man' and the 'Woman of the Pataud Shelter' based on remains found in France's Dordogne region in the 18th millennium BC. Ms Daynes became an expert in palaeontology after starting out as a make-up artist and creator of masks at the Theatre North in Lille. The silicone reconstruction of the 'Chancelade Man' created by artist Elisabeth Daynes, which is a reconstruction of a pre-historic human . The creation by Ms Daynes, right, which was based on studying his bones, shows a grey and balding man with blue eyes and wrinkled skin . Now she says she gives flesh to the faces and bodies of fossils from all ages of evolution, some from millions of years ago through a collaboration of forensic science, anthropology and art. The skeleton of the 'Chancelade Man', measuring 188cm tall, was discovered in 1888 in the south-west of the country with a curved posture, below the floor of a rock shelter. After years of studying casts of the skeleton's skull as well as carrying out detailed anthropometric surveys, Ms Daynes has created a silicone reconstruction of what the man would have looked like. The silicone reconstruction of a pre-historic female showing her with brown eyes and a rounded face and wearing an animal skin stole . The bones of the woman were discovered in France's Dordogne region and date back more than 17,000 years . And the result is a grey and balding looking man with blue eyes and wrinkled skin, who has been created in a pose similar to that of Rodin's 'The Thinker'. Ms Daynes, who creates he models in her Paris apartment, said: 'My work is done just like a forensic investigation from casts of skulls, which are reconstituted exactly as composite sketches by police. 'These anthropometric surveys deliver a wealth of information such as age and sex.' As well as the 'Chancelade Man', Ms Daynes has also created a female version of a pre-historic human based on the skeleton of a woman also found in the Dordogne region. The silicone model shows a woman, who is thought to have died aged 20 with brown eyes and a rounded face. An exhibition entitled 'Chairs de Orgines' in Bordeaux is where the two silicone models will be on show . The skin coyote stole worn by the female model is also a close representation of what a pre-historic woman would have worn, although she admits the dreadlocks and skin markings are her artistic impressions. She explained: 'My art is a synthesis between scientific observation and imagination.' The models are set to go on show in a exhibition entitled 'Chairs des Origins - our ancestors as you've never seen'. The exhibition will be displayed at a gallery in Bordeaux until December 5.

chatgpt: Elisabeth Daynes, a renowned artist who specializes in creating lifelike reproductions of prehistoric humans, has unveiled her latest creations: two life-size models of our ancient ancestors that are sure to impress both art and history enthusiasts alike. The male model, based on remains of a man who lived 17,000 years ago, showcases incredible detail and accuracy in its depiction of the physical characteristics of our prehistoric relatives. Through the use of techniques borrowed from forensic science, anthropology, and art, Daynes was able to create a highly realistic depiction of what the man might have looked like in life. The model includes features such as a pronounced jaw, a broad nose, and a deep-set brow, all traits that are commonly associated with prehistoric humans. Alongside the male model stands its female counterpart, a stunningly crafted figure that showcases a woman with a round face wearing a fur stole. Much like its male counterpart, the female model is thoroughly researched, with Daynes spending countless hours combing through the historical record to find evidence of what prehistoric women might have looked like. The attention to detail on the female figure is astounding – from the texture of her simulated fur to the intricacy of her facial features, every element of the statue has been carefully considered and crafted. The two models are set to be part of a brand new French exhibition that showcases the rich history of prehistoric humans from around the world. The exhibition serves as a testament to the remarkable work that Daynes has achieved throughout her career, as well as an opportunity for visitors to gain a greater appreciation for the scientific and artistic techniques that are used to bring ancient history to life. For Daynes, the exhibition is the culmination of years of research and hard work. As she explains, "Creating these models is not simply a matter of sculpting clay and creating a likeness. It's about engaging with our shared humanity – understanding the people who came before us, and appreciating the long and complex story of human evolution. With these models, I hope to give people a glimpse into that history and a greater appreciation for the incredible feats of our ancestors." The exhibition is expected to draw large crowds, with visitors eager to explore the rich history of our prehistoric ancestors. For Daynes, it's a chance to showcase her remarkable artwork and share her passion for history and science with a wider audience. As she notes, "We are all connected by the story of human evolution, and I believe that by sharing that story, we can gain a greater appreciation for our place in the world and the journey that has brought us here."
