chatgpt: The home of Stephen and Loni Tavizon, located in Clayton County, Georgia, was recently found in a state of disarray and filth. Upon investigation, authorities found one room containing over 50 bags of garbage that had been left to rot for an extended period of time. The accumulation of trash had attracted various insects and vermin, creating an unsanitary environment for the residents of the home.  Shockingly, eight children, ranging in ages from 2 to 13, were found living in the home. Police reported that the living conditions were not suitable for children or anyone to live in. It is unclear how long the children had been living in these conditions or what their daily routines were like.  As a result of these findings, both Stephen and Loni Tavizon were charged with eight counts of cruelty to children. Additionally, Stephen Tavizon received two misdemeanor counts of contributing to the deprivation of a minor. The potential punishment for these charges could include imprisonment and/or heavy fines.  Neighbors in the area expressed concern and unease upon hearing about the state of the Tavizon's home and the living conditions of the children. Some even stated that they had noticed an influx of insects in the area recently but had not realized that it could be due to a neighbor's home. Authorities have since moved the children to a safer, more sanitary location where they can receive adequate care and attention. It is unclear if they will be returned to the custody of their parents or be put in the care of another family member. The Clayton County Sheriff's Office has urged anyone who suspects child abuse or neglect to report it immediately. They offer a hotline that is available 24/7 to those who want to report instances of child abuse or neglect.  The case of the Tavizons is a sobering reminder of the importance of ensuring that all children are given a safe and healthy living environment. It serves as a call to action for communities to be vigilant and report any signs of child neglect or abuse that they may come across.
