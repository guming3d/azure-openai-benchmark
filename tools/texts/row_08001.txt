article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Your smartphone might help retailers to be smarter about your purchasing habits and even let them send you targeted discounts while you shop. Mobile marketing is an essential tool for the retailer in the next two years, said Gary Schwartz, the CEO of Impact Mobile, a mobile-tech firm. He said nearly half of all cell phones in use today are smartphones, the kind necessary for mobile marketing. In two years, that figure will jump to 70%, he said. You can register with a retailer and sign up for alerts, text messages or other notifications about special offers and sales. The retailer then can keep tabs on your shopping and spending habits and lure you into their stores. Schwartz said it's quite possible that smartphones will help boost sales and in doing so, help lift the economy. "If they're used in a smart way, it will absolutely drive sales," he said. The Gap, along with its other brands Old Navy and Banana Republic, is one of the companies taking advantage of mobile marketing. "Basically we send them offers as they shop," said Amy Carr, the Gap's senior director of customer relationship marketing. The Gap brands have teamed up with Visa on a smartphone app, "Gap Mobile4U." "So Gap/Visa's technology allows you to see where the customers are shopping, and we can [provide] offers or discounts telling them what's going on in the store when we see that they are close to stores or inside malls shopping," she said. Digital marketing consultant Zachary Cohen refers to the technology that links stores directly with potential shoppers as the "Wild West." "There are no rules, there are no protocols," said Cohen. "The law is very fuzzy on it, because the government can't legislate things that they barely understand." Cohen worries about smartphone spam and digital junk mail invading your most personal of personal devices. But Carr said that when it comes to this technology, the industry will most likely regulate itself. Carr said it's too dangerous for retailers to risk angering potential customers with unwanted messages that eat up texting minutes and battery life. After all, sign-up is still voluntary. Shopper David Thomason in Los Angeles said he doesn't like retailers knowing his whereabouts. "They're privy to too much information," he said. "It's invasive." Several other shoppers outside an Old Navy store in Los Angeles also said they would not take advantage of the technology. But there are plenty of other people who have signed up for it. And according to Carr, it is working. "We can see that this has a high take rate, so we know the customer is responding to it," she said. She declined to cite sales figures. The technology is still in the development phase, Carr said, but the company has models, which include unique sales codes, that it can use to measure success.

chatgpt: According to recent reports, over half of all cell phones in the United States are now smartphones. With these devices becoming so prevalent, more and more companies are turning to mobile marketing as a way to reach their customers. And some of the biggest brands out there, such as The Gap and Banana Republic, are leading the way. Mobile marketing involves using smartphones and other mobile devices to target consumers with ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. By taking advantage of the ubiquity of mobile devices, marketers can reach consumers wherever they are, whether that be at home, at work, or on the go. One of the key benefits of mobile marketing is its ability to target consumers with personalized messages. With the right data and analytics, marketers can tailor their messages to specific demographics, interests, and behaviors, allowing them to reach customers in a more effective and efficient manner. However, not everyone is convinced that mobile marketing is all sunshine and rainbows. Some experts worry that the technology used to link stores directly with shoppers lacks regulation, which could lead to privacy and security concerns. For example, one common tactic used in mobile marketing is called geofencing. This involves setting up a virtual boundary around a specific location, such as a store. When a consumer enters that boundary, they can be targeted with ads or other marketing messages. While this can be a powerful tool for marketers, it also raises questions about privacy, as consumers may not be aware that their location is being tracked and used for advertising purposes. Despite these concerns, many retailers are embracing mobile marketing as a way to stay competitive in today's fast-paced business environment. According to recent studies, more than 80% of consumers have used their smartphones to shop, and the majority of those have used their devices to make a purchase. For companies like The Gap and Banana Republic, mobile marketing has become an essential part of their overall marketing strategy. By leveraging the power of mobile devices, these brands can reach their target audiences in new and innovative ways, such as through mobile apps, mobile websites, or SMS messaging. Of course, with any new technology comes the need for clear regulations and guidelines. As the use of mobile marketing continues to grow, it will be important for lawmakers and industry groups to work together to ensure that consumers are protected and that their privacy and security are not compromised. In the end, mobile marketing is likely here to stay, with more and more companies recognizing its potential to reach customers in new and powerful ways. As long as companies are transparent about their data collection practices, and consumers have the ability to opt out of targeted advertising, there is no reason why the mobile marketing revolution cannot continue to thrive.
