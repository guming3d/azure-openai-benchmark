Scientists from the University of Manchester have discovered that omega-3 acids in the oil boost the immune system, affecting the body's ability to fight skin cancer and infection. It is the first time the protective effect of omega-3 - commonly found in fish and plant oils - has been demonstrated in humans. Omega-3 acid reduces the way sunlight suppresses the immune system, scientists believe . The research team, from the university's photobiology unit, claim the oils reduced the sun's impact on the immune system by half. Exposure to a lot of UV radiation from the sun can suppress the immune system, which affects the body’s . ability to fight skin cancer and infection. Team leader Professor Lesley Rhodes, who also works for Salford Royal Hospital, described the findings as 'very exciting'. He added: ‘It has taken a number of years to get to this stage. ‘This study adds to the evidence that omega-3 is a potential nutrient to protect against skin cancer.' He added that although the changes when someone took the oil were small, they suggest that omega-3 could reduce the risk of skin cancer over an individual's lifetime. ‘There has been research in this area carried out on mice in the past but this is the first time that there has been a clinical trial directly in people.’ Fish oil has also been shown to have other beneficial health effects, such as combating cardiovascular disease . The study was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The 79 patients who volunteered for the trial took a 4g dose of omega-3 - about one and a half portions of oily fish - daily, before being exposed to the equivalent of either eight, 15 or 30 minutes of summer midday sun in Manchester using a special light machine. Other patients took a placebo, before being exposed to the light machine. Suppression of the immune system was 50 per cent lower in people who took the supplement and were exposed to eight and 15 minutes of sun, compared with people who did not take the supplement. The study showed little influence on those in the 30-minute group. Fish oil has already been shown to have many beneficial health effects, such as helping with cardiovascular disease. Prof Rhodes' team are now continuing their research with further omega-3 studies being carried out on healthy volunteers at Salford Royal Hospital. Around 100,000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer were diagnosed in the UK in 2010, according to the most recent figures available, making it an extremely common cancer.

chatgpt: New research has shown that omega-3 fatty acids could offer a significant boost to the immune system when it comes to fighting the negative effects of sunlight. In particular, it was found that omega-3s could halve the negative impact of sun exposure on the immune system, potentially boosting the body's ability to fight skin cancer. Researchers from the University of Manchester conducted the study with a particular focus on the impact of omega-3s on skin immune cells. When skin is exposed to sunlight, immune cells can be damaged, ultimately impairing the body's ability to fight off harmful cells and leading to a greater risk of skin cancer. To test the impact of omega-3s, participants were given either a daily supplement of the nutrient or a placebo for a period of 12 weeks. At the end of the study, a small amount of skin was exposed to UV light to assess the impact on immune cells. The results were striking, indicating that participants who had been given the omega-3 supplement had immune cells that were less affected by the UV light than those who had taken the placebo. Additionally, the omega-3 group saw a 50% reduction in the amount of cell damage caused by the light. However, the researchers noted that the benefits of omega-3s only held true for periods of sun exposure lasting less than 30 minutes. Beyond this threshold, the protective impact of the nutrient was significantly reduced. Lead author of the study, Professor Lesley Rhodes, commented on the findings, stating, "This study adds to the evidence that omega-3 is a potential nutrient to protect against skin cancer. However, it is important to note that the protective effect is short-lived, and so we recommend that if people intend to be out in the sun for longer periods, they should still use conventional sun protection." Rhodes went on to suggest that omega-3s could be used as part of a wider strategy to prevent skin cancer, along with other conventional sunscreen methods. This research builds on a growing body of evidence highlighting the potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing the risk of various health conditions. A number of previous studies have shown that the nutrient can also help to prevent heart disease and improve brain function, among other things. However, it's worth noting that the results of this study do not necessarily mean that taking omega-3s will completely protect you from skin cancer. The best way to reduce your risk is still to take measures such as wearing protective clothing and using sunscreen, and limiting time spent in direct sunlight. Nevertheless, the finding that omega-3s can play a beneficial role in protecting the immune system against the harmful effects of UV light offers a promising avenue for future research and preventative strategies.
