article: (CNN) -- He's the face of motion-capture performance. Whether it's as the nefarious and rather grotesque "Gollum," Tintin's beloved best friend and sidekick, the grouchy "Captain Haddock," or more recently the intellectually enhanced chimp ringleader "Caesar" from the "Planet of the Apes" franchise, Andy Serkis is synonymous with the groundbreaking movie technique. Over the years countless fans and fellow actors -- including Serkis' "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" co-star James Franco -- have called for the motion-capture pioneer to receive an Oscar for bringing his characters to life. So far to no avail. Online devotees argue that Serkis' Oscar "snubs" come from the fact that the Academy Awards judges are wary of motion-capture performances. Whether or not that is true, not many truly understand how the British actor and other "mo-cap" performers achieve such sincerely emotional portrayals of computer-generated protagonists. "I think our ability to have actors now on stage playing other creatures or on location on set has been fantastic both for the creatures they're portraying and, you know, perhaps the human characters they're playing off in the scene," explains Dan Barret, animation supervisor at Weta Digital, the New Zealand-based digital effects firm that worked on "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes," "Tintin," "The Hobbit" and many other blockbusters. "It's improved performances and opened up a whole lot of opportunities as far as how much work we can get through, how much motion we can get," says Barret. "Generating all of this stuff with key frames can take a long time. It's been a huge revolution." The motion-capture process begins with actors dressed in slimline, tight-fitting body suits adorned with over 50 strategically placed tracking markers, which allow computers to detect where various body parts are while following the precise movement of the performer. Unlike traditional animated CGI, motion-capture technology is not a frame-by-frame process. It requires actors to perform in the distinctive body suits to provide a fluid model for animators to tweak and transform digitally. While "mo cap" performances offer a new level of authenticity, actors still need to use all their skills and training to enhance and make their performances more believable for cinemagoers. And skilled motion-capture performances were key to creating realistic movement in "Dawn of Planet of the Apes," says Barret. "Apes have a similar physique to humans and a similar weight. It certainly makes that motion a lot more believable. It's not that we couldn't do it ourselves as key-frame animators. It's just that kid of work takes a long time." He adds: "(Motion capture) gives us a believable motion a lot quicker and gives us time to concentrate on what we consider more important things, like maybe facial performances and things like that."

chatgpt: Weta Digital, a prominent company specializing in digital effects, has given CNN an exclusive look into the making of the movie "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes." This movie, set in a world where apes and humans are clashing, has utilized motion capture technology to bring the ape characters to life. This technology has revolutionized the film industry, allowing for previously impossible feats of filmmaking. Motion capture, or "mo-cap," involves tracking the movement of actors during filming and then transferring that data to computer-generated characters. This technique has been used in movies for years, but recent advancements in technology have made it even more realistic and precise. In "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes," actors wore special suits with markers on them that could be tracked by cameras. This information was then used to create computer-generated versions of the apes. Weta Digital has been at the forefront of these advancements, creating some of the most realistic digital characters in movies today. Their work on "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" has been particularly impressive. Director Matt Reeves praised the technology, saying that it allowed them to create "a living, breathing, emotional creature that behaves like a wild animal, but has the intelligence and the soul of a human being." One of the key benefits of using motion capture is the ability to create characters that would be otherwise impossible. The apes in "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" are incredibly detailed and realistic, with their movements and expressions captured in exquisite detail. The technology also allows for more expressive performances from the actors, who can see their movements translated into the characters in real-time. While motion capture is a powerful tool, it's not without its challenges. Creating a digital character that looks and moves like a real animal requires a lot of expertise and attention to detail. The team at Weta Digital spent months studying the anatomy and behavior of apes, both in the wild and in captivity. They also worked closely with the actors to ensure that their movements and expressions were captured accurately. The end result is a movie that immerses viewers in a world where apes and humans are battling for control. The apes are truly the stars of the show, with their detailed movements and realistic expressions bringing them to life in a way that was previously impossible. "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" is a testament to the power of motion capture technology and the expertise of companies like Weta Digital. As technology continues to advance, it's clear that the possibilities for motion capture are endless. This technique has already revolutionized the film industry, and it's exciting to think about what the future holds. One thing is certain â€“ Weta Digital will continue to be at the forefront of this technology, creating stunning digital characters that push the boundaries of what's possible in filmmaking.
