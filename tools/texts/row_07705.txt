Cliphit is designed for people who have always wanted to unleash their inner Phil Collins but don’t have space for a drum kit. The potentially annoying gadget can be played anywhere and uses sensitive clips that, when attached to everyday objects such as a stapler or hole punch, produce a drum or cymbal sound when the objects are struck.

Korg, a Japanese manufacturer of electronic instruments, makes the Cliphit and hopes that the device will enable more people to take up the drums. But because of the reasonable price point, the gadget may be used as an annoying toy. ‘Cliphit is a new electric drum kit that’s ideal for drum practice at home or for casual playing,’ a spokesman said. ‘The clips with their internal sensor attach to anything - a magazine, desk, or almost any surface, transforming it into a snare, hi-hat, or cymbal. ‘Cliphit will breathe new life into your drum practice and is a great way to enhance your experience and creativity.’ Sound is emitted from a three-inch (8cm) speaker on the top of the battery-powered portable domed device when an object attached to a clip (pictured) is hit . Sam Guy, an administrative assistant from Eastleigh in Hampshire, brought one for his office colleagues to play with on their breaks. The 29-year-old said: ‘It’s caused quite a stir in the office I must admit but even the bosses love it. ‘When I first played it I attached it to items on my desk and just started playing by striking my phone and stapler over and over again. ‘As soon as some of our favourite songs come on the radio we’re straight on the drums.’
