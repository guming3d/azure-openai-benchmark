article: A hospital ordered female staff to go on the pill and told them they would be fired if they fell pregnant after a department was left 'frequently shorthanded' by women taking maternity leave. The memo allegedly posted at the pharmacy department of Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok has sparked outrage with many saying it is a blatant violation of human rights. It said: 'From Oct 30, 2014 to Dec 31, 2015, all female staff must take birth-control pills. Do not get pregnant. Anyone who gets pregnant will be asked to leave.' The hospital memo said: 'All female staff must take birth-control pills. Do not get pregnant. Anyone who gets pregnant will be asked to leave' Under the text, more than 25 staff members signed their names to acknowledge it. A photo of the announcement taken by an employee went viral on social media, and drew strong criticism over the perceived prejudice of the hospital's administration. The order also contradicts Thailand's labour laws, which allows 90 days of maternal leave to employees. Rajavithi Hospital director Dr Udom Chaowarin said he has cancelled the order and claimed it was never endorsed as an official policy. He explained it was an internal message andÂ said the supervisor of the pharmacy department, which is '100 percent' women, was worried too many pregnancies would cause a labour shortage. The order allegedly posted at the pharmacy department of Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok has sparked outrage with many saying it is a blatant violation of human rights . Dr Udom said he had talked to the department chief, who explained it was intended to be 'a plea for cooperation' among the department's staff. 'In any case, the act is unconstitutional,' he said. 'So many maternity leaves had affected the department so it was agreed at a meeting the staff would be asked to cooperate. The method, however, infringed on their rights. 'We have settled this and the memo was scrapped. Everyone can get pregnant and the department will have to find other ways to cope with the staff shortage and report to management,' Dr Udom told the Daily News. Human rights commissioner Visa Benjano said the incident is being investigated. Under the Thai labour law, a worker can take maternity leave before and after the birth for not more than 90 days in total including holidays. The employer must pay her the normal wage for not more than 45 days. If she is a member of the Social Security Fund, she also gets a pay from it for the remaining 45 days of the leave. And if she is a civil servant, as in the case of the Rajavithi Hospital, she may also take a personal leave to look after the baby for another 150 days without pay and promotion eligibility for that year.

chatgpt: Employees at Rajavithi Hospital have been left outraged by the posting of a memo at the pharmacy department that threatened female staff with termination if they became pregnant. The memo instructed all female staff members to take contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy, or else face disciplinary action, which could lead to dismissal from their roles. The egregious act by the hospital has prompted accusations that the memo violates basic human rights, especially those pertaining to gender discrimination. The Thai hospital has faced significant backlash, with people condemning the overt sexist and prejudiced order. Social media users voiced their concerns, and the matter quickly caught the attention of the authorities. Dr Udom Chaowarin, the hospital's director, has since announced that he has scrapped the order and apologized for the inexplicable act. He has also promised to investigate the memo's origins and take necessary actions to ensure that a similar incident does not happen again. The order came at a time when several rights organizations have been pushing to eliminate gender biases in societies worldwide. The United Nations Human Rights Office called it a violation of fundamental human rights and criticized the hospital for promoting gender inequality. Organizations like the World Health Organization have long been championing reproductive rights, which includes a woman's right to decide whether or not to have children. The Rajavithi Hospital's memo is in direct violation of these rights and is a backward step from building a more inclusive and progressive society. Gender inequalities have always been prevalent in various settings worldwide. Still, the order from Rajavithi Hospital is particularly egregious, coming from a reputed healthcare institution, whose work involves upholding and promoting good health practices. Instead, the memo sends the wrong message about the institution's values, and many are questioning the credibility of the hospital's staff and management. The hospital's management has promised an investigation to understand the memo's origins and reasons for its posting. The memo's viral image caught the attention of various rights organizations and received international media coverage. The incident has further highlighted the need to address gender inequality, especially in the healthcare sector. The healthcare sector has been grappling with issues of gender inequality, including gaps in employment, promotion opportunities, and salaries. Studies have shown that women make up a more significant number of healthcare professionals worldwide but still earn lower pay and have limited access to leadership roles or training opportunities. The Rajavithi Hospital memo, though retracted, has sparked a conversation on gender biases within the healthcare setting and whether organizations worldwide are doing enough to address these issues once and for all. In conclusion, Rajavithi Hospital's memo demanding that female staff take contraceptive pills or face disciplinary action is an unjust and backward step from building a fair and inclusive society. While the order has since been rescinded, its impact on stakeholders remains, and the hospital management must take steps to address gender inequality and promote progressive values. The incident serves as a crucial reminder that there is still work to be done to eliminate gender biases, and healthcare institutions have a role to play in championing gender equality.
