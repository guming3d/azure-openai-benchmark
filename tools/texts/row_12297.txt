Sludge: Unsuspecting shoppers were showered with slurry when a septic tanker blew up inÂ Hechi, China .

'He complained that everything was ruined and said he needed to shut the business for a week to clean up the mess.' Stench: Some walked away from the scene covering their noses, while others sought medical assistance . Any hope of compensation looks futile however - because the firm which made the truck has blamed the firm which operated it, and vice versa. A spokesman for the company that handles the collection and storage of waste in the south western city said the incident was caused by a technical fault with the vehicle. The company said those affected should seek compensation from the vehicle manufacturer.

Spokesman Cai Chin said: 'No-one suffered physical harm, but many of those covered sought medical attention for fear that chemicals used in the cleaning process, or indeed diseases from the sludge, could cause harm to those affected by the blast.'

What initially looked like a car accident turned out to be a spillage of hazardous waste. Eyewitnesses were quick to react and warned others to stay away from the area as the stench was overpowering. Local authorities and emergency services quickly arrived on the scene to contain the spread. The source of the spillage was traced back to a lorry that was transporting the toxic waste.

These incidents have the ability to cause severe damage to the ecosystem and public health. It is imperative that companies involved in hazardous waste management take the necessary precautions to prevent such occurrences from happening.

Residents of the affected area must receive compensation to recover from the disruption caused. In conclusion, this incident reminds us of the importance of implementing and enforcing strict measures when handling hazardous waste.
