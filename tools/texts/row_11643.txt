chatgpt: Crystal Palace striker, Christian Benteke, has been a standout performer for his club this season. With six goals to his name already, it is no surprise that the ex-Arsenal man is looking to extend his stay at Selhurst Park despite being on a one-year deal. Benteke has been a vital cog in the machine for Palace this season, with his goals contributing significantly to their mid-table position. The Belgian international has been able to find the back of the net in a number of crucial matches, such as the 5-1 demolition of West Bromwich Albion earlier this month. The striker's impressive form has also been crucial to Palace's ascent up the table in recent weeks. The Eagles looked doomed in November, but Tony Pulis has done a remarkable job in turning things around. With just three losses in their last ten matches, Palace have been able to move away from the relegation zone. Despite his age and injury troubles in recent years, Benteke has shown that he still has the ability to be a top-level striker. His physicality and aerial dominance has been a useful weapon for Palace this season, particularly in games where they have needed to play a more direct style of football. Benteke's desire to stay at the club is good news for Palace fans who have been impressed with his performances this season. The striker has become something of a fan-favorite, with supporters taking to social media to express their admiration for him. "I'm delighted to hear that Benteke wants to stay at the club. He has been fantastic for us this season, and I hope we can offer him a new deal," said Palace fan, Dave. It remains to be seen whether Benteke will be offered a new contract by Palace, but the striker's performances this season will undoubtedly have caught the eye of other clubs. The Belgian international will be hoping to continue his goal-scoring form as he looks to secure his long-term future. In conclusion, Benteke's impact at Selhurst Park has been significant this season. His goalscoring form has been a vital component of Palace's mid-table position, and his desire to stay at the club will be welcomed by fans. The striker's physicality and aerial dominance have made him a useful weapon for Tony Pulis, and his form will be crucial if Palace are to continue their ascent up the table.
