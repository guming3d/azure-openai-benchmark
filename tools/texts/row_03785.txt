article: (CNN) -- Hundreds of family members, friends and neighbors of four of the eight victims of a workplace shooting rampage gathered at funeral services around Manchester, Connecticut, on Saturday to share tears and memories. The four men who were laid to rest had each worked at Hartford Distributors for around 30 years before Omar Thornton's shooting spree Tuesday, which ended when he took his own life. "We're a pretty tight neighborhood," said Mary Bey of South Windsor, at the funeral of Craig Pepin, 60, who she described as a "wonderful neighbor and friend and coach and referee." "He touched so many people's lives in South Windsor ... he was a very unique, kind and wonderful man," she told CNN Connecticut affiliate WTNH. Bey also knows a Hartford Distributors employee who was injured in the rampage. "We're very happy he made it through," she said of Steven Hollander, a neighbor who was treated and released from Hartford Hospital. Besides Pepin, Bryan Cirigliano, 51, Douglas Scruton, 56, and Victor James, who was killed on his 61st birthday, were also buried Saturday. "We've just had an outpouring of support," James' daughter told WTNH. "And it just felt good to hear the stories and just to see the amount of people that came to see my dad." Funeral services for two other shooting victims are scheduled for Sunday and Monday, and a candlelight vigil for those killed is scheduled for Sunday evening in Manchester's Center Park. Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell has called for Monday to be a day of remembrance for the victims, asking state residents to observe a moment of silence at 9:15 a.m. On Friday, police arrested a woman they said had accepted stolen beer from a delivery truck driven by Thornton. Hartford Distributors said it had asked Thornton to resign after it found him stealing and selling alcoholic beverages. Thornton's girlfriend told CNN he was being racially harassed at work, but Hartford Distributors' president said Thursday that there were no grievances filed with the company or with Thornton's union.

chatgpt: Four men had been working for a beer distributor for around 30 years when tragedy struck. A disgruntled employee, Omar Thornton, pulled out multiple guns at Hartford Distributors and opened fire, killing eight people and injuring two others. Thornton, who was of African American descent, claimed that he had been racially discriminated against at work and had tried to bring it up to his superiors. However, he felt it was not being addressed, which pushed him to take matters into his own hands. The two shooting victims that will be buried Sunday and Monday are both from South Windsor, Connecticut. William Ackerman, a 51-year-old truck mechanic, and Bryan Cirigliano, a 51-year-old union president and deliveryman, were both described as hard workers who had been with the company for many years. The loss of these two men, along with the others affected by the shooting, has left a deep and lasting impact on their families, friends, and co-workers. To honor these individuals and pay tribute to their lives, a candlelight vigil is scheduled for Sunday evening. The vigil will be held at the South Windsor Community Center, and anyone who wants to attend and support the families of the victims is welcome. The event is being organized by the South Windsor Rotary Club and the South Windsor Interfaith Council. Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell has also called for Monday to be a day of remembrance. It is a time for everyone in Connecticut to honor those who lost their lives and grieve with their families. Rell has requested that all flags in the state be flown at half-mast on Monday in honor of those who died. Although this horrific event has left many people with feelings of anger, sadness, and confusion, the community has come together to support each other in their time of need. The families, friends, and co-workers affected by the shooting will always remember the individuals they lost and honor their memory in the years to come.
