article: By . Harriet Arkell . At first glance, the 200-year-old books are handsomely bound, with the edges of their pages painted in gilt. Look more closely, however, and you will see a beautiful and intricate painting hidden on the edges of the pages. Known as 'fore-edge paintings' (the fore-edge is the opposite of the spine), their existence at all has lain a secret to many since the practice began centuries ago. This fore-edge of the 1837 book Winter by Robert Mudie, shows how the paintings reveal themselves . This is the fore-edge painting on Robert Mudie's Summer, and depicts a seasonal scene in the countryside . Now, however, staff at the University of Iowa have taken a series of photographs showing how the pages of historic books may contain more than just the story written within. Colleen Theisen, a Special Collections librarian at the University of Iowa, revealed the books' secrets in an online posting entitled 'It's a secret to everybody.' The edges of the books' pages have been painted in gilt, but what is not immediately obvious is that the margins of each page have also been painted in such a way that when the book is fanned slightly, a picture of a scene emerges. Ms Theisen used the University's Special Collections and Archives' set of four nature books, published in London in 1837 and entitled Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, by Robert Mudie, to show how the paintings were hidden. She said: 'Each has a landscape painting of the season hidden until you begin to read it and bend the pages to turn them.' Ms Theisen told MailOnline how the paintings were done, using a clamp. She said: 'In order to paint the edges the book has to be clamped in the fanned position to make a flat surface to paint on.  When the clamp is released, the image disappears.' This scene with golden leaves depicts autumn on the book of the same name - but is hidden when it's closed . Robert Mudie's Spring has an incredibly detailed rural scene of horses ploughing a field . The librarian took a picture of the painting hidden within the pages of each of the four books, which were donated to the University of Iowa by Charlotte Smith, for the website ThisisColossal.com. The artist who painted the images is unknown. Fore--edge painting dates back to the 10th century, but the practice of disappearing fore-edge paintings, when they are hidden when the book is fully closed, is thought to date back to 1649. Initially the paintings featured symbols or family crests, but in the latter half of the 18th century, specialist fore-edge painters began to paint scenes or detailed landscapes, or even erotic pictures. The pictures were painted first, before gilt was applied later to the very edges to mask the picture's existence. This photograph of a gilt-edged book shows how disappearing fore-edge pictures look when the book is closed . But when the pages are fanned slightly, a detailed picture of the River Thames in London appears .

Librarian at University of Iowa posts pictures online showing the paintings . Colleen Theisen says the beautiful pictures are 'a secret to everybody'

chatgpt: Fore-edge paintings, the intricate images visible only when book pages are fanned, have been disappearing over the years, making them a rare and sought-after object for bibliophiles. The practice of creating these paintings dates back centuries, with specialist painters mastering the technique to make the art appear seamlessly integrated into the edge of the book's pages making them one of the most unique forms of devotional or decorative art, often used to signal ownership or indicate a specific text. Today, a librarian at the University of Iowa, Colleen Theisen, has brought some of the world’s hidden fore-edge paintings to light by sharing pictures of them online. "The fore-edge painting is a secret to everybody," she said in a recent social media post, "Until you fan the edge to make the image appear." Theisen is the outreach and instruction librarian at the university and has tracked down and curated a collection of books containing fore-edge paintings. She has been posting images of these books on her social media accounts, including Twitter and Tumblr to make them more accessible to the public. Fore-edge paintings have become rarer over time as they are expensive to make and have mostly fallen out of fashion, with only a few specialist painters still mastering the art. They were particularly popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, with some contemporary books still containing these illustrations. The exteriors of these antique books may be unremarkable, but hidden inside the pages are miniature masterpieces. The fore-edge paintings in Theisen’s collection of books depict a wide range of subjects, from landscapes and animals to floral designs, and even images of famous figures. One particularly impressive work in her collection is a rare copy of Shakespeare's "The Works of William Shakespeare" with a fore-edge painting of the Globe Theatre's exterior, an image that only emerges when the book's pages are fanned. These paintings were often used to protect the text and prevent pages from sticking together, while also serving as decoration. The technique requires specialized equipment and careful application; as such, only a few skilled painters are capable of creating these wondrous works of art.  While many know of fore-edge paintings, few have seen them in person, and even fewer own a book with this unique feature. Theisen's online collection offers an alternative way to view and appreciate these hidden treasures from the worlds of literature and art. Theisen has been a lifelong enthusiast of rare books and illustrations, and hopes her online collection of fore-edge paintings will inspire a similar passion in others. "Being able to share these images is an opportunity to not only spread knowledge but to encourage a love of art and literature," she said. "If people are inspired to read these books and perhaps even pass them down to subsequent generations, then I believe I have achieved something significant."  The internet has provided a great platform for sharing information and images, and Theisen's online manifestation of these hidden masterpieces may encourage more people to take an interest in them. By sharing the beauty of these books, she has opened up a new window on this rare form of art, which will help preserve their legacy for generations to come.
