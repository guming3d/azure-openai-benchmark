article: Miles away from the history that is being made in London, a former Olympian is living an entirely different life – one of service and devotion to God. Back then, she was Kirstin Holum, a promising teenage speedskater making her Olympic debut at the 1998 Nagano games. Now 32, she's Sr Catherine Mary, in the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal, driven by a calling that she first began to receive in Nagano. Rising star: Kirstin Holum looked like a promising athlete when she competed in the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics as a 17-year-old . That's where she realised that the life of an Olympic champion may not be for her. Sr Catherine told ABCNews.com:  'I couldn't see myself continuing all through my 20s and 30s like other athletes.' She added: 'I remember it vividly, one day practicing: I said [to my mother], 'I just want to be in a play or a musical in school rather than this.' I had a feeling there was something else for me.' In a December 1997 interview with the Associated Press, Holum - who was 17 at the time - said she was ready to quit speedskating to pursue a career as an artist. Now and then: Holum, now Sr Catherine Mary, left, said she couldn't see herself continuing speedskating into her 20s and 30s. At right, she's pictured in the 1998 Olympics at 17 years old . That same year, she broke her own American record for the 3,000 meters three times, but was looking to leave it all behind. Holum said at the time: ‘There's so much more out there than speedskating. It's too consuming. I don't know what it's like not to skate. I want to get on with [my life].' Several months later, Holum competed in her first and only Olympic games in Nagano, where she came in 6th place in the 3,000m and 7th place in the 5,000m. Her mother and coach was Dianne Holum, who has four Olympic medals under her belt - including a gold she won in the 1972 Sapporo games. Devotion: Looking back at her life, Sr Catherine says she wouldn't change a thing . Dianne Holum said that when her daughter first told her that she was looking to hang up her skates, she was relieved. 'We were real close and I always knew,' said her mother. 'She was getting more and more focused on her faith and I was happy for that.' Looking back at her life now, Sr Catherine says she wouldn’t change anything. In a 2010 interview with CHN Online, she said: 'I don’t miss any of those things, because life is so rich and so full. 'Without all of the technology, we have more time for one another as sisters and also more time to serve God’s people. Life is so much simpler that way.'

chatgpt: Former Olympic speed skater Kirstin Holum, who had a promising career ahead of her after finishing 6th and 7th in events at the Nagano Olympics in 1998, has taken a different path in life. She now serves with the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal in Leeds, putting her faith and service to others above her athletic pursuits. Holum's mother, Olympic champion Dianne Holum, who won three gold medals at the 1972 Winter Olympics, said she fully supports her daughter's decision. "I'm happy that Kirstin is happy and fulfilled in her service to God and others," she said. "It's important to follow your heart and do what brings you joy, even if it may not be the most obvious choice." Kirstin Holum's journey to becoming a nun started after a successful career as a speed skater. She retired from competitive skating in 2001 at the age of 20, citing burnout and a desire to explore other interests. During her time away from the ice, she found herself drawn to the Catholic faith and began discerning a vocation to religious life. After several years of study and reflection, Holum entered the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal, a religious order based in the Bronx, New York, in 2011. She later moved to the order's mission in Leeds, where she currently serves as a volunteer in various outreach programs. Holum's life as a sister is markedly different from her high-profile days as an athlete. Instead of the intense training regimen and travel schedule of a professional skater, she now spends her days praying, studying scripture, and working with the poor and marginalized. In a 2016 interview with the National Catholic Register, Holum explained her decision to enter religious life. "I had a lot of success as an athlete, but there was always something missing," she said. "Once I started exploring a religious vocation, I felt a deep sense of peace and purpose that I had never experienced before. I knew it was the right path for me." Holum's mother, who has been supportive of her daughter's choice, expressed admiration for the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal and their mission of serving the poor. "I think it's wonderful what they're doing, and I'm proud of Kirstin for being a part of that," she said. Holum's story is a reminder that success and happiness do not always come in the form of medals, money, or fame. Sometimes, the greatest achievements are found in quietly serving others and living out one's faith. Kirstin Holum's decision to become a nun may have been unexpected, but it is undoubtedly a source of inspiration and hope for others who are seeking meaning and purpose in their own lives.
