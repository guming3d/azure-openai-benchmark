chatgpt: The iconic Ice Hotel in northern Sweden has installed a fire alarm, much to the chagrin of its loyal patrons. The hotel was forced to install the alarm in order to obtain planning permission this year. While some guests are disappointed at this new addition, others acknowledge its importance for safety. The alarm was put to the test just days after it was installed, when a guest sneaked a cigarette in a hotel cupboard. The alarm immediately sounded and the guest was quickly identified and reprimanded, preventing any damage to the hotel made entirely out of ice blocks. The Ice Hotel is a seasonal hotel that is melted each spring and rebuilt using ice harvested from the nearby Torne River in Jukkasjärvi. The tradition began in 1989, and ever since, the hotel has welcomed visitors from around the world who are enchanted by its unique charm.
