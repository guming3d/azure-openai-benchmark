Even some of the tracks for the Sochi Winter Olympics aren't complete, and those that are, come up short. Course workers added 40 meters (130 feet) to the biathlon track for the Sochi Olympics on Friday because it was too short. The loop should measure 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles). Even though a 5 percent deviation is allowed by the rules, the track at the Laura Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center came up short. Coming up short: Workers prepare the track at Laura Cross-country Ski & Biathlon Center inear Sochi, Russia. Officials found the Biathlon track to be 130 feet too short and had to make some last minute adjustments . 'We had an issue with the length but we made a change, which takes care of it,' biathlon's technical delegate at the Olympics, Max Cobb, said. First doubts about the track length came from the Norwegian team, and they proved right after IBU officials measured the course on Thursday. On the World Cup circuit, most courses are inspected four days before the actual competition though IOC rules are different, leaving organizers less time for adaptions if needed. 'It's much too late and it creates issues,' Cobb said. 'All of us feel it's the right thing to do and we still have (one) day before racing.' The venue hosted a World Cup biathlon event last year but the shape of the course has been modified since. Ready for action: The biathlon winter sport combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting . The new part of the track will be used in the women's 7.5K sprint on Sunday, and after that in the women's 12.5K mass start, the men's 12.5K pursuit and the three relays. U.S. head coach Per Nilsson told The Associated Press he was 'a little surprised it was a little on the short side.' 'It's still the Olympics, so they should have measured that before,' Nilsson said. 'Five percent (deviation) is allowed but this felt like a 7K (for the women's 7.5K). It was the right decision they corrected it. Everybody is happy with that.' Another change to the track moved the starting line back by more than 30 meters. In the initial course set, athletes were not given enough time to speed up from the start before approaching a steep hill. Nilsson called the course 'super tough. It will be a big fight.' 'In some courses on the World Cup you have big climbs and then you have quite some recovery,' Nilsson said. 'Here you're down to the bottom in a tough downhill, so you don't recover the legs and then you have a long, long climb.' Expense: The most expensive Olympic games are now underway.

chatgpt: The biathlon center, located in the heart of Norway, is a hub of training for the country's elite winter sports athletes. The center has long been a staple of the country's skiing and biathlon communities, serving as both a training ground for aspiring athletes and a venue for high-level competitions. Recently, however, the Norwegian team noticed something amiss during their practice sessions at the center. The team began to suspect that the track, which had been used for years without issue, had somehow become shorter. Concerned about the implications of such an oversight, the team brought the issue to the attention of the center's management. After a thorough investigation, it was confirmed that the track had indeed shrunk by a significant amount - 130 feet, to be exact. This news sent shockwaves through the skiing and biathlon communities, as the implications of a shortened track could have far-reaching consequences for athletes at all levels of competition. The center immediately took action to remedy the situation, announcing that 130 feet would be added to the course in order to restore it to its full length. Despite the added length, some athletes and coaches are concerned that the track may not be the same as it was before the shrinkage occurred. "Even a small change in the course can have a big impact on an athlete's performance," noted one coach, who asked to remain anonymous. Others, however, remain confident that the track will perform as expected, especially after the center's management released a statement assuring the public that the additional 130 feet had been carefully measured and added with the utmost care and precision. "We understand the concerns that athletes and coaches may have about this situation, and we want to assure everyone that we take their safety and well-being very seriously," the statement read. "We are confident that the track will perform at the highest level, and we look forward to seeing our athletes continue to train and compete here." For now, it appears that the situation has been resolved without incident. Athletes at the center are continuing to train and compete as normal, and officials are monitoring the track closely to ensure that it meets all necessary safety and performance standards. Still, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of paying attention to even the smallest details when it comes to sports training and competition. One small oversight can have significant consequences - and it's up to all athletes, coaches, and officials to ensure that everything is in order before hitting the track or field.
