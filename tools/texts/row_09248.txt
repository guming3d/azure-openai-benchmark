chatgpt: A tragic incident in the eastern city of Taoyuan, Taiwan, has left a family devastated. Liu Tien, a street vendor, accidentally crushed his own four-year-old son while attempting to flee from the police. The incident happened on Thursday afternoon while Tien and his wife Hsiung were selling fruit from the back of their truck. According to eyewitnesses, Tien and Hsiung spotted the police approaching and panicked. Without a second thought, they jumped into their vehicle, forgetting that their son Wu was playing right in front of it. As the truck lurched forward, Wu was caught under its wheels and died on the spot. The police investigation revealed that the parents were illegally selling fruit on the sidewalk without a license, which is a common practice in Taiwan. The police approached the couple to ask them to move their truck and stop selling fruits, but the couple became agitated and tried to drive away. A police spokesman said that the incident was an unfortunate accident that could have been avoided. "The child was playing in front of the truck, and the parents didn't see him there. When they started the vehicle, he was run over and killed instantly," he said. The incident has shocked the entire community, and people have expressed their condolences to the family. The local government has promised to extend full support to the family in their time of grief. The tragedy has also sparked a debate about the regulation of street vendors in Taiwan. Many people argue that licensing street vendors would help prevent such tragic accidents in the future. Others are calling for education campaigns to raise awareness among vendors and the public about the need to be more responsible and cautious. For now, Liu Tien and his family are bearing the unimaginable loss of their young son. As the community mourns with them and prays for their healing, one can only hope that such incidents will not occur again, and a better system will be put in place to ensure the safety of street vendors and their families.
