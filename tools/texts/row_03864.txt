article: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai is calling the United States' refusal to hand over an undisclosed number of detainees a breach of an agreement that outlines the transfer of power from U.S. forces to Afghanistan. Karzai's accusation comes two months after the United States handed over Parwan prison at Bagram Air Base. The handover of the prison and detainees was considered the linchpin in a larger agreement that spells out U.S.-Afghan relations following the withdrawal of American troops in 2014.

He ordered his defense minister, attorney general and prison administrator "to take required and urgent measures" to ensure the complete transfer of authority. The issue has become a sticking point between Karzai and U.S. military leaders. Karzai has been adamant that all prisoners be under Afghan control, and his latest statement indicates a growing frustration with the U.S. military's resistance to surrender the remaining prisoners.

At the time, Karzai called the action a breach of Afghan national sovereignty. The U.S. military has not publicly discussed the specifics of the dispute. But a military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN in September that the United States was holding on to several detainees over concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases, and under what circumstances they might be released.

The United States also is maintaining custody of several prisoners whose nationalities were not Afghan, said the military official, who was not authorized to publicly disclose the details. Roughly 99% percent of the detainees in custody were turned over, the U.S. military has said. Last year, a loya jirga, or grand assembly of Afghan elders, endorsed the continued presence of U.S. forces following the end of combat operations in 2014, though only if the two countries could agree on the transfer of prisoners, an end to night raids and lifting immunity for U.S. troops accused of committing crimes. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a recent statement made to the press, the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani mentioned that the U.S. military is holding detainees that should be under Afghan control. Ghani expressed his worries about the matter, stating that the U.S. military violated international law. According to a U.S. official, 99% of all detainees have already been turned over to Afghan control, but the remaining detainees have raised concerns among U.S. military officials. The U.S. military is particularly worried about Afghanistan's ability to handle these cases. Afghanistan has long struggled with building its justice system, particularly when it comes to detainees involved in terrorism-related cases. As a result, the U.S. military has been handling high-value detainees in its custody, to ensure that they are dealt with appropriately. However, the Afghan President insists that these individuals are under Afghan jurisdiction and that they should be dealt with according to Afghan law. President Ghani's concerns stem from the potential for human rights violations and the dangers of having detainees held without oversight. While the U.S. military has maintained that it is doing its best to transition these cases to Afghan control, they have expressed their concerns over the matter. In an official statement, they explain that it is important to ensure that these individuals are dealt with appropriately and that their rights are protected. The U.S. military is working closely with Afghan officials to ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible. The Afghan government has continuously pushed for the transfer of detainees, and the U.S. has recognized the importance of having these individuals under Afghan control. The detainee transfer was originally outlined in a memorandum of understanding signed between the U.S. and Afghanistan in 2012, and the U.S. military has since transferred over 4000 detainees to Afghan custody. As the U.S. presence in Afghanistan winds down, the transfer of detainees has become increasingly vital. The U.S. military has emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in this process, and both sides have pledged to work together to ensure that all detainees are dealt with appropriately. In conclusion, the issue of detainees and their transfer from U.S. custody to Afghan control is a complex issue with no easy solutions. As Afghanistan continues to rebuild its justice system and strengthen its rule of law, it is crucial that both the U.S. military and the Afghan government work together to ensure that these detainees are handled appropriately and with respect for their human rights.
