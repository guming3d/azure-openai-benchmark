Fisherman Calvin Conger, 18, found himself playing doctor after catching a pregnant stingray before helping it give birth to two pups on board his family's boat . Conger was about to cut the fish up to use as shark bait before noticing it had an extra stinger sticking out of it's rear end. As his father Terry gave the animal's stomach a push, a baby ray popped out . Calvin's father, Terry, instinctively stepped in, pushing down on the ray's belly while Calvin's mother, Valerie, recorded the bizarre incident. As Terry gently prodded the creature, the tiny baby ray popped out and began wriggling around in the boat, followed shortly by another. Despite nearly becoming fish food, the story had a happy ending for the mother ray and her two new babies, as Calvin decided to let the family go back into the ocean. Calvin told HLN: ‘We put it on the filleting table because we were going to use it for bait. ‘We got a closer look at it and there was a stinger hanging out. I can put it on my resume that I helped birth a stingray.' Calvin was out fishing with his family in Port Charlotte, Florida when the incredible event occurred. After the first baby ray was born, the Conger family noticed another stinger, before helping the fish to give birth to a second pup . Despite nearly being turned into fish food, the ray and her babies were released back into the ocean . Rays are ovoviviparous, meaning they carry litters of young inside them numbering up to 13 which feed on individual yolk sacks. Female rays are capable of storing a male ray's sperm inside their bodies without getting pregnant for years before impregnating themselves at a later date. A pair of rays gave birth to seven young at the Sea Life Aquarium in London despite not having been in the same tank as a male for two years.

chatgpt: A family fishing trip took an unexpected turn when Calvin Conger and his family reeled in a ray that had a surprise in store. The family, out on the water in North Carolina, were planning to use the ray as bait when they noticed something unusual about the catch. Upon closer examination, they realized the ray had a second stinger. Intrigued by this, they decided to investigate further and prodded the stomach of the fish. To their amazement, the ray gave birth to two baby stingrays. Calvin Conger, who was leading the fishing expedition, spoke of the unexpected discovery. "We were just out fishing, having a good time, and then this happened," he said. "It was fascinating to see the babies come out like that." The family captured the moment on camera, with several photos showing the baby stingrays being released back into the water. The discovery was an exciting and rare experience for the Conger family, who were delighted to witness such a unique occurrence. Ray experts have confirmed that it is not uncommon for rays to give birth in shallow waters, but it is rare for humans to observe the event firsthand. In fact, many people are not aware that rays are capable of giving birth in this way. According to marine biologist Dr. Emma Finlayson-Trick, the discovery is significant because it sheds light on the reproductive habits of rays. "This is an excellent opportunity to observe the behavior of these animals in their natural habitat," she said. The discovery has also garnered attention from the scientific community, with experts eager to study the footage and learn more about how rays give birth. Dr. Richard Webber, a noted ray expert, praised the Conger family for their curiosity and willingness to document the event. "This is exactly the kind of firsthand observation that is needed to improve our understanding of these creatures," Webber said. "We are grateful to the Conger family for sharing their footage with us and allowing us to learn from their experience." The Conger family, still in awe of their encounter, said they were happy to have stumbled upon such a rare event. "It was an incredible experience," said Calvin Conger. "We're all so grateful that we were able to witness it first-hand."  The discovery of the baby stingrays is a reminder that there is still so much we have yet to learn about the sea and its inhabitants. Thanks to the curiosity and determination of a family out on a fishing trip, we are one step closer to unlocking the secrets of the deep.
