article: (CNN) -- U.S. prosecutors have filed charges against a security company, accusing it of faking completed background checks to bilk the government of millions of dollars. U.S. Investigations Services used a computer program to "flush" or "dump" background checks -- labeling them as completed, when in fact they had not carried out a quality review as required by the government contract, prosecutors allege in a complaint. The fraudulent behavior involved at least 665,000 background investigations -- about 40% of the total number the company conducted, prosecutors allege. The company received nearly $12 million in bonus payments from 2008 through 2010, which would not have been given if the U.S. Office of Personnel Management had known of USIS's actions, the complaint says. USIS is charged with three counts: false or fraudulent claims; false statements, and breach of contract. Other filings -- including by the defense -- remain sealed. A USIS spokeswoman described the "alleged conduct referenced in the civil complaint" as "contrary to our values and commitment to exceptional service. These allegations relate to a small group of individuals over a specific time period and are inconsistent with the strong service record we have earned since our inception in 1996." After the company learned of the allegations nearly two years ago, it "acted decisively to reinforce our processes and management to ensure the quality of our work and adherence to OPM requirements." "We appointed a new leadership team, enhanced oversight procedures, and improved control protocols. From the outset, we have fully cooperated with the government's investigation and remain focused on delivering the highest quality service under our OPM contracts," the spokeswoman said. On its website, USIS describes itself as "the leading industry provider of background investigations to the federal government, with a long-standing reputation for service, quality and timeliness." The spokeswoman said "integrity and excellence are core values at USIS that guide the work of our outstanding 6,000 employees." Web's black market peddles fake documents .

chatgpt: Yesterday, the U.S. government charged U.S. Investigations Services (USIS) with false statements and breach of contract. The allegations stem from the company's alleged use of a computer program to "flush" or "dump" background checks. According to prosecutors, at least 665,000 background investigations conducted by USIS were affected by the company's actions.  USIS is a major provider of background checks and security clearances for the U.S. government. The company's actions, if proven, would represent a major breach of trust, and could have serious national security implications.  In a statement, USIS said the alleged acts were "contrary to our values." The company added that it was "committed to working with our customers and partners to resolve any issues arising from these allegations." The charges against USIS follow a lengthy investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. The investigation was launched after concerns were raised about the accuracy and reliability of background checks conducted by the company.  USIS has a long history of working with the U.S. government, and has been responsible for conducting background checks for many high-level government officials, including members of Congress and the executive branch.  If the allegations against USIS are proven, they would be a major blow to the company's reputation, and could have serious consequences for its business. The U.S. government is likely to review its contracts with USIS, and other companies providing similar services may also come under scrutiny.  The charges against USIS come at a time when concerns about national security are particularly high. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of security breaches and leaks of classified information. The allegations against USIS serve as a reminder of the importance of thorough and accurate background checks, in order to ensure that those with access to sensitive information are trustworthy and reliable.  In conclusion, the charges against USIS are serious and could have major implications for the company's business and reputation. The U.S. government is likely to take a close look at its relationship with USIS, as well as the broader issue of background checks and security clearances. Ultimately, the allegations against USIS serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining high standards of trust and reliability in all aspects of national security.
