A mushroom cloud rises above a row of skyscrapers in what looks like a devastating nuclear bomb blast.

Jaw-dropping: The incredible mushroom-shaped cloud hanging over Denver looks like a nuclear explosion but is a weather-front blasting in from the Rocky Mountains . Somewhere over the rainbow: Photographer Greg Thow took the incredible images of the extraordinary weather over Denver . Mr Thow, 49, has also taken equally stunning shots of lightning blasts and arching rainbows - all from the comfort of his balcony. His work has become so well-known in his community that he often gets texts from neighbours and friends when a picturesque storm or view presents itself. He said: 'In the case of the cloud photograph, I was just minutes from home and I drove there quickly upon receiving a text message. 'Hundreds of photos had started appearing online that afternoon from cell phones around the city - but my vantage point put the skyline squarely in front as the cloud continued to grow in size. 'Thank goodness it wasn't a nuclear bomb as I'm not sure I would be around right now to tell you about it.' Glorious: A red sky rises over the Colorado city in one of the dramatic series of pictures taken from Greg Thow's balcony . Flash: The photographer is able to capture the images - such as these lightning strikes - because his neighbors give him tip-offs about interesting weather . He has been capturing the images from his roof deck for the past six months. His favourite is the huge rainbow, as he had to run home to take it and it 'would have disappeared' if he had been two minutes later. The dramatic shot of a bolt of lightning illuminating the downtown part of the city is another that the photographer savours. The mix of images is only possible because of Denver's broad weather system, which is influenced by its proximity to the Rocky Mountains and can range from blizzards to arid spells. One local phrase is: 'If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes.' Spectacular: The huge blast of purple-tinged lightning streaks across a row of skyscrapers in Denver skyline .
