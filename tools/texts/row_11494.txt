article: (CNN) -- Barenaked Ladies have nixed their plans to play at SeaWorld after viewing CNN's "Blackfish" documentary. "This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time," the band said on a Facebook post late Wednesday night. "The Seaworld folks have been gracious, and extended us invitations to the park to learn more about what they do, and how they do it." A park spokesman told CNN that the show has been taken off the theme park's concert schedule. The decision to cancel the Canadian rock band's performance came two days after drummer Tyler Stewart posted a tweet saying the group is "looking at options" after viewing the documentary. The documentary -- which aired on CNN last month -- tells the story of the SeaWorld trainer who was killed in 2010 by an orca named Tilikum. Fans launched an online petition last week asking the group to cancel after the Barenaked Ladies announced it would perform at SeaWorld's Orlando park on February 15, 2014, during its "Bands, Brew & BBQ" events. Mike Garrett of St. Catharines, Canada, posted the petition on Change.org asking band members to watch "Blackfish" and "learn how SeaWorld and other captive display facilities such as Marineland in Niagara Falls have for decades exploited marine mammals solely for profit." Garrett said he was "disappointed" when he heard the group was scheduled to play there "in light of all the horrific information we're learning." "I'm hoping to grab the band's attention on this issue and ask them, on behalf of all their animal-loving fans, to reconsider performing there," Garrett wrote. His petition had gained more than 9,200 signatures by Wednesday afternoon. It worked. "We here at Barenaked Ladies have made a decision based on what we feel. It's not about money, or petitions, or press... But it is about our fans," the band said Wednesday night. "We listen to them, and they're important to us." The park's website does not list Barenaked Ladies on the schedule. February 15 and four other weekend dates just say "Coming Soon." Acts that are listed on the calendar include Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Martina McBride, 38 Special, Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery.

chatgpt: In a bold move, the popular American rock band "Heart" has decided to cancel their upcoming gig at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. The cancellation notice, which came out on Thursday night, follows a viral petition by a fan named Mike Garrett, calling on musicians to boycott the wildlife theme park over their mistreatment of orcas.  In a statement released by the band, they expressed discomfort and concern about the documentary "Blackfish", which tells the story of Tillikum, a 12,000 pound orca that killed SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010. After watching the documentary, Heart says they no longer feel comfortable proceeding with the gig. The documentary "Blackfish" has been the subject of controversy since its release in 2013, renewing debate about whether orcas should be kept in captivity. It highlights the stressful living conditions and treatment of orcas, which often results in aggressive behavior towards humans. The film inspired a movement that put pressure on musicians to boycott performing at SeaWorld and other facilities that keep killer whales in captivity. Mike Garrett, the creator of the online petition, expressed delight at Heart's decision, saying he was hoping to grab the band's attention on the issue. The petition, which currently has over 1,000 signatures, calls on other performers, including REO Speedwagon, Martina McBride, and Cheap Trick, to follow Heart's lead and cancel their SeaWorld shows. SeaWorld has been facing widespread backlash in recent years over the treatment of its captive orcas, which has led to a decline in attendance and a loss of partnerships with major corporate sponsors. The company has been working on rebranding itself as a conservation-focused enterprise, but the public and animal rights activists remain unconvinced. The decision by Heart to cancel their SeaWorld gig is a significant blow to the theme park, which relies on live entertainment to attract visitors. The move sends a message that musicians are willing to take a stand against animal cruelty and could inspire others to follow suit. In conclusion, Heart's decision to cancel their SeaWorld gig is a victory for animal rights activists and a strong message to other musicians that performing at facilities that keep animals in captivity is no longer acceptable. The move is a reminder that musicians have the power to influence public opinion and push for positive change in the world.
