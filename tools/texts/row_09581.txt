article: Avram Grant admits he jumped into the deep end taking over Ghana just before the Africa Cup of Nations but after almost a month with his new players reckons he is getting on swimmingly. The former Chelsea manager saw his team through to the quarter-finals in Equatorial Guinea on Tuesday after a storming come-from-behind win against South Africa in their final group match in Mongomo, where a double substitution midway through the second half was followed by two goals in 10 minutes. 'Having to learn every day about my team has not been easy but I think I now know enough about all of them,' he said after the 2-1 victory ensured top spot in Group C and a quarter-final in Malabo on Sunday.

'The Nations Cup is nothing new to me. I've been watching it all my life. Obviously being here is a little different to what I've done before but I did a lot of research and preparation. 'We had a good training camp and I've had a chance to also see how the players react after losing and after wining. You saw how we bounced back after we lost our first match.' Grant was under immediate pressure from a skeptical media and public after Ghana let a lead slip and lost to a last-gasp goal against Senegal in their opening group game.

'The game was in our hands. I'm very happy for the players, they showed once again as they did in the previous game their spirit and the determination. We came through the Group of Death,' Grant added.
