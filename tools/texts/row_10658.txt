Witnesses say around 450 women had to undergo the testing in the district of Betul which was organised by the Madhya Pradesh government. The Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojna wedding ceremony is paid for by the government and helps women from poor families to marry. But according to the Times of India, women were made to have the tests allegedly on government orders because it believes women are taking part in the ceremony to receive gifts. Nine women were reportedly found to be pregnant and banned from the ceremony. But government officials deny virginity tests took place. They said the tests had been to ensure the women were not pregnant. In India, a bride's virginity is highly prized and pre-marital sex is frowned upon. India's National Commission for Women is now calling for the Madhya Pradesh government to explain itself. Girija Vyas, chairperson of the Indian National Commission for Women, said: 'Such a shameful act where girls had to reportedly undergo tests to prove their chastity to avail the government's financial aid were sinful and could not be tolerated in a sane society. Rajest Prasad Mishra, Betul district collector, added: 'I have given the orders to probe the complaints on alleged virginity and pregnancy tests conducted on would-be-brides.' Government officials deny virginity tests took place but said they did test to ensure the women were not pregnant . In 2009, more than 150 women were allegedly tested on government orders. Mass marriages, generally organised by social organisations, are common in India where the custom of dowry is still widespread.

chatgpt: Angry protests have erupted in Madhya Pradesh following allegations of forced virginity testing of 450 women. Witnesses claim that the testing was organized by the Madhya Pradesh government, which has denied the allegations but claims that it wanted to ensure that no woman was pregnant.  According to local media reports, the testing was conducted as part of a mass marriage ceremony in the state's Shahdol district in central India. An angry crowd gathered outside the local government office, condemning the alleged testing as a gross violation of women's human rights. Many women who were reportedly tested claimed that they were humiliated and felt traumatized as a result. "I felt like I was being treated like an animal, not a human being," one woman told local media. "It was humiliating and shameful. I can't even express my feelings." The Madhya Pradesh government has faced widespread criticism over the alleged testing, with many human rights activists and campaigners calling for an immediate investigation. Several political leaders have also condemned the testing, with one opposition leader calling it a "brutal and shameful act". The incident has once again brought to the fore the issue of women's rights and the need for the government to take swift action to protect them. Women's rights groups have long complained about the lack of protection afforded to women in India, where rape, sexual assault, and harassment are all too commonplace. The Madhya Pradesh government has continued to deny the allegations but has promised to investigate the incident. "We take these allegations very seriously and will do everything in our power to ensure that justice is done," a government spokesperson said. As the investigation continues, activists and campaigners are urging the government to crack down on those responsible for the alleged testing and to take steps to safeguard women's rights in the state. The incident highlights the need for greater awareness and education on women's rights and underscores the importance of ensuring that women are empowered to speak out against abuses of their human rights.
