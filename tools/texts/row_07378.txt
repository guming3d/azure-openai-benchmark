Male life expectancy has risen at the rate of six hours a day over the past 30 years, a study shows. Lifespans are increasing so rapidly that a boy born in 28 days’ time will – on average – live a week longer than a boy born today. Life expectancy for women, meanwhile, is rising at the rate of four hours a day, according to analysts at the Office for National Statistics. Healthy: Life expectancy for men is growing at a rate of six hours per day, but for women it is four hours . Boys born in England and Wales in 2011 are likely to live for an average of 78.7 years, nearly eight years more than a male child born at the beginning of the 1980s. Women continue to live longer than men. A newborn girl in 2011 can expect to reach the age of 82.6 years  – six years more than their counterparts from the 1980s. The unprecedented changes have multiplied the numbers of older people in the population and seen men close the lifespan advantage enjoyed by women. Medical advances and the transformation of the economy have led to people eating more healthily and living in better heated and more comfortable homes. Men are also more likely to work in safe and air-conditioned offices than in polluted industrial plants. The ONS report said: ‘One major factor is the improvements in mortality from circulator diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, partly driven by changing smoking habits and medical and technological advances. Life expectancy: A baby born in 2011 will live nearly eight years longer than a male born in 1980 . ‘People who are younger than 60 have also benefited from a lifetime of NHS health care.’ The report gave estimates of life expectancy covering the years between 2009 and 2011. It said the gap between life expectancy at birth for boys and girls had narrowed from six years in 1980/82 to the four years estimated in the latest count. Over the past 30 years, it said, life expectancy at birth has gone up by six hours a day for boys and four hours a day for girls. Nine out of ten boys can now expect to live to reach the age of 65 – a retirement point now being raised because of rising life expectancy. Fewer than three quarters of those born in the early 1980s could expect to reach retirement age. ‘Life expectancy at birth in England and Wales has reached its highest level on record for both males and females,’ the report said. Life expectancy has been rising since the industrial revolution transformed the living standards of most. By 1901, men could expect to reach the age of 45 and women 49. Two world wars and the economic slump between them dragged down lifespans only temporarily and life expectancy has been rising smoothly since the early 1960s.

chatgpt: According to new research, babies born in just 28 days' time are likely to live a week longer than babies born today. This is particularly good news for boys, who generally have lower life expectancies than girls. The research was carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in England and Wales, and looked at all babies born in the two countries in 2011. At that time, life expectancy for a newborn boy was 78.7 years, while for a girl it was 82.6 years. However, the ONS found that life expectancy is increasing faster for boys than it is for girls. The findings suggest that a boy born in four weeks' time is likely to live to 78.8 years, a week longer than a boy born today. Girls' life expectancies are also improving, but at a slower rate, meaning that a girl born in 28 days' time is likely to live to 82.8 years, just two weeks longer than a girl born today. While it's not clear why boys' life expectancies are increasing faster than girls', there are a number of factors that could be contributing. One possibility is that boys are simply being born healthier than they were a decade ago, with fewer genetic and environmental factors affecting their health. Another possibility is that improvements in healthcare and technology are benefiting boys more than girls, particularly when it comes to conditions that are more common in boys, such as asthma and autism. These conditions are often diagnosed and treated earlier in boys, leading to better outcomes. Despite the good news for boys, however, women still live longer than men overall, and their life expectancies are growing at a slower but still steady rate. This is due in part to the fact that women often have healthier lifestyles than men, with lower rates of smoking and alcohol consumption. Women are also more likely to seek medical help early when they notice symptoms of illness or disease, leading to better outcomes in the long term. This is particularly important when it comes to conditions that are more common in women, such as breast cancer and osteoporosis. Overall, the ONS's findings suggest that life expectancies are continuing to improve in England and Wales, with boys seeing the greatest gains. However, it's important to remember that these are just predictions, and there are many factors that can affect someone's life expectancy, including their lifestyle choices, social and economic status, and access to healthcare. It's also worth noting that life expectancy is not the same as quality of life, and that many people will live shorter or longer than the average due to factors outside of their control. Nevertheless, the ONS's research is a hopeful reminder that improvements in healthcare, technology, and lifestyle choices can contribute to longer, healthier lives for people of all ages and genders.
