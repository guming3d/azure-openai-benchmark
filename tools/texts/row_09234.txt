Last week, about 100 cattle wandered onto a South Dakota reservoir covered in six-inch-thick ice while seeking shelter in a severe windstorm. Their hunt for rest turned tragic when the ice collapsed under their enormous weight of more than 1,000 pounds. Fell through: Mike Carlow (left)  and Bob Pille (right) use a shovel and a prying tool to free a dead cow from the ice on White Clay Reservoir south of Pine Ridge, South Dakota on Tuesday. Last week an estimated 100 of Carlow and his brother Pat's cows wandered onto the ice, broke through and died . Loss: Mike Carlow looks over the scene at White Clay Reservoir. He estimates that he lost $300,000 worth of cattle and is uncertain how his business is going to recover . Most of the cows that fell through drowned, leaving their owners out hundreds of thousands of dollars and also heartbroken at the gruesome accident. Brothers  Mike and Pat Carlow own the herd on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and discovered the horrific scene on January 8th during the morning feeding time. Pat had a hard time finding the cattle at first, but then eventually found a group feeding near the reservoir where there were several floating masses of dark brown. He was sickened when he realized the masses were his cows, drowned. Breaking through: Oglala Sioux Tribe solid waste director Bob Pille uses a prying tool to break ice on White Clay Reservoir on Tuesday. It's rare for cows to stray onto frozen over bodies of water . 'I've been ranching over 40 years,' Mike told the Casper Star-Tribune, 'and I don't ever remember cattle walking out on ice or falling through.' The Carlows say that most of the cows that wandered out onto the ice were prized 2-year-old bred heifers. The older ones apparently knew better than to walk out onto the ice. They say the ice was about as thick as a slice of bread, collapsing easily when forced down with 1,100 pounds of cattle. The Carlows, who are members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, estimate that the incident cost them $300,000 and they don't know how that's going to impact their business yet. 'I don't know what the hell is going to happen,' Mike said, adding that the ranching business 'was starting to really pay off. Hopefully we can stay in business. This week the Carlows have been working to extract their dead cows from the body of water, which has been a complicated job.

chatgpt: In a tragic incident last week, several cows owned by brothers Mike and Pat Carlow, members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, wandered onto a frozen reservoir in search of shelter from a wind storm. Unfortunately, the ice was not thick enough to support their weight and many of the younger heifers fell through, drowning in the icy water. The Carlows estimate that they lost around $300,000 worth of livestock in the accident. This is a significant financial loss for the brothers, who rely on their cows for their livelihood. This incident highlights the dangers that can arise when cows are out in the open during times of extreme weather. In this case, the wind storm created a situation where the cows were looking for any kind of shelter they could find. The frozen reservoir seemed like a safe place to hide, but unfortunately turned out to be an unexpected trap. The Carlows are not the only ranchers to have suffered such a loss. It is not uncommon for cows to wander onto frozen bodies of water during the winter months, with similar accidents occurring across the country each year. In response to this tragedy, the Oglala Sioux Tribe is urging ranchers in the area to take extra precautions to ensure the safety of their livestock. While it may be difficult to prevent cows from wandering out into the open, there are steps that can be taken to minimize the risks. For example, providing adequate shelter and fencing can help to keep cows contained during inclement weather. In addition, educating ranchers about the dangers of frozen bodies of water could help prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future. The loss of these cows is a reminder of the challenges faced by those who work in agriculture. While ranching can be a rewarding career, it is also a risky one, with unexpected events like this one leading to significant financial losses. Despite the difficulties they face, ranchers like the Carlows are dedicated to their work and to producing high-quality meat for their communities. The loss of these cows is deeply felt by the Carlows, and serves as a reminder of the importance of supporting local ranchers and farmers.  As the Oglala Sioux Tribe mourns the loss of these cows, they are also looking to the future, seeking ways to prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future. Their efforts, and those of other ranchers across the country, are critical to ensuring the safety and well-being of livestock and the communities they serve.
