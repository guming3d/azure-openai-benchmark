The final product: Maryland mother Michelle Cohn made butter using nothing but her own breast milk . Ms Cohn, who has a 16-month-old daughter, shared the simple process she used. The idea occurred to her when she was home alone for the first time since her daughter was born. 'I needed to make sure that I kept my milk production up,' she says. 'So I was hand expressing into a little container and then I remembered one time I was at a fair and they had a butter-making contest, where they had milk in jars and you shook it. 'So I wondered if you could do that with breast milk. I looked it up online and sure enough, you could and I did it.' Sole ingredient: Ms Cohn started with a container filled with her own breast milk . More volume: She then moved it to a larger container, and continued to add milk . She says the first time she tried it, she used about two ounces of milk, and after she shook it for about 45 minutes, the first butter began to form. She shook it for another 15 minutes, which yielded a small amount of butter - the size of a soybean. 'The next day, I put a little bit of milk in the fridge overnight and I added to that the next day, but a lot more - closer to eight ounces - and I started shaking. And that time, within about two minutes, I had butter,' she says. Ms Cohn says the result was 'not all that different from regular butter.' Solid goal: After vigorous shaking for 45 minutes, the butter began to form and she placed it in this pan . I can't believe it's butter: Ms Cohn spoons up some of the final product . While another Reddit user claimed to have made cupcakes with breast milk butter and fed them to her family, Ms Cohn said she hasn't shared hers with anyone else, and prefers to save her milk for her daughter. Ms Cohn says she posted the photos on Reddit because she thought others might find them interesting . She adds: 'I think the idea of an adult person consuming breast milk or a product of breast milk is sort of novel, so people are unsure how to react to it.'

chatgpt: Michelle Cohn of Rockville, Maryland has discovered a unique way of turning breast milk into butter. Her discovery came after witnessing a butter-making contest involving shaking jars of milk at a local fair. Cohn, a mother of two, was inspired to try the experiment herself after witnessing the butter-making contest. She first experimented with cow's milk, but the results were not satisfactory. She then decided to try the experiment with her own breast milk. To the surprise of many, vigorous shaking of breast milk in a jar led to the formation of butter. Cohn shared her findings on social media which quickly went viral. While some were surprised by Cohn's discovery, others were quick to point out that breast milk is, after all, a bodily fluid that is rich in fat. Cohn, who has been breastfeeding her children for several years, explained that the experiment was both fun and educational for her children. She also noted that the butter produced was safe for consumption, as long as it had been properly sanitized. The discovery has raised questions about the potential benefits of breast milk butter. Some have pointed out that breast milk is more easily digestible than cow's milk and contains antibodies that can help boost the immune system. However, health experts have advised against experimenting with breast milk in such a manner. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned against feeding infants anything other than breast milk or formula. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned against consuming breast milk from anyone other than one's own child. Cohn's discovery has also sparked some controversy on social media. Some have criticized her experiment as being inappropriate or even disgusting. However, Cohn remains unphased by the criticism. She explained that she simply wanted to share her discovery with others and to encourage others to explore the science of everyday items. The discovery has also led to Cohn becoming somewhat of a celebrity in the breastfeeding community. She has been invited to speak at several breastfeeding events and has even been featured on a number of news programs. In conclusion, Michelle Cohn's discovery of turning breast milk into butter through vigorous shaking has sparked some debate and controversy. While some have questioned the safety and appropriateness of such experimentation, others have praised Cohn for her scientific curiosity and willingness to share her findings with the world.
