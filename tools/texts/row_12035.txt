article: Chicago (CNN) -- Was Saturday night some crazy bad dream? Because the Charlie Sheen show I saw at the Chicago Theatre on Sunday night bore absolutely no resemblance to whatever it was the Detroit crowd and I witnessed Saturday. The entire nonsensical, rambling, random multimedia production? Scrapped. In its place: a live 90-minute talk show, with Sheen as the guest. From the start it was obvious a whole new show was planned. Gone was the sadly unfunny comedian warming up the crowd. Instead, a guy who never introduced himself to the audience was on stage at about 8:15 p.m. to introduce Sheen to Chicago. (I happened to recognize him since I interviewed him the day before in Detroit -- Sheen's tour promoter from Live Nation, Joey Scoleri). The crowd gave the headliner a standing ovation. Sheen replied, "Wow ... wow," inserting one of his trademark expletives. The actor and the still-unknown-to-audience "other guy" (Scoleri) sat down in two chairs on a spartan stage, with the audience still standing and cheering, then chanting "Detroit sucks! Detroit sucks!" "No, they don't," Sheen said into the mic. Scoleri was now the emcee, simply asking Sheen preplanned questions covering everything, including the "goddesses," his marriages, his firing from "Two and a Half Men," troubles with the law in Aspen, Colorado, call girls at New York's Plaza Hotel and why he pays for sex. Answer: "I have millions to blow, and I ran out of stuff to buy." It was classic Sheen -- caustically funny, crude, shocking and downright hilarious. He was relaxed and smoking and playing with audience members with the emcee as referee. He told the story of how he passed up being the original "Karate Kid" so he could take a much better opportunity in "Grizzlies 2," based on his dad's unwise advice. Laid back and comfortable, Sheen became the guy Detroit came to see but didn't get. This was just funny, funny Charlie. Yes, booze abounded here, too. And throughout, the highly intoxicated crowd was so pleased with Sheen that many just shouted, "(Expletive) Detroit!" It was as though the packed house of about 3,600 fans in Chicago couldn't understand how Detroiters could have booed this show. I wanted to stand up and scream at them, "Detroit didn't have this show!" and then scream back at Sheen and the "other interviewer guy," "Can you please bring this show back to Detroit?" iReport: Fans cheer Sheen in Chicago . Detroit was apparently some demented practice session. Here in Chicago, not much circuitous babble about Vatican assassins and trolls and warlocks -- some, just not 20-minute rants. Sheen felt the love and got his game on in Chicago. At the merchandise stand, I bypassed the shirt that said "Sheenius" and instead bought the $15 dog tag, which on one side says: "Charlie Sheen's Violent Torpedo of Truth Defeat is Not an Option Tour 2011." The flip side says....wait for it..... #winning. I'm wearing it now. CNN's Kareen Wynter and Rachel Wells contributed to this report .

chatgpt: Charlie Sheen, the infamous actor and former star of the hit sitcom Two and a Half Men, is no stranger to controversy. He has been in the news many times for his off-screen behavior, which has included drug use, wild partying, and public meltdowns. But now Sheen is making headlines again for a different reason- his latest venture into the world of entertainment. After his "Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour bombed in Detroit, Sheen decided to revamp the show and turn it into a talk show format. The new show, called "Charlie Sheen Live: The Sheenius," premiered last night to a packed audience in Los Angeles. Sheen sat down with his first guest, Dr. Oz, and the two discussed a range of topics, including Sheen's infamous past, his health and wellness, and even his sexual exploits. At one point in the conversation, Dr. Oz asked Sheen about his past use of prostitutes. Sheen replied candidly, saying that he had paid for sex in the past because he had "run out of things to buy." The comment drew laughter from the audience, but also criticism from some who felt that Sheen was trivializing the issue of prostitution. Sheen defended his comments, saying that he was simply being honest and that he didn't see anything wrong with paying for sex as long as it was consensual and safe. He also said that he had never forced anyone into prostitution or engaged in any illegal behavior. The conversation quickly shifted to other topics, however, as Sheen and Dr. Oz discussed the importance of mental health and wellness. Sheen talked about his own struggles with addiction and mental health, and said that he was in a much better place now than he had been in the past. Throughout the show, Sheen was engaging and likeable, even poking fun at himself and his past mistakes. He seemed comfortable in the talk show format, and the audience responded positively. However, it remains to be seen whether the show will be a success in the long run, or whether Sheen's baggage from his past will continue to overshadow his talent. Regardless, Sheen seems determined to move forward and continue to create new opportunities for himself. He seems to have found a new niche in the world of talk shows, and it will be interesting to see where he takes this new venture. For now, Sheen's fans and critics alike are tuning in to see what the controversial actor will say next. And whether they love him or hate him, one thing is certain- Charlie Sheen is a force to be reckoned with in the world of entertainment.
