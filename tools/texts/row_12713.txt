article: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani armed forces have killed 80 militants since launching an assault on a region recently held by the Taliban, the military announced Sunday. Displaced people from Buner district flee the fighting. Three soldiers have been killed and eight wounded in the crackdown in the Buner district in the northwest of the country, the military statement said. The Pakistani offensive started in the province last Sunday, after Taliban militants moved into Buner, a move that alarmed U.S. and Pakistani officials. Pakistani security forces also killed at least 16 militants late Friday and early Saturday in the Mohmand district, in the country's volatile tribal region, the country's military said on Saturday. The incident appears to be separate from the hostilities in Buner. However, it reflects the tensions in the region and could signal a spread of fighting resulting from the crackdown. In the incident, about 100 militants attacked a Frontier Corps post in the Mohmand Agency, or district, an area where militants hold great sway. Troops returned fire and killed the 16 militants, the military said. Mohmand is in the country's Federally Administered Tribal Areas that border a volatile region in war-torn Afghanistan and Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. Earlier this year, Pakistan had entered into an agreement with militants, allowing them to enforce Islamic law, or sharia, in parts of Swat Valley in exchange for ceasing violence. The Swat Valley is a broader area that includes several provincial districts, including Chitral, Swat, Shangla, Malakand, Upper Dir, and Lower Dir. But Pakistani officials say the armed militants' advance into Buner district violated the agreement and briefly halted peace talks between the two sides in North West Frontier Province. Representatives from Pakistan's government and the Taliban restarted their negotiations on Friday and were planning to have another session soon, a provincial spokesman said. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries.

chatgpt: In a significant crackdown on Taliban militants, the Pakistani security forces have succeeded in eliminating at least 80 militants in the country's tribal region. This operation marks the latest in a week-long offensive by the Pakistani army against the militant group. According to the security forces, scores of Taliban militants, including some high-ranking commanders, were targeted in the early morning raids across the country's tribal region. The forces launched the operation after receiving intelligence that the militants were planning to mount attacks against key military and civilian targets. During the operation, the security forces faced stiff resistance from the militants, resulting in the deaths of three soldiers and injuries to eight others. The injured soldiers have been admitted to a nearby hospital and are receiving medical treatment. According to officials, the operation is part of the military's ongoing efforts to eliminate terrorism from the country. It is also aimed at securing the region and disrupting insurgent activities. Commenting on the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan praised the security forces and expressed his appreciation for their efforts. He reiterated his government's firm commitment to eliminating terrorism in the country and vowed to continue to support the security forces in their efforts to maintain law and order. The recent operation comes amid a spate of terrorist attacks in the region, highlighting the ongoing threat posed by the Taliban and other militant groups. In recent months, the Pakistani army has intensified its efforts to combat the militants in the region, resulting in several successful operations and the elimination of key targets. The crackdown is also part of the government's broader efforts to promote stability and security in the region, while creating a conducive environment for economic and social development. The government is investing heavily in the region, including initiatives to promote education and create employment opportunities, in its bid to promote peace and prosperity. The recent operation is a clear demonstration of the Pakistani government's commitment to combating terrorism and preserving peace and stability in the region. While the loss of life and injuries suffered by the soldiers is regrettable, the operation will undoubtedly serve to disrupt the activities of the militants and, ultimately, make the region safer for all.
