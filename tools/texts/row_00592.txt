article: Mistakes by NHS staff are  to blame for the death or significant harm of 250 patients a day, figures show. In just six months there were 45,476 errors with such serious consequences, including incorrect diagnosis and patients given the wrong treatment or drug. Of these, 1,958 led to death and 43,518 resulted in significant harm. NHS hospitals have been told to report to the Care Quality Commission any incidents in which a patient comes to harm or the harm is only narrowly avoided. These include pressure sores, medication overdoses, false diagnosis and surgery in the wrong area. When near misses are also taken into account, the data from NHS England shows there was a total of 725,314 safety incidents between April and September 2013, though the majority were very minor. The figure is nine per cent higher than the previous six months. Officials said this is because staff are being more honest – not that care has got worse. But campaigners said the findings were probably an underestimate as many trusts still do not own up to every mistake. Since 2010 all NHS hospitals have been obliged to report to the Care Quality Commission any incidents in which a patient comes to harm or the harm is only narrowly avoided. These include pressure sores, medication overdoses, false diagnosis, surgery in the wrong area or treatment being given too slowly. But in the past some staff have not owned up to such mistakes for fear of legal action by patients or relatives. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans in March for hospitals to improve their safety in the hope that it could save 6,000 lives over the next three years . Peter Walsh, of charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said: ‘These figures are a timely reminder that there is an awful long way to go. ‘It is surprising how much error actually happens. 'Most experts believe that there is still very significant under-reporting so the real figures are probably worse.’ He said that studies had estimated that as many as one in ten patients admitted to hospital were involved in a patient safety incident, although this included other Western countries. ‘We need to get the culture right and have a regulation system that’s fit for purpose,’ he said. In March health secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans for hospitals to improve their safety in the hope that it could save 6,000 lives over the next three years. They include closer monitoring of hospitals as well the recruitment of extra staff specifically tasked with cutting down on harm. Dr Mike Durkin, NHS England’s director of patient safety, said it was ‘hugely encouraging’ that more incidents were being reported as it showed staff were ‘increasingly comfortable with speaking openly about mistakes and learning from error’.

chatgpt: The National Health Service (NHS) in England has recorded an alarming number of errors with serious consequences in the last six months, according to figures released by NHS England. A total of 45,000 incidents were reported, with 1,958 of those resulting in fatalities. The figures also reveal that there were 725,314 safety incidents recorded in the same period last year, marking a nine per cent rise. The majority of these were minor incidents according to officials, with the increase attributed to the honesty of staff reporting. The NHS has always been praised for its dedicated staff and the high-quality care they provide. However, these statistics raise serious concerns about the safety of patients in the NHS. The errors recorded range from medication mistakes to surgical errors and misdiagnosis. One of the cases that stands out is that of a 47-year-old woman who underwent surgery to remove her left ovary after being diagnosed with a benign cyst. However, due to a mix-up in paperwork, the surgeon removed the right ovary, leaving the woman unable to have children. In response to these cases, NHS England has launched an investigation into the errors and the reasons behind them. The investigation will focus on the factors contributing to the mistakes, such as staff workload, lack of training or outdated procedures. Despite the seriousness of the situation, officials have emphasized that the vast majority of incidents were minor, with only a small percentage leading to serious consequences. They also stressed that the increase in the number of recorded incidents was due to staff honesty in reporting them, rather than a decline in patient safety. The NHS is one of the largest employers in the world, with over 1.3 million staff members. While errors are an inevitable part of healthcare, the scale of these latest figures highlights the importance of continued efforts to improve patient safety. One such initiative is the introduction of new technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which can help to reduce the risk of human error in healthcare. This technology can assist healthcare professionals in tasks such as medical diagnosis and prescribing medication, ultimately leading to fewer errors and better outcomes for patients. The NHS has also implemented measures such as mandatory training for staff on basic safety procedures, as well as more advanced training for those in high-risk roles. These figures serve as a stark reminder of the importance of patient safety in the NHS, and the need for continual improvement in this area. NHS officials have vowed to take action to address the issues highlighted in the latest figures, working to reduce errors and further protect patients in the future.
