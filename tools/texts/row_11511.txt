A mother who complained about her 14-year-old daughter studying  a play containing 400 swear words has suffered a torrent of foul-mouthed abuse – from teachers. Gerardine Stockford expressed dismay on Mumsnet after finding her daughter Anna was studying the gritty drama Mogadishu – which contains 218 uses of the F-word and ten of the C-word – as part of her GCSE drama course. Mrs Stockford, 52, a former social worker, is running a petition to get the Government to put age controls on exposing pupils to swearing as her daughter had felt uncomfortable in classes at Teddington School in Richmond, West London. Former  pupils there include actors Keira Knightley and Sean Pertwee. Education Secretary Michael Gove has said he shares her concerns. But one Mumsnet user, who claimed to be a teacher, responded: ‘Censorship – that’s what you want. So you can impose your middle- England, white, middle-class values on a world that no longer exists. ‘As a teacher, I will say very bluntly how sick and f****** tired  I am of parents like you who think they are experts on all f****** areas of the curriculum.’ Another said: ‘This really, really p***** me off .  .  . I teach and have had half-***ed complaints from parents on occasion .  .  . What really boils my p*** is people having opinions about things they haven’t even read and certainly don’t understand.’ Mrs Stockford was so upset by the ‘vile’ abuse she removed the thread from Mumsnet. She said she was ‘no prude’, but was shocked by the language of the play, written by former teacher Vivienne Franzmann, about racism in a tough secondary school. She said: ‘This would not have been deemed suitable for under 18-year-olds if it was shown in a cinema, so it should not be studied by under-16s in school.’ Teddington School in Richmond, west London, said students were invited to withdraw if they felt uncomfortable, but none did so . Mr Gove said in a letter to Mrs Stockford’s MP, Vince Cable, that teachers should be trusted to decide what to teach but, ‘as a father’ he was worried about the use of a play ‘littered with extreme language and explicit references’. The Department for Education said: ‘We expect schools to alert parents before a text of this nature is taught and to give parents the option of withdrawing their children from these classes.’ Teddington School said students were invited to withdraw if they felt uncomfortable, but none did so.

chatgpt: Geraldine Stockford, a 52-year-old mother, expressed her dismay over the curriculum at Teddington School in Richmond after her daughter, Anna, felt uncomfortable in classes studying the Mogadishu drama. The play contains a staggering 218 uses of the F-word and ten uses of the C-word, which according to Geraldine, are completely inappropriate for children to be exposed to. In a thread on Mumsnet, Geraldine shared her concern for her daughter's wellbeing, saying that the constant use of profanity in the play made her daughter uncomfortable and distressed. She further stated that she understands that the play is meant to be edgy and provocative, but it simply goes too far, especially for students who are still developing emotionally. The Mogadishu drama is a popular piece that captures important themes like racism, prejudice, and xenophobia. However, the use of the derogatory language has raised questions of whether it is crossing the line in the education sector. This raises the bigger issue of how acceptable it is to introduce extreme material in the classroom, particularly for students who may be too young to appreciate it. Geraldine is not the only parent expressing concern over the Mogadishu drama's use of language. Several other parents on Mumsnet have written about their own experiences with their children and the play. Other parents expressed support for Geraldine's stance, calling the use of expletive language in a classroom setting as "unnecessary." Some argue that the use of strong language in art is protected by the freedom of expression, yet others believe that schools should prioritize nurturing their students' growth, rather than exposing them to potentially-extreme content. In this case, there is a thin line between free expression and ensuring that students are not exposed to potentially damaging content. Schools should be more mindful of the influence and impact certain content can have on impressionable young minds. As an alternative, some parents suggest more age-appropriate content to ensure that students are learning about important topics without having to experience disturbing or uncomfortable language. It is the role of educators to strike the right balance between education and the appropriate content suited for their students. Teddington School, in response to the parent's concerns, has pledged to review the curriculum and determine if the play should be removed entirely or if adjustments should be made to the content. The school promises to take the matter seriously and come up with a solution that is both beneficial for its students and meets its ethical stance. In conclusion, the debate about what is and isn't appropriate in the classroom is ongoing. However, one thing remains clear: students should be exposed to content that is age-appropriate and encourages their growth, rather than causing anxiety and distress. While edgy and provocative content is welcome in the arts, educational institutions should ensure that students are not exposed to material that they are not ready to handle.
