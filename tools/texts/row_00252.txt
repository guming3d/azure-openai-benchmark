article: London (CNN) -- British police arrested two men following a trespassing and burglary incident at Buckingham Palace this week, authorities said Saturday. The Metropolitan Police are still investigating the incident Monday night in which at least one man scaled a security fence to gain entry to the palace. One man was arrested for burglary, trespass and criminal damage, police said. The man was found inside the palace in an area open to the public during the day, police said. The second man was arrested for alleged conspiracy to commit burglary. No members of the royal family were at the London residence during the incident, police said. The incident has prompted a review of security at Buckingham Palace, the best known of Queen Elizabeth II's palaces. It's not the first time an intruder has managed to get into the central London palace. In 1982, Michael Fagan was arrested in the queen's bedroom after gaining access to the building via a drainpipe. According to news reports from the time, the queen woke to find him by her bed and talked with him until she was able to raise the alarm. That incident led to promises of tighter security at the palace. Other incidents have occurred since, but none has involved anyone getting as close to the queen as Fagan did. However, in 2004, a fathers' rights campaigner dressed as Batman evaded security to stage a protest on a Buckingham Palace balcony. Jason Hatch, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner, used a ladder to scale the perimeter fence before climbing onto the balcony, where the royals appear on ceremonial occasions such as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine in 2011. Concerns escalated after a Daily Mirror reporter got a job at Buckingham Palace as a servant before U.S. President George W. Bush stayed there during a state visit in November 2003. Stand-up comedian Aaron Barschak had highlighted lax security by gate-crashing Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor less than six months earlier. Buckingham Palace's 19 State Rooms, filled with magnificent paintings, sculpture and antique furniture, are open to paying visitors in summer, when the royal family is elsewhere. The palace is the administrative center for the royal household, as well as the queen's London residence. Laura Smith-Spark reported from London and Nicky Robertson reported from Atlanta.

chatgpt: Police have arrested two men who allegedly attempted to break into Buckingham Palace. According to authorities, one of the suspects scaled a fence to gain entry into the iconic residence. Fortunately, no member of the royal family was present in the palace when the incident occurred. The intruder was eventually apprehended by palace guards and was found in an area that is usually open to the public during the day. This news comes as a shock to many, as Buckingham Palace is one of the most heavily guarded landmarks in the world. However, it is not the first time that intruders have managed to gain access into the palace. In 1982, an intruder famously broke into the queen's bedroom while she was sleeping. More recently, in 2013, a man scaled a fence and made his way into the palace's state rooms. While no one was harmed in either incident, the subsequent investigations revealed significant gaps in the palace's security measures. Following the most recent incident, palace security has been tightened, and an investigation has been launched. A spokesperson for the palace stated that they are taking the matter "very seriously" and that the safety and security of its residents are of the utmost importance. The two suspects, whose identities have not yet been revealed, are currently in police custody. It is unclear whether they were working together or if they were acting alone. Authorities have not ruled out the possibility of additional arrests. News of the break-in has sparked concern among members of the public, with many voicing their worries about the level of security at Buckingham Palace. The palace is visited by millions of tourists every year, and with such high profile visitors, it is crucial that security measures remain at the highest level possible. In conclusion, the attempted break-in at Buckingham Palace highlights the continued importance of maintaining top-notch security measures in high-profile locations. Since several intruders have managed to gain access to the palace in the past, the authorities must continue to work on improving security in order to prevent further incidents.
