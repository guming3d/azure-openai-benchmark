Back to work: Monday is the least productive day of the week, with a third of workers saying they feel tired from the weekend (library image) The first day of the working week is the least productive for half of the nation, new research has revealed. About 48 per cent of Britons go to work in the wrong mindset and more than a third feel tired at the start of the week. Furthermore, the research shows that 57 per cent of workers feel anxious and stressed during the weekend in anticipation of the working week ahead. Half said they spent up to three hours working on or answering work emails or calls over the weekend. The study of nearly 6,000 adults also indicated thatÂ 52 per cent believe their health and well-being is negatively impacted by work due to lack of exercise, sleep and relaxation. 45 per cent said work had a negative impact on family . relationships, with a third considering quitting because of it. Surprisingly, 28 per cent revealed they had been in the middle of a 'romantically . special moment' with a partner when work interfered. In other countries this figure is higher, however. For Spaniards, work has ruined a romantic moment for six in ten people, while in Italy that figure is 46 per cent. The research was carried out by Westin Hotels and Resorts. Sue Firth, Occupational Psychologist at the London Stress Clinic, said: 'People need the weekend to relax and unwind from the stresses of work. That way, they come back on Monday full of energy. 'Many . of us feel obligated to answer emails at home when we should be able to . rest or make ourselves available for work discussions that could really . wait until after the weekend. 'Over . time this is going to affect a person's well-being, leaving them tired . and moody which in turn can affect personal relationships. All hours: Over half of those surveyed said they spent three hours working at home over the weekend, with 57 per cent revealing they felt stressed about the week ahead during their days off (library image) 'It can also make us feel resentful about work and less likely to contribute when we are in the office. 'I . tell clients to pick out a landmark a short distance from home and use . that as a cutoff point, so that when you go past it, you mentally leave . work behind ready to enjoy home time. 'If . you have to work at home, limit the number of evenings you'll do this . in a week and stop working after 9pm to ensure you get a good night's . sleep.'

chatgpt: A new study has revealed that almost half of Britain's workforce starts the week in the wrong mindset. According to the research, 48% of employees are not mentally prepared for Monday mornings, with over a third feeling tired after the weekend.  The study, which surveyed 6,000 working people, also found that a majority (57%) feel anxious during their days off, worrying about the week ahead. In fact, over half of those surveyed reported working for at least three hours on weekends.  These findings point to the growing problem of work-related stress and its negative impact on mental health. Indeed, over half of those surveyed believed that work was having a negative impact on their health and family life.  The study was conducted by the insurance firm Aviva as part of their Workplace Wellbeing Index, which aims to promote better work-life balance and support positive mental health in the workplace.  "The results of our study demonstrate the importance of ensuring employees have access to the support they need to maintain mental wellbeing," said Dr. Doug Wright, medical director of Aviva UK Health.  The findings also reveal a worrying trend of job dissatisfaction, with a third of those surveyed considering leaving their jobs due to work-related stress. This highlights the need for employers to address issues of work-life balance, workload, and job security in order to retain talent and promote employee wellbeing.  "The wellbeing of our employees is paramount," said Anne Woods, HR director at a large UK-based company. "It's imperative that we provide a supportive and nurturing work environment that encourages employees to thrive both professionally and personally."  The Aviva study echoes similar findings from recent workplace wellbeing reports, which have identified work-related stress as a growing problem in the UK. In response, many employers are implementing health and wellness initiatives, such as employee assistance programs, flexible working arrangements, and mental health support services.  It is clear that work-related stress is a major issue for many people in the UK, with negative impacts on both personal and professional life. While there is no single solution to this complex problem, initiatives aimed at promoting work-life balance, reducing workload, and improving mental health support can make a significant difference in promoting employee wellbeing and job satisfaction.
