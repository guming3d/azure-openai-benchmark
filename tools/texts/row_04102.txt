article: COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Five members of the Sri Lanka's Civil Defense Force (CDF) were killed in a suicide blast in Sri Lanka at a church outside the capital of Colombo Sunday morning, police said. Sri Lankan police officers investigate Sunday's suicide bombing near Colombo. Eight other CDF officers and two civilians were wounded, police said. Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but police suspect the bomber was a member of the Tamil Tiger rebels. There was no immediate response from the Tamil Tiger rebels to the incident, which, police said, occurred at St. Anne's Church in the Colombo suburb of Wattala, located on a roadway to the country's only international airport about 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of the capital. The attack happened during a weekly festival that usually draws a large crowd shopping for vegetables and household goods. The suicide bomber walked into an area where CDF officers were stationed and detonated his explosives, police said. Investigators suspect the bomber targeted the area because 150 police officers who help patrol the road to the airport are billeted there. Government forces have engaged rebels in heavy fighting for more than a year in the Kilinochchi region, once the center of political power for the Tamil Tigers. The 25-year civil war between ethnic Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan government has left more than 65,000 people dead. The Tamil Tigers were founded in 1976, and the U.S. State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. The rebels, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), are fighting for the creation of an independent nation, citing discrimination by the country's Sinhalese majority. Earlier Sunday, Sri Lanka's navy said it had destroyed a Tamil Tiger rebel boat allegedly attempting to smuggle in military supplies through the northern coast. Commander D.K.P. Dissanayake, a navy spokesman, told CNN that four rebels were killed in attack after the boat was engulfed in fire. He said the incident occurred just after midnight Sunday but gave no other details. There was no immediate response from the Tiger rebels to that incident. CNN could not independently verify the government's claim because media is debarred from Sri Lanka's battle zones. In the past, both sides in the conflict have exaggerated accounts of military operations. On December 20, the Navy said it destroyed a similar rebel boat trying to smuggle military supplies through the coast near the northeastern coastal village of Mullaitivu. However, a second supply boat was caught on Air Force aerial surveillance cameras unloading along the coast. "They included assorted ammunition, artillery shells, mortar shells and other items," a senior Air Force official told CNN. He spoke on grounds of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media.

chatgpt: The peaceful town of Negombo in Sri Lanka was rocked by a deadly blast on Sunday morning during a weekly festival that drew a large crowd of locals and tourists to the area. The attack, which targeted a church, was suspected to be the work of the Tamil Tiger rebels, though no immediate response was given by the group. Eyewitnesses to the blast described the chaos that ensued following the explosion. "There was smoke and debris everywhere. People were screaming and running in all directions," one witness said. Emergency services rushed to the scene to provide assistance to those injured in the attack, with the death toll currently standing at twenty-three. Police suspect that the bomber was a member of the Tamil Tiger rebels, a group known for its violent tactics in its quest for independence. The group has been responsible for a number of attacks across Sri Lanka in recent years, and this latest incident is likely to fan the flames of tensions between Sri Lankan authorities and the Tamil Tigers. In addition to the church blast, a boat was also destroyed in the early hours of Sunday morning. The Navy has confirmed that four Tamil Tiger rebels were killed in the incident, which occurred just hours after the church bombing. The authorities believe that the same group was responsible for both the church attack and the boat destruction, which were both carried out using explosive devices. The Tamil Tiger rebels have not yet made any official statement regarding either incident. However, authorities have warned that the situation in the country remains tense and that the likelihood of further attacks cannot be ruled out. The Sri Lankan government has responded to the attacks by increasing security measures across the country. The military has been placed on high alert, and additional troops have been deployed to areas where there may be a heightened risk of further attacks. The government has also urged the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the authorities. The international community has also condemned the attacks, with the United Nations expressing its condolences to the families of those affected. The US Embassy in Sri Lanka has issued a statement advising American citizens to exercise caution and avoid areas where large crowds gather. The aftermath of the latest attacks has left many in Sri Lanka shaken and afraid. The country has a long history of sectarian violence and civil strife, and these incidents are a stark reminder that the peace and stability of the region remain fragile. As the authorities continue their investigations, the people of Sri Lanka will be hoping that swift action is taken to bring those responsible to justice and prevent any further attacks from occurring.
