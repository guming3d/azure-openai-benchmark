chatgpt: Pakistan's Railway Minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, recently offered a staggering $100,000 reward for the person who kills the filmmaker responsible for the movie "The Innocence of Muslims." However, the prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, has condemned the bounty, according to his spokesman. "The prime minister has clearly stated that we cannot condone any form of violence, and this bounty is not acceptable," the spokesman said. The railway minister's party, the Awami Muslim League, has expressed concerns over his comments, stating that they firmly believe in nonviolence. "The Awami Muslim League believes in peaceful protest, and we do not advocate violence in any form," the party representative said. "We are concerned about the railway minister's comments and would like to clarify that his statements do not represent the views of our party." The filmmaker behind "The Innocence of Muslims" has already gone into hiding following protests across the Muslim world. The film has been accused of blasphemy and insulting the Prophet Muhammad, which has led to widespread condemnation. The Pakistani government has also taken action against the film, blocking access to the video-sharing website YouTube, where the trailer for the movie was first posted. This is not the first time that the railway minister has been involved in controversy. Earlier this year, he was at the centre of a heated debate when a train accident killed dozens of people. Many accused him of negligence, and there were calls for his resignation. The government will need to take swift action to address the railway minister's comments to prevent any potential acts of violence against the filmmaker. They have already called on the international community to condemn the film, and they will need to continue to work towards finding a peaceful resolution to the ongoing controversy. It remains to be seen whether the railway minister will retract his comments, but it is clear that his party does not share his views. The situation is being closely monitored, and the government will need to act decisively to ensure that any potential threats are dealt with effectively.
