article: Cyclists and motorists are well known for their mutual dislike of each other, with both parties accusing the other of hogging the road. And this unfortunate Jaguar driver certainly hasn't helped relations. Cyclists were stunned to see the motorist driving his car on a narrow cycle bridge over a railway line. Tight spot! The unfortunate driver kept apologising and telling cyclists he had made a terrible mistake . Cyclists watched in disbelief as the motorist drove his car over the £2m bridge reserved for pedestrians and cyclists in Cambridge . They heard the £2 million bridge 'creaking and cracking' as the driver squeezed onto the famous covered bike bridge in Cambridge city centre. The man, who was in his late 50s, eventually realised his mistake, profusely apologised, and reversed all the way back down the bridge at the north end of Cambridge station. Cyclist Ruth Platt, 43, did a double-take when she spotted the driver on the way home from her yoga class. She cycled past him, then went back and asked him if he knew what he was doing. 'A lot of cyclists were giving him a really hard time, but he kept saying he was really sorry and had made a terrible mistake,' said Mrs Platt, who photographed the car. 'I could hear a bit of creaking and cracking, so I hope the engineers made the bridge strong enough for a car, as it's much heavier than a bike. 'He wasn't trying to take a short cut, he really had made a big mistake and I actually felt quite sorry for him.' After realising his mistake, the motorist reversed - but not in time to stop the bridge groaning under the weight of the car . The bridge was built 23 years ago and has a red path for cyclists on the left and a slightly raised one for pedestrians on the right. It was designed to be a quick and safe off main-roads-route from the city centre to the south-eastern suburbs of the city for cyclists, so they could avoid cars. The bridge was given a £500,000 face lift seven years ago, when the floor was replaced. Councillor Kevin Blencowe, from the city council, said: 'I think he needs to get his eyes tested. 'How someone can mistake what is clearly a narrow cycle path and footbridge for a road bridge is beyond my imagination. 'I have never heard of this happening before and the bridge has been there for more than 20 years. 'If he had got to the end of the bridge he would have got stuck as the path gets even more narrow and there are bollards to stop cars.'

chatgpt: A famous £2m bridge in Cambridge suffered structural damage when a Jaguar, weighing nearly 2.5 tonnes, crossed over it on Tuesday evening. The historic Trinity College Bridge, located in the heart of the city, was groaning under the weight of the luxury vehicle, prompting immediate concerns about the structural integrity of the bridge, which is an important landmark of Cambridge. According to eyewitnesses, the incident occurred at around 6:45 pm when the Jaguar driver decided to take a shortcut across the bridge. He was apparently unaware of the bridge's weight restrictions, which limit the maximum weight of vehicles to 3 tonnes. The car, weighing nearly 2.5 tonnes, caused the bridge to groan under its weight. Traffic quickly came to a standstill as residents and passers-by gathered around to witness the incident. The driver, who was visibly shaken, immediately left his car and rushed to apologise to the authorities. The incident also prompted an emergency inspection by the council's engineers to determine whether the bridge had suffered any damage. Fortunately, the engineers confirmed that the bridge had not suffered any major structural damage in the incident. However, there were some visible signs of strain on the bridge, and it will require some repairs before it can be reopened to traffic again. A temporary diversion has been set up for pedestrians, and a spokesperson for the council has urged motorists to observe weight restrictions to avoid similar incidents. Following the incident, the motorist responsible for the incident has issued a statement apologising for his "terrible mistake". The man, who has not been named, stated that he was completely unaware of the weight restrictions for the bridge and that he deeply regretted the damage caused. "I would like to offer my sincere apologies to the people of Cambridge, and particularly to Trinity College, for any inconvenience or damage caused," he said. Trinity College, which owns the historic bridge, has declined to comment on the incident but has confirmed that it is cooperating with the authorities to assess the damage caused. The college is one of the oldest academic institutions in the world and has a long history of conserving historical landmarks in Cambridge. This incident has once again highlighted the importance of preserving historic landmarks in Cambridge and the need for motorists to observe weight restrictions to avoid causing damage. The Trinity College Bridge is a much-loved landmark in the city, and it is essential that every effort is made to keep it safe and secure for future generations. The incident also serves as a warning to motorists to be aware of the rules and regulations regarding weight restrictions on city roads, to avoid causing harm or damage to important landmarks.
