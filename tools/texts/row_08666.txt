article: (CNN) -- A company due to take over the management of one of the venues used in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa has pulled out of the deal after miscalculating the running costs. The Sail Stadefrance Operating Company (SSOC) -- a partnership between South African events company Sail and French consortium Stadefrance -- were due to take up a 30-year lease on Cape Town's Green Point Stadium on November 1 this year. But Cape Town's residents could now end up paying for the $600 million stadium -- as the management of the venue transfers to the city in January 2011. SSOC chairman Morne du Plessis said that the company had incorrectly anticipated the amount it would take to run and maintain the stadium, estimated at around $6 million per year. "In the light of unresolved matters that affected the viability of the lease we have advised the city that SSOC would not be in a position to enter the lease," du Plessis told the official website of the city of Cape Town. "Shareholders were not prepared to enter the lease under circumstances that projected substantial losses." The SSOC had been managing the stadium on behalf of the city since January 2009, apart from during the World Cup when the tournaments' organizing committee were in charge. Eight World Cup matches were held at the 68,000-seat Green Point, one of five new stadiums built for the World Cup this summer. Tournament CEO Danny Jordaan promised South Africans that the new facilities would not become "white elephants" and would leave a legacy for generations to come. "To ensure a lasting legacy and the commercial viability of the stadiums, they will be used for both rugby and soccer," Jordaan said before the World Cup. "This country has also used sports stadiums for major political rallies, concerts and church events. They can, therefore, also be used for outside of sport," he added. And despite the setbacks with the future of the Cape Town stadium as well as the burden it may place on the city's taxpayers, acting executive mayor of the city Alderman Ian Neilson has assured residents that future events will take place there as planned. This includes national football team Bafana Bafana's upcoming match against the U.S. on November 17. "While the current management deal has now fallen through, we also see new opportunities and will now engage directly with the relevant sporting codes in the City on how we jointly take forward the future of the Cape Town Stadium," Neilson told the city's official website.

chatgpt: The South African city of Cape Town has taken over the running of its World Cup stadium after a company pulled out of a deal to take it over. SSG, which had agreed to lease the venue for a 30-year term, was due to start operating the stadium on 1 November. Instead, the City of Cape Town will now take charge of the $600m arena. The stadium, which was built for the 2010 World Cup, has been the subject of a number of controversies in recent years. It was reported earlier this year that it was losing millions of dollars each year, and that the City of Cape Town was struggling to find a tenant for the venue. In a statement, the City said that it had taken the decision to operate the stadium itself in order to "ensure the continued viability and sustainability" of the venue. It added that it would be working with the board of the stadium to ensure that events would continue to take place there as planned. The Mayor of Cape Town, Dan Plato, said that the city was "fully committed" to the stadium and that the decision to take it over would ensure that it remained an "iconic" venue for the city. He added that the City was "confident" that it could run the stadium profitably and that it would be a "great asset" to the city. Despite SSG's withdrawal, the City said that it remained committed to finding a private partner to help run the stadium. It said that it was already in talks with a number of companies and that it hoped to announce a new partner in the coming months. In the meantime, the City said that it would be taking steps to improve the stadium's facilities and to ensure that it remained a "world-class" venue. This would include upgrading the security systems, improving the food and beverage facilities, and enhancing the overall visitor experience. The stadium has played host to a number of high-profile events in recent years, including international soccer matches, music concerts, and other cultural events. With the City now taking charge of the venue, it is hoped that it will continue to be a focal point for entertainment in the region for many years to come.
