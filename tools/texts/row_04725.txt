chatgpt: A man from Russia identified as Alexander Shapovalov recently got himself in trouble with the law for an unusual mode of transportation. The 23-year-old chose to sit in an armchair that was being dragged behind a car on a street in the city of Voronezh, as he found it difficult to fit the old seat into the vehicle. This surprising incident caught the attention of many bystanders and drivers who were amazed to see a man sitting in the armchair while being pulled along the busy street. Some onlookers took photos or recorded the scene on their phones. However, the police had a different reaction. After receiving reports of the dangerous and reckless act, they launched an investigation into the matter.
