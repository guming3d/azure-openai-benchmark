article: (CNN) -- The top-secret federal court that oversees government surveillance on Friday reauthorized the National Security Agency's program that collects data on nearly every phone call in the United States. The three-month renewal by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the first since two conflicting court opinions last month on the legality of the program. Revealed publicly in leaks last year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the program is at the center of the surveillance debate in the United States. Critics say it violates privacy rights of Americans whose data is collected even though there isn't any suspicion that they pose a security threat. The NSA and its supporters say the bulk collection authority is crucial to uncovering potential terrorists who haven't yet come to the attention of national security officials. The telephone data program, covered under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, has been authorized 36 times over the past seven years, the nation's top intelligence official said on Friday. President Barack Obama said recently that he is contemplating making modest changes following an independent review of the initiative. One possible change would remove the electronic surveillance effort from the NSA but requiring telecommunications companies, or perhaps a new quasi-government agency, to collect the data. "The intelligence community continues to be open to modifications to this program that would provide additional privacy and civil liberty protections while still maintaining its operational benefits," Shawn Turner, spokesman for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said. A federal judge in Washington last month called the program almost "Orwellian" and said it was likely unconstitutional. Days later another federal judge in New York, in a separate challenge to the program, said it was lawful. The Justice Department on Friday filed an appeal of the Washington ruling. The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the New York suit, is appealing that decision. Split decisions will likely set the stage for legal wrangling over the course of the coming year that could ultimately result in a Supreme Court case. NSA won't say if it's 'spying' on Congress .

chatgpt: In a recent decision, the Special Court of the United States renewed the National Security Agency's (NSA) authority to collect electronic data in bulk for another few months. This comes after a period of conflicting court rulings where one court deemed the data collection to be unlawful, while another upheld the agency's authority to conduct the practice. For several years, the NSA's bulk data collection program has been at the center of controversy surrounding privacy concerns and government surveillance. The program allows the agency to collect and store electronic communications data from phone calls, emails, and internet activity of millions of people around the world.  The Special Court is responsible for overseeing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which authorizes the collection of data in national security cases. The court periodically reviews and renews the NSA's authority to continue the program. In recent years, however, there have been conflicting court rulings on the legality of the program. In 2013, a federal court ruled that the program appeared to be unlawful and violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, in a separate ruling, another court found that the program was valid and necessary for national security. Despite the conflicting rulings, the program has continued, and the Special Court has periodically renewed the NSA's authority over several years. This latest decision marks the first time since the conflicting court rulings were issued that the Special Court has renewed the NSA's authority to collect electronic data in bulk. This decision is likely to renew the debate around privacy and government surveillance, particularly in light of recent revelations about the extent of government surveillance programs. Critics argue that these programs violate individuals' right to privacy and enable government overreach, while supporters argue that they are necessary for national security and are subject to strict oversight. The renewed authority for the NSA's bulk data collection program will last for several months, after which it will be up for review again. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the program will continue to be authorized by the Special Court in the future, or if legal challenges to the program will ultimately lead to its termination.
