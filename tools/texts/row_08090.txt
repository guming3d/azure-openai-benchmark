As a species they are notorious for their scavenging nature, so it's no surprise that this fox attempted a smash and grab raid on a Golden Eagle's lunch. But the less than wily creature is outfoxed by the giant bird of prey as it digs its claws in and defends its meal. The plucky fox was clearly willing to put up a fight to make sure he had his share of the eagle's spoils - but was eventually overpowered by the enormous bird. Attack: Yves Adams stunning photo captured the moment a Golden Eagle dug its claws in to the not so wily fox that tried to steal his lunch . Scrap: The fox fights back baring its teeth at the angry eagle . Fight: The plucky fox is knocked to the ground as the tussle between the two animals continues . The dramatic face-off was captured on camera by Belgian photographer Yves Adams, as the animals fought in the snow and freezing temperatures - which plummeted to -20C - in Bulgaria. He had been laying patiently in wait to capture shots of vultures which the Bulgarian Government has recently reintroduced into the wild but instead came away with these magnificent stills. Yves said: 'I had been photographing the vultures and an eagle eating from the carrion for about an hour. 'The eagle was getting stuffed and the Ravens started to give up their harassing, when suddenly something reddish came over the ridge, behind the eagle, too blurred for me to see through my low depth of field 600mm lens. Outfoxed: The fox gets to its feet and makes a hasty retreat . Retreat: The fox scarpers with its tail between its legs . 'But what happened then was incredible - a red fox came down to the feeding station, to grab some meat, but the Golden eagle wasn't really pleased with that and chased the poor fox away! 'I could hardly hold my joy when I saw most of the shots were pin-sharp and both animals had great expressions! I was really lucky to had my complete set-up in the perfect settings. 'I had never been to Bulgaria before, but after this experience, I know I had been waiting too long to discover the beautiful country.' It is hardly a surprise the one of the world's most famous birds of prey came out on top at the end of the scrap - it is one of the most powerful predators in the avian world and has an impressive wingspan of up to 7.7ft.

chatgpt: Belgium-based photographer Yves Adams was on a mission to capture mesmerizing pictures of vultures reintroduced by the Bulgarian government in the Rhodope Mountains in southern Bulgaria. Adams, known for his exceptional wildlife photography skills, was braving the freezing temperatures of -20C when he stumbled upon a rare sight. Instead, his camera captured an intense tussle between a golden eagle and a fox over their lunch. The stunning pictures provide a glimpse into the wildlife drama taking place in the remote mountains. The pictures show the golden eagle cruising around the snow-covered mountains before it spots a fox scavenging for food. The eagle, determined to catch the fox off guard, swoops down and launches a furious attack. It pins down the fox and begins attacking it with its sharp talons. The fox, however, is no easy prey. Its survival instincts kick in, and it fights back fiercely, standing on its hind legs to face the enemy. The golden eagle, realizing it's facing a formidable opponent, continues its assault, flapping its wings and clawing at the fox with all its might. The struggle is intense, with both adversaries locked in a deadly dance. Their eyes meet, each daring the other to give up first. With scenes straight out of a wildlife documentary, the pictures captured by Adams provide an insight into the brutal reality of a wild animal's life. The photographs have since gone viral, with many people admiring Adams' talent for capturing nature's most awe-inspiring moments. The images have also opened a window into the delicate balance of nature that exists in harsh environments like the Rhodope Mountains, where survival is a daily struggle for every creature. Adams, who has been photographing wildlife for over 20 years, said he never expected to witness such a scene. The experience has given him a new appreciation of the natural world and how animals survive in extreme conditions. The golden eagle and the fox, two of Bulgaria's most iconic animals, have come to represent the country's rich eco-tourism potential. The Bulgarian government has invested heavily in protecting and preserving the habitats of these and other endangered species, hoping to attract more tourists to the region. For Adams, the opportunity to capture such incredible images is just the beginning of his mission to highlight the beauty and fragility of nature. His hope is that these photographs will inspire more people to appreciate and preserve the natural world.
