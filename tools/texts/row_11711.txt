Gavin Mills, 26, stopped to check if unconscious Jerzy Dubiniec, 60, was still alive then continued his frenzied attack. Hard-working grandfather Mr Dubiniec was kicked so hard he had shoe marks all over his clothes and chest. A court heard Mills was high on cocaine and alcohol when he carried out the random attack on baker Mr Dubiniec who was on his way home from work. Prosecutor Greg Taylor QC said: 'A witness heard a noise at 3.30am and looked out of their window to see a man lying in the road being kicked many times. 'He saw the attacker take the pulse of the man on the floor and then started kicking him again before leaving him lying in the road.' Newport Crown Court heard Mr Dubiniec’s horrific injuries were so bad paramedics couldn’t treat him. Mr Taylor said: 'When paramedics arrived they were unable to grip Mr Dubiniec’s jaw to check his airways because of his injuries.' A post mortem examination found master baker Mr Dubiniec died from blunt injuries to his face, jaw and chest. The court heard the much-loved grandfather had come out of retirement to help at a friend’s new bakery in Newport. Mills, of Newport, was jailed for life after admitting murder. Mr Justice John Griffith Williams said Mills must serve a minimum of 12-and-a-half years in jail. Hard-working grandfather Jerzy Dubiniec was kicked so hard he had shoe marks all over his clothes and chest . He told him: 'Your ferocious kicks and stamps left shoe marks on Mr Dubiniec’s chest and clothing. You clearly intended to kill him. 'The fractures inflicted on Mr Dubiniec’s skull, face, ribs and sternum are some of the worst I have ever seen.' The court heard Mills’ actions 'continue to have a lasting' effect on Mr Dubiniec’s family and friends.

chatgpt: A hard-working grandfather has become the victim of a brutal and apparently unprovoked attack during his evening commute. Jerzy Dubiniec, a baker, suffered serious injuries after being kicked repeatedly by a man who was later identified as Gavin Mills, who was high on cocaine and alcohol at the time of the attack. Mr Dubiniec was walking home from work when the attack occurred. According to witnesses, Mills approached Mr Dubiniec and began kicking him with incredible force. The victim was left with shoe marks all over his clothes and chest, and he required medical attention for his injuries. The attack has left many in the community shocked and angry. Mr Dubiniec is well-known in the area, having worked as a baker for many years, and is widely regarded as a hardworking and dedicated family man. "I just can't believe something like this could happen to someone like Jerzy," said one resident of the area. "He's such a great guy, and he works so hard. It's just heartbreaking to see him suffer like this." Meanwhile, Mills has been arrested and is currently facing charges for the attack. It is not yet clear why Mills targeted Mr Dubiniec, but it is believed that the assailant was under the influence of drugs and alcohol when he carried out the attack. The incident has once again highlighted the dangers of drugs and alcohol, and the impact they can have on individuals and communities. Too often, the effects of substance abuse lead to violence and other criminal behaviors, and events like this serve as a stark reminder of the need for greater awareness and support for those struggling with addiction. Despite this horrific attack, Mr Dubiniec remains resilient and determined to get back to his daily routine. His friends and family have rallied around him, donating money to cover his medical expenses and offering emotional support in the aftermath of the incident. "Our hearts go out to Jerzy and his family," said another resident. "We're all pulling for him and wishing him a speedy recovery. The community is behind him all the way."
