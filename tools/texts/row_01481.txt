article: Caught: Retired school principal and 911 dispatcher Dennis Blake, 64, of Delray Beach, went to a teen boy's Lantana home for sex after they met online, federal prosecutors say . A retired school principal from Indiana is facing federal sex and child porn charges after he was arrested in Boynton Beach, Florida for soliciting sex from an officer posing as a 15-year-old boy. Dennis Blake, 64, of Delray Beach was arrested after he drove from Indiana to South Florida to have sex with what he thought was a teenage boy. The officer posing as the teen had been exchanging messages with Blake since October and arranged to meet him in January at the Boynton Beach Mall. The person he was meeting was an undercover city police officer who posed as a minor on the online Grindr service. During their messaging, Blake sent the officer sexually explicit pictures of himself, police said. Blake went to the boy's Lantana home within two hours of starting to chat online. When investigators later conducted a detailed forensic search of his cell phone, they found evidence Blake had also gone to meet a real teen whom he thought was 16. He is charged with soliciting a child for unlawful sexual conduct, traveling to meet a minor to commit an unlawful sex act and transmission of harmful material to a minor. Blake moved to Delray Beach in August after retiring from his jobs in southern Indiana. His online perversion began when he began using the online service Growlr, and they discussed meeting for sex. Blake asked for, and received, sexually explicit photos of the boy. The boy first told Blake that he was 18, then said he was 16 in online messages. The former school head was well aware he was playing with fire. Undercover: Blake showed up to meet what he thought was a 15-year-old boy at a Boynton Beach Mall restaurant. The person he was meeting was an undercover city police officer who posed as a minor on Grindr . In one online message 'Blake responded, 'I can't come to your house since you're underage. But you can come here,' 'Too much danger in getting caught. And I can't risk that,'' Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Schiller wrote in court records. The boy sent Blake his home address and Blake sent the boy a photo of his penis. Soon after the encounter, Blake began communicating with what he thought was another underage teen, only this time it was a police officer on the other end of his texts. Blake pleaded not guilty to four federal charges Wednesday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale. He is charged with two counts of enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity and one count each of receiving and possession child pornography. Three of the charges involve the real teen; one enticement charge involves the undercover officer. The most serious charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years to life in federal prison.

chatgpt: A former school principal from Indiana has been arrested in Florida for allegedly soliciting sex from a teenager. Dennis Blake, 64, was caught after an undercover police officer posed as a teenager online. The authorities said that Blake engaged in suggestive conversations with the officer, who he believed was a 14-year-old girl. According to the police report, Blake asked the teenager for pictures and suggested that they meet in person for sexual activity. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that Blake had previously attempted to have sex with a real teenager. The authorities did not provide details about this incident, but they did confirm that it appears to have taken place while Blake was still working as a school administrator. Blake has been charged with one count of solicitation of a minor and one count of travel to meet a minor for sex. He is currently being held on a $100,000 bond. The news of Blake's arrest has shocked many in the community, especially those who knew him professionally. He had served as a principal at an Indiana high school for more than a decade before retiring. The school district released a statement expressing their shock and sadness over the allegations against Blake. "We are working closely with law enforcement to provide any assistance they may need as they investigate this matter," the statement read. It is not clear at this time if Blake had any prior criminal history related to sexual misconduct. However, the authorities said that they are investigating the matter further to determine if there are any additional victims. The incident has once again highlighted the dangers of online predators and the importance of parents monitoring their children's online activity. In a statement, the Polk County Sheriff's Office urged parents to talk to their children about the risks of online communication and to monitor their devices and social media accounts closely. "We cannot stress enough the importance of parents and guardians taking an active role in their children's online lives," the statement read. "We must all work together to keep our children safe from these predators." Blake's case is still ongoing, and it is not clear if he has retained legal counsel. If convicted, he could face significant prison time and additional penalties. The allegations against Blake are shocking and disturbing, and they serve as a reminder of the importance of ongoing vigilance in protecting children from the dangers of online predators. Parents and educators alike must work together to ensure that children are safe and protected, both in person and online.
