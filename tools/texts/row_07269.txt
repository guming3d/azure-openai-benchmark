article: A self-styled lingerie model has been hit with an Asbo banning her from speaking to her neighbours for five years after a campaign of 999 calls and harassment. Tanya Pascolini, 42, was ordered not to talk to anyone who lives on her street in the village of Thames Ditton, Surrey, or face jail for breaching the order. Ms Pascolini was also told not knock on her neighbours' doors and windows or use 'abusive or threatening language and behaviour' outside her home. One neighbour said Tanya Pascolini, 42, as 'full-on' and always 'shouting the odds' at her Surrey neighbours . The Surrey woman, who claims on her Facebook page to work for lingerie chain Ann Summers, was also told to keep her dogs on a lead when outside. One local, who asked not to be named, said today: 'Tanya has lived here a few years now and is known for being a bit, how should I put it, full-on. 'I don't think she means anything bad, but she's always causing problems knocking on doors and shouting the odds at her neighbours.' She added: 'It is going to be nigh on impossible for her not to breach the Asbo unless she walks about with gaffer tape over her mouth. 'How can you go five years without speaking to any of your neighbours? It's impossible.' The Asbo was issued on October 30 and will run until the same date in October 2019. Ms Pascolini faces being arrested and jailed if she breaches any terms of the order. Tanya Pascolini claims on her Facebook page she works for the lingerie chain Ann Summers . Last year, a total of 1,349 ASBOs were issued - a 2% increase from the 1,329 the year before. The orders can be given out for any number of nuisances or offences from falling over while drunk and for being noisy neighbours. Last week, tenants who terrorise their neighbours by making them feel intimidated or causing lots of noise with endless parties were told they could be evicted in two weeks under a new fast-track process for landlords. New powers are being introduced by the Government which mean private and social landlords will be able to evict nightmare tenants more quickly, rather than leaving them in properties for months or even years while lengthy court proceedings take place. The fast-track process will work by allowing previous convictions for serious anti-social behaviour. This will include those who have taken part in riot-related offences, to trigger eviction proceedings. The powers are contained in the Anti Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, which gives landlords five ways in which they can apply to evict their tenants.
