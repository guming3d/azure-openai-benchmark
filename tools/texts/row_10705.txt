Now with the England squad in the United States, the Parkhead club have slapped a £10million price tag on the head of the former Newcastle keeper. But the signing of former Hearts keeper Gordon would heighten expectations that Forster will return to the English Premiership before the transfer deadline on August 31. Claiming he is fitter than ever after two years on the sidelines, the man who cost Sunderland keeper £9million said earlier this week: ‘I’ve had two or three offers already which have been quite interesting – but it’s just about picking the right one and then I can move on from there. Back in the mix? Gordon hopes to become Scotland's first-choice goalkeeper once more . ‘You know yourself when you’re ready and you’re able to play and I feel just as good now, if not better, than I have ever done in my career. ‘Fitness-wise I’m right there. It’s just a case of getting the matches and proving it to everyone else as well.’ Gordon spent a lengthy spell last season training with Rangers at Murray Park and had an offer from first club Hearts before Celtic entered the fray.
