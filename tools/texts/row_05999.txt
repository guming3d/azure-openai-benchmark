According to recent reports, Rafie was found dead in her home on October 14th, 2020, and her death was caused by multiple stab wounds. Polices and investigators have been able to find out from her husband's workmates that everything seemed normal on the job, and he was quite happy before the incident.  However, the case has now taken a dark turn as it has emerged that both Rafie's mother and husband also died on that fateful day.
