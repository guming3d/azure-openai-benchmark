Spotted at the age of 57 by a professional photographer who spied her posing for photos with her grandchildren, Sarah Wiley had never considered becoming a fashion model before then. Snapped up by London-based agency Close Models, Wiley, now 65, has since appeared regularly as a glamorous clothes horse for This Morning, as well as on Gok Wan's How To Look Good Naked and for retailer John Lewis. But she's not alone. Wiley, who appeared in Stella magazine's latest beauty shoot for the Telegraph about using make-up on aging skin, says she's one of a 'whole gang' of older women being papped by fashion editors and designers. Sarah Wiley, 65, was only scouted as a model when she was spotted by a professional photographer at the age of 57 . Speaking to Rena Niamh Smith for Stella, the former ballerina explained when she got 'spotted' she agreed to do a simple lifestyle shoot, just for fun, with the photographer . Other members of the group include veteran model Carmen Dell'Orefice, 82, 85-year-old Daphne Selfe, and Jenni Rhodes, 81. Speaking to Rena Niamh Smith for Stella, the former ballerina explained when she got 'spotted' she agreed to do a simple lifestyle shoot, just for fun, with the photographer. She initially thought the idea was a wind-up, only to be told at the end that she was quite the natural in front of the camera. Saddened that her 10-year-old granddaughter is given the impression by magazines that in order to be successful a woman must be thin, Wiley wishes to challenge traditional idea of 'beauty'. She says: 'It's the interest in someone's face . that makes them arresting. Being alive, being interested in . the world around you.'

chatgpt: At the age of 57, former ballerina Daphne Selfe was scouted by a professional photographer who spotted a snapshot of her with her grandchildren. Signed to the London-based agency Close models, Selfe has since gone on to become a well-known figure in the modelling world. Despite her age, Selfe has worked on high-profile shows such as This Morning and Gok Wan's How To Look Good Naked. Her latest achievement is appearing in Stella magazine's latest beauty shoot in the Telegraph. Selfe credits modelling with giving her newfound confidence in her own skin. Speaking to the Telegraph, she said that modelling has made her feel more comfortable with herself and encouraged her to embrace her natural beauty.  But Selfe's journey into modelling was never planned. Instead, it was a chance photograph of her with her grandchildren that caught the attention of a professional photographer. After noticing her natural grace and poise, the photographer suggested she pursue a career in modelling. Selfe initially didn't believe it was possible, but after being signed to Close models, she quickly proved herself as a talented and versatile model. She has since become an ambassador for natural beauty, encouraging others to embrace their age and imperfections. Modelling is often associated with youth and beauty, but Selfe is using her platform to challenge this stereotype. By embracing her age and natural beauty, she is empowering women of all ages to feel confident and beautiful in their own skin. As she continues to defy age stereotypes and challenge the traditional notions of beauty, Selfe proves that age is just a number. With her incredible talent, grace, and determination, she is a true inspiration to women everywhere.
