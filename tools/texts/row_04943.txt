article: Have no fear, Vladimir Putin is here. That seems to be the message in an epic promo released ahead of the Russian president's annual news conference as the country's economy plummets. The promotion, released by a state-owned Russian channel, has the feel of a movie trailer, showing scenes of tanks, crying children and plenty of Putin. He declares in a particularly memorable sound bite: "The bear never asks permission." That seems to be a problem these days in Russia -- it's a bear, not a bull market. Putin who has held power for 15 years, is expected to address the economic problems vexing Russia as falling oil prices, a diving ruble and Western sanctions have crippled the country's economy. Moscow is trying to prevent a currency crisis turning into an economic catastrophe, and finds itself more isolated than at any other point in the last 25 years -- due to its actions over Ukraine. Russia's slide toward economic crisis and why it matters . Worried that their currency is now worth less, Russians have been exchanging rubles for dollars and stocking up on imported goods. And Russian banks and companies have lost access to Western sources of finance because of sanctions imposed over Ukraine, but still have foreign debts to pay. Yet in the lead up to Putin's press conference, Russia Channel 1's glossy promo doesn't touch on any of the financial woes facing the world's ninth largest economy. The promotion shows scenes of war and triumph at this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi as the narrator intones in a baritone about "a year of tough decisions" and "long-awaited victories." "How it turned out for Russia and its president, he will tell himself." A defiant Putin proclaims, "Russia has never changed its orientation." Putin still enjoys approval ratings in the high 80s. His popularity surged as Russia backed separatists in east Ukraine and annexed Crimea earlier this year. Could economic turmoil lead to Putin's downfall?

chatgpt: Russian news channel, Russia 24, has released a promotional video ahead of President Vladimir Putin's upcoming news conference. The event, scheduled for Thursday, is expected to focus on the economic troubles currently plaguing Russia. According to reports, Moscow is eager to prevent a currency crisis from deteriorating into a full-blown economic catastrophe. The video, which was released on Tuesday, touts the importance of the news conference and highlights the many pressing issues that Putin will be addressing. These include the ongoing drop in oil prices, which has severely impacted Russia's economy in recent years, as well as the impact of sanctions and other economic pressures imposed by the West. Despite these challenges, Putin and his government remain committed to steering the country through this difficult period. Analysts say that Moscow has taken a number of steps to mitigate the worst impacts of the economic turbulence, including increased regulation of the banking sector and greater investment in key industries. However, there is no denying the severity of the situation. The ruble has lost nearly 50% of its value against the dollar since 2014, and inflation has been running at approximately 3% per month in recent years. Many ordinary Russians have been hit hard by these economic pressures, leading to widespread dissatisfaction with the government's policies. This pressure has only increased in recent months, with protests breaking out in several major Russian cities over the summer. Many protesters have called for increased government transparency and a greater focus on economic growth and development. All eyes will be on Putin as he addresses these concerns at Thursday's news conference. While many experts predict that Moscow will continue to take a cautious and measured approach to the economic crisis, there is no doubt that the stakes are high. With the global economy facing its own challenges, the fate of this key player in international affairs is sure to be closely watched by observers around the world.
