article: CNN's Larry King knew George Carlin for 50 years.  He spoke to CNN.com about his relationship with the comedian and will remember Carlin on tonight's Larry King Live, 9 ET. Larry King interviews George Carlin on June 7, 2001.  King knew Carlin for 50 years. CNN: When did you first meet George Carlin? Larry King: In 1958, I introduced him at a big DJ convention in Miami. He was a straight comic then, all his bits dealt with radio, things like the hippy-dippy weatherman. From there, we became friendly, and we occasionally went to dinner in New York. CNN: When did you last see him? Larry King: A couple of months ago, I saw him at the Regency Hotel in New York. I was checking in, he was checking out. We talked a little bit. He had remarried -- his first wife had died -- and he was very happy. My heart doctor in Los Angeles had treated George in the past, and had told me that he had terrible heart problems. CNN: Where does he rank as a comedian? Larry King: He was one of the brightest comedians in my lifetime. Whether you agreed or disagreed with him, it was always well thought out. He wrote out all his material by hand, and then memorized it. Everything he said was totally his own, and he'd do a new act every year, which is very hard to do.

Also, his greatest comic influence was Lenny Bruce. Carlin used to do mother-in-law jokes, disc-jockey jokes. But Bruce influenced him to do edgier, more topical material. He also influenced how Carlin moved around on stage. CNN: What was the impact of the "seven dirty words?" Larry King: It's one of the classic comedy bits of all time. It was great conception and a great idea. It pointed up the hypocrisy of society. People take words too seriously. Violence is a lot worse than words. All those words, while not used on air, are used in society. George once said, if a word shocks you, you must have heard it somewhere else. CNN: Where does he rank as a comedian? Larry King: He ranks very high as a social monologist, and he commented on social things. He was also a pretty good actor. CNN: How did other comedians view him? Larry King: I never heard a bad word about him in the comedy world. Some religious people didn't like him. He will really be missed. If you want to use the word "one of a kind," he was one of a kind.

chatgpt: Legendary broadcaster Larry King recently revealed details of his first meeting with late comedian George Carlin over six decades ago, in 1958. According to King, the two met at a DJ convention where King was working at the time. Despite Carlin's later reputation for pushing boundaries and questioning authority, King remembers him as a "kind, gentle man" offstage. In an interview with The New Yorker, King reflected on the comedian's impact on the world of comedy and beyond. When asked about Carlin's biggest influence, King was quick to cite Lenny Bruce, another late comedian known for his subversive and often controversial material. "Lenny Bruce was the king of the social commentary comedians, and George saw that," King reflected. "George definitely borrowed from Lenny, but he also made it his own. He had this uncanny ability to take a current event or an issue and twist it in a way that made you think, 'Wow, I never thought of it that way before.'" Carlin's infamously acerbic style, which often skewered politicians, celebrities, and societal norms, was a major influence on a generation of comedians who followed in his footsteps. From Louis C.K. to Dave Chappelle, Carlin's impact can be seen in the work of countless contemporary comics. But King believes that Carlin's greatest legacy is his ability to provoke thought and inspire reflection. "George wasn't just trying to be funny, he was trying to make people think," he said. "He used his comedy as a way to shine a light on the absurdities of life, the things that we often take for granted. And in doing so, he made us all a little bit smarter, a little bit more aware." Despite his later success as a comedian, Carlin never forgot his roots in radio, King said. In fact, the two continued to cross paths over the years, appearing on each other's shows and at various events. But even as his fame grew, Carlin never lost his sense of humor or his sharp wit. "He was always himself, no matter where he was or who he was with," King recalled. "And people loved him for it. He was the real deal, a true original." The two legends of broadcasting and comedy may have come from different worlds, but they shared a deep respect for each other's work. And as King remembers him, Carlin's impact still reverberates today, inspiring new generations of comedians and thinkers alike.
