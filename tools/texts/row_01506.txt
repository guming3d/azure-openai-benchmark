chatgpt: A father in Maryland has been charged with reckless endangerment and child endangerment after leaving his two-year-old daughter locked in a car on a hot summer day. Melvin Marroquin, 30, left his toddler alone in the vehicle for 25 minutes while he went shopping at a local store, authorities said. A concerned passerby called 911 and officers had to break a car window to rescue the child. When they arrived, they found the little girl "beet red" and dripping with sweat. She was too weak to speak. According to the police report, the temperature inside the car had reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit. It's unclear why Marroquin would leave his daughter in such dangerous conditions, but authorities have suggested he may have been oblivious to the potential danger. "A person walking by heard the child crying and called 911," said Capt. Steven Reynolds of the local police department. "The child was trapped inside the car, which was locked. By the time officers arrived, it was clear that the toddler was in distress." The incident happened on Thursday afternoon and Marroquin was arrested later that evening. He returned to the car with shopping bags 10 minutes after his daughter was rescued. When questioned by officers, he admitted to leaving the child in the car for 25 minutes while he shopped. "He showed no concern or remorse for the child," Capt. Reynolds said. "He was surprised that we had to break the window to get her out." The toddler was taken to a local hospital for treatment and released to her mother. She suffered no serious injuries but was understandably traumatized by the incident. It's unclear if Marroquin will face any additional charges or if he has hired a lawyer. As temperatures continue to soar during the summer months, parents are being reminded to never leave their children in hot cars. According to KidsAndCars.org, 39 children died in hot cars in the United States last year alone. It's a tragic and preventable problem that can happen to anyone, regardless of income or education level. As for Marroquin, he will have to answer for his actions in court. His daughter was lucky to survive the incident, but she could have easily suffered irreversible damage or death. It's a stark reminder that when it comes to children's safety, there is no room for complacency or ignorance.
