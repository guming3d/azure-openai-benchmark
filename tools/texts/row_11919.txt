article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:57 PM on 21st December 2011 . Research In Motion has turned down takeover overtures from Amazon and other potential buyers because the BlackBerry maker prefers to fix its problems on its own, according to sources. Amazon hired an investment bank this summer to review a potential merger with RIM, but it did not make a formal offer, said one of the sources. It is not clear whether informal discussions between Amazon and RIM ever led to specific price talk, or who else had approached RIM about a takeover. Talks: Amazon considered buying RIM, but made no formal offer, say industry insiders . RIM's board wants co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie to focus on trying to turn around the business through the launch of new phones, better use of assets such as BlackBerry Messaging and restructuring, two sources said. They did not want to be identified as the discussions are private. RIM and Amazon declined to comment. At the moment Blackberry is trying to make sure that delays to its new touchscreen phones donâ€™t harm the business. Trouble ahead? Blackberry's new phone (not shown) has been delayed until late 2012, which analysts say could damage profits . The new devices are designed to update the smartphone brand for consumers used to iPhones and other touch handsets such as Android, but have been delayed until the end of next year. It's a delay that some analysts predict could be disastrous for the company. The touchscreen BB10 phones were crucial to updating the brand. The co-CEOs insisted that BlackBerry can hold out - but admitted that BlackBerry sales were falling month by month, and that net income had fallen 71 per cent. Earlier this year, BlackBerry also ran into trademark difficulties for the new operating system - BBX - and renamed the phones BB10 to avoid a dispute. No official name or spec for any of the handsets has yet been revealed. Shots of an angular handset supposedly known as BlackBerry London leaked earlier this month. The phones will run an operating system that's mid-way between the simple, old-style operating system of current BlackBerries, and the more iPad-esque OS of the recent BlackBerry PlayBook. PlayBook was another disaster for the company, with the seven-inch tablet sold at a damaging loss after customers failed to take an interest. PlayBook required a BlackBerry phone 'tethered' to it for email to work - unlike any other tablet on the market. Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies & Co in New York, said the company needs to get its new phones out fast. Mike Lazaridis, one of the company's co-CEOs, said the BlackBerry 10 phones will need a new chipset that will not be available until mid-2012, so the company expects the new phones to ship late in the year. 'We've experienced a delay,' he said. Analysts say RIM's future depends on the new software.

chatgpt: Canadian telecommunications company, Blackberry has experienced a significant drop in income by 71 per cent. This drop in income is directly linked to the delayed launch of the much-anticipated 'BB10' smartphones, which will now not be released until late 2012. The company had high hopes for the new device, which is intended to compete with industry leaders such as Apple and Samsung. However, due to complications in the production process, the launch has been pushed back. These delays have resulted in a significant drop in the company's earnings. The expected launch of the BB10 had boosted Blackberry's shares, and analysts were predicting a rise in the company's earnings. However, the manufacturing delays have now impacted the company's stock prices and overall profitability. The delay of the BB10 smartphone has also disappointed stakeholders, who were expecting the company to make a comeback in the highly competitive smartphone market. Blackberry's struggles have also been compounded by the increased competition from industry giants such as Apple and Samsung. The launch of Apple's iPhone 5 and Samsung's Galaxy S III have further contributed to Blackberry's reduced market share. In response to these challenges and to revamp the company's portfolio, Blackberry has invested in a new operating system known as QNX. The QNX operating system is expected to provide Blackberry with a new platform for its smartphones and a chance to compete in the fast-growing app market. However, given the current delays and decreased revenue, it remains to be seen how successful the company's transition to QNX will be. The BB10's delayed launch also means that Blackberry risks losing its already shrinking market share. Many of its customers have already migrated to competitors who offer more advanced smartphones with new features and functionality. Losing market share would be a significant blow for the company, which has long been synonymous with quality and reliability. The company's CEO, Thorsten Heins, has publicly stated that Blackberry would take the necessary steps to overcome the current struggles. The company has recently undergone significant restructuring, including a focus on reducing expenses and cutting jobs. However, these efforts may not be sufficient to enable Blackberry to recover from its current situation. Meanwhile, industry analysts are suggesting that Blackberry should focus on its strengths, namely its security features and its popularity among government and corporate customers. The company has a long history of providing secure mobile devices, which could prove to be a valuable advantage in a market where privacy and data security are of growing concern. While the wait for the BB10 continues, Blackberry's future remains uncertain. It's clear that the company is facing significant challenges in a highly competitive market. However, despite its current struggles, Blackberry still has a loyal customer base and a reputation for quality and security. How the company will survive in the long term remains to be seen, but for now, all eyes remain on the delayed launch of the BB10 smartphone.
