Zoe Saldana, best known for her roles in Guardians of the Galaxy and Avatar, has also been making waves in the entertainment industry. In addition to her film work, Saldana has been highly praised for her work in the television series, Rosemary's Baby, and for her role as Gamora in the highly successful Marvel franchise. Saldana has also been a vocal advocate for social justice issues, using her platform to raise awareness of important causes and to encourage positive change. Solange Knowles, the younger sister of global music icon Beyoncé, has carved out her own successful career in the music industry. Known for her soulful, politically charged music, Knowles has been lauded for her unique sound and her commitment to using her voice to speak out against social injustice.
