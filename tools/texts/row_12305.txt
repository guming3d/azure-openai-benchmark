article: (CNN) -- Alvaro Quiros triumphed at the Qatar Masters on Sunday when the Spaniard finished three shots clear of former champion Henrik Stenson and Louis Oosthuizen. Spaniard Quiros clinched his third European Tour title and now looks set for a first appearance at the Masters. The 26-year-old survived a late scare to card a final-round of three-under-par 69 and finish at 19-under 269 -- a showing that sends him into the world top 30 and opens the door for his Masters debut at Augusta in April. Swede Stenson's three-putt bogey at the last for a 68 allowed South African overnight leader Oosthuizen to share second with the 2006 champion after a final round of 71. Stenson, last year's runner-up to Adam Scott, snatched the lead at 16 under with an eagle at the 10th, but Quiros and Oosthuizen -- playing a group behind -- responded with birdies of their own to leave all three tied through 11. The momentum swung Quiros' way as he birdied the 12th and Oosthuizen dropped a shot to fall two off the pace before the Spaniard extended his lead as he converted from eight feet a hole later. Stenson put pressure on with birdie of his own at 15 to move within one at 17 under before Quiros wobbled as he sent his three-wood approach from the rough into the water. Quiros eventually holed from 15-foot putt for bogey, but then birdied 16 and 17 to take a two-stroke lead down the last and claim a third European Tour title. Oosthuizen had birdied the last to record a second successive runner-up finish, which sees him move up to fifth on the season money list -- a place ahead of Stenson. Ireland's Damien McGrane carded a bogey-free 67 for fourth at 13 under, while Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez's three birdies earned him a 69 and a share of fifth with Dutchman Maarten Lafeber (72). World number two Sergio Garcia (70) had a share of seventh place at 11 under.

chatgpt: Alvaro Quiros put in a sensational display to win the 2018 Qatar Masters by three strokes at the Doha Golf Club on Sunday, February 25th. The Spanish golfer held his nerves throughout his final round to post a score of 19-under par, and secure his seventh European Tour victory.  Quiros was in fine form throughout the tournament, remaining in contention for the title from the very start. However, it was his final round effort which pushed him up the leaderboard and finally saw him emerge as the worthy champion. He did not drop a single shot in his last 18 holes, finishing with a birdie on the 18th hole which impressed everyone present.  Former champion Henrik Stenson and Louis Oosthuizen shared the second spot on the leaderboard, having finished three strokes behind Quiros. Stenson, who won this title in 2006, was leading the field after three rounds. However, he was unable to match Quiros’ immense form in the final round and eventually had to settle for a shared second position.  In addition to winning the tournament, Quiros has also earned a place in golf’s prestigious Masters competition. By climbing into the world’s top 30, Quiros has secured his debut appearance at the tournament, an achievement in itself for the Spaniard. He has worked hard on his game in recent months, and it seems that his efforts are finally paying off.  "I'm very happy. It's been a long way from when I won the last time. I've been through some very low moments but I'm pleased to say I've kept my passion for the game," said Quiros after his victory at the Qatar Masters. Quiros is enjoying a rich vein of form, having finished in the top five in three of his last four starts on the European Tour. His strong performances have led him to being considered as one of the most talented and exciting golfers in world golf.  The Qatar Masters has been a happy hunting ground for Quiros over the years. He made his European Tour debut in the same tournament in 2004 where he finished tied 28th. He then won the title in 2009, before finishing as a runner-up in 2015.  All in all, it has been an exceptional week for Quiros who proved his true class and determination by winning the Qatar Masters. This win is sure to boost his confidence and could prove to be a springboard for even greater achievements in the future.
