Pakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf was today charged with murder over the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007. The move completes the downfall of the man who once dominated his country but was driven out of office and exiled in disgrace. The decision by a court in Rawalpindi marks the first time any former army chief has been charged with a crime in Pakistan. Charge: Pervez Musharraf, left, is accused of murder over the death of Benazir Bhutto, right, at a rally in 2007 . Musharraf has been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation for murder. The former army commando who took power in a coup in 1999 appeared in person at the hearing and pleaded not guilty to all charges. The next hearing will take place on August 27, when the first evidence will be presented. Ms Bhutto was killed in December 2007 during a gun and bomb attack at a political rally in Rawalpindi. Prosecutors claim that Musharraf, who was then president, failed to protect her properly. Trial: Musharraf is pictured being driven away from today's hearing in Rawalpindi under tight security . Musharraf, 70, left Pakistan in 2008 after being forced to resign from office, but returned to the country in March and vowed to contest this year's elections. However, the former leader enjoys little popular support, and has been faced with a host of legal problems dating back to his time in power. He has been confined to his house on the outskirts of Islamabad, and was brought to court today surrounded by tight security. In addition to the Bhutto case, Musharraf is involved in a case related to the detention of judges and the death of a separatist leader. He also faces threats from the Pakistani Taliban, which tried to assassinate him twice while he was in office and vowed to try again if he returned.

chatgpt: Pervez Musharraf, former army chief and former president of Pakistan, has pleaded not guilty to charges at a court in Rawalpindi. The case is the first time a former army chief has been charged with a crime in Pakistan. Musharraf appeared in court on Tuesday, where he faced charges of high treason for his suspension of the constitution and imposition of emergency rule in 2007. The former president, who is 76 years old, was brought into the court on a stretcher due to his poor health. Musharraf has been in self-imposed exile in Dubai since 2016, and his return to Pakistan has been met with controversy. The charges against Musharraf were filed in 2013, but the former president failed to appear in court. He was declared a fugitive and his property was seized by the government. However, in March 2019, Musharraf expressed his willingness to return to Pakistan to face the charges against him. The case has been highly controversial, with many people in Pakistan viewing the charges against Musharraf as politically motivated. Supporters of Musharraf argue that his actions were necessary to prevent a crisis in the country, while critics of Musharraf allege that the former president’s actions were an unconstitutional power grab. The trial is expected to be a lengthy process, with witnesses expected to testify about the events leading up to the imposition of emergency rule in 2007. If convicted, Musharraf could face the death penalty. The case is significant in Pakistan, as it marks the first time a former army chief has been charged with a crime. The Pakistani military has played a powerful role in the country’s politics, and many former army chiefs have gone on to hold top government positions. The trial of Pervez Musharraf is likely to be closely watched in Pakistan and around the world, as it will determine the fate of one of the country’s most controversial political figures.
