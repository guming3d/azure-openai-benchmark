article: (CNN) -- Leonardo Damiao grabbed his first international goal as Brazil beat 10-man Ghana 1-0 in a friendly held in London. Despite its billing, the game was anything but friendly as referee Mike Dean sent off Daniel Opare and produced eight cards in the match. The game was settled just before half time as Damiao latched onto Fernandinho's through ball to fire a shot into the corner of the net from a narrow angle. Victory for the Selecao ensured some breathing space for coach Mario Menezes who has been heavily criticized for Brazil's poor showing in the recent Copa America. In front of a lively crowd at English Premier League side Fulham's Craven Cottage ground in west London, it was Ghana who started the brighter of the two teams. But after Jonathan Mensah headed over from a corner, Brazil began to take control of the game and tempers began to flare. The first booking, for substitute Elias, came on 11 minutes and soon after Opare also saw a yellow card for a crunching tackle on Brazil striker Neymar. Opare was dismissed for a second booking just after the half hour mark after he was adjudged to have tripped Lucio and Brazil assumed total control of the game. Damiao thought he had scored after he finished off Neymar's pass but he was flagged for offside. But in the last minute of the first half he got his first goal for his country as he finished smartly from Fernandinho's expertly weighted pass. The striker, who plays for Internacional, would have had a second had he been able to tuck home Hulk's cross into a gaping net but the ball flew past his outstretched leg. Ronaldinho, formerly of Barcelona and AC Milan, drew a good save from Ghana keeper Adam Kwarasey, as did Alexandre Pato but the game ended being settled by Damiao's goal.
