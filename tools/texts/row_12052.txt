article: (CNN) -- Iraqi security forces on Thursday thwarted an attack by an al Qaeda splinter group on a military base in central Iraq, killing 40 gunmen, Iraq's Interior Ministry said. One Iraqi army officer was killed in the attack by members of the group calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, according to the ministry. The attack happened at a base in Yusufiya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the country's capital, Baghdad. Also Thursday, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in northern Iraq, killing at least four people and injuring 13 others, police officials in Tikrit and Kirkuk said. The restaurant was in Tuz Khurmatou, about 200 kilometers north of Baghdad. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed. In March alone, terrorist attacks and other violence killed 592 people and injured 1,234 others in Iraq, excluding Anbar province, according to the United Nations . The United Nations in March kept separate, civilian-only figures for Anbar, which has seen intense fighting between Sunni extremists and Iraqi security forces since the beginning of this year. More than 480 civilians, including 133 civilian police officers, were killed, and 1,104 civilians were injured last month in Anbar, the United Nations said. In February, more than 700 people were killed and nearly 1,400 others were wounded in Iraq, according to the United Nations.

chatgpt: A military base south of Baghdad was attacked by an Al Qaeda splinter group resulting in the death of one Iraqi army officer and 40 attackers, according to Iraq's Interior Ministry. The attack on the military base occurred in the midst of continuing political and sectarian violence that has plagued Iraq for months. The Al Qaeda splinter group, which calls itself the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), has been responsible for numerous attacks across Iraq. The group aims to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, in the region by force. The group has targeted both Iraqi security forces and civilians, using suicide bombings and other violent methods. The attack on the military base is another instance of the ongoing violence that has plagued Iraq. The country faces numerous internal challenges, including political and sectarian divisions, weak institutions, and a struggling economy. Since the U.S. withdrawal in 2011, Iraq has struggled to maintain stability and security. The government has faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with many accusing it of being unable to address the root causes of the violence. The attack on the military base also highlights the continued vulnerability of Iraqi security forces. Despite their efforts to combat the rising levels of violence, the Iraqi security forces have been unable to effectively contain the threat posed by ISIL and other militant groups. The attack underscores the need for continued support to the Iraqi security forces in their fight against terrorism. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has vowed to address the rising levels of violence in the country. He has promised to strengthen security measures and implement political reforms to address the country's divisions. However, many remain skeptical of the government's ability to deliver on its promises. In conclusion, the attack on the military base south of Baghdad is a tragic reminder of the ongoing violence that has plagued Iraq. The government must take bold steps to address the root causes of the violence and strengthen its institutions to create a truly stable and secure Iraq.
