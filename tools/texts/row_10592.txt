article: Classical scholars have made an unusually large find of religious seals and amulets in an ancient sanctuary in Turkey. The discovery, which researchers are describing as ‘unparalleled’, was made close to the ancient city of Doliche at a former worship site. Researchers uncovered more than 600 stamp seals and amulets at the site dating back from the 7th to the 4th centuries BC. Researchers have uncovered more than 600 stamp seals and amulets at the site dating back to the 7th to the 4th centuries BC . ‘Such large amounts of seal consecrations are unheard-of in any comparable sanctuary’, said excavation director Dr Engelbert Winter. ‘The amazingly large number proves how important seals and amulets were for the worshipping of the god to whom they were consecrated as votive offerings,’ he added. The artifacts, identified as late Babylonian, local Syrian Achaemenid and Levantine seals,  were found at the ancient sanctuary of Jupiter Dolichenus, who was one of the most important deities of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century AD. Many pieces show scenes of adoration and provide a surprisingly vivid insight into the faith of the time. This late Babylonian seal found at the site depicts a praying man in front of divine symbols . Jupiter Dolichenus was one of the most important deities of the Roman Empire. He became identified with the Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda as a lord of the universe. Returning legions carried his cult to Rome, where it became popular in the 2nd–3rd century AD. In Roman mystery religion he was believed to control military success and safety. He was usually represented standing on a bull holding a double ax and thunderbolt. Jupiter Dolichenus was the god of a Roman cult – the practices of which are still shrouded in a huge amount of mystery. The cult involved secret ceremonies known only to those initiated. Researchers hope the large find will help them  learn more about these practices. The stamp seals and cylinder seals, as well as scarabs, were made of glass, stone and quartz ceramics. Different themes were found ranging from geometric ornaments and astral symbols to elaborate depictions of animals and people. They included praying men in front of divine symbols. The excavations took place at the Jupiter Dolichenus sanctuary which is located at the Turkish mountain Dülük Baba Tepesi . Another popular theme was a royal hero fighting animals and hybrid creatures. During the excavations at the sanctuary, located at the Turkish mountain Dülük Baba Tepesi, Professor Winter’s team worked in an area of over 500 square metres. ‘The results are already extending our knowledge of all periods in this holy place’s long history,’ he said. ‘It covers the time span from the early place of worship of the Iron Age and the sacred site of the Roman era, famous throughout the empire, to the long phase of utilisation as a Christian monastery, which existed until well into the time of the crusaders.'

chatgpt: Archaeologists have made a fascinating discovery at a worship site dedicated to the god Jupiter Dolichenus. The site, located in southeastern Turkey, was the center for a cult whose practices were shrouded in secrecy. However, a recent excavation has uncovered an array of seals and amulets that shed light on the religious beliefs of people in the 7th to the 4th centuries BC. The Jupiter Dolichenus worship site was a unique place of worship, with a distinctive blend of Roman and Persian cultic elements. The discovery of the seals and amulets provides an even deeper insight into the faith of those who worshipped there. The artifacts, which include scarabs, gemstones, and amulets, are intricately designed and have been well-preserved, given their age. Many of the artifacts depict scenes of adoration, with the god Jupiter Dolichenus at the center of the imagery. The amulets were likely used as talismans, offering protection and good fortune. The seals also provide an insight into the workings of the cult, and how it functioned within the larger context of the region. One particularly interesting aspect of the discovery is the blending of Roman and Persian motifs in the artifacts. It is thought that the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus incorporated elements from both cultures, resulting in a unique and syncretic religious experience. The seals and amulets provide evidence of the intermingling of cultures, and how this influenced religious practice in the region during this period. The discovery of these artifacts is significant in terms of our understanding of ancient religious practices. They offer a glimpse into the faith of people who lived over two thousand years ago, and provide evidence of the spiritual beliefs that held sway during this period. The seals and amulets are also indicative of the level of craftsmanship that existed at this time, and the influence of different cultures on the region. The excavation of the Jupiter Dolichenus worship site is ongoing, and it is hoped that further discoveries will be made in the future. While the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus may be long gone, the legacy of these artifacts lives on, offering a window into the spiritual world of a lost age. Excavations of religious sites have become increasingly important in recent times, as they offer insights into the complex and multifaceted nature of ancient religions. The discovery of the seals and amulets from the Jupiter Dolichenus worship site is a prime example of how these excavations can provide valuable information about religious practices from the past. The seals and amulets found at the worship site reveal a great deal about the worldviews and beliefs of the people who lived at this time. They add a new layer of knowledge to our understanding of the ancient world, and provide a glimpse into the lives of people who lived in a time long gone. As archaeologists continue to uncover more secrets from the site, our understanding of this complex and fascinating period of history will undoubtedly be enriched.
