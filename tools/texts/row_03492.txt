article: By . Associated Press . It cost a Bend teenager about $800 in revenue from chores, yard work and birthday gifts to buy a miniature aircraft and a camera he sent aloft to capture video of a forest fire this summer that was threatening the western edge of the city. The images were a YouTube hit, but they were also a source of worry for fire bosses concerned about the possibility that drones could interfere with firefighting and possibly bring down a big aircraft. Morgan Tien, 14, told The Bulletin newspaper of Bend that he had read federal guidelines on when and where he could fly his DJI Phantom, a small quadcopter he fitted with a GoPro camera.

Tien's not in trouble for the flight, which went up from his patio on June 7, followed by a second flight the next day. They didn't get into restricted air space. But federal authorities cited the flights, along with others this summer in Washington state and California. They called them an 'emerging hazard.' Drones may be a problem for firefighters if the drones fly into restricted airspace over and near a wildfire, where air tankers and helicopters could be in the air, said Mike Ferris, a spokesman in Portland for the U.S. Forest Service. If firefighters spot a drone close to a fire, they may suspend the aerial delivery of retardant and water from air tankers and helicopters, Ferris said. The number of drones flying around wildfires is expected to increase, he said. 'We just want people to be aware and know the rules and know that it could become a hazard,' Ferris said. There have been no collisions reported between airplanes or helicopters and drones in central Oregon or the rest of the country, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Forest Service itself is interested in using drones to collect information about wildfires, such as determining their perimeters and checking for small fires. Tien said no federal agencies have contacted him about his flights near the Two Bulls Fire. He said he'd fly again near another wildfire, after making sure he was following rules, and he expects to see more people flying drones near wildfires. 'We are just entering this realm of drones,' Tien said. Video by Morgan Tien .

chatgpt: Drones have become increasingly popular among hobbyists in recent years. However, authorities are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential danger drones pose to public safety. One area in which drones may pose a significant risk is firefighting. According to officials, drones could interfere with firefighting efforts and even bring down firefighting aircraft. This concern was highlighted recently when a 14-year-old boy named Morgan Tien launched his drone near a wildfire in Bend, Oregon. Tien claims he checked federal guidelines before launching his DJI Phantom, which was fitted with a GoPro camera. Although Tien's drone did not enter restricted airspace, it was cited by federal authorities as an example of an "emerging hazard." Despite his good intentions, Tien's actions could have had serious consequences. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a warning to drone operators, reminding them that it is illegal to fly drones near wildfires. The FAA states that drone operators who interfere with firefighting efforts could face hefty fines and even jail time. This warning comes as wildfires are becoming more frequent and more severe across the western United States. In recent years, wildfires have destroyed entire communities and killed scores of people. To combat these blazes, firefighters rely on air tankers and helicopters to drop water and retardant on the flames. However, drones can interfere with these vital operations. Drones can collide with aircraft, potentially causing a crash. They can also disrupt communications between pilots and ground crews. To address this issue, the FAA is working with the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) to develop guidelines for drone use during wildfires. The NIFC, which is responsible for coordinating national firefighting efforts, has already begun to educate the public about the dangers of flying drones near wildfires. The FAA has also launched a campaign urging drone pilots to "know before you fly." The agency reminds drone operators that they are responsible for following all federal regulations and guidelines, and that they can face severe consequences for violating these rules. Despite the hazards posed by drones, many enthusiasts continue to fly them near wildfires. This has prompted lawmakers to consider new regulations that would restrict drone use during firefighting operations. For now, however, it is up to drone operators to act responsibly and avoid posing a threat to public safety.
