chatgpt: Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs suffered a hamstring injury in their match against Crystal Palace on Saturday. As a result, he was left behind as the squad flew to Turkey for their crucial Champions League qualifying tie against Besiktas on Tuesday.  Gibbs' injury comes as a blow to the Gunners, who are already without their two first-choice center backs, Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. The 24-year-old left back has been a regular member of the team ever since he made his debut in 2007, and his injury will be a cause for concern for the Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Wenger has also issued a warning to his players ahead of the match against Besiktas. Speaking to the press, he said, "We didn't play well against Crystal Palace and we were fortunate to come away with a win. We need to improve our performance against Besiktas to get the result we need." Arsenal managed to secure a narrow 2-1 win over Palace, thanks to goals from Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla. However, the Gunners were far from convincing in their performance, and Wenger will be looking for his team to show more creativity and attacking intent against Besiktas. Besiktas, on the other hand, will be buoyed by their recent form. They have won all five of their domestic league matches so far this season, and have scored an impressive 13 goals in the process. Their star striker, Demba Ba, will also be eager to prove himself against his former club, having played for Arsenal's London rivals, Chelsea, last season. The match against Besiktas will be crucial for both teams, as they look to secure a place in the group stages of the Champions League. Arsenal will be hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's play-off round, where they were knocked out by German side Borussia Dortmund. Despite their injury concerns, Arsenal will still be favorites to progress to the group stages of the competition. They have a strong squad with plenty of depth, and will be looking to capitalize on Besiktas' lack of experience at this level. The match will take place at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul, and promises to be an exciting encounter between two talented teams. Both sides will be looking to make a statement and prove themselves in Europe's most prestigious club competition.
