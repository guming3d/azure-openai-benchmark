article: A man desperate to have a perfect smile like singer Lana Del Rey spent a fortune on fillers that would give him the singer's luscious lips, but he was left with a trout pout instead. Dean, 24, from Newcastle, now says he wishes he'd never undergone the beauty treatment three years ago. Speaking on the documentary Bodyshockers, which airs on Channel 4 tonight, he said: 'I regretted it pretty much instantly. I looked in the mirror and thought "what have I done?"' Dean, 24, from Newcastle, spent a fortune on lip fillers to get a plump smile like the singer Lana Del Rey, but claims he was left with a trout pout instead (Dean pictured before, left, and after, right) Dean's lips inflated to twice their normal size and it took six months for the swelling to subside. He was then left with sore and achy lumps under his top lip. He said: 'Inside when you touch it, you can feel all these hard lumps. When I turn my lip up you can see tube-like lumps. After having the fillers, Dean's lips inflated to twice their normal size . 'They are really sensitive and sting when I eat certain foods or use lip balm.' Dean's boyfriend, Darren also joked that his lips looked like sausages and claims they make kissing unpleasant. He said: 'When I kiss you I can feel them. I would prefer him to have a natural look.' Dean agreed that he wanted to go back to how he was before the beauty treatment. He said: 'I want to reverse it, I want to get back to natural-looking lips, I don't want Darren to feel lumps like frozen peas when he's kissing me.' The cameras followed Dean as he has a reversal treatment where a chemical is injected into his lips. The chemicals are designed to break down the filler that is in lip, so they can then be sucked out. Dean paid for lip fillers so that he could look like the celebrity Lana Del Rey . Surgeon Dr Esho of Le Beau Ideal, who performed the procedure for Dean on Bodyshockers last night, said: . 'Dean had very lumpy, over filled lips. This is characteristic and common from overuse of filler. 'Luckily his fillers were semi-permanent, so using a product called hylase I was able to give precise injections into the lip, dissolve the filler and restore his lips.' Afterwards, Dean said he was delighted with the result.Â He said: 'The sensation of having small marbles under my lip is gone now, it feels back to normal.' Bodyshockers: Nips, Tucks and Tattoos is on Channel 4 Wednesdays at 10pm .

chatgpt: Dean, a 24-year-old man from Newcastle, was left dissatisfied with the results of his lip filler treatment. He had opted for the procedure in the hopes of achieving a smile similar to that of popular musician Lana Del Rey. However, Dean claims that the outcome was far from what he had anticipated. After the lip filler injection, Dean's lips swelled up to twice their original size, leaving him with a 'trout pout'. This painful and unwanted result persisted for months, and it wasn't until six months after the procedure that his lips finally began to subside. Many individuals, including men, have recently been seeking out lip filler treatments as a way of enhancing their appearance. However, the risks associated with such procedures must be carefully considered before going under the needle. According to experts in the field, like Cosmetic Doctor and Founder of The Private Clinic, Dr. Luca Russo, the vast majority of lip filler treatments are successful. He also stated that in the unlikely event of a complication, immediate medical attention should be sought. "When it comes to lip fillers, there will always be risks associated," Dr. Russo said. "In most cases, side effects such as subtle bruising, swelling or mild discomfort are temporary and can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief medication. But rare, more advanced complications - such as those experienced by Dean- require urgent medical attention." It is therefore essential for anyone considering cosmetic treatments to research the procedure and its potential consequences thoroughly. Additionally, seeking out a reputable and experienced practitioner can significantly reduce the risks involved. Fortunately for Dean, his swelling did eventually subside, and he did not require any medical attention. However, this is not always the case, as some individuals have experienced more severe long-term complications. Despite the potential risks of cosmetic procedures, it appears that more individuals than ever are seeking to alter their appearance using non-surgical methods. According to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), non-surgical procedures, including lip filler injections, have increased by 60% since 2019. While many individuals have achieved their desired results with lip filler treatments, there are risks to consider. It is important to carefully research and choose a qualified practitioner before undergoing any cosmetic procedure to minimize the likelihood of complications. In conclusion, Dean's experience serves as a cautionary tale for those considering lip filler treatment. While many people opt for the procedure to enhance their appearance, understanding the potential side effects is essential. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to weigh the risks and benefits of cosmetic procedures before deciding whether to pursue them.
