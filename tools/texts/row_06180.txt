article: Beijing (CNN) -- China said Sunday it plans to increase its defense budget by 11.2%, following similar increases in years past and coming on the heels of a renewed U.S. push in the region. The planned increase would lift spending to some 670 billion yuan ($106.4 billion) in 2012, which is almost 68 billion more than 2011 spending, said Li Zhaoxing, spokesman for the National People's Congress. By comparison, the proposed U.S. defense budget for the 2013 fiscal year is $613.9 billion, including $525.4 billion in base spending. That budget cuts half a trillion dollars in spending increases over the next 10 years. Li spoke a day before the annual session of the Chinese legislature is scheduled to start in Beijing. "The Chinese government follows the principle of coordinating defense development with economic development. It sets the country's defense spending according to the requirement of national defense and the level of economic development," he said. Last year, China announced it would increase its defense budget by close to 13%. It reported a 7.5% increase the year before. Li stressed that China's defense spending will go primary toward living expenses, training, maintenance and equipment, China's state news agency Xinhua reported. Given the country's population, long coastline and large territory, the outlays are low, he said. "The limited military strength of China is solely for safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will not pose a threat to any country," the news agency reported Li as saying. Still, China's announcement is sure to stoke concerns among some its neighbors. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to use force against the island if it ever formally sought independence. China also has claimed a significant portion of the South China Sea as its own territorial waters, putting it in conflict with other nations that have made claims on portions of the region. The move is similarly sure to raise eyebrows in Washington, where President Barack Obama is pursuing a more aggressive approach in the region. During last year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the president stressed the importance of the Pacific to global economic security. And this year, Obama and top defense officials unveiled a new U.S. defense strategy that focuses heavily on the Asia-Pacific region, a fast-growing economic powerhouse with numerous potential flashpoints that the administration has identified as crucial to U.S. interests. The strategy calls for the United States to increase its military's "institutional weight and focus on enhanced presence, power projection, and deterrence in Asia-Pacific," said Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Xinhua, while welcoming a peaceful U.S. role in the region, cautioned in a commentary then against the United States acting like a "bull in a china shop." CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.

chatgpt: China is set to raise its defense spending by 6.8% this year, according to reports. The move will take the total military budget to around 670 billion yuan ($106.4 billion), up from last year's figure of 620 billion yuan. The increase follows similar rises in defense spending in previous years. The news is likely to stoke concerns among some of China's neighbors, who have long been wary of the country's military ambitions. The increase in spending comes amid ongoing tensions in the region, particularly in the South China Sea, where China has been asserting its territorial claims. According to Chinese state media, the country's leaders have said the defense spending increase is necessary to ensure China's security and protect its sovereignty. They have also emphasized that the spending is in line with the country's economic growth and is part of its efforts to modernize its military. However, the news will not be welcomed by everyone. Some analysts have warned that China's growing military capabilities could lead to a dangerous arms race in the region. Others have expressed concern that Beijing could use its increased military power to exert greater influence over its neighbors. The United States, in particular, has been critical of China's military expansion in recent years. The Trump administration has labeled China a strategic competitor and has increased military aid to countries in the region, including Taiwan and the Philippines. In response, China has accused the US of trying to contain its rise and has warned that any attempts to interfere with its territorial claims will be met with a strong response. Despite the concerns, some observers have argued that China's military spending is not necessarily a cause for alarm. They have pointed out that China still spends significantly less on defense than the United States, and that its military capabilities are focused primarily on regional defense rather than global power projection. Moreover, China has made efforts to reassure its neighbors that its military expansion is not a threat. In November, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised the country's military for its contributions to peacekeeping efforts around the world and emphasized China's commitment to peaceful development and a peaceful foreign policy. However, China's neighbors are unlikely to be entirely comforted by such assurances. With tensions in the region on the rise, the increase in China's military spending is likely to further fuel fears of a regional arms race and could push countries to build up their own military capabilities in response.
