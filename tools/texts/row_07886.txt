article: A vigilante gang kidnapped two alleged fraudsters and threatened them with a hammer, knife and hot iron to try to get them to return money. The victims were taken to a house in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, where members of the group beat them overnight in a 'terrifying' hold up. Seven men, led by 44-year-old Tariq Dhumial, were jailed after forcing the men into transferring thousands of pounds into their bank accounts. Tariq Dhamial (left) was described as the leader of the group which also included Fateh Ahmed (right) Shakaar Ahmed Butt (left) and Ghulam Ali (right) snared the victims to a property in Manchester where they threatened them . Dhumial, the court heard, believed a previous failed business deal with the two victims had been fraudulent. With his fellow offenders, he duped the victims into meeting him at a property they thought was for sale when they attacked. Beating the men, they took a wallet, watch, bracelet, phone and keys from one man. Both hostages were told to phone their wives and arrange for bank transfers of £5,000 and £9,000. Dhamial, who was described by prosecutors as the 'leader' of the group was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court to four years in prison. Fateh Kashief Ahmed, 47, Shakoor Ahmed Butt, 35, Shazwan Ashraf, 31, Ghulam Ali, 33, and Abdul Zubair Qadus, 33, were each sentenced to 32 months, while Mohammed Khateer Ali, 31, was sentenced to 27 months. Mohammed Khateer Ali (left) was jailed for 27 months while Abdul Zubair Qadus was sentenced to 32 months . Shazwan Ashraf, 31, was also jailed for 32 months . Senior investigating officer Duncan Thorpe, from GMP, said: 'The victims were severely beaten and threatened for money that the offenders believed was owed to them from a previous fraud. 'A separate investigation is being conducted in relation to the fraudulent activities of the two victims, but unfortunately the offenders in this case decided to take matters into their own hands and inflict violence upon the victims. 'They kept the two victims prisoner for a couple of days and this was clearly a terrifying experience for both men, but today justice has been done.' Rob Hall, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: 'Tariq Dhamial was the leader in the false imprisonment of two men after a business deal went wrong. 'The two complainants were physically assaulted and threatened with demands for money being made directly to their families on mobile phones. 'The defendants initially denied all offences but eventually admitted falsely imprisoning the two men on the day of their trial. 'The message is clear that this behaviour will not be tolerated. 'Today, as these men begin prison sentences, they must face up to the consequences of their unacceptable actions.' All seven men were sentenced to different jail terms at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) for their crimes .

chatgpt: Seven Asian men have been jailed following a trial at Manchester Crown Court for holding two victims hostage and threatening violence until they arranged bank transfers to the gang's accounts. The gang of seven took the two victims hostage in a house in the Manchester area. The victims were subjected to verbal and physical abuse and were threatened with violence if they did not comply with the gang's demands. The gang then forced the victims to arrange bank transfers to their accounts. The victims managed to escape the house and reported the incident to the police. The gang was arrested and charged with false imprisonment, blackmail and money laundering. During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence of the gang's activities, including recordings of the gang members making threats to the victims. The jury found all seven men guilty of the charges. In sentencing the gang, the judge described their actions as "despicable and cowardly" and said they had caused "enormous distress" to their victims. The judge highlighted the fact that the gang had not shown any remorse for their actions. All seven men were sentenced to jail terms ranging from six to 12 years. Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Inspector Stephen Ward of Greater Manchester Police said: "These men subjected their victims to a terrifying ordeal and used violence and intimidation to get what they wanted. I would like to praise the courage of the victims in coming forward to report what happened to them. I hope the sentence handed down today provides some comfort to them." The case has highlighted the issue of gangs involved in serious and organised crime in the Manchester area. The police have warned that such gangs pose a serious threat to public safety and are committed to taking action to dismantle them. In a statement, Chief Superintendent Conrad White of Greater Manchester Police said: "This case highlights the serious and organised crime threat posed by gangs in our area. We will not tolerate such criminal activity and will work tirelessly to bring those involved to justice. We urge anyone who has information about such activity to come forward so that we can act on it." The sentencing of the gang of seven sends a clear message that such criminal activity will not be tolerated and those involved will be brought to justice. The police urge anyone with information about such criminal activity to come forward to help them tackle this issue and keep the public safe.
