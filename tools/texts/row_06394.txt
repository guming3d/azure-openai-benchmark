The Germany forward wheels away after his second goal in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar . Gibraltar played, as expected, with 10 men behind the ball, leaving just Liam Walker to wait for very rare touches inside the Germany half. It seemed to be going according to plan for Germany too when Shkodran Mustafi's cross from the right struck the near post and fell out for Muller to slot in to open the scoring in the 12th minute. The floodgates did not open, though, because Gibraltar's wall of players were holding them closed well, although a powerful cross from Karim Bellarabi almost ended in the back of the net off a Gibraltar defender.

chatgpt: Germany Secures Dominant Win Against Gibraltar as Minnows Continue Struggle in Euro Qualifiers Germany's national soccer team secured a dominant 4-0 victory against Gibraltar on Saturday, June 13th, in their bid to claim a spot for the Euro 2016 tournament. It was a match that many predicted to be a massacre against the minnows, who had previously conceded 14 goals in their opening Euro qualifiers. However, Gibraltar surprised many with their resolute defense, limiting Germany to just four goals. Despite the high expectations on Germany, it was a fairly quiet first-half, with the minnows managing to hold off Germany’s attacking prowess for almost half an hour. It wasn’t until the 28th minute that Thomas Muller finally broke the deadlock, glancing in a header from a Joshua Kimmich corner. It was all Germany needed to finally find their rhythm, as they dominated the rest of the match.  Muller went on to double his tally, just eight minutes after his first goal to put Germany 2-0 up. It was a well-worked play that started with Toni Kroos who played the ball forward to Mario Gotze. Gotze then fed in Muller, who skillfully controlled the ball with his chest before slotting it into the bottom corner.  Gotze then showed his class with a brilliant solo effort that put the game beyond Gibraltar's reach. The Bayern Munich forward, who has struggled for form for much of the season, controlled a loose ball and darted through the defense before calmly slotting the ball into the bottom corner of the net.  Gibraltar’s misery was compounded when German striker, Max Kruse, saw his effort deflect off defender David Artell's leg before the ball rolled over the line for an own goal in the second half. However, Gibraltar battled on until the final whistle, preventing Germany from running rampant and adding to their already impressive goal tally. The game, played at the Frankenstadion in Nuremberg, takes Germany to second place in Group D with 10 points, three points behind Poland. While Gibraltar remains at the bottom of the group standings, their performance was well-received and appreciated by fans who were impressed by their fighting spirit. Despite the final result heavily favoring Germany, it was a game that demonstrated the improvement of the smaller football nations, no longer willing to be mere fodder for larger countries. Gibraltar may have lost the match, but the team can draw optimism from their performance against one of the world's top soccer nations.  Germany will next face Scotland in September, while Gibraltar will play against Georgia in their next Euro qualifier. It remains to be seen what new surprises await in the next match, but we can expect more exciting soccer as the Euro 2016 tournament approaches.
