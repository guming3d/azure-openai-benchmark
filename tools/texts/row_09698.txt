Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Before you complain again about living in 2010 and not yet having a jetpack to fly you to work, consider taking a trip to Mexico. There's only one person in the world who produces a complete flying rocket belt from start to finish -- from the parts to the fuel that powers it. His name is Juan Manuel Lozano and he lives in Cuernavaca, a city two hours south of Mexico City. So VBS sister technology channel Motherboard.tv traveled to visit him at his company, TAM (Tecnología Aeroespacial Mexicana). A self-taught scientist and inventor whose technologies have traveled the world from Turkey to Switzerland, from Boeing to the U.S. Navy, Lozano considers his biggest achievement not his jetpack, but a machine that produces pure hydrogen peroxide that he uses as fuel for most of his inventions. Apart from his rocket belt, he's assembled a rocket bicycle, rocket motorcycle, rocket dragster and a personal helicopter. Then there's the hydrogen-peroxide-powered rocket belt. While at least one company has recently promised to bring personal flying machines to market, these conveyances only rely on propellers, not jets. But the real thing ain't cheap. If you can't afford the system, priced at around U.S. $125,000, you can pay him to drop by your party for only $20,000. See the rest of Backyard Rocketeer at VBS.TV . Among many other projects, Lozano's working with a group of scientists on a car that will run on seawater, converted into hydrogen peroxide by electrolytic cells powered by solar energy. It's a project, he says, that will completely transform transportation and energy in the near future. Lozano and his daughter -- the only woman to fly a jetpack -- take his creations for test-drives in their backyard. While he couldn't fly for us (he recently broke his ribs and shoulder while taking his rocket bike for a spin at 80 mph), he gave us a tour of his workshop to share with us his favorite machines and a philosophy of invention built on hard work, self-teaching, and lots of jet fuel.

chatgpt: Juan Manuel Lozano, a Mexican scientist, has been making waves in the aeronautics world with his inventions for many years. Lozano has traveled the world, working with esteemed organizations such as the U.S. Navy and Boeing. Recently, he has set his sights on revolutionizing human flight by building and testing jetpacks in his own backyard. Lozano is not new to the world of aviation and has previously invented several other personal transportation devices, including a rocket bicycle, a rocket motorcycle, and a personal helicopter. But his latest project, the jetpack, has garnered significant attention from the international press. The Mexican scientist’s jetpack is a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) device that uses hydrogen peroxide as fuel. The jetpack has a maximum altitude of 200 feet and a top speed of 60 miles per hour. Lozano says that the fuel for the jetpack is readily available and easy to handle, making it an ideal choice for personal use. Lozano spent over a year on designing and building the device. He faced several challenges during the building process, including procuring the necessary equipment and sourcing suitable materials. Nevertheless, after several setbacks, Lozano managed to perfect his design, and the outcome has been remarkable. The Mexican inventor is now in the testing phase of his latest invention, and he is eager to explore the possibilities of the device further. He has already tested his jetpack in his backyard, and the results have been promising. Furthermore, Lozano believes that the jetpack has many practical applications, including search and rescue operations, firefighting, and farming. Lozano’s jetpack has caught the attention of many aviation and technology enthusiasts globally, with many praising his innovative spirit and drive. However, as with any new technology, there are also critics who are skeptical about its safety and practicality. Despite the criticisms, Lozano is confident that his jetpack will revolutionize human transportation, and he plans to release it commercially when he is satisfied that it meets all necessary safety standards. He also hopes to continue his passion for revolutionizing personal transportation in the future. In conclusion, Juan Manuel Lozano’s latest invention has made waves in the aviation industry, with his jetpack design garnering significant attention globally. While skeptics and critics remain, the Mexican scientist is confident that his device will revolutionize human transportation and open new frontiers in aeronautics. His project is undoubtedly an example of human innovation and the desire to push boundaries relentlessly.
