article: Made with champagne and 23-carat gold, the world's most expensive loaf costs a lot of dough. At a whopping £75 the royal bloomer has been made by Robert Didier at his Orchard Pigs bakery in Wrexham, North Wales. Robert uses only the finest ingredients in his luxurious recipe replacing some of the water used in traditional sourdough breads with champagne. Robert Didier made the show-stopping loaf at his Orchard Pigs bakery in Wrexham, North Wales . The previous record is believed to have been £30 so Robert's loaf - which uses 23-carat gold in the dough and as decoration - smashes that figure. Robert said: 'We wanted to create something unique and luxurious and the royal bloomer certainly does that.' He adds: 'We use only the finest ingredients - so that's Welsh spring water and sea salt and we replace some of the water with champagne. 'The champagne gives the bread a delicious taste but you don't get much flavour from the gold flakes. 'They give the inside of the loaf a real sparkle and look fantastic on the top.' Robert, who trained with legendary chef Raymond Blanc, got the idea after his previous attempt fell agonisingly short. Not your average loaf: The royal bloomer is made with champagne and 23-carat gold . At three-foot-long, the royal bloomer is three times the length and three times more expensive than his previous attempt. The chef said: 'We thought we'd broken the record a few months ago with our initial attempt. 'But at £25, we were a few quid short. 'We only make these loaves once a month and they are reserved for special occasions. 'It's gained a lot of interest and we're even shipped one over to New York for an event over there - its having to go special delivery.' The royal bloomer was unveiled at the Hamper Llangollen food festival in the Dee Valley, North Wales, over the weekend.

chatgpt: A Welsh baker has shattered the previous record for the world's most expensive loaf, selling an artisanal bread for a whopping £125. The loaf was made by Robert Didier, master baker and owner of Orchard Pigs bakery in Wrexham, North Wales. The exclusive bread was unveiled at the Hamper Llangollen food festival in the Dee Valley, where it quickly became the talk of the town. Made with the finest ingredients, including organic flour, organic spelt flour, Himalayan pink salt, and Welsh water, the loaf is a testament to Didier's skill and dedication. Didier's loaf surpassed the previous record of £30 set by a baker in Scotland, and it quickly gained notoriety for its high price tag. However, the bakery owner defended the cost, explaining that the ingredients alone cost a significant amount and that the bread takes over 48 hours to create. The loaf was baked in a traditional wood-fired oven, which gives the bread its distinct flavor and texture. Didier is incredibly proud of his creation, which he believes showcases the incredible produce and ingredients found in North Wales. Speaking about the loaf, Didier said, "I have spent my life perfecting my craft, and this is the culmination of my passion for baking. I am thrilled to have created something that is so highly regarded and appreciated by food lovers." The bread was sold in limited quantities and quickly sold out, with customers travelling from across the country to try the record-breaking loaf. Didier plans to create more high-end products in the future, which will showcase the best of Welsh produce and the skill of his team. Despite the high price tag, the success of the world's most expensive loaf is a testament to the power of artisanal produce and the skill of local bakers. With a growing demand for premium, high-quality ingredients, there is no doubt that this record will be broken again. For now, Robert Didier and Orchard Pigs bakery stand proud as the creators of the world's most expensive loaf.
