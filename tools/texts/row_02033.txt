chatgpt: Barbadian singer Robyn Fenty, better known as Rihanna, has revealed she was left "effectively bankrupt" at the end of 2009 due to bad financial advice from her former accountant. The 25-year-old, who is now worth an estimated $43m according to Forbes, says she was advised to purchase a $7m Beverly Hills mansion when she was running out of cash. The revelation comes in court papers filed in London as part of a lawsuit against her former accountant, Peter Gounis of Berdon LLP, whom she accused of negligence and breach of contract. In the documents, Rihanna says Gounis failed to properly advise her on her financial situation during a period when she was extensively touring and launching a number of businesses, and as a result, she suffered significant financial losses. "At the end of 2009, I found myself running out of cash," Rihanna wrote in the court documents. "At this point, Mr. Gounis and Berdon had been my accountant and business manager for several years. Mr. Gounis advised me that I could purchase a home in LA costing around $7m, even though I was experiencing financial difficulties." Rihanna claims that she relied on Gounis' advice and purchased the property, only to later discover that her expenses had exceeded her earnings. She says the property purchase, coupled with other bad financial decisions she alleges were made by Gounis on her behalf, led to her becoming "effectively bankrupt" by the end of 2009. The singer says she eventually discovered the extent of her financial problems and terminated her relationship with Gounis and his firm in 2010. She later settled a lawsuit against them for an undisclosed amount. Rihanna's career has since bounced back, and she has become one of the most successful recording artists in history. In addition to music, she has launched several successful fashion and beauty lines, and has become a prominent philanthropist, donating millions of dollars to various causes. Despite her success, Rihanna says the financial advice she received from Gounis still haunts her to this day. "Mr. Gounis and Berdon left me in a dire financial situation and now I am still dealing with the aftermath of their negligence," she said in the court documents. The case is expected to go to trial later this year, where Rihanna will seek damages for the losses she says she suffered due to Gounis' alleged negligence. For now, the singer continues to focus on her music and her many business ventures, hoping to continue her climb up the ranks of the world's most successful and influential stars.
