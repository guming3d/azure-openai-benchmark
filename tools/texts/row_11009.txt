article: A couple's dream honeymoon became a nightmare after they were struck down with stomach bugs. Just days after touching down in the Dominican Republic, Rebecca and Matthew Lott say they were infected with crippling gastric illnesses, turning their five-star getaway into a 'horrendous' ordeal. Matthew, 28, said the start of their wedded life together was ruined by the experience at the Caribe Princess Resort in June this year after they booked with Thomson Holidays, part of the TUI UK group. The couple's honeymoon to the five-star Caribe Princess Resort turned into a nightmare . They suffered from symptoms including diarrhoea, sickness, blood in their stools and fever from early in the first week of their two-week stay, and continued to feel the effects after they got back home to Prestwich. Account manager Matthew said: 'We'd had a perfect wedding day, it was everything we'd hoped for, but now our lasting memory of such a special time in our lives is clouded by the honeymoon, which was just a disaster. 'We were concerned about the conditions at the hotel and both of us suffered from horrendous symptoms throughout our honeymoon and even now we are still suffering from on-going illness which has had a huge impact on our lives.' Following their wedding, Matthew and Rebecca Lott headed for their honeymoon to the Dominican Republic, where they contracted severe stomach illnesses . The honeymoon suite is advertised on the hotel's website as costing $2,324 (£1,500) for a two-week trip in June, excluding flights. The newlyweds have now asked solicitors to investigate as they believe the resort was responsible for ruining their first trip as a married couple. The couple claim undercooked food was served throughout their stay, including raw pieces of chicken, and said flies swarmed over food being served, and birds flying around inside the restaurant were a regular sight. Nichola Blackburn, from Irwin Mitchell solicitors, said: 'We are now investigating how our clients became ill during their honeymoon. 'This was meant to be a holiday of a lifetime for Rebecca and Matthew who were celebrating the start of their married life. The illness they suffered ruined their holiday'. A Thomson spokeswoman said: 'We are sorry to hear of the Lotts' experience at the Caribe Princess Resort in the Dominican Republic this summer. 'Thomson closely audits all resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards. 'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'

chatgpt: A couple's Caribbean vacation turned into a nightmare when they fell ill after staying at the Caribe Princess Resort. Rebecca and Matthew Lott from Wisconsin, USA, had planned a dream vacation but instead, they claim they experienced raw food and birds flying inside the resort's restaurant during their stay. The couple said that they suffered from a range of symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, blood in their stools, and fever. They believe their illness was directly caused by the poor food hygiene conditions at the resort. "It was a nightmare from the outset, and we couldn't wait to leave," said Rebecca Lott. The Lotts say they raised concerns with the resort's management, but their complaints fell on deaf ears. "We were brushed off by the staff at the resort who didn't seem to take our complaints very seriously," said Matthew Lott. "We were told that the food was safe to eat, but clearly it wasn't." The Caribe Princess Resort is a popular hotel located in the Dominican Republic that offers all-inclusive packages for holidaymakers. The resort features a large restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as several bars and lounges. The Lotts warned other travelers about their experience at the Caribe Princess Resort, urging them to be vigilant about the quality and safety of the food they consume during their vacations. "We've been to several resorts over the years, but we have never experienced anything like this," said Rebecca Lott. "We would hate for anyone else to go through what we went through." Upon hearing about the incident, the resort's management issued a statement apologizing to the Lotts for their negative experience. "We take all guest complaints seriously and work hard to ensure the safety and satisfaction of all who stay with us," the statement read. "We have since addressed the issues raised by the Lotts and will continue to work to improve our food hygiene and safety protocols." However, the Lotts say that the resort's apology is not enough. They believe that more needs to be done to prevent other travellers from experiencing the same ordeal. The couple has created a blog to document their story and have urged others to come forward if they have suffered from illnesses while staying at the Caribe Princess Resort. Cases of foodborne illnesses are not uncommon in the hospitality industry, and it is essential for hotels to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of their guests. Travelers are encouraged to be vigilant about the quality of the food they consume during their vacations and report any concerns to the resort's management immediately.
