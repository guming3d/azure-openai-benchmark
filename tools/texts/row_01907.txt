The Census Bureau report, titled School Enrolment: 2012, is the latest in a series of studies that seem to show that older people who fled to colleges and universities during tough economic times might be heading back into the workforce. President Barack Obama took a two-day tour in late August to campaign for college affordability, stopping at locations in New York and Pennsylvania. Among other initiatives, Obama pushed for a college rating system that would help students and their parents determine which colleges would provide the best return for their tuition dollars. ‘We've got a crisis in terms of college affordability and student debt,’ Obama said during a stop at the State University of New York at Buffalo. ‘We can't price the middle class, and everybody working to get into the middle class, out of an education.’

chatgpt: Enrollment in colleges and universities across the United States has taken a hit with half a million less students registered in 2012 than the previous year. The largest decline was reported among mature students aged 25 and above. According to a recent report by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, the number of students who enrolled in higher education institutes dropped from 20.6 million in 2011 to 20.1 million in 2012. The report sheds light on the trend of declining enrollment, which many experts say has a lot to do with the rise in tuition fees and the sluggish economy. The report also indicates that the enrollment rates among mature students have decreased by 3.9%. The trend has been attributed to various factors, including the booming job market, the increasing demand for skilled labor, and the sheer cost of education. However, amidst the dip in enrollment, there has been a glimmer of hope. The report shows that there has been a surge in the number of Hispanics enrolling in colleges and universities. The Hispanic community has accounted for a staggering 17% of the total student population, up from 11% in 2006. This development marks a significant shift in the demographics of the student population in higher education institutions. According to the report, the increase is a positive trend that highlights the growing diversity in higher education. The study also indicates that the enrollment rates for African American and Native American students have remained stable, while the rates for Asian American students are showing a steady decline. The findings of this recent report come ahead of the 2020 US Presidential Elections, where education reform is a key issue. Experts in the academic field believe that policies aimed at addressing the issue of rising tuition fees would go a long way in promoting equal access to higher education. In conclusion, the decline in college enrollment, particularly among mature students, is a cause for concern. However, the growing number of Hispanics enrolling in higher education institutions is good news for diversity and inclusion. The report highlights the need for concerted efforts to make college education more affordable and accessible to all Americans, regardless of race, gender, or socio-economic status.
