article: (CNN)The U.S. Navy says its new laser weapon works and it will use it if it has to. The Office of Naval Research reported Wednesday that its laser weapons system -- dubbed LaWS -- had performed flawlessly in tests aboard the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce in the Arabian Gulf from September to November. "Laser weapons are powerful, affordable and will play a vital role in the future of naval combat operations," Rear Adm. Matthew L. Klunder, chief of naval research, said in a statement. "We ran this particular weapon, a prototype, through some extremely tough paces, and it locked on and destroyed the targets we designated with near-instantaneous lethality." Klunder said the laser performed so well that the commander of the Ponce is now authorized to use it in defense of the vessel, according to a report from the U.S. Naval Institute. "The captain of that ship has all of the authorities necessary if there was a threat inbound to that ship to protect our sailors and Marines (and) we would defend that ship with that laser system," Klunder is quoted as saying in a USNI report. The laser could be used to stop threats ranging from drones and helicopters to small patrol boats, Klunder said, according to the USNI report. Navy video released Wednesday shows the LaWS hitting exactly those types of targets. Watching the video, you can't see any light beam as you might expect from watching science fiction movies. Instead, the targets just burn up. The Navy says the laser weapon is safer than conventional arms that use propellants and explosive warheads, and more cost-effective. "At less than a dollar per shot, there's no question about the value LaWS provides," Klunder said in the Navy statement. "With affordability a serious concern for our defense budgets, this will more effectively manage resources to ensure our sailors and Marines are never in a fair fight." The laser also takes fewer crew members to operate. It can be fired by one sailor using a video game-like controller. The weapon performed without failure in conditions of high wind, humidity and temperature, the Navy said. The Navy hopes to deploy variations of the laser weapon system in the fleet by 2020.

chatgpt: The United States Navy has successfully tested its laser weapon off a ship in the Persian Gulf from September to November. The weapon was aimed and fired by a sailor using a video-game-like controller. This technology is significant when it comes to future military warfare, as it is an efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional guns and missiles. The Navy's laser costs less than a dollar per shot, making it extremely cost-effective, especially when compared to traditional weapons. The system is capable of targeting a wide range of threats, including aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and surface vessels. Additionally, the laser is said to be more accurate and faster than traditional weapons, which could be critical in combat situations. During the testing period, the Navy's laser was used in a range of scenarios, including shooting down unmanned aerial vehicles and disabling small boats. The tests were conducted under real-world conditions, showing that the weapon is capable of performing in harsh environments. The laser's accuracy was also demonstrated during the tests. The Navy's laser was able to focus on and target specific areas of the boats, such as the engines, causing them to become disabled. This level of precision was possible due to the laser's superior aiming capabilities. The video game-like controller was a key component of the testing process, as it allowed the sailors to easily aim and fire the laser. The controller is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, making it a crucial part of the Navy's success in testing the system. The Navy's laser is also said to be safer than traditional weapons. As there is no ammunition involved, there is no risk of explosions or collateral damage. This could be a significant advantage in combat situations where safety is a significant concern. The success of the Navy's laser weapon is an essential step towards the future of modern military warfare. With its cost-effectiveness, accuracy, and safety, the laser has the potential to replace traditional weapons in the near future. The Navy's testing of the laser proves that it is possible to create a superior weapon system that can perform more effectively and efficiently than traditional weapons.
