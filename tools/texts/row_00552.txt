The defendant was caught on CCTV cameras at Asda in Bury St Edmunds stealing 23 pods on January 22nd.  Bryon was found guilty of a similar crime that he committed at a Tesco's store in 2010. During his trial at Ipswich Crown Court, the court heard that Bryon had used a hook-like device to steal the pods containing cash from the self-service checkout machines.  The prosecutor, Lucy D’Orsi, told the court that Bryon had stolen the pods at Asda in January by placing his device into the pod slot and pulling out the cash containers. D’Orsi also informed the court that Bryon had stolen over £2,000 in total. The court heard that Bryon had a history of theft convictions, including theft of cash and other items from shops. It was also revealed that Bryon had previously been jailed in 2010 for stealing pods containing cash from a Tesco's store in Hertfordshire. During his sentencing hearing, Bryon's defense lawyer, Harry Bentley, admitted that his client had a long history of theft offenses but stressed that he was trying to turn his life around. Bentley argued that the four-year sentence was excessive and asked for a lenient sentence. The judge, however, disagreed and sentenced Bryon to four years in custody. The judge commented that Bryon had failed to learn from his previous conviction and that he had committed a significant amount of theft on this occasion. In conclusion, Michael Bryon will be spending the next four years of his life behind bars for stealing pods containing cash from a supermarket. His actions have affected not only his life but also the lives of those around him. The verdict serves as a reminder to individuals who engage in theft to consider the consequences of their actions.
