article: We're all living longer than ever - but will a poor lifestyle send some of us to an early grave? Worldwide, a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can . expect to live to 68, according to a recent World Health . Organisation report on life expectancy. In the UK, life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83, meanwhile in the U.S. it is 76 and 81 respectively. But are your habits and lifestyle knocking years off your life? In . a bid to raise awareness about the risk factors for a premature death, . Canadian medical experts from various organisations - including the . Canadian Institutes of Health Research - compiled this life expectancy . calculator. Called . Project Big Life, it was created by a team investigating the deaths of 70,000 . people - and how different health behaviours affected the risk of death. It takes into account a person's height and weight, if they smoke (or . ever have) and how often alcohol is consumed. Fruit . and vegetable intake is also taken into account - in particular the . quantity of fruit juice, salad, fruit, salad, potatoes and carrots . consumed each week. Later questions relate to exercise; how many hours are spent a) jogging or running and b) playing ice hockey, soccer, basketball, volleyball, or rollerblading. Activities such a walking, cycling, gardening, golfing, bowling and fishing are calculated as leisure time. Finally, stress levels, health conditions (such as heart disease and diabetes) and household income are factored in. TAKE THE TEST HERE . While the health dangers of smoking are well known, research is increasingly showing . that being obese and/or sedentary may be just as bad. Last month, . Australian researchers warned that lack of exercise is a worse risk for . women over 30 than obesity or smoking. And . a study published in the British Medical Journal reported that stress . can lower life expectancy. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh . found the risk of heart attack or stroke increases by 20 per cent when a person suffers from low-level stress. Mental illness has even more of a toll and is as bad as smoking, according to Oxford University research published last month. Serious . mental illness can reduce a person's life expectancy by 10 to 20 years, . when the average reduction in life expectancy for heavy smokers is . eight to 10 years. Across the globe, life expectancies are increasing with the highest male life expectancy being in Iceland - 81 - and the highest female life expectancy being in Japan - 87 .

chatgpt: A team of Canadian medical experts has launched a new project aimed at investigating the deaths of over 70,000 individuals. The initiative, titled 'Project Big Life', seeks to understand the factors that contribute to a healthy and long life. The project takes into account several crucial factors that determine an individual's health status, such as stress levels, fruit and vegetable consumption, and existing medical conditions. Additionally, the project examines the role of leisure and sports activities, an individual's household income and their height to weight ratio. According to the lead researcher behind Project Big Life, a healthy lifestyle can help contribute to a longer life. He added that people's daily habits make a more significant difference to their health than genetics. The project is designed to collect data and analyze the trends and correlations related to the different lifestyle factors that can contribute to a healthy and longer life. The findings could help Canadians modify specific lifestyle habits and lead healthier lives. Initial data suggests that individuals with higher household incomes are likely to live longer than those who don't. Several factors may contribute to this, such as access to high-quality medical care, better nutritional choices, and less stressful work environments. Similarly, regular exercise, including sports activities and leisure, has been found to be an essential component of a healthy lifestyle. Project Big Life's researchers found that people who engage in physical activity regularly are much more likely to live longer and healthier lives. The study also revealed that controlling one's weight is essential to achieving optimal health. Those who maintain a healthy weight throughout their lives are less likely to develop chronic medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. Although the project is still in its early stages, the findings so far are compelling. Project Big Life has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of Canadians by providing them with the information they need to modify their lifestyle habits and achieve better health outcomes. Overall, the creators of the project hope that the findings will help create a healthier society by encouraging individuals to make better-informed decisions about their health. The project aims to continue monitoring trends and patterns to design interventions that will positively impact individual and community health outcomes.
