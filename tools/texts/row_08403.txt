A disabled Iraqi war veteran is suing a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in the Bronx for refusing him service when he brought in his service dog. 50-year-old Charles Hernandez says he entered the location on Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue on February 26 to buy a two-piece chicken meal with fries in order to take some prescribed medication. But he was refused service when the employees behind the counter saw that he was accompanied by his service dog, Valor. Turned away: Charles Hernandez (second left) and his dog Valor (black) meet Senator Chuck Schumer (center). Hernandez filed a lawsuit yesterday against a KFC in the Bronx for refusing him and Valor service . 'Papi, there are no dogs allowed,' Hernandez recalls an employee saying. Hernandez tried to explain that Valor is a service dog and according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Valor is allowed to accompany him anywhere. 'OK, but you still cannot have the dog in the store,' the employee responded. Hernandez even says that the store's manager, Sade Clark, saw the 'discrimination' happening and did nothing about it. 'I was frustrated, angry and more, depressed,' Hernandez told the New York Post. 'No one was helping. Rather than understanding the needs of a person, they shut me out.' So Hernandez is now suing the employee, Clark, the restaurant's owner and the company's principal owner for $1million. Sued: This KFC in the Bronx was slapped with a $1million lawsuit yesterday for refusing Hernandez and his dog Valor service last February . In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, Hernandez alleges that the KFC worker broke federal, state and city laws and caused him distress. Hernandez won a similar case in 2011 after being cursed out by a McDonald's store manager in Times Square for entering with his service dog. 'It's unfortunate that when disabled veterans return from war...they are confronted with ignorance and discrimination,' Hernandez's lawyer David Lackowitz told the New York Daily News. Hernandez was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2006 and sustained multiple injuries to his shoulder and his back. A spinal chord injury led to his early retirement. Hernandez also worked at Ground Zero for three months after the September 11th attacks and was named 'City Council Veteran of the Year' in 2011. In 2010 he was given Valor to held him with balance and prevent his panic attacks.

chatgpt: Charles Hernandez, a disabled man from the Bronx, is suing KFC for $1 million after he was allegedly refused service at one of their locations last February when he brought in his service dog, Valor. According to Hernandez, the KFC worker denied him service because of his dog, which is against the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires that service dogs be allowed to accompany their owners in all public places. Hernandez claims that he informed the KFC worker that Valor was a service dog, but the worker still refused to serve him. He then spoke to the store manager and owner, but they also denied him service. Hernandez is now suing the worker, store manager, owner, and the company's principal owner for $1 million. Under the ADA, service dogs are defined as dogs that have been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. This includes tasks such as guiding individuals who are blind, alerting individuals who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, and alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure. The ADA also states that businesses that serve the public must allow people with service animals to enter their premises and use their services. In an interview with a local news outlet, Hernandez said that he relies on Valor to help with his disability and that the incident at KFC had a significant impact on him. He says he felt embarrassed and humiliated, and it made him question whether he wanted to leave his home again. KFC has not yet responded to Hernandez's lawsuit, but they released a statement saying that they take this issue seriously and are investigating the matter. They also stated that they have policies and procedures in place to ensure that they comply with the ADA, and they take the training of their employees seriously. According to the National Service Animal Registry, there has been an increase in the number of people traveling with service animals in recent years, and this has highlighted the need for individuals and businesses to be aware of the laws surrounding service animals. This includes ensuring that service animals are allowed to accompany their owners in all public places, including restaurants and other businesses. Hernandez's case highlights the importance of educating individuals and businesses about the rights of people with disabilities and their service animals. It also emphasizes the need for businesses to make sure that their employees are properly trained and educated about the ADA and how to interact with people with disabilities and their service animals. In conclusion, Charles Hernandez's lawsuit against KFC serves as a reminder that people with disabilities have the right to be accompanied by their service animals in all public places. It is a violation of the law to deny service to someone because they have a service animal with them, and businesses must take steps to ensure that their employees are properly trained and educated on this issue.
