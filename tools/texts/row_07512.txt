article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Conrad Murray wants a key piece of evidence tested which his lawyers argue could prove Michael Jackson injected himself with the drug that killed him. Murray, who is serving a four-year prison sentence, is appealing last year's involuntary manslaughter conviction in Jackson's 2009 death. A motion filed Monday by his lawyers asked an appeals court to order a test of the residue in a 100 milliliter bottle of propofol that prosecutors say contained the fatal dose of surgical anesthetic. Conrad Murray invites Katherine Jackson to visit him in jail . If it contains 10% lidocaine, then it would support prosecution expert Dr. Steven Shafer's theory that Murray rigged up an IV drip using the bottle and then left the room, Murray's motion said. Shafer testified that lidocaine, which was found in Jackson's blood after his death, was mixed with propofol to ease the sting of the drug as it entered a vein in Jackson's leg. "However, if the residue is 100% propofol, it would absolutely refute Shafer's final contention that was used to prove an IV propofol infusion," the motion said. The defense theory was that a desperate Jackson, fearing that his comeback concerts could be canceled unless he found elusive sleep, self-administered propofol that Murray was trying to wean him off of. It contends that Jackson also swallowed eight lorazepam tablets while Murray was not watching. Two requests by Murray's lawyers to have the bottle tested after the trial were rejected by the trial judge, who ruled they should have asked for testing before the trial. Murray's lawyers argued the residue in the bottle, which the prosecution never tested, became relevant only at the end of the prosecution's case" when Shafer "remodeled" his theory about how Jackson died. "Dr. Shafer made a striking change in his rebuttal testimony, which occurred during the final minutes of the evidentiary portion of the trial," Murray lawyer Valerie Wass said. Murray told police he stopped using IV infusions of propofol to help Jackson sleep three days before his death, and that he only injected a small dose the morning he died. "The amount of propofol Murray claims he gave Jackson does in fact comport with the amount of propofol found in Jackson's blood at autopsy," Murray lawyer J. Michael Flanagan said. "There was no propofol infusion on the morning of Jackson's death. The analysis of the residue in Exhibit 30 will prove the truth once and for all." The motion asks the appeals court to order the Los Angeles County Coroner to either test the residue or hand it over to a private lab for testing. Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show .

chatgpt: Lawyers representing Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson, are seeking to have a propofol bottle tested for lidocaine residue. According to prosecutors, the bottle in question contained the fatal dose of propofol that led to the pop icon's death in 2009.  The defense team argues that if the bottle is found to have no lidocaine residue, it would disprove the prosecution's theory that Murray administered the fatal dose of propofol. Instead, their theory is that Jackson was desperate and self-injected the drug that ultimately killed him. Dr. Murray was sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of administering a lethal dose of propofol to Jackson while serving as his personal physician. During the trial, the prosecution argued that Murray was reckless in his use of propofol, a powerful anesthetic. Propofol is a powerful medication that is typically administered in hospital settings to patients undergoing surgery or other medical procedures. It is not intended for use as a sleep aid, and its misuse can be extremely dangerous. Jackson was known to have struggled with insomnia and reportedly sought out propofol as a means of helping him sleep. Murray was hired by Jackson as his personal physician and began administering propofol to him on a nightly basis. The defense's theory that Jackson self-injected the fatal dose of propofol is difficult to prove, as there were no eyewitnesses to the incident. However, the defense believes that the absence of lidocaine residue in the propofol bottle would suggest that someone other than Murray administered the drug. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that is often used in combination with propofol to reduce pain and discomfort during administration. If the propofol bottle in question contains no lidocaine residue, this would suggest that it was not used in conjunction with the drug. The testing of the propofol bottle for lidocaine residue is scheduled to take place in the coming weeks. If the test results are favorable for the defense, it could potentially lead to further legal action in the case. Despite Murray's conviction and sentencing, the death of Michael Jackson remains a deeply controversial and emotional topic for many fans and observers. The singer's legacy as one of the most successful and innovative pop musicians of all time has been overshadowed by the circumstances of his death and the ongoing legal battles that have surrounded it. As the legal fight over Jackson's death continues, the world continues to mourn his loss and celebrate his contributions to music and popular culture. Whatever the outcome of the propofol bottle testing, his legacy will undoubtedly continue to loom large in the years to come.
