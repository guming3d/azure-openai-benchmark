article: MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida boy remains in stable condition just days after he found his parents' long-forgotten handgun in a closet and accidentally shot himself in the head. Police are deciding whether or not to charge parents after their son found a forgotten gun and shot himself. Sheriff's detectives in Pinellas County, Florida, near St. Petersburg, say the boy found the .25-caliber European semi-automatic handgun in a box in a closet in their home. "They are dealing with this very tragic situation, and at this point, no charges have been filed," said Cecilia Barreda of the Pinellas County sheriff's office. His stepfather found Jacob Larson, 12, with a gunshot wound to the head Friday. The stepfather called 911. Police say the shooting took place between 7:40 a.m., when his mother, Tracy Newman, leaves for work, and about 11 a.m., when his stepfather, Joseph Newton, returns home. The boy normally goes to school about 8:30 a.m. "A few years ago, they moved, and [the gun] was stored in the closet. The mother never checked it, never fired it," Barreda said. "They told detectives that they forgot they had stored it in a box inside a closet. Both her and her husband forgot about it," she said. Newman told detectives that she received the gun six years ago from a former employer. Police say that both she and her husband are cooperating in the investigation into the incident. The sheriff's office says it's unlikely that they will face charges. Florida law prohibits a person from leaving a loaded firearm where a minor might have access to it. Prosecutors do have some discretion, and depending on what happens with the gun, charges ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony can be filed in the event of death or serious injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 17 states have child firearm access protection and safe-storage laws. Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett says that although laws are needed, an accident with a firearm can be a greater penalty than any judge could ever hand down. "Sometimes, the injury of a child is more severe from a punishment standpoint than any kind of criminal charge," he said. The CDC says one child, on average, every three days died in accidental incidents in the United States from 2000 to 2005, the last year data are available. Bartlett said his office has filed charges in previous cases when there was culpable negligence on the part of a gun owner. But, he says, there are cases where accidents happen, not crimes. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says that 34 percent of children in the United States live in homes with at least one firearm, so people have to be aware. "It's a horrible thing, and those parents will blame themselves from here out, and you have to look at things real close to see if it warrants any enforcement from our end," Bartlett said.

chatgpt: A 12-year-old boy was found with a .25-caliber gun in his possession, which he had discovered in a box located in his closet. Despite the discovery of the weapon, police have not yet charged anyone in relation to the incident. Florida law prohibits anyone from leaving a loaded firearm where a minor can access it. If anyone violates this law, they can face severe consequences. Speaking about the incident, a prosecutor stated that the injury and suffering of a child could result in more severe punishments for those who violate the law. It is a reminder to all parents and legal guardians to ensure that they are mindful of where they store their guns, particularly if they have minors in their homes. The discovery of the gun has understandably raised alarm bells for law enforcement officials and parents alike. It highlights the importance of keeping guns, particularly those that are loaded, out of the reach of minors. The fact that a child was able to find a gun in his own closet highlights the alarming consequences of gun ownership, particularly when they are not stored in a secure location. According to reports, incidents like these are all too common. Many families leave their guns within reach of minors, believing that they are safe from harm. The truth is, however, that such carelessness can lead to tragic consequences. By leaving a gun within reach of a child, parents and guardians are putting their children's safety at risk. Guns that are stored in places that are not secure, such as a closet or a drawer, are a ticking time bomb waiting to cause tragedy. There is no doubt that gun ownership is a right that many Americans hold dear. However, with that right comes a significant responsibility. It is the responsibility of every gun owner to ensure that they store their guns in a secure location, where minors are not able to access them. As the case of the 12-year-old boy shows, incidents involving children discovering guns are all too real. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that all guns are kept out of the reach of minors, and that those who violate this law are held accountable. In this particular case, police are continuing to investigate the incident, and will determine if any charges will be filed. In the meantime, it is essential that all gun owners take the necessary precautions to ensure that their guns are always out of reach of minors. The takeaway from this incident is that gun ownership should be taken very seriously. It is not enough to simply own a gun; it must be stored in a secure location that is inaccessible to minors. Doing so can prevent incidents like the one involving the 12-year-old boy, and ensure that all children remain safe from harm.
