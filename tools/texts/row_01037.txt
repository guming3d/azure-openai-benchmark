chatgpt: Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen has confirmed that he is willing to extend his contract beyond 2018, but the onus is on Tottenham to make the first move in negotiations. The 30-year-old's current deal at White Hart Lane runs until the end of next season, but the club will be keen to tie him down to a longer contract due to his importance to the team, both on and off the field. Vertonghen joined Tottenham from Ajax in 2012 for a fee of around £9 million, and has established himself as one of the most dependable defenders in the Premier League. However, he has had his fair share of injury problems, and has found himself in and out of Mauricio Pochettino's side this season as a result. Speaking to the media ahead of his side's Boxing Day clash with Southampton, Vertonghen said: "My contract is expiring at the end of the season after next. I feel very good at Spurs, so we'll see what happens. It's up to the club to come to me now." The Belgian international also spoke about the role he plays within the Spurs lineup, emphasising his desire to contribute to the team's success both on and off the field. "I try to help everyone, even the new players who come in," he said. "I try to make them feel at home and I'm always there for them if they need me. It's not easy being in and out of the team, but I'm just glad to be playing my part." Despite being part of a Tottenham defence that has let in just 14 goals in the league so far this season – the best defensive record in the division – Vertonghen believes there is still room for improvement. "We're very solid at the back, but we can always improve," he said. "We've got a great squad with a lot of quality players, so I'm confident we can keep pushing on." As for his future at the club, Vertonghen admits he feels like a key part of the Tottenham setup, and is excited about the team's potential over the coming seasons. "I love playing at Tottenham and I feel like I'm part of something special here," he said. "We've got a great team spirit and we're all pulling in the same direction. We're not where we want to be just yet, but we're making progress all the time." It remains to be seen whether Vertonghen will remain at Tottenham beyond 2018, but the club's fans will surely be hoping that he does. His combination of defensive solidity and leadership qualities make him a vital player for Spurs, and his commitment to the team's cause both on and off the field will undoubtedly stand him in good stead as negotiations begin.
