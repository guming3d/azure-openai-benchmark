For drivers planning to embark on a journey across snowy terrain, this quirky looking vehicle might seem an unlikely mode of transport. But back in 1925, this Model T Ford with a crude set of bright blue skis and chains attached was at the forefront of winter travel. It was in 1913 that madcap U.S. inventor Virgil D White hit upon the idea of the 'Snow Flyer' kits, which - when attached to a Model T - transformed the popular motor car into the world's first snowmobile. Crude but effective: A Ford Model T motor car fitted with the 'Snow Flyer' kit - a forerunner of modern snowmobiles . The inventor sold his kits for around $400 almost a century ago, and now this 1925 example is expected to fetch upwards of £10,000 when it goes under the hammer in Pennsylvania, U.S., next month. At the time the kits - which consisted of skis made of metal and wood and rear-mounted chain link tracks -were particularly popular with country doctors, who used them to battle the elements when visiting patients in rural areas in winter months. Relics of winter travel: The chain links were fitted over the wheels of Model T cars . Engine power: Makers of the Snow Flyer kit claimed they enabled vehicles to travel over unbroken snow at a speed of 18mph . Today the souped-up cars are equally in demand among collectors, and there is even a Ford T snowmobile owners' club. A spokesman from the club said: 'The . snowmobile became an indispensable convenience for the person requiring . rapid, dependable transport in all kinds of weather. 'Country doctors and rural mail carriers were the largest users of this type of vehicle.' The spokesman said other customers . included public utility companies, lumber firms, travelling salesmen, . fire departments, taxi drivers, grocers, milkmen and undertakers. 'When the father of President Calvin . Coolidge died on March 18, 1926, a Model T Snowmobile led the Coolidge . funeral procession over the snow-covered hills of Vermont,' he added. Despite their popularity, demand for Virgil D White's kits faded with the introduction of the snowplough, and the inventor eventually sold his firm. The kits remained in production up until World War II. 'Makers of the attachment . claimed the ability to travel over two and a half feet of unbroken snow . at an average speed of 18 miles per hour,' the club spokesman said.

chatgpt: An incredibly rare and fully restored 1925 "Snow Flyer" snowmobile, converted from a Model T, is set to hit the auction block next month in Minnesota, USA. The snowmobile was created using "Snow Flyer" kits, which transformed a normal Model T motor car into an early, working version of the snowmobile.  This specific snowmobile was restored to its original condition by North Dakota resident, Keith Olson. Olson spent over a decade researching and collecting original parts in order to make the restoration as authentic as possible. The Snow Flyer is now estimated to fetch upwards of £10,000 at the auction. The Snow Flyer was a revolutionary invention, providing access to areas that were previously unreachable by vehicle, including remote winter communities and difficult terrains. The Model T's engine was the ideal choice, due to its reliability and affordability, making the snowmobile accessible to a wider range of people. In the 1920s, the sporting industry was booming, and snowmobiling quickly became the preferred mode of transportation for getting around during the winter months. The Snow Flyer was designed to cater to these sporting individuals, as it could easily navigate through deep snow and ice. The Snow Flyer kit included tracks and suspension designed to support the weight of the Model T, along with various other components that were specific to the cold weather environment. The conversion was fairly simple, requiring a few modifications to the original Model T, making it more affordable than purchasing a brand new vehicle. The Snow Flyer was produced by the Snow Transportation Company, founded in 1915 in Minnesota. The company's main focus was to provide a means of transportation during the winter months, and initially developed the kit to convert Ford Model Ts into snowmobiles. The Snow Transportation Company also produced various models of snowmobiles, including the popular "Aero Sled" during the boom in the 1920s. Today, the Snow Flyer is a rare find and a piece of history. The restoration of this 1925 Snow Flyer has not only preserved an important part of American history but provides the opportunity for collectors to own this unique piece of machinery. The restored Snow Flyer includes various original components, including a restored gas tank and brake components, making it an extremely coveted item. The upcoming auction will be held by VanDerBrink Auctions on July 17th, and is expected to attract collectors from around the world, eager to own this one-of-a-kind piece of history. The Snow Flyer is a testament to the ingenuity and innovation of the early 20th century, and provides a rare glimpse into a time before modern conveniences.
