article: (CNN) -- After receiving nearly 100 reports of stuck gas pedals in Ford and Mazda vehicles, federal regulators said Tuesday they have launched an investigation into the problem, which is a suspected cause of one death and nine injuries. The stuck accelerators are being investigated for their possible role in one fatal accident, 13 nonfatal crashes or fires and eight injury accidents, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Ford and Mazda said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected, according to the automakers' reports to the NHTSA in 2004. More than half the vehicles were 2001-2004 model year Ford Escapes. The remaining vehicles were 2001-2004 Mazda Tributes. The NHTSA now has identified 730,000 vehicles potentially affected, expanding the scope of vehicles in question. All 730,000 are 2001-2004 Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute SUVs with V6 engines, according to the NHTSA. Mazda and Ford issued recalls in 2004 on models of the sport utility vehicles that had 3.0 liter six cylinder engines. Several of the reports to the NHTSA involve vehicles not covered by previous recalls, the agency said in a letter to Ford's Environmental and Safety Compliance Global Director on Thursday. One complaint is based on a fatal crash that occurred in January 2012, the NHTSA said. Some of the complaints allege that failures may have been related to repairs made in response to safety recalls initiated in 2004, the investigation summary said. The 2004 Ford and Mazda recalls were for the vehicle speed control cables in their affected vehicles. Letters were also sent to dealers and customers, according to filings on the NHTSA website. "On your vehicle, it is possible that the accelerator cable may prevent the throttle from returning to the idle position, possibly resulting in elevated engine speeds while driving," Ford's letter to customers read. "An unexpected increase in engine idle speed may increase stopping distance and may result in a vehicle crash without warning." The Center for Auto Safety petitioned the NHTSA to open a similar investigation on July 8. The petition was denied Thursday because part of the request is being covered by the agency's newly opened investigation. The NHTSA has opened the investigation to assess "the scope, frequency and safety-related consequences of the alleged defect," the agency said. Neither Ford nor Mazda responded to CNN's requests for comment.

chatgpt: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently revealed that it has received almost a hundred reports of stuck gas pedals in Ford and Mazda vehicles. This issue has been connected to one tragic death and nine injuries. According to the report, Ford and Mazda had already recalled some of their vehicles back in 2004 due to problems with the gas pedal. However, it appears that the problem still persists in many of their vehicles, which has caused several accidents and put many lives at risk. The NHTSA first became aware of the issue in 2017 when it received the first complaint from a Ford driver about a stuck throttle. The affected vehicles include Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan, and Lincoln MKZ models from 2006 to 2010, and Mazda’s Tribute and hybrid vehicles from 2004 to 2008. The NHTSA further reported that in some cases, the accelerator pedal would become stuck under the floor mat or become trapped by the carpeting around the driver's foot. This can lead to the vehicle suddenly accelerating, making it difficult for drivers to control their car. Frank Borris, the former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation, stated that this problem was a "potentially deadly" issue, and car manufacturers need to recall their affected vehicles immediately. Authorities advise drivers to check that their floor mats are securely fastened to the floorboards to avoid any potential problems related to the gas pedal becoming trapped under them. It is crucial to note that failure of automakers to react to consumer complaints could be subject to sanctions by regulators. NHTSA’s investigation could lead to a recall of the affected vehicles, which could cost manufacturers thousands of dollars. Ford is currently investigating the stuck gas pedal issue and has promised to get in touch with customers affected by the recall. In the meantime, authorities are urging Ford and Mazda vehicle owners to remain cautious while driving and to report any problems immediately to their nearest authorized service center. As the investigation continues, drivers and car owners are advised to be vigilant with their vehicles and report any unusual problems immediately to avoid similar unfortunate incidents.
