South Wales Police confirmed Almahri had been detained following an international manhunt. Sammy Almahri (pictured), 44, from New York, has been wanted since the discovery of 28-year-old Nadine Aburas's body in Cardiff . Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'Almahri fled to Tanzania and we have worked closely with the local police authorities to trace and arrest him. 'This has been a fast moving and complex investigation involving law enforcement agencies from three continents and we are particularly grateful for the professional cooperation we have received from the Tanzanian police. 'Officers from South Wales Police major crime unit were sent to Tanzania to work with local police officers and were able to trace Almahri's movements over hundreds of kilometres across the country.' Miss Aburas had travelled to New York for a holiday with Almahri in the past, but it was believed to be the first time that he had met her in Britain. It is thought he flew into the UK on Boxing Day and booked a Â£135-a-night room at the Future Inn hotel for December 30 and New Year's Eve. He checked into the hotel with Miss Aburas, which is less than a mile away from her flat at 8.25pm on December 30. The pair went out for an hour before returning at about 11pm.

But police say Almahri left at 3am on New Year's Eve and hours later at around noon, the injured body of Miss Aburas was found by hotel staff. Detectives then discovered Almahri had quickly booked a flight and flew from Heathrow to Bahrain at 10.30am on New Year's Eve. He then went to Doha in Qatar before moving on to Tanzania. South Wales Police said they couldn't say where Almahri was arrested in the vast East African country - which cover 365,756 square miles - but said the wealthy New York City resident had not been hiding in the capital city of Dodoma. The spokesman said: 'As I understand it he wasn't arrested in the capital city but somewhere else in the country.' The spokesman added: 'The next step is extraditing Sammy Almahri from Tanzania and getting him back in the UK. 'We are currently applying for extradition. A decision on charges will then be made after that - we are taking this step by step.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: Sammy Almahri, 44, from New York, has been brought to justice after months on the run. Almahri was a wanted man in connection with the death of Nadine Aburas, whose body was found on New Year's Eve at the Future Inn, Cardiff Bay. The South Wales Police had been investigating the case for several months, and it was believed that Almahri had fled the country. However, police were able to track the suspect to Tanzania, where he was arrested and extradited to the UK. Nadine Aburas, 28, had been found dead on New Year's Eve at the Future Inn, Cardiff Bay. The cause of her death was not immediately apparent, and police launched an investigation. It was quickly determined that her death was suspicious and that she had been killed. The investigation led police to identify Sammy Almahri as a suspect in the case. Almahri was known to Aburas, and it was believed that the two had met while Aburas was working in London. It is unclear what led to Abura's death, but it is believed that Almahri was involved. Almahri, who is originally from Yemen, had been on the run since the investigation began. He was believed to have fled to the Middle East, and police had issued an international arrest warrant for him. However, they were able to track him down to Tanzania, where he was arrested in June. Almahri was extradited to the UK and appeared at Cardiff Magistrates' Court on 13th August. He was charged with the murder of Nadine Aburas, and his case was sent to the Crown Court for trial. The case has attracted widespread attention in the UK and the US, with many following the investigation and subsequent arrest of Almahri. It is a stark reminder of the tragic consequences of violence against women, and the importance of holding perpetrators accountable for their actions. Detective Superintendent Richard Jones, who led the investigation, spoke following Almahri's arrest, saying "Our thoughts remain with Nadine's family and friends, who have been left devastated by her death. We will continue to support them throughout the legal process as they seek justice for Nadine." The trial of Sammy Almahri is set to take place at Cardiff Crown Court later this year, and many will be watching closely to see the outcome of the case. His arrest is a victory for justice and a reminder that law enforcement will continue to pursue suspects, no matter where they may try to hide.
