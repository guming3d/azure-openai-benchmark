article: By . Becky Barrow . Midwives are threatening to go on strike for the first time in the history of the profession in a move which poses a real worry for pregnant women. The Royal College of Midwives said midwives in England are 'over-stretched, under-resourced and under-valued'. Founded in 1881, it is the first time in his 133-year history that the RCM has ever asked its members whether or not they are prepared to go on strike. The Royal College of Midwives said its members are threatening to go on strike for the first time in the history of the profession . Cathy Warwick, the chief executive, warned: 'The sense of anger and frustration among midwives is palpable. 'We knew midwives were angry about the derisory offer from the Government but this response from our members highlights just how unfairly they have been treated. 'Such an unprecedented response with such a large number willing to consider action should ring alarm bells with the Government.' Each year, nearly 700,000 babies are born in England, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics. Around 20,000 midwives were asked if they were prepared to go on strike . The threat of a potential strike will fuel fears among pregnant women, who will worry about the impact of a strike on their chance of a safe delivery. The dispute was sparked by an annual pay offer of up to one per cent made to midwives in April this year, which they dismissed as 'derisory.' A typical midwife, who works full-time and has five years' experience, is paid £29,759, but many work part-time and earn a lower salary. For a new midwife who works outside London, the starting salary is around £21,500, according to the RCM. Around 20,000 midwives were asked if they were prepared to go on strike, with nearly half responding to the unprecedented ballot. Of those who did respond, two-thirds said they were prepared to take strike action if the bitter dispute continues. Ms Warwick insisted midwives in England 'will always think of the woman and her baby first.' An emergency meeting will take place in the next few weeks to decide whether or not to formally ballot midwives about staging a strike, which could take place within months. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'We are disappointed that unions are considering industrial action. 'There is still time for the unions to put patients first and accept our offer to come back to the negotiating table.'

chatgpt: Midwives in England are feeling 'over-stretched', according to a recent survey from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). The survey, which is the first of its kind, asked members about their willingness to strike, and the results have sparked concerns about the availability of maternity care in the country. The RCM survey found that 91% of midwives and maternity support workers would consider striking if they were asked to do so. Further, 97% of respondents said that they were under-staffed, and 96% claimed that they had been asked to work beyond their contracted hours. These findings support the RCM's call for better funding for midwives and better working conditions for women who work in the field. The news has already sparked fears among pregnant women in England. The possibility of midwives striking means that there could be a shortage of care providers available to help pregnant women deliver their babies. This is a worrying prospect for many women who are already anxious about the birthing process. The RCM's general secretary, Gill Walton, has called for additional funding to be made available to support midwives and their work. She says that the shortage of midwives is a direct result of the lack of government funding for maternity services, and that it is essential that the needs of expectant mothers are met. Walton says: "The government needs to take action now to ensure that there are enough midwives to keep maternity services running smoothly. Women deserve to have high-quality care during one of the most important times of their lives, and we owe it to them to provide that care." The RCM's survey findings come at a time when the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is already facing significant staff shortages. Politicians and healthcare professionals have called for the government to take action to address these shortages, but so far, no clear plan has been put in place. The threat of a midwife strike will only exacerbate concerns about the future of the NHS. The strain on the service is already evident, with long wait times and an increasing number of cancelled surgeries. The RCM is calling for immediate action to be taken to address these issues, and restore confidence in the NHS. Overall, the concerns highlighted in the RCM survey are reflective of a broader demand for better funding and more support for healthcare workers. The healthcare sector is facing significant challenges, and it is essential that the government takes action to provide the resources needed to ensure that health services can continue to operate effectively. For now, expectant mothers in England will be watching closely to see what steps the government takes to address the shortage of midwives, and ensure that there is enough care available for those who need it.
