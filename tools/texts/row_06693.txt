article: (CNN) -- It's a cautionary tale: Capping off a 50-day bender with a transcontinental flight may cause confusion. A Ukrainian man returning from a trip during which he "got drunk and stayed drunk for the entire 50 days," according to court papers, faces federal charges after attempting to open an emergency exit moments after his flight landed. Details of the commotion are contained in a federal complaint filed by the U.S. attorney in Utah. The complaint says that as the plane was descending, Anatoliy N. Baranovich, 46, woke and started yelling in Russian that the wing of the aircraft was on fire. Passengers wrestled Baranovich when he tried to open the emergency exit shortly after landing, documents say. Later, Baranovich told investigators through an interpreter that he thought the plane's wing was on fire and was close to scraping the ground. The incident occurred Monday night aboard Delta Flight 1215 -- a Boeing 757 -- traveling from Boston to Salt Lake City. Baranovich lives in Portland, Oregon, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Read the FBI complaint against Baranovich (PDF) Baranovich's rough homecoming came after a trip to visit family in Ukraine, where he was planning to start building a house. But those building plans fell through. According to the complaint, he also "stated that he got drunk and stayed drunk for the entire 50 days" of his visit. The drinking continued while traveling back to the United States, but Baranovich "could not specify when, how much or where he consumed the alcohol." When the 757 touched down, Baranovich jumped out of his seat and ran to the back of the aircraft, where he tried to open an emergency exit, according to the complaint. A flight attendant ordered Baranovich to stop, but he continued to open the door, breaking the door and an inflatable slide and damaging the fuselage, the court papers say. Several passengers jumped out of their seats, pinning Baranovich against a galley wall, the complaint says. He attempted to open the exit on the other side of the plane, stopping only when a former police officer forced him to the floor. The ex-cop searched Baranovich's fanny pack, finding his Ukraine passport and U.S. visa. Baranovich faces charges of damaging and disabling an aircraft and interference with a flight crew. Each charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. "We do not believe there is a connection to terrorism," FBI spokeswoman Deborah Bertram said. Baranovich appeared in court Wednesday and was assigned counsel. He remained in custody Wednesday. Delta Air Lines is in contact with other passengers, a spokesman said. "We continue to cooperate with the FBI, which is leading the followup." Grape expectations: Making wine taste good at 35,000 feet .

chatgpt: On Monday, a Ukrainian man on a Delta 757 flight caused a panic among passengers when he attempted to open the emergency exit mid-flight. The man claimed he believed the plane's wing was on fire, and the incident has once again raised questions about the dangers of flying while under the influence of alcohol. According to a complaint filed by the FBI, the incident occurred on Delta Flight 1225, which was en route from Boston to Salt Lake City. The man in question, identified as 34-year-old Anton Donner, had been drinking heavily for 50 days, according to authorities. Passengers on the flight reported that Donner began acting erratically shortly after takeoff. He stood up from his seat and began waving his arms around, causing alarm among nearby passengers. When flight attendants attempted to calm him down and get him back in his seat, he became increasingly agitated. Donner then turned his attention to the emergency exit, attempting to open it as the plane was flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet. When he was unable to open the door, he began banging on it and shouting that the plane was on fire. Several passengers restrained Donner and managed to subdue him until the plane landed safely in Salt Lake City. Once on the ground, Donner was taken into custody by local law enforcement and charged with interfering with a flight crew, a federal offense. The incident has once again raised concerns about the hazards of flying while intoxicated. While airports and airlines have policies against allowing visibly intoxicated passengers to board flights, it's often difficult to determine when someone has been drinking beforehand. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, alcohol is a contributing factor in a significant number of aviation accidents. In recent years, there have been several high-profile incidents involving intoxicated passengers causing disruptions on flights, highlighting the need for more stringent policies and enforcement. In addition to alcohol, many airlines and experts are also concerned about the use of prescription and recreational drugs on flights. While some medications are allowed under certain conditions, others can cause dangerous interactions with altitude and cabin pressure. As for Anton Donner, he remains in custody pending court hearings, which are scheduled to take place in the coming weeks. The incident has left many passengers shaken but grateful for the brave actions of those who intervened to prevent a potential disaster. Delta released a statement in response to the incident, stating that the safety of its passengers and crew is its top priority. The airline also thanked the flight attendants and passengers who took quick action to ensure a safe outcome for all involved. As air travel continues to increase in popularity, it's crucial that airlines and airports take steps to ensure the safety of their passengers. From comprehensive security screenings to strict policies regarding alcohol and drugs, these measures are essential to keeping travelers safe and secure in the skies.
