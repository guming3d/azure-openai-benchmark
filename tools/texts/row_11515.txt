Four people were reportedly killed in the explosion which happened just after Friday prayers. Islamist sect Boko Haram - which killed 42 with a series of Christmas Day bombs outside churches - has been blamed. The city is known to be its stronghold. Blast: A 'major' blast has rocked an area around a mosque in the restive northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri . One resident said: 'There was a loud blast near the mosque just after the Friday prayers as people were trooping out of the mosque. 'Everybody scampered to safety, leading to a stampede.' Army spokesman Brigadier General Isa initially blamed Boko Haram for the attack, but it is not yet known if and why it would attack a mosque. Boko Haram is suspected of having links to Al Qaeda and is believed to want to impose Islamic Sharia law in Nigeria. Nigeria's 160 million people are roughly divided between Muslims and Christians, who mostly live side by side in peace. Boko Haram claimed three bomb attacks on churches on Christmas Sunday, including one that killed 27 worshippers in a Catholic church just outside the capital Abuja, and one in Jos without fatal victims. A car burns outside St Theresa Catholic Church at Suleja, Neigeria, after an explosion on Christmas Day. Five bombs exploded that day at churches in the country . The coordinated strikes by the northern-based Islamist group, whose name translates as Western Education Is Sinful in the Hausa language of the region, appeared aimed at prising open Nigeria's religious faultline in a direct challenge to the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner. 'Boko Haram is seeking to provoke retaliatory attacks on Muslims in predominantly Christian parts of the country,' said former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell. The attacks have led local Muslims to be wary of a possible Christian backlash. 'We are just beginning to live in peace, so we hope our Christian brothers can help us keep that peace,' said Mohammed Kabir, who like many Nigerian Muslims said he resented being associated with violent extremism.

chatgpt: The militant Islamist group Boko Haram has again been blamed for a deadly attack in the city of Maiduguri, known to be one of the sect's strongholds. According to reports, the militants attacked a crowded market in the city, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens more. The attack, which took place on Saturday evening, saw the militants detonate a bomb before opening fire on shoppers in the market. Eyewitnesses reported chaos and panic as people scrambled to get away from the scene of the attack. Boko Haram has been active in the area for several years, with Maiduguri widely considered to be one of the group's strongholds. The group has been responsible for numerous attacks in the city in recent years, including a similar attack on a market in 2015. The Nigerian military has been engaged in a sustained campaign against Boko Haram, with some success in pushing the group back in certain areas. However, the group remains a potent threat in many parts of the country, with the ability to launch devastating attacks on civilians and military targets alike. The latest attack has been condemned by the Nigerian government, with officials pledging to step up efforts to combat the group. Speaking to reporters, Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola described the attack as "callous and wicked", and vowed to bring those responsible to justice. The attack comes at a time of heightened tension in Nigeria, with security forces on high alert following a series of attacks on military and police facilities in northern regions of the country. Boko Haram is widely believed to be behind these attacks, and the group has been linked to other extremist groups across Africa, including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Islamic State West Africa Province. The Nigerian government has faced criticism for its handling of the Boko Haram insurgency, with some accusing officials of not doing enough to tackle the group. However, the government has maintained that it is committed to defeating Boko Haram and other extremist groups operating in the country. Despite the challenges, there have been some signs of progress in recent years. In 2018, the Nigerian military launched Operation Last Hold, a major offensive aimed at clearing Boko Haram fighters from their remaining strongholds in the northeast of the country. While the operation was not without its challenges, it was seen as a significant step forward in the fight against the group. However, the latest attack in Maiduguri is a reminder that Boko Haram remains a serious threat to security in Nigeria and the wider region. With the group showing no signs of relenting in its campaign of violence, the Nigerian government and its military will need to remain vigilant if they hope to defeat this deadly foe.
