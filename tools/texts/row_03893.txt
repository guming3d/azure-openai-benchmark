article: Johannesburg (CNN) -- A novel skin graft treatment appears to be working for a 3-year-old South African girl burned over 80% of her body in January, a spokeswoman for her family said Tuesday. A medical team led by reconstructive surgeon Ridwan Mia spent four hours Monday night removing wrappings from Isabella "Pippi" Kruger's body, according to spokeswoman Ilze Rabie. They found that 90% of the skin graft -- cloned in a U.S. laboratory and then rushed to South Africa last week -- appears to be taking, she said. The little girl, who was burned in a New Year's Eve barbecuing accident at home, remains sedated, said Rabie, who is representing the family and Genzyme, the Boston company that produced the cloned skin graft that's being used to treat her. The plan is to gradually wake Pippi and remove her from a ventilator by Thursday, Rabie said. While complications and other setbacks remain a possibility, Rabie said Pippi could be well enough to begin physical therapy and rehabilitation by next week. Pippi's ordeal began on New Year's Eve when she was playing outside as her father, Erwin Kruger, prepared a barbeque using a highly flammable liquid gel. As he lit the gel, its container exploded and covered Pippi's small body. She screamed as her skin burned and "bubbled," according to her mother, Anice Kruger. The toddler suffered third-degree burns on 80% of her body. Afterward, she was struck with four cardiac arrests, kidney failures, collapsed lungs and multiple infections. Her critical condition eventually stabilized under the care of Mia and others at the Netcare Garden City Hospital in Johannesburg. But the Krugers were uncomfortable with their options for healing her skin: temporarily using skin from a cadaver or from a pig, or taking her small portion of undamaged skin and grafting it elsewhere. "Please don't take the perfect skin, just give me a week to find something else," Anice Kruger begged of Mia. After days on the Internet and hours reaching out to reconstructive specialists in the United States, Pippi's mother discovered Genzyme, whose specialty is growing layers of human skin by cloning a 2-square-centimeter sample from a patient. Doctors in the United States performed the process -- called a cultured epidermal autograft -- more than 100 times in last year, according to Genzyme. However, because the new skin must be administered within 24 hours of leaving the lab, the procedure hasn't been attempted much farther away. It had never before been attempted in South Africa. The procedure, which is being covered by local medical coverage and donations, cost $82,000. Georgia woman with flesh-eating bacteria gets skin graft .

chatgpt: Doctors in South Africa are closely monitoring the progress of 3-year-old Isabella "Pippi" Kruger, who received a first-of-its-kind skin graft to treat severe burns covering 80% of her body. According to a spokeswoman, the graft appears to be taking, and doctors hope to wake the young girl by Thursday. Isabella suffered third-degree burns in a suspected gas explosion at her home in Johannesburg last month. The extent of her injuries left doctors with little hope for her survival. However, a team of specialists from the Netcare Milpark Hospital and the University of Witwatersrand successfully performed a cutting-edge skin graft utilizing Isabella's own cells for regeneration. The spokeswoman reported that complications are still possible, but Isabella's progress is cause for cautious optimism. If her vital signs remain stable, doctors may consider physical therapy in the coming week to start retracing her recovery process. The procedure, performed under general anesthesia, involved removing a small sample of Isabella's skin and using it to grow skin cells in a laboratory. This novel approach is often used for smaller areas of burns, but this was the first time it has been used for a case as extensive as Isabella's. The cultivated cells were then used to generate layers of skin that were carefully transplanted onto the affected areas. The success of this procedure could pave the way for future burn victims to receive treatments that may have once seemed impossible. Dr. Ridwan Mia, the lead surgeon on Isabella's case, notes that it represents a significant advancement in the field of burn care. He hopes that this approach could reduce the number of skin grafts required to treat severe burns in the future. It may also eliminate the need for donor skin or synthetic skin substitutes, and reduce the risk of rejection. Isabella's family and the team of doctors caring for her at Netcare Milpark Hospital expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support and prayers they have received as they focus on Isabella's recovery. In a statement, Netcare CEO Dr. Richard Friedland commended the team of doctors for their innovative medical care, stating that they have once again demonstrated the advanced level of medical expertise that South Africa has to offer. The success of this novel skin graft treatment brings hope for those who suffer severe burns, and may lead to new advancements in the way burn patients are treated worldwide. The medical field continues to redefine what is possible, and this groundbreaking procedure could represent a turning point for burn victims everywhere.
