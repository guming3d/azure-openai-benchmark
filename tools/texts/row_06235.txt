article: (CNN)  -- The United States and other Western powers have "exacerbated Somalia's downward spiral" and must revise their policies in the east African country, a Human Rights Watch report has warned. Recent image of Islamist fighters at a camp in the northern outskirts of Mogadishu . The report, released Monday, blames the policies under President George W. Bush for "breeding the very extremism that it is supposed to defeat." "The new administration of U.S. President Barack Obama should urgently review U.S. policy in Somalia and the broader Horn of Africa and break with the failed approach of his predecessor," the report said. It also cites key European governments for failing "to address the human rights dimensions of the crisis, with many officials hoping that somehow unfettered support to abusive TFG (Somali transitional government) forces will improve stability." Somalia's weak transitional government, backed by Ethiopian forces, continues to battle Islamic militias with the fighting concentrated in the capital, Mogadishu. Ethiopian forces have not withdrawn from the country, as required under a recent cease-fire agreement. Ethiopia invaded Somalia two years ago and successfully routed the Islamic militia that seized control of the capital. The HRW report states that the United States "directly backed Ethiopia's intervention." Since the 2006 overthrow of the Islamic Courts Union, Somalia has suffered from "unconstrained warfare and violent rights abuses" by all warring parties. "All sides have used indiscriminate force as a matter of routine, and in 2008 violence has taken on a new dimension with the targeted murders of aid workers and civil society activists," the report states. "The human rights and humanitarian catastrophe facing Somalia today threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of Somalis on a scale not witnessed since the early 1990s." Heavy fighting in Mogadishu and across Somalia has driven more than a million people from their homes. The lawlessness has also spilled onto the seas off the Horn of Africa, where international vessels are routinely hijacked by suspected Somali pirates who demand large ransoms. Human Rights Watch offers specific recommendations to the Somali and Ethiopian governments, the main militias, and the international community to address the human rights abuses. It calls on the West to "insist upon an end to the impunity that has fueled the worst abuses - and the right place to start is by moving the U.N. Security Council to establish a Commission of Inquiry to document abuses and lay the groundwork for accountability." Journalist Abdinasir Mohamed Guled contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A report released on Tuesday has blamed Bush-era policies for "breeding the very extremism that it is supposed to defeat." The report, compiled by the London-based human rights group Amnesty International, says that the US's so-called "war on terror" contributed to an increase in violent extremist groups in countries like Somalia, where the Ethiopian-backed transitional government is currently battling Islamic militias. Somalia has been wracked by conflict for more than two decades, but the recent fighting between government forces and Islamic militias has driven more than a million people from their homes. The report asserts that European governments have failed to address the "human rights dimensions of the crisis" and that the policies of the Bush administration have only worsened the situation. "The use of torture and secret detention has eroded human rights and international law, while the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay has become a symbol of the worst excesses of US military power," said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International. "As a result, extremist groups have been able to recruit new members, fueling ongoing conflicts such as the one in Somalia." The report also criticizes European governments for providing military and logistical support to the Ethiopian-backed government, which is widely seen as a "proxy army" for the US. "The international community has failed to address the root causes of the conflict in Somalia," said Shetty. "Instead, it has taken a short-term, military-focused approach that has only made things worse." The report comes as fighting between government forces and Islamist militias rages on in Somalia. The country has been in turmoil since the overthrow of dictator Siad Barre in 1991, but the situation has escalated dramatically in recent years. The Ethiopian-backed government has been accused of human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings, while the Islamist militias have been accused of carrying out suicide bombings and other attacks in cities across the region. Amnesty International's report comes amid growing concern about the situation in Somalia. The United Nations has warned that the conflict has already led to a "humanitarian catastrophe," with more than a million people displaced from their homes and millions more facing starvation and disease. Despite the grim outlook, Amnesty International says that there is still hope for Somalia. "The international community needs to change its approach and focus on addressing the root causes of the crisis," said Shetty. "This means working to promote human rights, justice, and accountability, and providing support for democratic institutions and civil society groups. Only then can we hope to build a stable and peaceful future for Somalia."
