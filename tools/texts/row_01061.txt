article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Army ground commanders in Afghanistan say they need help, fast. That's not a request for more troops, but a request from commanders who say the current camouflage uniform is not blending well in the diverse countryside. U.S. Army commanders in Afghanistan say the current uniform does not blend well in the countryside. In response, the Army later this month will field-test two new camouflage color schemes and patterns on about 1,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, where the terrain is extremely varied. Commanders have had problems there because of the numerous changes in environments a soldier can move in and out of in a short period of time -- from woodland to desert to alpine, and to rocky and snowy mountain tops. The current uniform, known as the Army Combat Uniform or ACU, has lighter shades of green and tan, which some commanders have complained does not blend well if soldiers need to stay motionless on a mission, as snipers or reconnaissance troops must. The effort by the Army was recently accelerated, according to Army officials, after U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, told the Army he had a number of complaints from soldiers in Afghanistan who said the current camouflage pattern was not effective in the mountainous regions. Two yet-to-be-identified battalions -- a battalion has about 500 troops -- will test the two patterns, with initial results being turned into Army researchers by the end of October. While deployed, all 1,000 soldiers will have their regularly issued ACUs. In addition, one battalion will also get one of the new camouflage uniforms with a test pattern known as "MultiCam." The pattern is made up of numerous blobs of white, brown, tan, black and greens for a more woodland look, and is already being worn by snipers and special operations forces. The other brigade will test a similar pattern to the ACU, called the Universal Cammo Pattern-Delta or "UCP-Delta." While the pattern is the same, a series of "digitized" blocks of green and tan, the test uniform adds what he Army calls "coyote brown" and a slight color darkening all around to the greens and tans. The look is also designed to blend in the woods. Both battalions will be based in eastern Afghanistan where the terrain is the most rugged and diverse, Army officials said. The Army hopes to have the field input and a decision on what pattern is best by the end of January 2010 and the fielding of the new uniform as early as June 2010. Troops will still keep the existing ACU, and commanders will be able to decide mission by mission what the soldiers should wear, according to Army officials. The testing is part of the Army's long-term development of a permanent alternative to the current ACU, according to Army officials.

chatgpt: In an effort to improve operational effectiveness, the United States Army is set to field-test two new camouflage patterns in Afghanistan this month. The move comes after commanders raised concerns about the current uniform not blending well in the countryside. The Army hopes to have a decision on a new pattern by the end of January 2010. The current camouflage pattern used by the Army is known as the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP). The pattern features a pixelated design of colors such as gray, green, and beige, which is meant to be effective in a variety of environments, including woodland, desert, and urban areas. However, the UCP has been criticized for being too light in color and not blending well in the rugged terrain of Afghanistan. To address these concerns, the Army has developed two new patterns: the Desert Terrain Pattern and the Woodland Terrain Pattern. The Desert Terrain Pattern features shades of tan, brown, and green, while the Woodland Terrain Pattern includes shades of green and brown. According to Colonel Bill Cole, the project manager for Soldier Protection and Individual Equipment at the Army's Program Executive Office Soldier, the two new patterns are designed to provide better camouflage for soldiers serving in Afghanistan. "These patterns are specifically tailored to the environment in Afghanistan, and we hope they will provide our soldiers with better protection and improved capability," Cole said. The field tests will involve approximately 900 soldiers who will be given the opportunity to wear both the UCP and the two new patterns while they are out on patrol. The soldiers will then provide feedback on the effectiveness of each of the patterns. The feedback received will be used to determine which pattern will ultimately be adopted. The decision to field-test the two new patterns in Afghanistan is part of a broader effort by the Army to improve the effectiveness of its soldiers on the ground. The Army has recognized that the terrain in Afghanistan presents unique challenges for soldiers and that the standard issue uniform may not provide the necessary level of protection. As a result, the Army has been working to develop new uniforms and equipment that are better suited for the environment in Afghanistan. The decision to adopt a new camouflage pattern will have significant implications for the Army as a whole. The uniform is a critical component of a soldier's equipment, and it can have a significant impact on their safety and effectiveness. By selecting a new pattern that provides better camouflage in the rugged terrain of Afghanistan, the Army hopes to improve the safety and effectiveness of its soldiers on the ground. The field tests are set to begin in the coming weeks, and the Army hopes to have a decision on a new pattern by the end of January 2010. If the tests prove successful, the Army will move forward with implementing the new pattern across all of its units. This will represent a significant step forward in the Army's efforts to provide better equipment and support to the soldiers serving in Afghanistan.
