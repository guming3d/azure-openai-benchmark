"To have been selected to represent Team South Africa at the London 2012 Olympic Games in the individual 400-meters and the 4x400-meter relay is a real honor, and I am so pleased that years of hard work, determination and sacrifice have all come together," he said last month.

chatgpt: South African Paralympian runner Oscar Pistorius made history on Sunday, becoming the first Paralympian to compete in the able-bodied Olympic games. Pistorius, who had both legs amputated when he was just 11 months old, competed in both the 400-meter race and the 4x400-meter relay. Despite his disability, Pistorius has become a renowned athlete, winning six gold medals at the Paralympic games and breaking multiple world records. However, his journey to the Olympics has not been without controversy. In 2007, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) introduced a new rule that prohibited athletes with prosthetic limbs from competing in international competitions. Pistorius challenged the ruling, arguing that his prosthetics did not give him a competitive advantage. After a lengthy legal battle, Pistorius was cleared to compete in 2008. On Sunday, Pistorius qualified for the semifinals of the 400 meters, clocking in at 45.44 seconds. He was the second runner in his heat, finishing just behind the Dominican Republic's Luguel√≠n Santos. Pistorius spoke to reporters about his experience at the Olympics, saying that it was an "unbelievable" feeling to compete among the world's best athletes. He also expressed his gratitude for the support that he had received from fans and fellow athletes. "I've had so many messages of support from people around the world, and it has been really overwhelming," Pistorius said. "I just want to thank everyone who has believed in me and supported me." Pistorius will compete in the semifinals of the 400 meters on Monday. He will also be a part of South Africa's team in the 4x400-meter relay, which will take place on Friday. Pistorius' journey to the Olympics serves as an inspiration to individuals with disabilities around the world. His perseverance and determination to overcome adversity has made him a role model for many, and his success on the track serves as a testament to the power of hard work and dedication.
