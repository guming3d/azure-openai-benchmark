article: (CNN) -- Four continents, 16 cities, 192 "lost" wallets. That's the basic formula for a recent sticky fingers experiment by Reader's Digest. Reporters from the magazine dropped wallets in parks, on sidewalks and near shopping malls in international cities from New York to Mumbai and waited to see how people would respond. Each wallet contained the equivalent of $50, a cell phone number, business cards, coupons and a family photo. Bottom line? Nearly half -- 47% -- of the wallets were returned. "If you find money, you can't assume it belongs to a rich man," said Ursula Smist, who returned one of the five wallets recovered in London. "It might be the last bit of money a mother has to feed her family," said Smist, who is originally from Poland. The other seven wallets dropped in London remain at large. Can your cell phone bring down a plane? Of the 102 wallets subjected to the old "finders keepers" rule, one was pocketed by a male Zurich tram driver whose employer runs the city's lost and found office. In Warsaw, five of 12 wallets were returned while the other seven were pocketed by women. The magazine concluded that gender and age are unpredictable when it comes to sussing out honesty. "The most surprising discovery for the team at Reader's Digest is that honesty is not a relative," said Raimo Moysa, editor-in-chief of Reader's Digest International Magazines. "For all the people who returned wallets, it was the only way to act in such a situation." " 'It is something you do naturally,' said 30-year-old optician's assistant in Prague when we asked about why she returned the wallet. A 73-year-old grandmother in Rio de Janeiro expressed the same sentiment by saying simply: 'Because it is not mine,' " Moysa wrote in an e-mail response.

chatgpt: Reader's Digest set out to conduct a social experiment by dropping wallets in 16 major cities across the United States to test how honest people were. The results are in, and nearly half of the wallets were returned to their owners. It's a reassuring sign that many people are still willing to do the right thing. The wallets contained clues to help identify the owners and were left in a variety of places such as sidewalks, park benches and shopping centers. The experiment aimed to determine if people would go out of their way to return the lost wallets or if the temptation to keep the cash inside would be too great to resist. The results were mixed across the different cities. In Seattle, 9 out of 12 wallets were returned, followed by 8 out of 12 in Minneapolis. On the other hand, in Newark, only one out of 12 wallets was returned, while Las Vegas came last with just two out of 12 returned. The average result of the experiment was that 46% of wallets were returned. While this may seem like a low number, it's actually quite encouraging considering the wallets could easily have been kept by the person who found them. According to experts, the results of the experiment reflect a mix of factors such as the cultural norms of each city, the organization of the community and the individual's own sense of honesty and integrity. This social experiment shows that even though we live in a world that can be selfish and competitive, many people are still willing to do the right thing. While itâ€™s common to hear about negative news of theft or corruption, these results demonstrate that a significant percentage of people still believe in upholding moral standards. It's important to recognize the cities where the most wallet returns occurred, including Seattle and Minneapolis, where the majority of wallets were returned, and to applaud the honesty of the individuals who chose to do the right thing. At the same time, it's also worthwhile to reflect on the cities where the least amount of wallets were returned, such as Newark and Las Vegas. It's important for these cities to implement measures to increase their sense of community and honest values. Overall, the Reader's Digest experiment shows that while there may be some differences in response rates across different cities, the majority of people still believe in doing the right thing.
