Acres: Google is expanding its presence in Los Angeles with the $120 million purchase of a dozen acres of vacant land in the Playa Vista area on the city's west side . Google: The parcel Google purchased is zoned for nearly 900,000 square feet of commercial space that could house offices or studios holding as many as 6,000 workers . City Councilman Mike Bonin, who represents the area, said the purchase 'brands Playa Vista as the tech and innovation capital of Los Angeles.' The Mountain View-based tech giant wouldn't detail its plans for the properties. Last year Microsoft opened a 20,000-square-foot space in Playa Vista, a neighborhood near major freeways, several neighborhoods and Los Angeles International Airport. Facebook has operations nearby, as do other major media companies and ad agencies. Three years ago, Google opened a campus in Venice, where it leased 100,000 square feet in three buildings for about 600 employees. One of those buildings is the famous Binoculars Building, a three-story office on Main Street designed by architect Frank Gehry.

A Google spokeswoman said the company, which typically likes to expand near its existing properties, will continue to rent the 69,000-square-foot Binoculars Building. Google views the Playa Vista land purchase as a long-term investment and has no particular design in mind for the site, she told the Times. Google also rents a 41,000-square-foot video production facility for subsidiary YouTube in a renovated former Hughes building in Playa Vista. Google already has bought or rented about 6.2 million square feet of space this year in the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing its total there to 15 million square feet, according to real estate brokerage statistics cited by the Times.

chatgpt: Tech giant Google has announced its purchase of a 12-acre parcel of land in Los Angeles for a staggering $120 million. The expansive plot, which is located next to the historic hangar where aviation pioneer Howard Hughes built his famous Spruce Goose airplane, is expected to host up to 6,000 workers upon completion. According to reports, the parcel is zoned for almost 900,000 square feet of commercial space that could be utilized for a range of purposes, including office space or production studios. The property could be part of Google's expansion plans as it seeks to accommodate its growing workforce. This latest acquisition confirms Google's continued expansion efforts in the Los Angeles area. Its current Los Angeles office is located in Venice and houses the company's YouTube division. This new property is located near the border of Playa Vista, which is fast becoming a hub for technology and media companies. Playa Vista is already home to companies such as Facebook, Sony Pictures, and the streaming service Hulu. The purchase of this property could further cement Google's position as a major player in the tech industry. Google has been actively expanding its real estate holdings in recent years, with a focus on building out its workforce and research capabilities. The announcement comes amidst a broader trend of tech companies expanding into new markets in search of talent and resources. In particular, Los Angeles has become an attractive destination for tech and media companies looking to tap into the city's vibrant entertainment industry. In addition to its acquisition of this new property, Google has also recently leased office space in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood. Google's continued expansion into new markets is a testament to the company's desire to stay at the forefront of the tech and innovation industries. As Google continues to deepen its roots in Los Angeles and other key areas, it will be interesting to see how the company's real estate strategy evolves. With this latest acquisition, Google has demonstrated that it is willing to make bold moves to secure its place as a leader in the tech industry.
