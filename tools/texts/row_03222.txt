Mr Diver said he was 'delighted' at the lack of interest in the property and that he believed the sale will secure the jobs of its 50 staff. He told the Irish Independent: 'It's just a total adrenalin rush. I can't believe it. It's been a long, long road but we have made it.'

Since the crash of the Celtic-Tiger economy in 2007-2008, average house prices have fallen by more than 60 per cent with commercial properties falling at a similar rate. Mr Diver believes the hotel's prime location off the Rosnowlagh beach will remain a lure for visitors. The beach has played host to the European Surfing Championship on several occasions.

chatgpt: Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's childhood holiday destination is set to hit the market for a knock-down price. The property, located in Fethard-on-Sea, County Wexford, is expected to be listed for €500,000, significantly less than its €700,000 estimated value. The price reduction reflects the scale of the Irish property collapse that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Blair spent several summer holidays at the property as a child, a time period he has referred to as "magical" and which has left him with fond memories of the area. The stunning coastal county is a favourite among tourists for its long stretches of sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters. Set on 1.4 acres of private land, the property features a well-maintained garden with mature trees and a variety of shrubs. The house itself has retained much of its original charm, with its whitewashed walls, thatched roof, and high ceilings. With nine rooms, including four bedrooms and three reception rooms, the house offers spacious living and plenty of character. While the property has not undergone any significant renovation in recent years, it does feature central heating and double-glazed windows, making it a comfortable living space during colder months. The Irish property market experienced a significant downturn in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. As banks struggled with unsustainable levels of debt, many homeowners found themselves unable to pay their mortgages. This led to a wave of foreclosures, resulting in many properties being listed for sale at a fraction of their original price. Despite a moderate recovery in the years since, the property market remains unstable, making this property's listing price an attractive deal for anyone looking to purchase a holiday home. Although the property's link to Tony Blair will likely generate interest among potential buyers, it's the location and price that will undoubtedly draw people in. With its stunning coastal views, spacious living quarters, and serene surroundings, this property is sure to appeal to anyone looking for a peaceful retreat away from the hustle and bustle of city life.
