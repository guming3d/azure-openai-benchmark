article: Baghdad (CNN) -- The commemoration of Ashura, arguably the holiest day on the Shiite Muslim calendar, passed without significant violence in Iraq Sunday. The peace was a marked contrast to the last eight years in which hundreds of people died in sectarian attacks. The period commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D.. His death was one of the events that helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. Iraqi troops and police were deployed in the streets of Baghdad and Karbala, a holy Shiite city where 2 million Shiite pilgrims from across Iraq converged for the festival over the weekend. No attacks against Shiite pilgrims were reported in Baghdad and Karbala in the last several days, police officials in both cities told CNN. Abut 30,000 security members from the army and police were on duty in and around Karbala, establishing four rings of security around the holy shrine of Imam Hussein. More than 200 female security workers were placed at checkpoints to search women passing through, Karbala police said. Pilgrims chanted, beat their breasts in penance, cut themselves with daggers or swords and whipped themselves in synchronized movements from Saturday through Sunday morning. Most people in Iraq are Shiites, and the commemoration of Ashura was almost banned under Saddam Hussein, a Sunni. The first public Ashura demonstrations in Karbala after his fall, in 2004, came under attack by Sunni extremists. In 2005 nearly a thousand Shiite pilgrims died in a stampede over a Baghdad bridge triggered by a rumor that a suicide bomber was among them. Shiites gained the upper hand politically after Hussein was overthrown by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Sunnis felt disenfranchised amid that political backdrop, and many backed insurgent actions against the government. As a result, Sunni-Shiite violence exploded in the early 2000s. While full-blown sectarian violence had ebbed by the end of the Iraq War, Sunni extremists continued to launch attacks against Shiite pilgrims over the years. Paris Hilton stirs up a storm in Mecca .

chatgpt: The city of Baghdad has been transformed into a peaceful place in the last several days, as Shiite pilgrims have been able to carry out their activities without any disturbances. Police officials report no attacks have been reported during this period, which is a marked contrast to the last eight years of Ashura attacks. Ashura is an Islamic holiday that marks the martyrdom of Hussein, a key figure in the religion and the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. The day is observed by Shia Muslims worldwide, and one of the most important religious events in Iraq. However, in recent years, the day has been marred by violence as extremist groups have targeted Shiite pilgrims who gather in significant numbers to attend the celebrations. In 2005, during the Ashura holiday, nearly a thousand pilgrims lost their lives in a tragic stampede that occurred on a bridge in Baghdad. The incident was one of the deadliest since the beginning of the Iraq war and a stark reminder of the dangers faced by those attending the events. However, this year's Ashura celebrations have been relatively peaceful, with no reports of attacks against those marking the holiday. Given the volatile security situation in Iraq, this marks a significant achievement for the security forces and the government. The Iraqi government has reportedly stepped up security in the capital and other cities to ensure that the religious observances of Ashura pass without any incidents. The response appears to have been effective, as the situation on the ground has remained peaceful despite fears of renewed sectarian violence. Shiite pilgrims were able to perform their religious rituals and mark the occasion without fear of violence, and this is a significant development for the country as a whole. However, the security situation remains fragile, and the government must continue to work diligently to ensure that the country remains safe and secure for all its citizens. In conclusion, the relative peace observed during the recent Ashura celebrations is a welcome relief to the events of the past eight years. While security forces are undoubtedly to thank for this achievement, the country's leadership must work to maintain this peaceful atmosphere in the future. As Iraq continues to struggle with political and security concerns, moments like these demonstrate that there is still hope for a brighter future.
