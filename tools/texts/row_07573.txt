article: Sugar is a poison and its sale should be as tightly regulated as cigarettes and alcohol, scientists say. They warn that sugary foods and drinks are responsible for illnesses including obesity, heart disease, cancer and liver problems. And they claim it contributes to 35million deaths a year worldwide and is so dangerous it should be controlled through taxation and legislation. Sugar is 'toxic' beyond its calories, warn scientists. They suggest a sales tax licensing requirements on vending machines . In an article entitled The Toxic Truth . About Sugar, published in the journal  Nature, the scientists add: ‘A . little is not a problem but a lot kills – slowly.’ The U.S. authors warn obesity is now a . bigger problem than malnourishment across the world, and that sugar not . only makes people fat but also changes the body’s metabolism, raises . blood pressure, throws hormones off balance and harms the liver. The damage done mirrors the effects of . drinking too much alcohol – which the scientists point out is made from . distilling sugar. The authors, led by Robert Lustig, a . childhood obesity expert at California University, say that, like . alcohol, sugar is widely available, toxic, easily abused and harmful to . society. They say teaching children about diet . and exercise is unlikely to be effective and instead the answer lies in . taxes and restricting availability. The study recommends using taxation . to double the price of fizzy drinks, restricting their sale to those . over 17 or 18, and tightening regulations covering school vending . machines and snack bars. Dr Laura Schmidt, also of California . University, said: ‘We’re not talking about prohibition. We’re not . advocating a major imposition of the government into people’s lives. ‘What we want is actually to increase . people’s choices by making foods that aren’t loaded with sugar . comparatively easier and cheaper to get.’ The article also reveals that . consumption of sugar has tripled in the past 50 years and that there are . now more obese people than malnourished ones across the world. It concludes that responsibility lies . with the food companies, saying that while they may resist change, . shifts in policy are possible if the pressure is great enough. Examples . include the ban on smoking in public places and the fitting of airbags . in cars. The article ends: ‘These simple . measures are taken for granted as tools for our public health and . well-being. It’s time to turn our attention to sugar.’ However, other scientists have . described the essay as ‘puritanical’, saying sugar is only toxic when . eaten in unrealistic amounts. Barbara Gallani, of the Food and Drink . Federation, which represents the UK food and drink industry, said that . while urgent action was needed to beat heart and other diseases, it was . wrong to focus on sugar alone. She added: ‘The causes of these . diseases are multi-factorial and demonising food components does not . help consumers to build a realistic approach to their diet. ‘The key to good health is a balanced and varied diet in a lifestyle that includes plenty of physical activity.’

chatgpt: The World Health Organization has reported that sugar consumption is killing millions of people each year. According to WHO, sugar contributes to over 35 million deaths per year worldwide. The painful reality is that people are consuming sugar in high amounts, which is causing a plethora of health problems, ranging from obesity to heart disease. It is commonly known that eating too much sugar can lead to problems such as tooth decay and diabetes. However, the full extent of its negative impact on the body is not generally understood. Sugar is a highly addictive substance that can lead to unhealthy cravings and weight gain. This, in turn, can lead to health issues such as heart disease and stroke. WHO has taken the unprecedented step of declaring sugar an addictive substance. It is commonly used in processed foods and sweetened drinks, which can make it challenging for people to regulate their intake. The organization recommends that adults should limit their sugar intake to no more than six teaspoons per day, while children should consume no more than three teaspoons per day. According to Dr. Francesco Branca, the Director of the Department of Nutrition at WHO, sugar needs to be shunned in favor of healthier options such as fruits and vegetables. "If you are looking for something sweet, try fresh fruit, yogurt or some dark chocolate," he advised. The health risks associated with high sugar consumption are more profound in developing countries, where access to health care is limited. WHO reports that over 80% of sugar is consumed in developing countries. People in these countries are more likely to suffer from obesity and diabetes, which puts a massive strain on their health care systems. The sugar industry has also had a significant impact on the environment, with the production of sugarcane contributing to deforestation and soil degradation. The World Wildlife Foundation has called for the sugar industry to become more sustainable in its practices, stating that "sugar production needs to be done in ways that do not damage the environment, that protect the people who work in it and that provide benefits to local communities." Governments across the world are taking steps to reduce sugar consumption among their populations. In the UK, the government has introduced a sugar tax on drinks with high sugar content. The tax has already reduced sugar intake in the country, with some manufacturers reducing sugar levels in their products. However, some critics argue that government intervention is not enough to tackle the problem. The sugar industry is vast, and many companies will continue to promote their sugar-loaded products regardless of government policies. Instead, people need to take responsibility for their own consumption and make healthy, informed decisions about the food they eat. In conclusion, it is clear that sugar consumption is a significant problem that is affecting millions of people each year. While sugar may be tempting, it is essential that people take responsibility for their health and choose healthier options. By doing so, we can reduce the number of deaths caused by sugar-related health issues and create a healthier, more sustainable world. Remember - a little sugar is not a problem, but a lot of sugar kills, slowly.
