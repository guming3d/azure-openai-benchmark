article: Blyth Spartans will learn their FA Cup third-round fate on Monday – and manager Tom Wade has every reason to believe that Chelsea lie in wait. The Spartans boss – whose Northern League side beat League Two Hartlepool 2-1 on Friday night – met an old woman in a car park at the onset of their cup run back in September and she predicted every score until now, as well as their third-round opponents. ‘I tell everybody about this story and nobody believes me,’ said Wade. Blyth Spartans manager Tom Wade has revealed an old woman has correctly predicted their FA Cup run . Wade said, as well as correctly predicting the results, the woman claimed they will face Chelsea next . ‘An old women came up to me in the car park, and she told us the results would be 2-1, 4-3, 4-1, 2-1 and Chelsea. So she’s been right on four results before the games have even been played. I thought I might have dreamt it - I had a couple of beers that night. ‘But I told people before Friday she said it will be 2-1 (against Hartlepool) and then you’ll get Chelsea in the next round. If that happens I’ll pack in gracefully - play the game and then just pack in. That’s as good as it gets. I wish she had given me six numbers between 1 and 49 as well!’ Should Blyth land a home tie with the Premier League leaders in Monday's draw – live on BBC2 from 7pm – then they will host the match at the 4,400-capacity Croft Park. Chairman Tony Platten said: ‘Unlike a few years ago, you cannot just say, "Okay, we've got a great draw against x, y or z so let's shift it to St James' Park”. ‘You cannot do that. Whoever we draw and it's at home, whether it's Manchester United of Chelsea, the game will definitely be staged at Croft Park, We have the appropriate safety certificate.’ Stephen Turnbull pictured celebrating scoring the equaliser for Blyth Spartans against Hartlepool .

chatgpt: Northern League side Blyth Spartans have made it to the FA Cup third round after a thrilling victory over League Two opponents Hartlepool United. The Spartans will now be eagerly waiting to find out their opponents in the next round, with manager Tom Wade expressing his hope that they will be drawn against the Premier League's mighty Chelsea. Wade spoke to reporters after the game, saying, "We’re going to get Chelsea. An old woman told me so. Kevin Keegan got his players to touch the FA Cup at Wembley before he won it, and I’ve been told to do the same with the ball." The Blyth manager's confidence was certainly on display throughout the game, as his team put in an impressive performance to secure their place in the next round of the competition. The historical significance of Blyth Spartans' victory over Hartlepool should not be understated. The Northern League side were the first non-league team to beat a league team in this year's FA Cup, and their victory has sparked discussion across the country about the magic of the cup. Wade himself acknowledged the importance of the win, calling it "a massive day in the history of Blyth Spartans Football Club." Despite having previously stated that he would be happy with any Premier League team in the next round, Wade's bold prediction that Blyth will face Chelsea has certainly turned heads. The Stamford Bridge side are one of the giants of English football, and would present a daunting challenge for a team from the lower leagues. However, with Wade's confidence and the spirit of the cup behind them, Blyth Spartans will undoubtedly be up for the challenge. The FA Cup third round draw will take place on Monday, and Blyth Spartans will be hoping that fate favours them in the form of a profitable home draw. With the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal, and Liverpool among the potential opponents, the Northern League side will have their work cut out for them no matter who they face. However, with the belief and determination shown by Wade and his team throughout this season's competition, anything is possible. In what has already been a memorable FA Cup campaign for Blyth Spartans, the team are now just one game away from a potential clash with one of the biggest teams in world football. The magic of the cup is alive and well, and Blyth will be hoping to continue their remarkable run all the way to a place in the history books.
