article: Dr Mansoor Kassim, who is facing being struck off after faking Viagra prescriptions worth £340 . A doctor is facing being struck after forging Viagra prescriptions to help him patch up his marriage because he was too embarrassed to ask his own GP. Dr Mansoor Kassim was having 'marital difficulties' when he faked the prescriptions worth £340.67 to the NHS. The 37-year-old, who worked at the Ystrad Fawr Hospital at Caerphilly, South Wales, has already been given a suspended jail sentence for faking the scripts. Now the doctor is facing a hearing by the General Medical Council who argue his fitness to practise is impaired by his conviction. Dr Kassim told the disciplinary panel that it was a 'stupid mistake' due to a 'stressful situation' within his marriage. He said: 'I have been very dishonest doing these things. I am not offering any excuse, I understand there is no excuse for this. 'I am remorseful and ashamed that it came to this. This was a unique case. It was a stressful situation in my life. It was a stupid mistake. 'I put my career at stake. I lost my family. I have learnt my lesson.' Presenting officer Sharon Beattie told the hearing Dr Kassim took the fake prescriptions for sildenafil - better known as Viagra - to a chemist to collect the tablets himself for over eight months. But staff were suspicious because he worked in a trauma and orthopaedic unit where patients would not normally need drugs for impotence. Staff then brought in handwriting experts who discovered the stolen prescription forms had been filled in by Dr Kassim. Miss Beattie told the GMC hearing Dr Kassim started forging prescriptions on the second day of his employment at Ystrad Fawr Hospital. Dr Kassim, who had a home in Ilford, Essex, visited pharmacies in Newport with his fake prescriptions to obtain 20 Viagra tablets at a time, which are free on prescription in Wales. He yesterday claimed it was a 'one off' mistake to fake the prescriptions but Miss Beattie said his pattern of offending went on for over eight months between February and October last year. Dr Kassim agreed but added: 'The reasons were a one-off. I have made a foolish decision. An error of judgement at this time. A GMC hearing heard that Dr Kassim started forging the prescriptions on the second day of his employment at Ystrad Fawr Hospital, pictured . 'The whole issue was I did not want to reveal my identity then and tell anyone I had these problems.' Dr Kassim has already been convicted of two counts of theft, four counts of forgery and three counts of fraud in relation to four prescriptions. He was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to pay compensation of £340.67, costs of £2561.11 and victim surcharge of £100. The hearing continues.

chatgpt: Dr Mansoor Kassim, who started forging prescriptions merely two days into his new job at a South Wales hospital, has been found guilty of faking scripts while he was having 'marital problems.' Subsequent investigation into his conduct only worsened the situation as handwriting experts traced the fraudulent prescriptions back to him. The hospital eventually brought the matter to the authorities, leading to Kassim being given a suspended jail sentence for his fraudulent activities. The investigation began when hospital staff raised suspicion about Kassim's activities while he worked on an orthopaedic ward at the unnamed hospital. It was soon discovered that he had been fabricating the prescriptions, which only added fuel to the suspicions. Further inquiries by handwriting experts confirmed that the handwriting on the documents belonged to Kassim, leaving him with nowhere else to hide. Kassim had initially stated that his actions were mainly due to his personal life, specifically his marital problems. He later pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a suspended jail term. Following the court's decision, Kassim could potentially face further consequences, such as a hearing by the General Medical Council (GMC), which could result in his being struck off. Such a punishment could have a devastating impact on his career and future job prospects. The fraud committed by Kassim cannot be understated. As a medical professional, he had a responsibility to act in the best interests of his patients. Instead, he breached this trust for his own selfish gain. This situation could lead to a lack of confidence and faith in the medical profession among patients, something that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. The hospital where Kassim worked expressed disappointment and concern over the incident. A spokesperson stated that the hospital takes such matters seriously and that they will continue to work to ensure that incidents like this do not occur again. Meanwhile, the GMC hearing is eagerly anticipated by all parties involved. Many are keen to see justice served, and the matter put to rest once and for all. A stern warning to medical professionals in a similar position is also necessary, as such actions will not be taken lightly. The incident has tarnished Kassim's professional reputation, casting doubt on his character and conduct as a medical professional. It remains to be seen what the future holds for him and whether he will be able to make amends for his actions. Ultimately, the case of Dr. Mansoor Kassim serves as a reminder that accountability and responsibility must remain a top priority for all medical professionals in their line of work.
