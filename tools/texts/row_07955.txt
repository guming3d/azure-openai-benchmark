Keys said his penny-saving obsession begun after his father encouraged him to save his money when he was a young man and some were saved when he was just 17-years-old.

His collection weighed a whopping 500 pounds and Keys joked that he nearly 'broke the springs on his pickup truck' while he hauled them into the bank.

Kari Lewis, a personal banker at Prosperity Bank, told KCBD that Keys' collection of pennies was unlike anything she has ever seen before. 'You see them on the ground and you're kind of like, 'Oh, I'm not picking that up,' but for him to collect it for years and years was pretty amazing,' she said.

He also believes that his father would have been annoyed that he'd cashed in his stash. He joked: 'He'd say, I told you to save...not to cash them in.'

chatgpt: After saving his pennies for nearly seven decades, Ira Keys, an 81-year-old resident of Slaton, Texas, recently decided to cash them in at the local Prosperity Bank branch. Keys' penny-saving obsession began when his father encouraged him to save as a young boy. Keys started saving pennies and other coins at the age of 17. From then on, he would collect them from the streets, pick them up from the ground, and ask cashiers if they had any extra pennies. Over time, his collection grew and grew. Keys confessed that he never kept track of how many pennies he had collected. He simply continued to save them and store them in two large coffee cans. When he finally decided to turn them in, he had no idea how much money they were worth. Luckily for Keys, the bank had a coin-counting machine on hand. The machine took several hours to count all the coins, but in the end, it totaled up to a whopping $5,136.14. Keys plans to continue saving his money and admits that he still has a stash of pennies at home. He says that he has always been frugal and that saving his pennies has been a way of life for him. The bank staff was amazed by the amount of coins Keys had saved over the years. They say that he was one of the most dedicated penny-savers they had ever seen. Keys' story of penny-saving is not unusual in America. Many people collect coins or save their loose change, hoping to one day cash it in for a lump sum of money. Some penny collectors, like Keys, have even turned their hobby into a full-time job. They scour the country looking for rare or valuable coins, which they can then sell for a profit. While Keys' collection may not have any significant monetary value, it was still a testament to his dedication and discipline in saving his money. For Keys, the joy of saving pennies was not in their worth, but in the satisfaction of knowing that he had accomplished something through his hard work and determination. In a society where people are constantly tempted to spend money, Keys' penny-saving story is a refreshing reminder of the virtues of frugality and saving. His dedication to penny-saving has taught us that small amounts of money can add up to significant sums over time and that careful budgeting and financial planning can pay off in the end.
