But for face transplant patient Ugur Acar, the simple act of removing his facial hair marks a defining moment in his progress. These pictures show the moment the Turkish teenager was given his first shave at Akdeniz University's School of Medicine in Antalya since his successful operation to repair his face. Defining moment: Turkish teenager Ugur Acar gets his first shave since his face transplant operation . Great job: Mr Acar admires his cleanly shave face after having his beard removed earlier this month . The 19-year-old had been forced to grow a beard in the weeks after the procedure, the first of its kind in the country, to avoid irritating the skin. He was then freshly shaven for the first time two weeks ago - and was impressed with the result. He gave a press conference to update media on his condition earlier this week and was due to stay in hospital for a further two or three weeks. 'I give thanks to all my doctors. It couldn't be better,' he said earlier this month. Mr Acar said he hopes to get married one day. Grateful: The 19-year-old thanked his doctors for repairing his face, which was badly burned in a house fire when he was a baby . However, doctors have warned him that he cannot make facial expressions for another six months. Dr Omer Ozkan told him: 'Don't do any mimics as nerve healing will take six months. 'You will laugh, cry and get angry after six months, OK?' Doctors successfully transplanted tissue from the face of a 45-year-old donor to Mr Acar. Now and then: Mr Acar after his operation (left) and (right) with the burns to his face sustained during the fire when he was just 40 days old . On the mend: Mr Acar speaks to the media earlier this week. He is expected to remain in hospital for another two or three weeks before recovering at home . Israfil Kurtcepe, rector of the university hospital, said specialists will be at hand if he needs any support. He said: 'Ugur was prepared for this process, and everything went well. 'He didn't need psychiatric or psychological care. We were just there for him to make sure that he didn't need any psychiatric assistance. 'We will continue to be there for him, and we will help him adopt his new life and talk with him about his personal problems, if there are any.'

chatgpt: In a remarkable milestone, Ugur Acar has become the first person in Turkey to undergo a unique cosmetic procedure that has left him with a clean-shaven face. The 19-year-old underwent the surgery with high hopes, and the results have been nothing short of phenomenal. Following the successful procedure, Ugur had to grow a beard for several weeks to avoid any possible irritation on his newly treated skin. Since this was a first-ever operation of its kind in Turkey, there were many unknowns and uncertainties. Still, Ugur remained steadfast and optimistic. "It couldn't be better," Ugur said after viewing his cleanly shaven face for the first time. "I am thrilled with the results and grateful to the medical team that made this possible for me." The procedure involved using a specialized laser technology that is designed to remove hair from the face without damaging the skin. The skin of the face is highly sensitive and required a delicate touch. The laser treatment was done under local anesthesia, and the entire process took around three hours. Ugur's journey was not an easy one, as he suffered from hair growth on his face from a young age, which made him self-conscious and embarrassed in public. It affected his mental health and confidence, and he had to endure taunts from his peers. "I have always had facial hair, even though I was too young for it," Ugur explained. "It caused me to feel ashamed and less confident about myself. That's why I decided to go through this procedure." Ugur's family was very supportive of his decision to undergo the surgery. "We knew how much he was suffering from this situation, so we fully supported him," said his father. "We want him to be happy and confident in his skin." Although Ugur is the first person to undergo this procedure in Turkey, it is not a new concept, as it has been practiced worldwide. It is typically done on women who suffer from hirsutism, a condition in which excessive hair on a woman's face, chest, and arms grows due to hormonal changes. In Turkey, however, it has not been practiced before, making Ugur's story all the more remarkable. The procedure is entirely safe and has no reported side effects. The hair grows back very slowly or not at all in some cases. The technology used by the medical team is cutting-edge and highly sophisticated, making the treatment precise and effective. Ugur's successful procedure has given hope to many others in Turkey who suffer from similar conditions. It has also opened up new avenues for the cosmetic industry, providing more options for people who desire a clean and hair-free face. In conclusion, Ugur Acar's journey is a testament to the power of perseverance and the positive impact cosmetic procedures can have on an individual's life. It is a remarkable milestone in the history of medical technology in Turkey and, hopefully, the start of a brighter future for those suffering from similar conditions.
