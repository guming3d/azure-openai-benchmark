After spending years conducting pre-match build ups on the pitches at grounds across the UK and abroad, football presenters are aware they have to be fully alert at all times. As regular hazards of the job includes flying footballs and abuse from the crowd, presenters have to be well-versed in how to deal with a number of potentially difficult situations. But what these three ESPN presenters didn't see coming at the Etihad Stadium yesterday was the sprinkler system suddenly bursting into life. Didn't see that coming: ESPN presenter Ray Stubbs is sprayed by the sprinklers before the game between Manchester City and Leeds United at the Etihad Stadium . The sudden shower caught presenter Ray Stubbs and guests Gary McAlister and Sportsmail's Martin Keown by surprise as it was switched on while they were stood by the pitch. Former Arsenal defender Keown raised his coat to shield himself from the water moments before Manchester City's 4-0 win over Leeds United in the FA Cup fifth round tie. The three presenters were quickly attended to before the coverage continued. Football fans who saw the incident took to social networking sites to post their reaction. Karen Davies posted on Twitter: 'Loving it the pundits on ESPN are being attacked by the sprinklers pitch side at the Etihad'. Danny Carey tweeted: 'Anyone else just see the ESPN panelists get soaked by sprinklers haha'. Meanwhile, Steve Greenwood wrote: 'Keown must hate covering #LUFC on ESPN. If he's not getting smacked by balls he's getting drenched by sprinklers'. Take cover: Martin Keown shelters himself from the water from the pre-match sprinklers . Clean-up operation: The presenters are dried after the sprinkler surprise . Why always me? Martin Keown must be getting used to pre-match shenanigans. He felt the full force of a ball in the face before Leeds' FA Cup clash with Arsenal last season. Robbie Savage later claimed it was meant for him.
