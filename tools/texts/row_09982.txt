article: (CNN) -- Somalia, Myanmar and Afghanistan have the lowest scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, which measures how people in 178 countries and territories view corruption in their public sectors. On a scale of 0-10, with 10 being "very clean" and 0 being "highly corrupt," all three countries score below 1.5. Somalia is the lowest at 1.1, while Myanmar and Afghanistan are tied for second at 1.4. At the other end of the list are Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore, which score the highest at 9.3. The United States, with a score of 7.1, is among the countries viewed as least corrupt. It's tied for 22nd overall with Belgium. But while the U.S. is well ahead of neighbor Mexico (3.1), it seems to have some work to do to catch Canada (8.9). The latest scores were drawn from 13 surveys and assessments published between January 2009 and September 2010 by "independent and reputable institutions," according to Transparency International. It defines corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. Transparency International is a nongovernmental organization headquartered in Berlin. It acknowledges that corruption, by nature, is often hidden and therefore difficult to quantify, but it says it has found people's perceptions to be a reliable estimate over the long term. Some other noteworthy scores from the index: . ** Because of activist Anna Hazare and his recent hunger strike, corruption has been brought to the forefront in India. The country scored a 3.3 on the most recent index, putting it among the countries viewed as most corrupt. ** Libya (2.2) and Syria (2.5), were also near the top of the perceived corruption list, something that might not be a surprise considering the recent unrest there. Yemen also scored a 2.2. Egypt (3.1) and Tunisia (4.3) scored better, but not by much. Again, it's important to point out that these surveys were conducted well before these two countries' longtime leaders were ousted. More comparisons: Which country has the smallest gender gap?

chatgpt: The latest rankings of the world's most corrupt countries by Transparency International have been released, and the results do not paint a pretty picture. Out of the 178 countries and territories included in the list, Somalia is perceived to be the most corrupt, followed closely by South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. This year's rankings are based on data collected between March 2020 and February 2021. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the scale of corruption may have shifted as governments around the world have sought to rapidly distribute funds and resources to tackle the crisis. Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore, on the other hand, continue to earn high marks for transparency and low levels of corruption. These countries are known for having strong democratic institutions, independent media and well-functioning legal systems. The report sheds light on the widespread nature of corruption around the world, with two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 on the index, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean. The average score for all countries included was just 43. Transparency International's rankings are based on surveys of experts and business leaders on the perceived levels of corruption in each country. The researchers consider factors such as bribery, diversion of public funds, and conflicts of interest among officials. The impact of corruption can be devastating, leading to lower economic growth, reduced access to healthcare and education, and a lack of trust in government institutions. Corruption can also fuel inequality and undermine democracy. The rankings serve as a reminder that much work remains to be done to root out corruption and promote transparency around the world. Governments, civil society organizations and private sector actors all have a role to play in ensuring that public resources are used for the common good, rather than for the enrichment of a small elite. As Transparency International notes in its report, "Corruption is a problem we all need to fight together." The rankings provide a valuable tool for monitoring progress and holding governments accountable for their actions. They also offer hope that with sustained commitment and effort, corruption can be reduced and ultimately eliminated.
