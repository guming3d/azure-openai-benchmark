Bad role models: Three of America's biggest sports stars - Peyton Manning, LeBron James, pictured, and Serena Williams - have been named and shamed as the worst at marketing unhealthy food to kids . But the worst culprits were the most famous athletes, a fact that saddened health experts. Denver Broncos signal caller, Peyton Manning, has endorsement deals with Papa John's pizza and Oreo cookies, adding to the $12 million he makes annually from lending his face, voice and persuasive powers brands. According to Forbes, he even owns 21 Papa John's stores in the Denver area. Meanwhile, Miami Heat champion LeBron James earns $42 million per year by endorsing McDonald's, Coca-Cola and other products and number 3 on the researchers' list of stars who plug unhealthy products is tennis powerhouse Serena Williams, who in the past has done ads for McDonald's and Oreo cookies.

Many of those food-and-beverage sales campaigns are aimed at young consumers, the study, which was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, found. 'When taking into account the nutrient quality of the products endorsed and the amount of advertising for each product, Peyton Manning, LeBron James, and Serena Williams are the highest contributors to the marketing of unhealthy foods,' the paper concluded. The authors said it 'ironic' that 'some of the world's most physically fit and well-known athletes' were promoting the unhealthy food and drinks and said it sends 'mixed messages about diet and health.'

The study compared the modern day junk food flogging to the cigarette ads of sports stars like Babe Ruth and Ted Williams appeared in. The authors are urging the mega stars to re-think their decisions to push sugar-rich drinks or high-calorie foods. 'Our ultimate hope would be that athletes reject the unhealthy endorsements or, at the very least, promote healthy foods,' Yale University clinical psychology doctoral student and lead author in the study Marie Bragg told NBC News. 'These athletes have an opportunity to work with parents. Instead, they're promoting really unhealthy foods.'

chatgpt: Yale researchers have revealed that professional athletes are promoting a worrying amount of unhealthy food and drink products. A study conducted by the prestigious university found that pro athletes promoted 44 different food or drink brands during 2010, with a staggering 79 percent of those food products being 'energy-dense and nutrient-poor.' Furthermore, a shocking 93 percent of the drinks endorsed by athletes received all of their calories from added sugar. The research identified several athletes who were particularly prolific for endorsing junk food products. The most notable of these were a star of the Denver Broncos, an Olympic gold-winning tennis player, and a legend of the Miami Heat. All three athletes were found to have promoted numerous unhealthy food and drink brands during 2010. The findings of the study are particularly alarming given the position of professional athletes as role models for young people. Many children aspire to emulate their favorite athletes and may be encouraged to consume unhealthy products after seeing their idols promoting them. Furthermore, the promotion of unhealthy foods and drinks by athletes is likely to contribute to the country's already significant obesity epidemic. The researchers behind the study are now calling for greater regulation of the advertising of unhealthy food and drink products, particularly those that are endorsed by professional athletes. They argue that the promotion of such products by athletes is highly influential and can have a significant impact on the choices made by young people. The study raises important questions about the ethical responsibilities of athletes who sign endorsement deals with unhealthy food and drink brands. While it is undoubtedly tempting for athletes to accept lucrative advertising contracts, they must also consider the wider impact of their actions. By promoting unhealthy products, athletes are potentially contributing to the poor health of their fans and could be setting a negative example for young people. The implications of the study are clear. If we are to tackle the obesity epidemic and promote healthy living, we must take a closer look at the impact of advertising on our choices. In particular, we must be mindful of the effect that athlete endorsements can have on young people. While everyone is entitled to make their own choices about what they eat and drink, we must ensure that those choices are informed by accurate information and not influenced by the promotion of unhealthy products. In conclusion, the study by Yale researchers is a sobering reminder of the role that professional athletes play in the promotion of unhealthy food and drinks. While many athletes undoubtedly mean well and genuinely believe in the products they endorse, they must also be mindful of the wider impact of their actions. The promotion of unhealthy products can have far-reaching consequences and may contribute to the poor health and wellbeing of their fans. As a society, we must work together to address this issue by regulating the advertising of unhealthy products and promoting healthy living.
