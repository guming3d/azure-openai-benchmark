A surveillance camera captured her stumbling and lurching before falling over as she tried to attack the ducks . Charlene Winter admitted two counts of animal cruelty . A camera set up by the homeowner filmed Winter on September 3 last year, lurching drunkenly around the garden at 8am. The video captured the horrifying moment she lurched after a duck, stamped down on its neck and allowed her dog to attack it. A post mortem revealed the bird had died from a compressive trauma from being squashed with a heavy weight. She was ordered to pay £300 costs and banned from owning animals for five years as punishment for her vile attack. Animal rights campaigners have slammed the sentence because she could have faced a lifetime ban from owning animals, a £20,000 fine and six months in jail. RSPCA Inspector Andrew Kirby said: 'This poor duck died after being stood on. It was clearly an intentional and incredibly cruel act. 'Winter showed no regard whatsoever for this duck and was seen standing on her in a deliberate way - crushing the poor bird to death.' Sue Baumgardt from Brighton Animal Action said: 'Why is she allowed to have animals after five years, why not ban her for life? 'If she is drunk with a dog and then stamping on a duck, is she capable of looking after anything?'

chatgpt: A woman who attacked and killed a bird in her neighbor's garden has been ordered to pay £300 in costs and banned from owning animals for five years. Charlene Winter was caught on camera stumbling around the garden before attacking the helpless birds. Enraged with the ducks' quacking, she went into her neighbor's garden and killed one bird by stamping on its neck and letting her pet maul it. Winter's actions were captured on video by her neighbor, who reported the incident to the authorities. In court, she pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary harm to an animal and disturbing the peace. The judge in the case condemned Winter's actions, calling them "vicious and cruel." He noted that killing animals in this way is against the law, and that Winter has shown no remorse for her actions. The court heard that Winter has a history of aggressive behavior towards animals and humans. In 2016, she was convicted of assaulting her neighbor and causing criminal damage to his property. Winter's defense lawyer argued that her actions were not premeditated, and that she had been suffering from mental health problems at the time. However, the judge rejected this argument, stating that Winter had acted with clear intent to harm the bird. In addition to the ban on owning animals and the fine, Winter was given a 12-month community order, requiring her to attend a mental health assessment and complete 100 hours of unpaid work. Outside the courtroom, Winter's neighbors expressed relief that she had been held accountable for her actions. They described her as a "dangerous and unstable" person who had caused them a great deal of distress. Animal welfare activists welcomed the verdict, but called for tougher penalties for those who harm animals. They pointed out that animal cruelty is often a strong predictor of future violence towards humans, and that it is important to take such cases seriously. Overall, Winter's case highlights the importance of being responsible and compassionate towards animals. Whether it is pets or wildlife, animals deserve to be treated with respect and care. The consequences of harming them can be severe, and it is important for individuals to understand the consequences of their actions.
