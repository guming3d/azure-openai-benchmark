chatgpt: Police in Romania have launched an investigation after disturbing footage emerged of a couple drowning while attempting to cross the swollen River Jiu in a horse and cart. Tragically, the fisherman who bravely waded into the water to try and save the couple was unable to do so due to the strong current. The couple, identified as Calin Neagu, 47, and his wife Dana, 45, were attempting to cross the river on Sunday when their horse and cart were swept away. Shockingly, those who were filming the incident from the shore did nothing to help, and could be heard laughing in the video. "I couldn't believe what was happening," said Ionel Popescu, a local fisherman who witnessed the tragedy. "I jumped into the water with my waders on and tried to swim towards them. But the current was too strong, and I couldn't reach them in time." Rescue teams were called to the scene, and divers were eventually able to recover the bodies of the couple several hours later. The incident has sparked outrage in Romania, with many questioning why no one stepped in to help during the couple's desperate struggle for survival. "This is a tragedy that should never have happened," said local politician Adrian Oros. "It is heartbreaking to think that someone could stand by and film something like this without trying to help. We will make sure that those responsible for this tragedy are brought to justice." The incident has also drawn attention to the dangers of attempting to cross swollen rivers, particularly when driving or riding in a horse and cart. As rain continues to fall across the region, authorities are urging people to take extra precautions when traveling near bodies of water. "Our hearts go out to the family of the couple who lost their lives in this tragic accident," said Bogdan Despa, the mayor of the nearby town of Bumbesti-Jiu. "We will do everything we can to ensure that this kind of accident does not happen again, and urge all members of the public to exercise caution when near rivers and other bodies of water." The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and authorities are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward. Meanwhile, the community is in mourning for the loss of Calin and Dana, two beloved members of the local community who will be deeply missed by all who knew them.
