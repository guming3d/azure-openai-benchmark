article: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Explosions and heavy automatic gunfire were heard hours after five well-armed suicide bombers attacked the British Council in the Afghan capital Friday, leaving at least eight people dead, officials said. White smoke billowed from a building in the compound while heavily armed British and Afghan forces cordoned off the area in the center of the capital, establishing a security perimeter around the buildings. The attacks occurred inside a well-guarded Kabul neighborhood, leaving at least 16 people wounded, the Afghan Interior Ministry said. Among the dead was one New Zealand Special Forces service member, officials said. "I have limited details about the soldier's death, but I am advised that he died during fighting that followed an attack by insurgents in Kabul in the last few hours," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said. "On behalf of the government, I want to offer my condolences to the family of the soldier." The strike, which the Taliban have claimed responsibility for, coincides with the 92nd anniversary of Afghan independence from Great Britain. Eyewitnesses: 'Whole house shaking' In the first attack, a militant drove a vehicle packed with explosives toward the Council's main security gate before detonating the device, according to Afghan police spokesman Hashamap Stanikzai. A second man then attempted to enter the compound wearing a vest filled with explosives. He also detonated himself, Stanikzai said. Police say two militants were killed in a firefight with security forces. The other three detonated their explosives. Gunfire could be heard throughout the incident, and military helicopters circled overhead. The British Council is a British government-affiliated body that fosters cultural and academic exchanges in Afghanistan. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, as did the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. "Initial reports indicate a combination of multiple vehicle-borne and personal-borne (improvised explosive devices) were detonated," the ISAF statement said. NATO commander Gen. John Allen pledged to hold "the perpetrators accountable for their actions." Meanwhile, an embassy spokesman said British government personnel are coordinating with Afghan authorities to secure the area. The strike occurred not far from the Intercontinental Hotel, the scene of another insurgent attack against a high-profile Western target in June. CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, has offered her condolences to the family of a service member who was killed in an attack on the British Council in Kabul, Afghanistan. The service member, who has not been identified, was one of 16 people who were wounded in the attack. According to reports, five militants launched an assault on the British Council on Friday, using rocket-propelled grenades and guns to target the compound from a nearby building. Afghan police responded to the attack and engaged in a firefight with the militants that lasted for several hours. The attack has been claimed by the Islamic State, which has been responsible for a number of high-profile attacks in Afghanistan in recent years. The group has been weakened in the country in recent months following a series of operations by Afghan and American forces, but it still poses a significant threat. In a statement released following the attack, Prime Minister Ardern expressed her condolences to the family of the slain service member and to the people of Afghanistan. She condemned the attack and reiterated New Zealand's commitment to supporting the Afghan government in its efforts to maintain peace and stability in the country. "The death of this service member is a tragic reminder of the risks that our armed forces face every day as they work to keep us safe," Ardern said. "Our thoughts are with their family and loved ones during this difficult time." The attack on the British Council comes just days after a similar attack on a charity in Kabul that claimed the lives of 10 people. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for that attack, which was also carried out by a group of militants using guns and explosives. The recent attacks highlight the ongoing security challenges facing Afghanistan as it struggles to maintain stability following decades of conflict. Despite the efforts of the Afghan government and its allies, the country remains plagued by violence and insecurity, with attacks like these posing a constant threat to the civilian population and those working to restore peace and prosperity to the country. As New Zealand mourns the loss of one of its brave service members, the world is reminded of the ongoing struggle in Afghanistan and the sacrifices being made by those who are working to make the country a safer place.
