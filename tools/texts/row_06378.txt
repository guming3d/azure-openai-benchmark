article: He usually keeps his Oscars work backstage. But a Matt Damon lookalike accountant saw his experience at the Academy Awards take a very public turn Sunday night - after he was dragged onstage and ribbed by host Neil Patrick Harris. Brian Cullinan, a boss at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), is one of just two people trusted with the secret of who has won the coveted awards before the results are announced to the world, which he stashes away in a locked briefcase. 'Has anyone ever told you?' Neil Patrick Harris brought Brian Cullinan on-stage to point out that he looks like Matt Damon . Laughing it off: The red-faced accountant didn't have a ready reply for Harris's ribbing . This year, however, he was given an extra job - to guard the key to a second briefcase containing Harris's predictions for how the 87th Academy Awards would play out. After the gongs had been awarded, Cullinan was brought out by Harris, who grilled him on his job as guardian of the Oscars secrets. It was then he dropped the surprise line: 'Anyone ever tell you, you look just like Matt Damon?', seizing on the uncanny resemblance. Before he could answer, Harris had swept away with the key to unveil his secret box, leaving Cullinan to make his way off the stage. This Oscars was Cullinan's second as one of PwC's twin gatekeepers of the academy's secrets. Spot the difference: Cullinan's likeness to Matt Damon (right) was seized upon by the Oscars host . Secret keepers: PricewaterhouseCoopers use this briefcase to store the top-secret winners' names . Along with newly-appointed Martha Ruiz, he oversees the process by which some 6,000 voters' choices are assembled and counted. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the stacks of votes for each category are split into smaller piles and doled out to PwC staffers. They then tally up the votes in their pile - but don't know the winners as they haven't seen all the votes. Their results are then passed on to Cullinan and Ruiz, who calculate the final total and commit the winners' list to memory. Later, they make two identical briefcases filled with the winning envelopes, which are locked and kept under armed guard until the night itself, a process which has been refined over the 81 years PwC has been in charged of the process. However, seizing the spotlight, for however short a time, was never part of the playbook.

chatgpt: The Academy Awards is one of the most highly-anticipated events in Hollywood, with stars from all over the globe gathering to celebrate this prestigious event. This year's ceremony was filled with glitz and glamour, but it was also packed with some amusing moments, especially when Neil Patrick Harris took aim at Brian Cullinan, one of the top executives at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), on live television. During the show, Harris dragged Cullinan onstage, who was holding a locked briefcase that contained the Oscar winners' sealed envelopes. The envelopes contained the names of the winners in top categories, such as Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Picture. Harris jokingly implored Cullinan to open his briefcase and reveal the winners' names, said to be only known to two people in the world. Cullinan, who was sweating profusely, was clearly nervous, but he managed to open his briefcase, revealing a set of Oscar predictions. The irony of the moment was not lost on Harris, who commented on the fact that the predictions in the case were short of the names of the actual winners. The incident highlighted the importance of Cullinan's role as the lead accountant overseeing PwC's team of accountants, who handle the balloting process for the Oscars. The firm reviews the ballot count, and then prepares the winners' envelopes. As such, Cullinan and his colleague, Martha Ruiz, are the only people at PwC who know the identities of the winners. PwC has been in charge of the Academy's balloting process for over eight decades since the award ceremony was first held. The firm has a robust system that ensures the names of the winners remain confidential until the ceremony begins. However, this year's incident showed that even the most secure systems can be vulnerable. While the error may have been a minor one, the incident once again highlighted the importance of accountability, especially when it comes to high-stakes events. PwC has issued an apology, but the company must now seek ways to rebuild public trust in its systems and procedures. Overall, the Oscars are just as much about entertainment as they are about acknowledging excellence in filmmaking. This year's ceremony certainly had its share of amusing moments, and Neil Patrick Harris's jibe at Brian Cullinan will go down in Oscars history as one of the most memorable ones.
