article: By . Sara Smyth . Two women who spent their 94-year-old relative’s money on cars, designer handbags and expensive jewellery have had their cloak of anonymity lifted by a judge. Janet Miller, 72, and Margaret Johnson, 61, from Derbyshire, were not allowed to be named publicly in order to protect their victim Gladys Meek. But now, the women who spent more than £230,000 of Mrs Meek’s savings, have been identified following her death at the age of 94. Shocking: Janet Miller, 72 and Margaret Johnson, 61, from Derbyshire, who spent Gladys Meek's money on watches, jewellery and cash gifts were named at the Court of Protection, sat at the High Court . Mrs Miller, who was a niece of Mrs Meek’s late husband Bert and Mrs Johnson, a great-niece, were given power to manage Mrs Meek’s finances in 2010. At the time it was decided that Mrs Meek’s dementia meant she lacked the mental capacity to make decisions about her estate. But rather than protect her aunt’s savings, Mrs Miller went on to spend £17,000 on an Omega watch, more than £10,000 on rings and treated herself to two Mulberry handbags worth more than £1,000. Named and shamed: Two women who spent their relative's savings on luxuries like a Rolex . She used money from Mrs Meek’s accounts to buy her daughter and granddaughter Vivienne Westwood handbags. Mrs Johnson’s ‘gifts’ to herself included an £18,000 Rolex watch, a £16,000 ring and a £20,000 ‘cash gift’. She also gave her daughters designer handbags and spent £500 on a Derby County football club season ticket for her husband. The two women donated more than £50,000 of Mrs Meek’s money to charities. In 2013, the women were stripped of their power after they were accused of ‘extravagant’ spending Judge David Hodge QC. Judge Hodge made the decision to name the women following the latest in a series of hearings in the Court of Protection - which handles cases relating to sick and vulnerable people. Before Mrs Meek died in April 2014, the court considered whether a police investigation should be called. But rather than have Mrs Meek questioned as part of the investigation, the judge ruled that a £270,000 ‘security bond’ offered by Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson should be called in instead. Judge Hodge concluded that publication of names would pose no risks to anyone other Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson. Judge Hodge said: ‘Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson engaged in a course of conduct involving extravagant gifts, not only to charities, but also to themselves and members of their respective families, and involving the purchase of a motor car for each of them, computers, jewellery, watches, designer handbags and football season tickets, and involving very large transfers of cash.’ He said in April this year records showed that Mrs Meek’s assets to be worth nearly £115,000. But he said more than £90,000 of that could be eaten up in legal costs.

chatgpt: A pair of women are now facing the consequences of taking advantage of a 94-year-old dementia sufferer who lacked the capacity to make their own decisions. Janet Miller, 72, and Margaret Johnson, 61, spent Gladys Meek's savings on watches, jewellery, and cash gifts. However, the two were not able to get away with it as Judge David Hodge QC stripped the pair of their spending powers and ordered them to pay back £200,000 to Mrs Meek's estate. Janet Miller was Mrs Meek's niece, while Margaret Johnson was her great-niece. The two women were given the responsibility of handling Mrs Meek's finances when she moved into a care home in 2011. However, it wasn't long before they began withdrawing substantial sums of money from Mrs Meek's bank account. The court heard that Miller had a history of financial misconduct, including taking out credit cards in her husband's name without his knowledge. Despite this, Mrs Meek's family still appointed her as the attorney of their relative's estate. Both Miller and Johnson were named as attorneys for Mrs Meek's estate in 2013. However, in the years that followed, Miller and Johnson systematically drained Mrs Meek's finances. They spent thousands of pounds on watches, jewellery and cash gifts, with no regard for the welfare of the 94-year-old dementia sufferer. One of the most significant purchases made by the two was a £2,500 watch for Margaret Johnson, paid using Mrs Meek's savings. The court also heard that Johnson withdrew £50,000 and transferred the money into Miller's account. Judge David Hodge QC, who oversaw the case, ruled that both Miller and Johnson had "abused their position of trust" and had "deliberately dissipated and squandered" Mrs Meek's savings. The pair was ordered to pay back £200,000 to Mrs Meek's estate and was stripped of their powers as attorneys. The court heard that Mrs Meek had no children and had left her estate to be divided among her surviving relatives. However, Miller and Johnson's actions mean that there will be significantly less money to distribute now. During the case, evidence was presented that suggested Miller and Johnson had used some of the money to fund business ventures. However, the judge found no evidence to support this claim. The case serves as a warning to others who may hold positions of power over vulnerable individuals. Judge David Hodge QC noted that it was "tragic" that Mrs Meek, who had worked hard all her life, had been left in such a vulnerable position. This case highlights the dangers of appointing family members as attorneys or guardians for vulnerable adults. It is important to carefully consider who will be responsible for an individual's financial affairs and to ensure that they are trustworthy and capable of handling such responsibilities. Otherwise, the consequences can be devastating for those who are left vulnerable and powerless.
