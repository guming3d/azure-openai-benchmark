The two are the only brands to be valued at more than $100 billion, according to the annual Best Global Brands report. The ranking, compiled by Interbrand consultancy, considers three main criteria. Besides the financial performance of branded products, it also looks at how the brand influences customer choice, and whether it can push up the price of a product.

Tech companies are heavily represented in the ranking with IBM (4), Microsoft (5) and Samsung (8) in the top 10. The ranking is also a good news for the car industry, as four automobile companies -- Toyota (8), Mercedes-Benz (10), BMW (11), and Honda (20) -- all made in into the top 20. Three other carmakers were among the top rising brands. Audi's brand value increased 27%, while Volkswagen and Nissan both saw a boost of 23%. But Facebook was the ranking's top riser, gaining 86% in brand value and jumping 33 spots to number 29. Facebook has grown again last year, with the number of monthly active users at 1.32 billion, up 14% year-over-year.
