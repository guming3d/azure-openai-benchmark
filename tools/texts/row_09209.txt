article: Supermarkets have announced fuel-price cuts ahead of the August bank holiday getaway. Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco are all reducing the cost of their petrol by up to 2p a litre, with diesel going down by 1p a litre. In Asda’s case, this will take the price of its petrol to no more than 124.7p a litre, with diesel at 128.7p for diesel - its lowest prices since January 2011. The move by three of the biggest supermarkets will bring some relief for drivers who have seen pump prices inch up in recent weeks . The average UK price of petrol was 129.71p a litre, with diesel at 133.74p - its lowest since mid-February 2011, yesterday according to the AA. Unlike Asda, other supermarkets are not implementing a national cap so prices could vary regionally. Morrison's is one of the few that hasn't promised a reduction, with a spokesman saying the supermarket will 'be evaluating' prices to 'remain competitive'. An AA spokesman said: 'We have seen competitive independent retailers east of London selling petrol as low as 125.9p a litre recently.' RAC fuel spokesman Pete Williams said: 'We’ve been calling for petrol and diesel prices to fall for some time following the decrease in wholesale prices and so this is a welcome move by the supermarkets. 'We would expect to see other retailers to follow in the coming days giving consumers a great opportunity to fuel up ahead of the bank holiday.' Asda, which claims to offer the cheapest fuel all year round, said released a statement crediting the strength of the pound for the slash in prices. The cost of filling up has almost doubled in a decade, with average prices of around 80p per litre in July 2004 . A spokesman said: 'We’re giving our customers and holiday makers the opportunity to fill up their cars with some of the cheapest fuel prices in the market for years, putting much needed cash back in their pockets as the summer holidays begin. 'A full tank of fuel now costs £5 less than last summer and our national price cap benefits everyone across the country, meaning that no-one filling up at Asda will be forced to pay a premium for their fuel because of where they live.'

chatgpt: Supermarkets across the UK are gearing up for a busy weekend and have announced significant price cuts on petrol and diesel. Asda, one of the leading supermarket chains, has announced that the price of petrol at its forecourts will not exceed 124.7p per litre, and diesel will be priced at 128.7p. This move by Asda comes as a pleasant surprise for motorists, especially given the current trend of rising fuel prices across the UK. According to the Automobile Association (AA), the average price of petrol in the UK currently stands at 129.71p, while diesel is priced at 133.74p. Asda's decision to cut prices is expected to put pressure on other retailers to follow suit, as the supermarket chain aims to capitalise on the increase in demand ahead of the Bank Holiday weekend. Supermarkets are likely to compete fiercely for customers as people prepare for a weekend of travel, shopping, and recreation. This move by supermarkets is likely to lead to price cuts that will benefit consumers. With fuel prices being one of the significant contributors to the cost of living, this announcement will come as a relief for millions of motorists across the UK. According to industry analysts, supermarkets have been able to cut prices as they benefit from economies of scale. As a result, they can offer products at lower prices than many independent operators. Retailers are primarily using their vast buying power to bring prices down for their customers.  Asda has already reduced prices of essential items in stores to be much more competitive, and the reduction in fuel prices will be seen as a big win for the chain.  Some industry experts are warning that these price cuts could be short-lived, however. With global oil prices remaining volatile, any prolonged rises could necessitate a quick reversal of the current trend in petrol and diesel prices. Nevertheless, this move by supermarkets to cut fuel prices will undoubtedly bring relief to millions of motorists this Bank Holiday weekend, with many households already feeling the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With people eager to enjoy a weekend of socially-distanced autumnal fun, they will undoubtedly appreciate paying less at the pump.   In conclusion, UK motorists can expect to fill up their tanks at superstores' petrol stations, which are offering petrol and diesel at much lower rates before the weekend. It is expected that other players in the market will follow suit and reduce their fuel prices too, providing some much-needed relief for consumers.
