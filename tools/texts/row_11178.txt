article: For a man with so much going on in his head, Wilfried Bony has done a fair job of relocating his feet. It’s barely been three weeks since the Ivorian with 25 goals to his name last season was facing questions of his failure to score even one in this campaign. Sigurdsson has had a hand in eight goals (seven assists, one goal) in nine PL games for Swansea this season. Those have been sufficiently addressed, with four strikes in three games, including the two on Saturday that saw off Leicester and made his position in forthcoming contract talks a touch stronger. Those discussions are expected to commence imminently, with Bony (right) happy to extend his commitment beyond the summer of 2017, though he has made no secret of his ambitions to join a bigger club.

Approaches never came in the summer despite interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, but that will surely change if the 25-year-old matches last season’s goal tally, which is his target. ‘I knew the goals would come,’ said Bony, who celebrated his strikes against Leicester with a T-shirt tribute to two friends who died recently. ‘When I wasn’t scoring the team was doing well. Now, the team needs me to score and I did. I have a target in my head and I will take it step by step.’ Of his contract situation, Bony added: ‘Contract talks I leave to my agent. But I am happy.’ Garry Monk, meanwhile, does not expect to be charged by the FA after he said Stoke’s Victor Moses cheated. He said: ‘I’ve been in contact with the FA. I’ve made my views, I’m happy with them and I can’t see anything happening after that.’ Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has seen his side go four games without a win since the 5-3 victory over Manchester United. He said: ‘The problem is people want to talk about that (the United game) all the time. But as soon as that game is over it is not important.’

chatgpt: Swansea City forward Wilfried Bony has been in sensational form in recent games, scoring four goals in just three matches. The Ivorian international has played a crucial role in Swansea's recent victories, and his performances have led to speculation that his stay with the club could be extended beyond the summer of 2017. Bony, who first joined Swansea in 2013, quickly established himself as a fan favorite with his goalscoring prowess. Last season, the 28-year-old striker scored an impressive 25 goals for the Welsh club, a feat that has not gone unnoticed by other clubs. Rumors have circulated that Bony could be the subject of transfer approaches from a number of Premier League rivals, but Swansea manager Paul Clement has made it clear that the Welsh side are eager to keep hold of their star striker for the foreseeable future. "Wilfried is a fantastic player, and we would love to have him with us for many more years," said Clement. "His goalscoring record speaks for itself, and he is an important part of our team. We know that there will be interest in him from other clubs, but we are doing everything we can to convince him to stay with us." Bony's form has certainly given Swansea plenty of incentive to try and prolong his stay. In recent games, he has been almost unplayable, scoring two goals in each of the club's last two victories over Stoke City and Burnley. His performances have been especially impressive considering his recent injury troubles. Bony missed a large portion of the last campaign due to a knee injury, but he appears to be fully recovered now and ready to lead the Swansea attack for the rest of the season. The Swans have struggled for consistency this season but will be looking to build on their recent form, with Bony set to play a crucial role. Their upcoming fixture against Bournemouth could prove to be a stern test, with the Cherries currently enjoying a good run of form themselves. However, Swansea have already shown this season that they are capable of producing big performances against the Premier League's top sides, having beaten Arsenal and drawn with Chelsea earlier in the campaign. With Bony in top form, Clement will be hoping that his side can continue their climb up the table and start to cement their place in the top half. If Bony continues to score at the rate that he has been doing in recent games, then there is no doubt that Swansea will be pushing hard to keep him beyond the summer of 2017. The Ivorian striker has proven time and time again that he is a class act, and his goals could prove to be the difference between a mid-table finish and a season of struggle. For now, however, all eyes will be on the upcoming fixture against Bournemouth. If Bony can continue to find the back of the net, then Swansea fans will be dreaming of a successful end to the season and a bright future with their talismanic striker leading the charge.
