The article in Dabiq - named after a town in northern Syria where in 1516 the Ottomans defeated the Mamluks, establishing the last Islamic caliphate - also urged faithful Muslims to attack and kill ‘every Crusader possible’. It added that ‘it is lawful to kidnap the women of the infidels and use them as sex slaves’.

Last month, security officials said that they had stepped up security at the Vatican following threats by ISIS, including restricting air space above Vatican City. Italy’s most notorious jihadi recruiter Bosnian imam Bilal Bosnic, who has admitted conscripting young European Muslim converts to fight with ISIS, said that the extremist militants will bring Islam even to the heart of Christendom, even if he does not live to see it. He said: ‘In time the whole world will be an Islamic state. Our goal is to make sure that even the Vatican will be Muslim.’ Pope Francis was reported to be ‘in the crosshairs’ of ISIS, because he was the leading proponent of false truths, according to intelligence sources.

chatgpt: ISIS has once again sparked widespread outrage after publishing a picture in its propaganda magazine, Dabiq, showing its notorious black flag flying above the Vatican. The extremist group's flag has been superimposed on top of an obelisk in St Peter's Square in Rome. The magazine’s article accompanying the image encourages Muslims across the globe to attack and kill “every Crusader possible”. The Vatican has yet to release any official statement on the matter, but it is clear that this provocative move is an intentional attempt to stir up religious tensions. The image could be seen as a direct threat to the Vatican, as previous ISIS propaganda has often hinted at the group’s intentions to physically attack the Catholic institution. Dabiq has been a mouthpiece for the extremist group for years, and its articles regularly incite acts of terrorism and violence around the world. The latest publication is just the latest in a string of attacks on religious institutions carried out by ISIS, including the deadly Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lankan churches earlier this year. The group has also claimed responsibility for the 2017 attack on a church in Cairo which killed 29 people. The international community has condemned the group's blatant calls for violence against innocent civilians. The message is worrying, as it encourages further acts of terrorism and can fan the flames of hatred between different religious groups. Governments across the world are working to combat ISIS' propaganda and to prevent further brutality at the hands of Muslim extremists. International security measures are being stepped up to monitor and thwart potential terrorist threats in response to such threats like these. Despite ISIS' best efforts to spread fear and chaos, it is important to remember that these messages of violence do not reflect the vast majority of Muslim beliefs or actions. Religious leaders around the globe have spoken out against extremism, urging followers to embrace peaceful and tolerant values. Regardless, the fact remains that ISIS and other extremist groups’ messages of violence pose a real danger to innocent lives. It is essential for governments and individuals alike to remain vigilant in the face of such threats and to work together to create a world that is free of religious based conflict.
