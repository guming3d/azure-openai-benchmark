chatgpt: Ricochet, a golden retriever, has gained a reputation as an excellent surfing partner for children, the disabled, and veterans. The talented dog was discovered during a trip to the beach where she spontaneously jumped on a surfboard with a disabled boy named Patrick. Since then, Ricochet has become a sought-after therapy animal and surf instructor, bringing joy and boosting confidence to those in need. Ricochet's owner, Judy Fridono, knew from a young age that her dog had a special connection with people. She trained Ricochet to be a service dog, but the surf-loving pooch had other ideas. Ricochet's passion for surfing was discovered by chance during a trip to the beach with Patrick, who has quadriplegia. When Ricochet saw Patrick struggling to get onto a surfboard, she jumped on and rode the waves with him. From then on, Ricochet's talent as a surfing dog has been put to good use. Ricochet is no ordinary surfing dog. She can detect the energy and emotions of the people she surfs with, and she adjusts her behavior accordingly. For example, if she senses that someone is nervous, she will calm them down by snuggling with them on the surfboard. If she feels that someone is confident and ready to go, she will ride the waves with them in a playful manner. Her ability to connect with people has earned her a legion of fans and followers on social media. For children, surfing with Ricochet can be an incredibly empowering experience. Many of the children she surfs with have special needs or disabilities, and surfing with Ricochet gives them a sense of confidence and freedom. According to Fridono, surfing with Ricochet is an opportunity for children to forget about their challenges and experience pure joy. Ricochet's therapeutic surfing sessions have also benefited veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The calming presence of the dog, coupled with the physical activity of surfing, can help veterans cope with anxiety and depression. Ricochet has worked with veterans from all branches of the military, and many have described the experience as life-changing. Since becoming a therapy dog and surfing instructor, Ricochet has helped countless individuals improve their confidence and quality of life. Fridono hopes that more people will learn about the benefits of surfing with dogs and that more therapy dogs will be trained to provide this unique form of therapy. In conclusion, Ricochet is not your ordinary golden retriever. She has a unique talent for surfing and a remarkable ability to connect with people. Ricochet's surfing adventures have brought joy and confidence to children, the disabled, and veterans, and her work as a therapy dog has made a real difference in the lives of those she helps. With her positive impact, Ricochet is an inspiration to us all.
