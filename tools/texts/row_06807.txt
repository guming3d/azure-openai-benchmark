article: Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- An unemployed security guard from Ecuador is Spain's top snoozer. Pedro Soria Lopez, 62, was able to nap for 17 minutes and register a 70-decibel snore while sprawled out on a couch in the middle of a crowded shopping mall in what's been billed as the first-ever Spanish National Siesta Championship, CNN sister network CNN Plus reported. The grand siesta champ won the first cash prize of 1,000 euros (about $1,400) in credit to purchase goods at the shopping center in Madrid. The competitors started off by lying down on blue sofas, some in pajamas. Each got to eat a lunch ahead of time, then had twenty minutes to get as much z's as they could squeeze in. Hundreds of contestants took part in the siesta championship which began October 14 and ended Saturday. The intricate rules award points to contestants depending on how long they sleep during the 20-minute competition time, any unusual positions they sleep in, eye-catching pajamas they might be wearing, and yes, a lot of extra points for snoring. The sponsors say it's meant to raise eyes to the problem of a country that's become so fast-paced that many say the traditional siesta is at risk. "The modern life is a danger that we feel is against the siesta. When you sleep la siesta everyone has the image that your life is calm, you have a good life. And then, the modern life is a direct attack," said Daniel Blanco, president of the National Association of Friends of the Siesta earlier in the competition. His group, which includes about 50 of his friends across Spain, persuaded a shopping center, Islazul, to host and pay prize money for the siesta competition. In the competition, the siesta is limited to 20 minutes, a duration which the organizers and some doctors say is optimal; a quick nap after lunch to get refreshed, without entering a deep sleep cycle. But the traditional siesta in Spain often lasts an hour or more. The bustling shopping center where the siesta championship is being held is a prime example of the changing times in Spain. The stores don't close at lunchtime -- which is what used to happen with Spanish shops -- so instead of sleeping the siesta, people are working or shopping. Siesta lovers complain that Spain's frenetic push to compete in the global economy means longer, more pressure-package workdays, even if some Spanish workers still get a two-hour lunch break.

chatgpt: Spain's first national siesta championship has come to a close in Madrid, after participants demonstrated their napping prowess in an event that celebrates a declining tradition. While the siesta is a cultural staple in Spain, the tradition has been fading away over the years, with modern life being blamed for people's inability to take a proper midday nap. However, this event, held in the Spanish capital for the first time ever, aimed at bringing back the concept of the siesta, albeit in a fun and competitive way. The competition, held in a park in Madrid, saw participants lying down on mattresses in a designated area with their eyes closed, attempting to nap for as long as possible, with a decibel meter registering the volume of their snores. According to the rules, the contestant who managed to sleep for the longest duration and generate the loudest snore won the championship. The winner of the first-ever championship held in Spain's capital, Madrid, napped for a brief 17 minutes but registered a thunderous 70-decibel snore that helped them take home the ultimate prize. Traditionalists across Spain, who have been concerned about the disappearance of siestas, would likely have appreciated the event, which served as an ode to a fading tradition. While the event aimed at providing a fun and light-hearted demonstration of the siesta tradition, it also conveyed the significance of taking a short nap to boost productivity and enhance mental health. While modern life and busy schedules have wiped out the concept of the siesta, scientific research has shown that a short nap can enhance brain function, boost concentration levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The championship witnessed a significant turnout, with competitors from all over the country participating in the event. They lay down on their mattresses with their eyes closed, attempting to nap for as long as possible while battling the bustling noise and busy ambience of Madrid's city center. Many contestants pointed out that the championship also aimed at spreading awareness about the idea of a siesta, which they hoped would make a comeback in modern-day Spain. They opined that in today's fast-paced life, a 20-minute nap in the middle of the day could work wonders for mental and physical health and could help combat the stresses that come along in a daily routine. Overall, the event was both fun and significant; it celebrated traditionalism while bringing to light the importance of a much-needed power nap in our busy, modern-day lives. Perhaps this championship could usher in a new era of the siesta, not only in Spain but across the world.
