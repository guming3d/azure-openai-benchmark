article: (CNN)  -- A Russian heavy missile cruiser stopped three pirate ships off the coast of Somalia, and detained 10 pirates, according to a statement released Friday by Russian Navy headquarters in Moscow. Russian missile cruiser "Peter the Great" moored in Cape Town, South Africa, last month. The cruiser, Peter the Great, halted two small high-speed motor boats and a mid-size, support vessel on Thursday, the Russians said. "Ten pirates have been detained. All of them are citizens of Somalia," the press release obtained by CNN stated. "Officials from the Northern Fleet's military prosecutor's office are currently questioning the detainees aboard the Peter the Great. Their future will be decided in coordination with the Russian Foreign and Justice ministries." The Russians said a Russian helicopter Ka-27, which took off from the cruiser, had located two small boats, which were moving toward an Iranian fishing vessel at high speed last Thursday. When those in the boats spotted the helicopter overhead, the boats began slowing down, then veered off toward their support vessel, which was adrift nearby. The helicopter crew could see pirates in the two motor boats throwing weapons into the sea, and kept chasing the boats until the Russian cruiser arrived in the area. "The three boats were (captured and) delivered to the Peter the Great, and ten Somalian pirates were taken aboard. "The detainees possessed weapons, including a G-3 rifle, an Ak-47, two AKMS machine-guns, two grenade-launchers and two anti-infantry grenades, and also had a GPS receiver, a ladder, 500 grams of drugs, a large amount of money, a bag of sugar and a bag of rice. The detained pirates were high on drugs," the press release said. Meanwhile, Somali pirates have released a Panamanian-flagged, Japanese-owned vessel that was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden in November, according to a non-governmental group that monitors piracy. The ship, named the MT Chemstar Venus, was released late Thursday, according to Ecoterra International.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa Â» . The 18 Filipino and five South Korean crew members were reportedly unharmed. The International Maritime Board, a group that also monitors piracy, told CNN that the company had not confirmed the release of the ship, but said shipping companies sometimes wait a few days before going public to ensure the safety of the crew. The ship was hijacked on November 15. It was unclear whether the pirates were paid a ransom to release the ship. This incident comes a week after Somali pirates released a Ukrainian ship carrying tanks, ammunition and crew after receiving a ransom of $3.2 million. -- CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The Russian navy has detained 10 pirates in the Gulf of Aden, near Somalia, after stopping two small high-speed motor boats and a support vessel. The news has been confirmed by the Russian authorities, who added that all the pirates were Somalian citizens. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the detained pirates were attempting to hijack a Liberian-flagged ship in the area. This successful operation by the Russian navy comes just a few days after the release of a Ukrainian vessel carrying tanks, which was released after the payment of a $3.2 million ransom. The Ukrainian ship, known as the MV Faina, has been held by the pirates for almost six months, and its release was widely celebrated by authorities and family members of the crew. The Russian cruiser, which was on an anti-piracy mission in the area, intercepted the small boats and prevented them from approaching the Liberian vessel. According to the Russian authorities, the pirates were armed with automatic weapons and were attempting to board the ship. The cruiser managed to detain the pirates and seized their weapons. The incident highlights the ongoing problem of piracy in the region, which has been a major issue for international shipping companies. Piracy has been on the rise in recent years, with many ships being hijacked and held for ransom. The pirates, who are mostly based in Somalia and operate from the country's lawless coastline, have been targeting ships passing through the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route that connects Europe with Asia and the Middle East. The Russian Navy has been actively involved in anti-piracy operations in the region, along with other countries such as the United States, France, and China. The operations have been successful in reducing the number of successful pirate attacks, but the problem has yet to be completely resolved. Meanwhile, the release of the Ukrainian ship has raised concerns about the role of ransom payments in resolving piracy incidents. The payment of millions of dollars in ransom has become a common practice in the industry, but it is also seen as a major source of income for the pirates. Some experts have called for a tougher stance against piracy, including the use of military force to deter attacks and punish pirates. In conclusion, the detention of 10 Somalian pirates by the Russian navy is a significant development in the fight against piracy in the Gulf of Aden. The incident highlights the ongoing problem of piracy in the area and the need for continued international cooperation to combat the threat. However, the release of the Ukrainian ship after the payment of a large ransom raises concerns about the effectiveness of the current approach to piracy and the need for a more comprehensive solution to the problem.
