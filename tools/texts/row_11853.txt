article: Tokyo (CNN) -- As Japanese authorities widen their investigation into ties between financial institutions and organized crime, an investigative reporter says the current allegations have left with a sense of "déjà vu." "In 2004, Citibank (Japan) lost their private banking license because they were allowing yakuza to do many complex transactions," Jake Adelstein, author of "Tokyo Vice" and an expert on Japan's mafia -- known as the yakuza -- told CNN. "They got spanked in 2009 for failing to update their databases and allowing yakuza to do business with them again. The Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country's financial regulator, will send inspectors to Japan's three largest banks -- Mizuho Bank, Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Bank -- to "review over their corporate governance, legal compliance and overall risk management," said Hiroki Kato, director of the Inspection Bureau of the FSA. The on-site inspections are scheduled to begin next week. All three banks declined to comment on the review when contacted by CNN. Ties to gangs . Mizuho has already come under scrutiny after 54 executives, including the bank's president, were punished after it was revealed an affiliate made more than $2 million in loans to people with ties to organized crime. Yakuza is the name given to Japan's organized crime syndicates. Adelstein -- the only American who has worked a crime beat for the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper -- has called them "Goldman Sachs with guns" because of the financial prowess and sometimes brutal means. "The yakuza have been tremendously successful because they can work out in the open," Adelstein told CNN. "They have business cards, they have office buildings. People know who they are -- they have fan magazines and they have a lot of money." Strict code . Members are said to follow a strict code of discipline -- and often sport full body tattoos. The biggest and wealthiest yakuza gang -- the Yamaguchi-gumi -- is said to number nearly 40,000 members. Robert Feldman of Morgan Stanley Japan once called the Yamaguichi-gumi "Japan's largest private equity group." Belonging to a yakuza gang itself is not a crime. But members are known to engage in drugs, prostitution and gambling. After recent crackdowns by Japanese authorities, yakuza are making more strides into white-collar crime, experts say. "So if you have a lot of money and a lot of information and you can use blackmail and extortion to do insider trading it can make quite a tremendous financial force," Adelstein said. "Yakuza have tremendous political connections and they have a lot of information to blackmail people."

chatgpt: Three of Japan's largest banks have come under scrutiny for their reported connections and loans to underworld groups, particularly the yakuza, the notorious Japanese mafia. Mizuho is the latest bank to face scrutiny after punishing 54 executives for their involvement in loans to people affiliated with the yakuza. The yakuza have long been a part of Japanese society, and their links to the country's economic elite are well documented. However, these loans have brought the issue to the forefront of public debate in Japan, with many questioning the role of large financial institutions in supporting criminal organizations. According to sources, the loans to the yakuza were made through front companies and shell corporations. While not illegal, concerns have been raised that such loans could potentially support the yakuza's illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and extortion. Experts have noted that the yakuza's ability to operate openly in Japan has allowed them to accumulate vast wealth and power. "The yakuza have been tremendously successful because they can work out in the open," said one expert. "They operate in a gray area where there are no clear lines." The revelations about the loans made to the yakuza have sparked a broader conversation about the role of banks in preventing financial crimes. The Japanese government has introduced stricter regulations on banks to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, but critics argue that more needs to be done to combat organized crime. Mizuho has apologized for its involvement in the loans and has said it will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The bank has also set up a committee to investigate the matter and has pledged to improve its compliance procedures. Other banks, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, have also been scrutinized for their reported ties to the yakuza. However, these institutions have not faced the same level of punishment as Mizuho. The issue of organized crime is a sensitive one in Japan, and the yakuza's links to the country's economic elite have long been a source of concern. The revelation that banks have been making loans to the yakuza has only heightened these concerns and put more pressure on financial institutions to be vigilant against criminal activities. As the investigation into the Mizuho loans continues, there are sure to be more questions raised about the role of banks in combating organized crime in Japan. For now, the country will have to grapple with the uncomfortable reality that some of its largest financial institutions have been supporting criminal organizations for years.
