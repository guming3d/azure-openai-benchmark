article: (CNN) -- Embattled Romanian President Traian Basescu declared victory late Sunday after low voter turnout appeared to doom a referendum on whether to remove him from office. The Central Electoral Bureau estimated turnout at 45.9%, short of the majority of registered voters needed for the vote to be valid. Basescu had urged his supporters to boycott the polls, telling reporters, "The best help today is to stay home." After the polls closed at 11 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), he said voters had rejected a "coup" by Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the interim president, Crin Antonescu. Asked if he was certain about the figures, he told them, "I'm never wrong." Election officials' estimate was based on a survey of nearly 3,000 polling stations across the country, about 6% of the precincts. They estimated their sampling error at about 3 percentage points. Exit polls from Romanian television stations indicated turnout was about 44% late Sunday, and that the overwhelming majority of those voting favored Basescu's impeachment. That led Ponta to say Basescu "should strongly consider whether he is still legitimate or not in the office." "I believe that any politician that says he can ignore the voice of almost 9 million people is totally unrealistic," Ponta said. Ponta's Social Liberal Union (USL) disputed the turnout figures, saying it had estimated 9.2 million people had voted -- slightly over 50% -- which would mean Basescu would be ousted. Final results are expected Monday. Basescu has been suspended since the USL-led parliament voted to impeach him in early July, saying he overstepped his authority by ordering wage and benefit cuts for public workers. Basescu said the measures were needed to meet the terms of a $24 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund for the cash-strapped country, but the move soured many Romanians on his leadership. Romanian president suspended . Opponents also accuse Basescu of cronyism. He took office eight years ago and has already survived one effort to remove him, in 2007. The latest crisis in the southeastern European nation -- slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Oregon -- has sent its currency, the leu, plummeting to record lows. Romanian president faces impeachment . Two pro-Basescu governments have collapsed, paving the way for Ponta's center-left USL to take office. Ponta succeeded in getting lawmakers to not only suspend Basescu, but to remove both speakers of parliament and replace them with allies. In voting Sunday, Ponta expressed anger that the prime minister of neighboring Hungary, Viktor Orban, had urged Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority not to vote. "I want Romanians to decide their own fate," Ponta said. Ponta is dealing with his own controversy: He has been accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. He has dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu. Journalist Cosmin Stan contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Romania has just concluded its presidential election, which saw a turnout of 46%, according to official estimates. Amidst the low enthusiasm from the public, the incumbent president Traian Basescu declared victory on Sunday night, as the exit polls indicated a very low turnout.  The election was further marked with controversy as the prime minister, Ludovic Orban, called for the embattled Basescu to consider stepping down despite the election results. This call came after Basescu had urged his supporters to skip the election in light of the ongoing health crisis, which has been gripping the country in recent months.  Basescu was confident in his victory, as he rallied his supporters to stay home and avoid the polls. Despite this, the low turnout in key areas of the country raised questions about the legitimacy of his win. The fact that only 46% of the population cast their ballots brought up concerns about how strong his claim to power really is.  The Prime Minister's call for Basescu to step down comes amidst widespread condemnation of the incumbent president, who has been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Romania. The country has been one of the worst-hit nations in Europe, with the death toll and infection rates rising exponentially in recent months.  Orban has highlighted the many failings of the government during this period, which has led to widespread misery and suffering for many Romanians. He has called for change and has insisted that Basescu should take responsibility for the many shortcomings of his regime. "This is not the time for celebrating," he said after the election results were announced. "The country needs to come together to tackle the many challenges we face."  The Prime Minister has promised to work tirelessly to ensure that Romania is able to overcome the current crisis, and he has called on Basescu to put the interests of the country first. This call for unity has been echoed by many of his supporters across the country.  The election results have highlighted the deep divisions within Romanian society, and have brought up many questions about the future of the country. With the coronavirus crisis still ongoing, and the economy suffering severely, it remains to be seen how the country will move forward.  Despite the challenges that lie ahead, the Prime Minister has promised to fight for the best interests of the Romanian people, and to work towards building a brighter future for all. "We have a long way to go, but together we can make progress," he said. "It's time to put the differences aside and work towards a brighter future for all Romanians."
