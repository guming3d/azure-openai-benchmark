Toure was the second City player to be sent off on a dismal night at the Etihad, following Fernandinho's earlier dismissal. Toure shoved CSKA midfielder Roman Eremenko in the face nine minutes from time.

'It's a strange moment to understand why it happened. I don't think it's just this competition, the last two weeks we are not playing the way we normally do. 'It's a crisis of confidence, of course, I don't understand why but we must find a reason, talk with the players every day and try to win again.' Pellegrini would not be drawn on the two dismissals, saying simply: 'It's the referee that has to decide about that.' VIDEO Pellegrini defends City's discipline .

chatgpt: Manchester City suffered a shocking loss at home as they were defeated 2-1 by CSKA Moscow in their Champions League fixture. The game was not without controversy as Yaya Toure and Fernandinho were both shown red cards, leaving City with only nine men on the pitch. Toure became the second player to see red for City after Fernandinho was dismissed earlier in the game. The Ivorian midfielder's sending-off worsened City's problems and left his team with very little chance of mounting a comeback.  Before his red card though, Toure had scored a goal for his side. The goal came from a well-taken free-kick, which brought City back on level terms after CSKA had opened the scoring. However, despite a valiant effort from City's remaining players, the Russian visitors managed to take the lead once again, with Seydou Doumbia scoring twice, sealing the win for his team.  City's manager, Manuel Pellegrini, expressed his disappointment after the game, stating that his team's performance was not up to par. "We did not play well today, and we deserved to lose. The red cards did not help, but we should have done more to win the game," Pellegrini said. CSKA's victory was a surprise, and it was their first win over City in the competition. Their manager, Leonid Slutsky, praised his team's performance, saying that they deserved the win. "We came here to win, and we did that. I'm very proud of my players today," Slutsky said. The defeat means that City's hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition are in peril. They are currently in third place in their group, behind Roma and Bayern Munich, with two games remaining. The Manchester-based club will now need to win both of their remaining fixtures and hope for other results to go their way if they are to progress to the next round.  In conclusion, City's poor performance and the double red cards added to their woes in what was a disappointing night at the Etihad Stadium. CSKA, on the other hand, will relish their victory and will be looking to build on this result as they move forward in the competition.
