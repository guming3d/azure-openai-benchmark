chatgpt: Less than two days after Erin Hamlin qualified for her third Olympic appearance, tragedy struck her family. On Monday morning, Joan F. Hamlin, the mother of the American luger, was killed in a car crash. The crash occurred in Remsen, New York, where Hamlin's mother lived. According to reports, Hamlin's mother was driving a Kia Sedona van when she collided with a tractor-trailer on Route 365 at around 8:20 a.m. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the tractor-trailer was uninjured in the accident. Hamlin, who is 75 years old, was a resident of the town of Remsen for over 40 years. A statement released by the Oneida County Sheriff's Office said that the incident is being investigated, but there is no evidence to suggest that drugs or alcohol were involved. Erin Hamlin, who is one of the United States' most successful lugers, qualified for her third Winter Olympics on Saturday. She made history in 2014 when she became the first American to win a singles luge medal at the Winter Games, taking home the bronze in Sochi. After announcing her retirement in April 2018, Hamlin decided to return to the sport and start training again in August. The news of Joan Hamlin's death has been met with an outpouring of condolences from the luge community and beyond. On Twitter, the USA Luge account expressed sympathy for the Hamlin family, saying "Our thoughts and support go out to @erinhamlin; we are sorry for your loss." Erin Hamlin has not yet commented publicly on her mother's death, and it is unclear whether her Olympic plans will be affected. The Winter Games are set to take place in Beijing, China, in February 2022. The tragedy is a stark reminder of the sacrifices that athletes and their families make in pursuit of their dreams. While qualifying for the Olympic Games is a momentous achievement, it is important to remember that these victories often come at a cost. As the world of sports mourns the loss of Joan Hamlin, it is a time to reflect on the bravery and resilience of those who choose to pursue their passions against all odds. In a statement released by USA Luge, the organization said that it was devastated by the news of Joan Hamlin's death: "Joan was a wonderful woman who was loved and cherished by her family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with her loved ones at this time."
