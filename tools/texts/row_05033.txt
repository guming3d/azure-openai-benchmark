article: Lewis Hamilton turned the World Championship into class warfare, claiming that his humble origins make him 'hungrier' than his privileged Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton, who is the richest sportsman in Britain with an estimated fortune of Â£68million and joined girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger at a star-studded Cinema Against AIDS event on Thursday, grew up in an end-of-terrace house on a tough council estate in Stevenage.

Rosberg is the son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg and attended elite European schools. Speaking ahead of Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton said: 'I come from a not great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in my dad's apartment. 'And Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and hotels and boats. So the hunger is different. I've got to be the hungriest guy in the cockpit to win the World Championship.' The pair have tried to keep their rivalry friendly this season to help them cope with the pressure of being first and second in the standings. Hamilton now lives in Monaco and previously spoke of how he and Rosberg played table tennis while sharing a Monaco apartment block. Rosberg has since moved out and Hamilton has changed apartments.

chatgpt: Lewis Hamilton, the Formula One champion, has stated that his modest upbringing in Stevenage provides him with the drive and hunger to win, despite the vastly different upbringing of his competitor, Nico Rosberg. Hamilton, who heads up the drivers' championship, leading Rosberg by three points after four consecutive victories, believes that his childhood experiences have given him a tenacity that sets him apart from his rivals. Speaking ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton emphasized that he would not let Rosberg's privileged background distract him from his focus on winning. "If I were to come here believing Nico is hungrier than me then I might as well go home. So I've got to be the hungriest," he said. The comments from Hamilton come amidst a fierce battle for the championship, with Rosberg hoping to claim his first title, and Hamilton hoping to maintain his reign as the dominant figure in the sport. Hamilton's remarks highlight his belief that his upbringing has given him the strength to persevere and succeed, regardless of the challenges he faces. He grew up in a council house in Stevenage, a town on the outskirts of London, and started his racing career from a young age, with his father working two jobs to fund his passion for the sport. In contrast, Rosberg was born into a wealthy family, with his father, Keke Rosberg, also a former Formula One driver. Despite the differences in their upbringings, Hamilton remains focused on the prize, stating that his motivation comes from within. "I know who I am and where I came from," he explained. "It's not about the money or the background or the privileges. It's about the drive and the passion and the hunger to succeed." Hamilton's winning streak has put him in a strong position, and he is poised to maintain his lead as the drivers head to Monaco for one of the most prestigious races on the calendar. However, Rosberg will no doubt be pushing hard to close the gap and take the championship lead. While the rivalry between Hamilton and Rosberg is intense, Hamilton remains confident that his background and his own sense of determination will drive him to victory. "I'm not one to give up easily," he said. "I know what I want, and I know what I need to do to get it." As the drivers prepare to take to the track in Monaco, the question on everyone's mind is whether Hamilton can maintain his winning streak, or whether Rosberg will be able to close the gap and take the lead. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that both drivers will be giving it their all, driven by their own unique experiences and motivations to succeed.
