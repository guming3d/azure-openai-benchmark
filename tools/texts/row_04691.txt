chatgpt: Bumbo, a manufacturer of baby products, has issued a second wave of recalls after reports of babies being injured due to safety risks associated with their products. The company had previously recalled 1 million of their popular foam seats in 2007, but it seems like the issue still hasn't been fully resolved. This time around, consumers who own certain models of the Bumbo Baby Seat are urged to call the company to receive a free repair kit.  Scores of other injuries have been reported, with babies reportedly able to wiggle out of the seats and fall off elevated surfaces. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission had received at least 84 reports of incidents involving the product, with 21 of those incidents resulting in skull fractures. The British equivalent of the commission, Trading Standards, also reported at least 28 falls and two skull fractures, prompting a recall in the UK as well.  The affected seats were sold from August 2003 through August 2012 at various retailers such as Target, Toys R Us, and Walmart. Bumbo has stressed that only certain seats are affected and that the recall only applies to those models. The affected models can be identified by the shape of the leg holes, with those that were previously recalled having a more rounded shape.  Bumbo CEO Johan Pretorius has issued a statement saying that the company takes the safety of their products very seriously and that they are working diligently to address the issue. "We have made significant enhancements to the warnings and instructions that accompany our Bumbo Baby Seats, and we are working with retailers to ensure these warnings are prominently displayed in stores," he said.  The company has also released a video demonstrating the proper use of the seats and how to safely position them on the floor. "It is important to remember that the Bumbo Baby Seat is intended to be used on the floor only, not on elevated surfaces," said Pretorius. "We urge parents and caregivers to use the product as instructed and to supervise their children at all times."  For concerned consumers, Bumbo has set up a hotline at (866) 898-4999 and a website where they can enter their seat's serial number to determine if it is affected by the recall. The company is advising owners of the affected seats to stop using them immediately until they receive the free repair kit.  While it is unfortunate that a second recall had to be issued for these popular baby seats, it is reassuring to see that Bumbo is taking steps to address the issue and keep their consumers safe. Parents and caregivers must always be vigilant when it comes to their children's safety and ensure that all products are used properly and according to instructions.
