The owners, Gail and Kevin Donovan, have no idea how the fire started but have assured the public that they will rebuild the restaurant "bigger and better". The incident comes just months after Melbourne's iconic Stokehouse restaurant was destroyed by a fire in January this year. The Donovans have said that they have been in contact with the owners of the Stokehouse and have received encouragement and support from the community. The fire started around 7pm at the St Kilda restaurant, which is popular for its seafood and waterfront location. The diners were quickly evacuated without any injuries. The fire brigade arrived on the scene and extinguished the fire within an hour. The cause of the fire is still unknown, but authorities have confirmed that it started in the kitchen. The damage to the restaurant is extensive, with the roof and some of the walls completely destroyed. The Donovans have stated that they will work with their insurance company to see what can be salvaged and what needs to be rebuilt. Despite the devastation, the Donovans remain optimistic and have already started planning for the restaurant's future. "We're devastated by what's happened, but we know that we can come back from this," said Gail Donovan. "We've got a lot of support from the community and we're determined to rebuild the restaurant even better than before."

The Donovans have promised to keep their customers updated on the progress of the rebuild and hope to reopen as soon as possible.
