chatgpt: Anthony Bourdain, the late celebrity chef and travel show host, caused quite a stir in New Mexico after making controversial comments about the beloved local dish, Frito pie. A Frito pie is a simple, yet delicious snack that consists of a bag of Fritos, filled with chili and topped with cheese. During an episode of his show, "Parts Unknown," Bourdain described the Frito pie as "feeling like holding a warm crap in a bag." The comment immediately upset locals who were proud of their hometown dish. Many took to social media to express their disappointment with the celebrity chef's remark. Not only did Bourdain insult the dish, but he also claimed that it wasn't even a New Mexico creation. According to him, Frito pie originated in Texas, which only added fuel to the fire. "I mean, if you're going to insult our food, at least get the facts straight," said Maria Garcia, a local resident. Despite the controversy, Bourdain did admit that the Frito pie tasted delicious. He even went as far as to say that "it's like a happy marriage of chili, cheese, and Fritos." The Frito pie has been a popular snack in New Mexico for decades, especially in high school football games and state fairs. It's a meal that's easy to eat on the go and doesn't require any utensils, making it a perfect snack for outdoor events. Many people were outraged that Bourdain would make such comments about the dish without fully understanding its significance in the local culture. Some even called for him to issue an apology, but Bourdain never did. Despite the controversy surrounding his comments, Bourdain's feedback on the Frito pie has generated a lot of buzz for the dish. Some restaurants in New Mexico have even started serving their own versions of the snack, hoping to capitalize on the newfound interest in the dish. In the end, it's important to remember that food is subjective, and what one person finds distasteful, another person might find delicious. Even if Anthony Bourdain didn't appreciate the Frito pie, many locals will continue to cherish it as a beloved part of their culture.
