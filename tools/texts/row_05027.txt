article: (CNN) -- Waterlogged Vermont and northern New York braced for more rain a week after Tropical Storm Irene destroyed roads and sent floodwaters cascading into homes and businesses. A flash flood watch for the region has been issued for Sunday evening through Tuesday morning, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Abundant moisture from Tropical Storm Lee, moving up from the Gulf of Mexico, will interact with an approaching cold front to produce widespread rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with localized amounts of 4 inches possible, Morris said. A flash flood watch means conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding. Although the forecast was too far out to show precisely where the heaviest rain might fall, "it could be trouble," especially for the southern part of the state, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. "The ground is already saturated and some of the road beds have been washed out." Irene killed 43 people from Florida to New England as it marched up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend, dumping torrential rain. Some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. Swiftwater rescue teams have been put on notice, Bosma told CNN on Saturday. The state and towns are already in an emergency operations mode because of Irene. "It's all hands on deck," Bosma said of road crews, which have been busy across the state with emergency repairs. National Guard engineers and other personnel, including a contingent from Maine, are working this weekend on bridges and thoroughfares. Towns are being informed of the latest weather conditions, Bosma said. Power outages in Vermont from Irene were down from a high of 50,000 to about 300 Saturday, he added. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A flash flood watch has been issued for several counties in the northeastern part of the United States. The watch went into effect on Sunday evening and covers areas that were ravaged by Tropical Storm Irene several years ago. Emergency officials are already preparing contingencies to ensure that residents are safe. The flash flood watch is a result of an approaching storm that is expected to bring heavy rain and strong winds. The storm is predicted to hit the region on Monday and could dump up to three inches of rain in some areas. Emergency officials are concerned that the heavy rain could cause rivers and streams to overflow their banks, leading to flash flooding. The targeted counties include those located in the Northeastern region of the United States, such as Massachusetts and Connecticut. These are the areas that were most severely ravaged when Tropical Storm Irene hit in late August 2011. Irene was a Category 3 hurricane that hit the East Coast, causing widespread devastation. Emergency officials are already preparing contingencies to ensure that everyone in the affected areas remains safe. Local authorities are urging residents to be alert and stay tuned to local news channels for updates. They are also warning individuals to be cautious when traveling in the affected areas, as roads and bridges may become flooded, making travel dangerous. Residents near rivers or streams should be particularly vigilant and prepare for the possibility of flooding. Emergency officials recommend that homeowners take precautionary measures including moving valuable belongings upstairs, unplugging appliances, and avoiding driving in flooded or standing water. The flash flood watch will remain in effect until the storm passes and all warnings or advisories have been lifted. Emergency officials are encouraging residents to take this warning seriously and prepare for the worst. By working together, individuals and communities can weather any storm that comes their way.
