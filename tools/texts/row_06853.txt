Walking free: Taylor has been handed a three-month jail sentence suspended for a year with supervision . 'She claimed someone had stopped to help her, that she was in considerable pain, and had managed to hobble home.' Taylor admitted perverting justice in June last year. She was handed a three-month jail sentence suspended for a year with supervision on Monday, October 1. Recorder Slater told her: 'I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion the custodial threshold has been passed. 'But having regard to your previous good character, that you were under considerable pressure at the time, and that custody would have disastrous consequences for you, your five-year-old son and your accommodation, it seems to me the most appropriate sentence is to suspend that term of imprisonment.' It was brought to light that Taylor was out of work at the time of the incident. Graham O’Sullivan, defending, said the lies that followed had 'got out of control'. He said: 'The van driver did drive onto the zebra crossing when she was about halfway across but that does not justify the exaggeration she subsequently perpetrated. 'It’s clear she was soon having second thoughts. She was not persistent in pressing the civil claim for compensation.' Taylor 'claimed someone had stopped to help her, that she was in considerable pain, and had managed to hobble home.'

chatgpt: A woman in the United Kingdom has been caught faking an injury during an attempted scam to claim compensation from a driver. Kayleigh Taylor, a mother-of-one and night-care assistant, pretended to be hit by a van while crossing the road on a zebra crossing. CCTV footage revealed that she had slowed down before throwing herself to the ground and holding her leg in apparent agony. According to reports, Taylor quickly made her way to a nearby convenience store and called paramedics to attend to her injury. She also contacted her solicitor to initiate legal proceedings against the driver of the van, claiming compensation for her supposed injuries. The incident took place in January 2021 in the town of Scunthorpe in North Lincolnshire. However, the police were informed of Taylor's deceit, and an investigation was put in place. The CCTV footage obtained by investigators showed that Taylor had clear and ample opportunity to cross the road safely but instead chose to feign being injured. Taylor ultimately admitted to her wrongdoing, pleading guilty to fraud. Despite the seriousness of Taylor's offence, she is set to escape imprisonment for her actions. The court heard that Taylor was a night-care assistant and had suffered from depression and anxiety in the past. The judge was also informed that she had lost her job and was struggling financially, which could have led to the attempted scam. Nevertheless, the judge stated that Taylor's behaviour was unacceptable and ordered her to carry out 120 hours of community service. She was also ordered to pay a fine of £85 and to pay the legal costs incurred by the defendant of £300. The driver whose van Taylor had attempted to claim compensation from was not charged with any offences. This case highlights the dangers of attempting to commit insurance fraud, and the importance of CCTV and other forms of surveillance in identifying such attempts. Insurance fraud is a serious crime that not only affects insurance providers and their clients but also society as a whole. False or exaggerated claims can lead to higher premiums, which makes insurance less affordable for many. In this instance, the criminal behaviour of Taylor not only cost her her job but also led to her being convicted of fraud. The court’s decision to order her to carry out community service and pay a fine sends a clear message that fraudulent insurance claims will not be tolerated, and those who try to cheat insurance companies will face legal consequences. In conclusion, the attempted scam by Kayleigh Taylor to claim compensation for an injury she did not suffer is a reminder of the importance of honesty in our dealings with insurers. Taylor's actions were a deliberate attempt to defraud, and she will now face the consequences of her deceit. Fraudsters should beware that justice will catch up with them, and they will pay the price for their wrongdoing.
