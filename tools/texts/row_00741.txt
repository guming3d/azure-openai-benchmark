article: By . Sian Boyle . It appears to promote the idea that women can’t park. But officials hope they won’t be complaining when it means they get a prime spot in the centre of town. These extra-large parking spaces have been created in a £60million scheme to make Seoul, in South Korea, more female friendly. Women only: A £60m scheme in Seoul, South Korea, has designated parking bays for women only, which are marked with pink outlines and a figure wearing a skirt . The spaces, dubbed ‘she-spots’, are longer and wider – 8ft 2.5in rather than 7ft 6.5in – than standard and are marked with bright pink outlines and a female logo. They will also receive better lighting and be placed closer to shops. The authorities say they created the spaces for safety reasons, and not because of women’s reversing skills. Though it is not clear whether men who park in the spots will incur a fine. The scheme in Seoul will also see . pavements resurfaced with a ‘slightly spongy material’ that makes them . easier to walk on in high heels. As part of the effort, around 7,000 new toilets just for women will also be installed across the city. Some South Koreans welcomed the news, particularly as the spots will be located near shopping mall elevators and escalators. But others reacted angrily. The measures have sparked accusations of sexism similar to that which officials in the German town of Triberg were met with in 2012 when they introduced a similar programme. The Assistant Mayor for Women and Family Affairs Cho Eun-hee told the Korea Times newspaper: ‘It is like adding a female touch to a universal design and make things more comfortable for women.’ China, Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia, Austria and Italy also have women-only parking spots. Australia doesn’t have spots reserved for women but they do have ‘family’ car parking spots in shopping malls for parents with infants. Triberg Mayor, Gallus Strobel, said he was accused of ‘male pig-headedness’ because the female spots were better lit and wider, while the male versions were flanked by concrete pillars and could only be reversed into. Triberg’s Mayor, Gallus Strobel, told Der Spiegel that two spaces in the town would be too difficult for women because they required drivers to reverse diagonally between a pillar and a wall. ‘I am happy, and it looks like we’ve hit a raw nerve in society,’ he said. ‘It’s been a great marketing gimmick. Women can come here and prove me wrong, and while they’re at it they can see the town’s attractions.’

chatgpt: In an effort to promote safety and ease of access for female drivers in Seoul, South Korea, the city has introduced a new parking scheme that designates specific parking spaces for women. Dubbed "she-spots," these extra-large parking spaces are marked by pink lining and a skirted woman symbol. These "she-spots" are not only larger, but they are also better lit and strategically placed closer to shops and other amenities. The woman symbol is intended to specifically designate these parking spots for female drivers, while the closer proximity to shops encourages more women to take up driving and provide a safer route for them to do so. The Seoul Metropolitan Government claims that the scheme is not simply designed to help female drivers find parking spaces more easily, but more importantly to increase their safety, particularly at night. Women often feel wary and insecure when parking, especially in secluded or dimly lit areas. These protected parking spaces are meant to provide women with peace of mind when parking their cars, reducing the risk of harassment, theft or other dangers. According to the city's transportation department, the idea for these "she-spots" was sparked by a survey conducted back in 2010, in which women reported feeling uneasy and vulnerable when parking in unlit, isolated areas. The new designated parking spots aim to tackle this issue by providing a more secure location for females to park safely. Although this initiative has won plaudits from many, some have criticized the new scheme, arguing that it perpetuates gender stereotypes and reinforces the notion that women need extra help when it comes to driving and parking. Critics also argue that the city could have done more to ensure all parking spaces were well lit, without resorting to gendered spaces. However, despite the criticisms, many women drivers have welcomed the new parking scheme. One female driver expressed her appreciation, stating that the new design increased her confidence when parking and that she no longer dreads the prospect of parking at night. The design has also garnered attention from other parts of the world, with some countries considering implementing their own version of the "she-spot" parking system. In conclusion, the introduction of "she-spots" in Seoul, South Korea, is intended to provide female drivers with greater convenience and peace of mind when parking their cars, while also promoting greater safety for women in general. Whether the new scheme can overcome criticisms that it perpetuates gender stereotypes or reinforces a sense of female helplessness remains to be seen. For now, however, the "she-spots" initiative looks set to provide thousands of women with a safer and more secure parking experience.
