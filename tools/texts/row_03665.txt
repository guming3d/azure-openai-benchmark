article: On Boxing Day it was the batsmen and on Saturday the bowlers but Sri Lanka's punishment at the hands of New Zealand remained consistent at the Hagley Oval. Having seen Brendon McCullum take to their attack as though it were a Twenty20 on day one of this opening Test, the tourists would have hoped for some quality time in the middle on day two. But, after New Zealand checked out on 441 all out, they quickly collapsed to 138 all out themselves and were forced to bat again in the day.

They fared better then, reaching 84 for none at the close, but remain 219 behind with three days to go. Dimuth Karunaratne was the first man to go just four balls in for a duck, getting trapped playing across the line by Trent Boult (three for 25). Kaushal Silva was quickly back with his opening partner, going in the same way to the same man for four.

Kumar Sangakkara was unable to hang around and make things better, caught at third slip for six off Boult to leave his side 15 for three. Lahiru Thirimanne at least added some runs before he went, making 24 before Tim Southee had him caught at second slip, while Niroshan Dickwella made only two before holing out. Prasanna Jayawardene got to 10 but hit Neil Wagner to gully, before Angelo Mathews - the only man with credit as he got to 50 - hit Wagner to third man where he was taken.

After that it was over quickly enough, with Tharindu Kaushal (six), Dhammika Prasad (18) and Suranga Lakmal (two) unable to make a better fist of it. Karunaratne at least made 49 and Kaushal Silva 33 in an unbeaten second knock after New Zealand opted not to bat again immediately, but plenty of work remains to be done. New Zealand had added only 15 to their overnight score but lost three wickets, Mathews (one) and Lakmal (two) taking them.

chatgpt: New Zealand showcased their batting proficiency against Sri Lanka on the third day of the second Test match at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo. The Kiwis were in commanding form as they amassed a mammoth total of 441 runs in their first innings, with their captain skipping Kane Williamson scoring an unbeaten 168. Sri Lanka started their innings confidently, but the New Zealand bowlers managed to tear through their top order, leaving them struggling at 46/4. Despite a resilient fifty from Angelo Mathews, the Sri Lankan team could only manage to put up 138 runs on the board, trailing by 303 runs.  The visitors, who had already secured the series after winning the first Test, then enforced the follow-on, forcing Sri Lanka to bat again on the same day. The hosts were in dire need of a miracle to escape humiliation, but the Kiwis bowlers continued their dominance, restricting Sri Lanka to 84 for no loss at the close of day three.  Skipper Dimuth Karunaratne and his opening partner Lahiru Thirimanne managed to survive the day, but the deficit still looms large, and with two full days of play remaining, they face an uphill struggle to avoid defeat. Mathews was the only Sri Lankan batsman who seemed to have an answer for the New Zealand bowling attack. He top-scored with 50 runs, but his efforts proved fruitless, as the Sri Lankan middle-order collapsed under intense pressure from the Kiwis. On the other hand, New Zealand's batting performance was exemplary, with Williamson leading from the front with his epic unbeaten 168, ably supported by Ross Taylor, who scored 50 runs. Tom Latham, BJ Watling, Colin de Grandhomme, and Mitchell Santner all chipped in with crucial contributions as well. The Kiwis have been unstoppable in the series so far and have outclassed their opponents in every department of the game. The Sri Lankans have been unable to respond to the Kiwis' level of intensity, and their poor batting display has cost them dearly throughout the series. With Sri Lanka trailing by 257 runs going into day four, it's unlikely the hosts can avoid a defeat unless they stage a miraculous comeback in the game. On the other hand, New Zealand is in prime position to secure another comprehensive victory and push for a whitewash in the series. All said and done, the Kiwis have been impressive so far, and it will come as no surprise if they finish the job on Monday and claim their first Test series win in Sri Lanka since 1984.
