Murray has been handed a favourable draw to begin his Wimbledon title defence and will face Belgian David Goffin in the first round, who is a talented ball striker but has made his biggest career impression on clay.

Murray could have a major headache in the quarter finals where he could come up against last Sundayâ€™s Aegon champion Grigor Dimitrov or the relentless Spanish scrapper David Ferrer. The Scot first expected seed in the third round is Roberto Bautista Agut, although it could be the in-form German Tobias Kamke instead.

chatgpt: Tennis fans had a treat on Friday morning as they witnessed Andy Murray train with his coach Amelie Mauresmo at SW19. The Wimbledon champion appeared in high spirits as he prepares to defend his title at this year’s competition. With his fans and critics alike keeping a close eye on his every move, Murray's practice on Friday morning was as relaxed as it was focused. His team left no stone unturned in ensuring that the Scot is perfectly prepared to take one match at a time and retain the Wimbledon crown. Murray's road to another Wimbledon final was given a boost when he drew Belgium's David Goffin as his first-round opponent. Murray has never lost to Goffin in his career, and he will be comforted by this fact as he prepares for the first-round match. Goffin, the World No. 78, could prove a tricky opponent, but Murray's record at Wimbledon is exceptional. Despite facing a tough draw in the coming rounds, he remains among the favorites to lift the trophy this year. Fans at SW19 were excited to see Mauresmo working with Murray once again after the duo's successful partnership last year. The Frenchwoman’s influence on Murray's game is well documented, and it seems that the Scot is once again ready to take advantage of her vast experience in the sport. Murray and Mauresmo’s partnership is a unique one, with Mauresmo being one of the few female coaches currently working with a top male player in the game. However, results from last year’s Wimbledon tournament proved that this partnership can produce excellent results and bring home major trophies. The draw for the 2016 Wimbledon tournament looked favorable for Murray, with potential tricky tests coming in the form of Nick Kyrgios, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and Milos Raonic in the latter stages. However, the Scot knows that he has to take it one match at a time and not get too far ahead of himself, a lesson he learned at the French Open earlier this year. Murray has won Wimbledon twice, in 2013 and 2016, and it seems that he is ready to add another title to his impressive haul of major trophies. With his coach by his side and his fans roaring him on, Murray will feel that he has every chance of adding another Wimbledon title to his collection.
