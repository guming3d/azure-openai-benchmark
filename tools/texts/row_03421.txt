article: By . Alexandra Klausner . Millennials may not be getting jobs because they value their smart phone more than they value things like personal hygiene and body odor. In data released on Monday by the Bank of America Trends in Consumer Mobility report, 1,000 adults were interviewed about how they value objects in their everyday lives. Only 87 per cent said that deodorant was important to them compared to 93 per cent who said that a smartphone was important. Millennials may bot be getting jobs because their smart phones than they acre about wearing deodorant . 91 per cent said that toothbrushes were important. Older adults cited deodorant and smartphones as equal in their everyday lives with the toothbrush ranking the highest importance at 95 per cent. NBC interviewed Susan RoaAne, the author of How to Work a Room, a book that gives workforce hopefuls advice on how to land a job. 'If people can smell you before they see you, you aren't getting the job,' said RoAne. Employees who let their personal hygiene slip after getting hired are also less likely to get promoted or get hired in a position that requires face to face contact with clients or CEOS. To make things even more difficult for recent graduates, unemployment in the workforce is high. The number of youths in the work force continues to drop and it may be because they don't wear deodorant or don't want to work . Older adults said that they cared about wearing deodorant just as much as they cared about using their smart phone . Data from May claims that unemployment among 25 to 34 year olds was 6.7 per cent. Unemployment went up a bit from April where it slightly lower at 6.6 per cent. Unemployment for those aged 20-24 is 11.1 per cent which is up from 10.6 per cent. Unemployment for all adults aged 20 and older is 5.8 per cent. Even though deodorant may keep the younger generation from entering the workforce, some evidence suggests thatÂ  millennials don't even really want jobs. Steve Toback, the managing partner of Invisor Consulting, told NBC that millennials have their own version of entrepreneurship where they don't even need to leave their 'parents basement.' 'What entrepreneurialism is for many of them is hanging out in their parents' basement or their childhood bedroom with their smartphone, calling themselves the CEO of this one-person company,' said Tobak. 'It's sad, but you don't need personal hygiene when you're the only person in the business.' Toback says that even while starting a business is admirable, getting some experience working for another company before starting one's own is a good idea. 'Experience is the best teacher,' said Toback. 'But buy some deodorant before you get out there.'

chatgpt: A recent report by Bank of America has revealed some interesting insights about consumer mobility trends among different generations. The report surveyed 1,000 adults from different age groups, and found that the younger generation has slightly different priorities compared to the older one. According to the report, only 87 per cent of millennials considered deodorant to be important to them, while a whopping 93 per cent said that a smartphone was important. This trend came as a bit of a surprise to many, as personal hygiene has always been considered one of the basic necessities of life. However, it seems that younger people are prioritizing their digital lives over their physical ones. On the other hand, the report found that older adults still consider personal hygiene to be just as important as a smartphone, if not more. This shows that the older generation has a better understanding of the importance of hygiene and self-care, and they are not letting technology overshadow their physical well-being. The report further showed that the differences in attitudes towards personal hygiene and technology were not just limited to deodorant and smartphones. The survey also asked participants about their preferences for other consumer goods such as toothpaste, hygiene products, and home appliances. In general, younger generations were found to be more focused on technology-driven products, while older adults still prioritized traditional necessities. The findings of the report have raised some important questions about the changing attitudes of consumers towards different products. It seems that the rise of technology has had a significant impact on people's perceptions of what is important or necessary in life. While smartphones and other digital devices have undoubtedly transformed the way we live, they have also led to a certain level of dependency and addiction that can have negative effects on our mental and physical health. The Bank of America Trends in Consumer Mobility report may serve as a wake-up call for younger generations to prioritize their physical well-being and self-care over their digital lives. The report may also serve as a reminder for older generations to embrace technology and its benefits while also maintaining a healthy balance between their digital and physical lives. In conclusion, the report by Bank of America has highlighted some important trends in consumer mobility and attitudes towards different products. While the findings may seem surprising at first, they offer a valuable insight into the changing priorities of consumers in our digital age. The report may also serve as a call for people to reflect on their own priorities and strike a healthy balance between technology and personal hygiene.
