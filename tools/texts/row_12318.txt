Those from Robbie Williams' home town order the largest sized condoms, followed by their neighbours in Leeds and Manchester. But when it comes to girth, it's Bristol chaps who claim the top prize, followed by those in Oxford, Leeds and Newcastle. Men from Stoke-on-Trent, such as Robbie Williams, have the longest manhoods in Britain, a survey has revealed . The survey, of 20,000 men by an online condom retailer,  found a staggering four inch difference in the circumference of the . smallest and largest men. The findings are said to be the most . accurate set of size data recorded, avoiding the 'brag factor', as men who . took part were buying custom-fit condoms. However the survey, from condom makers TheyFit, does suggest the average man on the street may be deluded when it comes to his size. It found the average British man is . only 5.1 inches long, rather than the often quoted average of six . inches, while the average girth (circumference) is 4.7 inches. In fact, 26 per cent of men are less than five inches when . erect, while 53 per cent are between five and six inches. Twenty one per . cent of men claim to be longer than six inches. Men from Stoke-on-Trent ordered the largest condoms from the company's . web store, which stocks 95 different sizes of prophylactic. Sizes range . from three to 9.5 inches long and fit girths of 3.5 inches up to 7.5. Fortunately . for chaps paranoid about their manhood, the size is marked on the . packet with a discreet code, rather than a measurement in inches. Joe . Nelson, founder of the website, said: 'Our anonymised data represents . the most accurate survey of penis sizes ever collected. 'Previous studies have relied on self-reported measurements from men, leading to an issue of "size exaggeration". 'But men buying our condoms are much . less likely to do this for two reasons - firstly because they are . parting with money for a custom fit condom and secondly because of our . size code system (rather than labels like small, medium and large), . there's simply less focus on whether someone is bigger or smaller - it's . all about getting a custom fit. The problem of fit with standard condoms has long been recognised - a study published in the Lancet in 1993 called for different sizing - while a study in 2010 reported 45 per cent of men complained that their condoms did not fit.

chatgpt: A recent report from an online retailer has revealed the surprising findings regarding men in the UK and their choices in condom size. The report shows that men in the North West are ordering the largest sized condoms, with those in Leeds and Manchester placing second and third respectively. Meanwhile, men in the South West are considered to be the widest, followed by Oxford and then Leeds. The findings come from a top condom seller that analyzed data from their online store, which sells a variety of condom brands and sizes. The report found that the average man only measures 5.1 inches long when erect, instead of the commonly assumed 6 inches. This indicates a discrepancy between perceived size and actual size. Despite the average size, men in the North West showed a preference for larger condoms, with sizes ranging from 6.5 inches to 9 inches. Leeds and Manchester followed with similar preferences. Meanwhile, those in the South West region preferred condoms with a larger width, measuring between 52mm and 60mm. Oxford and Leeds tied for the second widest region. The report has sparked a range of reactions, with some individuals questioning the need for such large condoms. Others have pointed out that the differences in size preferences could be attributed to cultural or regional factors. Regardless of the reasons behind the preferences, the findings have prompted discussions regarding sexual health and education. Experts have emphasized the importance of properly fitting condoms in order to ensure protection against sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies. The report also sheds light on the topic of male body image and the unrealistic expectations that many men hold regarding their own size. The average size of 5.1 inches demonstrates that size is not everything and that other factors contribute to sexual pleasure and satisfaction. As the conversation surrounding condom size and sexual health continues, it is important to remember that ultimately, the choice of condom size should be based on individual needs and preferences. Safe sex practices are key to maintaining a healthy sexual lifestyle for all individuals.
