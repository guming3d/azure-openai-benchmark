article: (CNN)  -- A 23-year-old beauty queen and seven men arrested in vehicles loaded with weapons and cash near the central Mexico city of Guadalajara have been transferred to Mexico City, the state news agency said Wednesday. Laura Zuniga and seven men were found in vehicles with guns and $50,000, Mexican police say. Laura Zuniga and the men were traveling Monday night in two vehicles that contained AR-15 assault rifles, 38-caliber specials, 9 mm handguns, cartridges and $50,000 in cash, said Luis Carlos Najera Gutierrez de Velazco, secretary of public security for the state of Jalisco. Police, who had received a tip that armed men were in a home, detected the vehicles in the city of Zapopan as authorities were en route to investigate the call, Najera said Tuesday. Inside one of the vehicles, authorities found Angel Orlando Garcia Urquiza, 29, who is Zuniga's boyfriend and the brother of "one of the greatest capos [bosses] of narcotraffic," Ricardo Garcia Urquiza, a member of the Juarez cartel already in police custody, Najera said. All eight were filed before the news media Tuesday. Zuniga, wearing blue jeans and a gray sweater, raised her handcuffed wrists to cover her face in a police picture.

They were transported in a heavily armed 30-vehicle convoy late Tuesday to Guadalajara International Airport and flown to Mexico City, the official Notimex news agency reported. The federal organized crime team in Mexico City will investigate, and the suspects will face arms charges, Najera said. Zuniga is from Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, a center of drug activity. In July, she won the title Our Sinaloa Beauty. That gave her the right to compete two months later in the national Our Mexico Beauty in Monterrey, where she won "The Election of the Queens," one of five special recognitions, and came in third overall. In October, she won the title "Hispanoamerican Queen 2008" in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Mexican newscasts referred to her Wednesday as "Miss Pistols" and likened her situation to "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." According to the Nuestra Belleza Mexico Web site, she is to represent Mexico in next year's Miss International contest. A statement issued Wednesday by Lupita Jones, director of Our Mexico Beauty, said the organization will wait to see what happens in the legal system. "In order to determine the situation with Miss Laura Zuniga, Our Mexico Beauty will be watching the case and will take appropriate action once the results of the authorities' investigation are known," said the statement, published on the Web site for CNN affiliate Televisa Mexico.

chatgpt: The Mexican news is buzzing with the latest arrest of a beauty queen who is now being referred to as "Miss Pistols". Laura Zuniga along with seven men were arrested on weapons charges after being found with weapons and $50,000 in cash in their possession, according to the police. The arrest was made late on Monday, 22nd December, after the group was stopped in their vehicles at a military checkpoint in Zapopan, near the city of Guadalajara. Upon further investigation, the authorities found a large amount of cash in the car and several weapons including AR-15 rifles and .45 caliber pistols. Mexican beauty queen, Laura Zuniga is now facing charges of violating federal arms laws, along with seven men who were arrested with her. Laura Zuniga, a student of communication and 23-year-old model, was crowned Miss Sinaloa in July 2008 and was set to represent Mexico in the Miss International contest next year. Authorities are currently investigating the case to determine what connection, if any, the group had to the country's notorious drug trade. Zuniga, and the seven men who were arrested with her, have been questioned by federal agents to determine whether they were acting as couriers or providing armed protection for a drug cartel. This is not the first time that a beauty queen has been allegedly connected to drug trafficking in Mexico. In September 2008, Miss Baja California, Maria Susana Flores Gamez, was killed in a shootout between the military and suspected drug traffickers. Miss Pistols' arrest is the latest indication of the escalating drug-related violence in Mexico as it grapples with a surge in drug-related crime in recent years. The Mexican government has launched a massive crackdown on drug cartels, which has led to the arrest of several high-ranking members of these gangs as well as seizures of millions of dollars worth of drugs and weapons. This arrest has gained widespread media attention, with several news outlets across the globe picking the story up in their headlines. It has sparked a debate on the involvement of beauty pageants in criminal activities and raised questions about the safety of contestants in such events. While Laura Zuniga's future in the beauty pageant circuit is now in question, it is important to note that she is currently facing serious criminal charges that could lead to a significant jail term if found guilty. However, the investigation is still ongoing, and it is not yet clear whether Miss Pistols had any direct involvement in the drug trade or was simply caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The outcome of this case will likely have far-reaching implications for the Mexican beauty pageant industry, as well as the country's ongoing fight against drug trafficking. It is a story that will continue to be followed closely by both local and international media outlets in the coming months as more details emerge.
