article: A woman who accused Bright Eyes singer Conor Oberst of raping her when she was a teenager a decade ago now says she made the story up. Joan Faircloth sent a notarized statement to Oberst's lawyer Monday recanting what she wrote online starting last December. "The statements I made and repeated online and elsewhere over the past six months accusing Conor Oberst of raping me are 100% false," the Durham, North Carolina, woman wrote. "I made up those lies about him to get attention while I was going through a difficult period in my life and trying to cope with my son's illness." The allegations were "republished by countless media outlets around the world, thus further perpetuating the untrue depiction of Oberst as a rapist," said a defamation lawsuit filed by Oberst against Faircloth in February.  "To add insult to injury, certain media outlets published stories in which Faircloth's defamatory false statements were characterized as true, and in which Oberst's fans were actually encouraged to stop supporting his musical career." Court records show that Faircloth never responded to Oberst's lawsuit, which called her a "pathological liar" and asked for at least $1 million in damages.  A judge issued a default judgment in Oberst's favor earlier this month. Faircloth's story was first published in December on the website OXJane.com under the title "It Happened to Me: I Dated a Famous Rock Star & All I Got Was Punched in the Face," the lawsuit said.  Faircloth wrote that Oberst "took advantage of my teenage crush on him" when she was introduced to him at a concert when she was 16 and he was in his 20s.  She wrote that " Conor took a lot from me including my virginity, my dignity and self esteem." Faircloth later published statements saying that the singer's attorneys offered her "hush money" to keep quiet about the rape. Her statement on Monday recanted all of her claims. "I publicly retract my statements about Conor Oberst, and sincerely apologize to him, his family, and his fans for writing such awful things about him," Faircloth wrote. "I realize that my actions were wrong and could undermine the claims of actual sexual assault victims and for that I also apologize. I'm truly sorry for all the pain that I caused." Oberst, 34, is described by Rolling Stone as "a pain-strumming poet of emo."  His group Bright Eyes first found success in 2002 with the album "Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground." The singer-songwriter did not immediately to CNN's request for comment on Faircloth's retraction. Bright Eyes' 'The People's Key' review .

chatgpt: Conor Oberst, the American singer-songwriter known for his emotional poetry in his music, recently experienced a victory in court after a woman, Joan Faircloth, admitted to making up lies about him for attention. The accusation initially started when Faircloth shared her story on an online forum claiming that Oberst had sexually assaulted her 10 years ago. This led Oberst to sue Faircloth for defamation, as he vehemently denied the allegations and questioned the motives behind the false claim.  Earlier this month, a judge issued a default judgment in favor of Oberst after Faircloth failed to respond to the lawsuit. This meant that the accusations against Oberst were officially dismissed and that he was awarded damages for the harm caused to his reputation. Faircloth's statement, admitting to making up lies about Oberst, was a significant factor in the judge's decision. With this admission, Oberst's legal team argued that the accusations must have been driven purely by a desire for attention and not based on any facts or evidence. Rolling Stone magazine describes Oberst as a "pain-strumming poet of emo," with his music often featuring highly personal, introspective lyrics. He has been a well-known name in the industry, both solo and as a member of groups such as Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band and Bright Eyes. Oberst's victory in court is a strong statement against false allegations and the impact they can have on a person's life and career. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the issue of sexual assault and harassment, leading to a rise in victims speaking out and seeking justice. However, it is crucial to remember that false accusations can be just as damaging, and every claim must be thoroughly investigated to ensure the truth is uncovered. The fact that Faircloth admitted to making up the allegations against Oberst highlights the importance of taking evidence seriously and not blindly believing every claim. Oberst's case also highlights the need for individuals to protect their reputation and seek legal action when necessary. In today's world, where information can be spread quickly through social media and the internet, a single false allegation can have a disastrous impact on a person's life. Overall, Conor Oberst's victory in court provides an important reminder that not every accusation is true, and the consequences of baseless claims can be severe. The importance of investigating evidence thoroughly and seeking justice for all parties involved cannot be overstated.
