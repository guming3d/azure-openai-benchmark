article: Teenage heptathlon star Morgan Lake has pulled out of England’s team for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, partly because her father is not allowed to stay in the athletes’ village. Lake’s father, Eldon, is also her coach and would therefore have been eligible for accreditation, but would have only been allowed day passes into the athletes’ village. Team England will provide chaperones for all athletes at the Games who are under 18 — including 13-year-old diver Victoria Vincent and weightlifter Rebekah Tiler, 15 — but there is no scope for parents or guardians to stay among the expected 6,500 athletes in the village.

Team: British heptathlon star Lake with her father and coach Eldon Lake . Lake, 17, has just finished her AS Level exams but has already broken Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s British junior heptathlon record. She is also second behind Johnson-Thompson on the Under 20s all-time list after scoring 6,081points in Gotzis, Austria last month. Lake’s preference this summer was to do the heptathlon at the World Junior Championships in Oregon, USA and then the high jump in Glasgow, but British Athletics would not allow her to double up. She will now hope to be selected for Great Britain’s team at the World Juniors from July 22 to 27, — a single-sport, much smaller event than the Commonwealth Games. This would allow greater contact with her father and might also be a better option for her exciting long-term prospects.

But Lake cleared a high jump personal best of 1.93m in Loughborough in May, the second highest jump by a British athlete this year, and could yet earn her first senior international vest this year at the European Championships in Zurich next month. The reasons behind Lake’s withdrawal from the Commonwealths should enable England to call up another athlete to replace her and compete alongside Jessica Taylor and Johnson-Thompson, the favourite for gold, if required. Meanwhile, marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe has announced she will race competitively for the first time in more than two years as she targets one final attempt at the London Marathon on 2015. Foot surgery ruled Radcliffe, 40, out of the London Olympics, but she will run in the Worcester City 10k on September 21.

chatgpt: Morgan Lake, the highly talented heptathlete, has decided to withdraw from England's team for the Commonwealth Games. The reason for her unexpected announcement relates to her father and coach, Eldon Lake, not being able to stay with her in the village throughout the duration of the competition.  Eldon Lake is eligible for day passes that would allow him access to the village, but there is a strict rule that prevents any parents or guardians from staying with the athletes. This policy has reportedly caused Morgan Lake a great deal of distress and concern ahead of the competition.  The 17-year-old athlete has just finished her AS Level exams and is undoubtedly one of the leading junior contenders for the heptathlon title. In fact, she has already broken Katarina Johnson-Thompson's British junior heptathlon record, which highlights the potential and talent that she possesses.  However, despite her impressive abilities, Lake has decided that she cannot compete at the Commonwealth Games under these conditions. Her father has been instrumental in her development as a young athlete, and Lake feels that she needs him by her side during the competition.  The decision has come as a surprise to many, especially those who have followed Lake's progress in recent years. She has won numerous medals at the World Junior Championships and the European Junior Championships, and many people believed that she could become a real star at the Commonwealth Games.  However, the policy of not allowing parents or guardians to stay in the village has proven to be a real stumbling block for Lake. The Commonwealth Games Federation has defended the policy, stating that it is designed to protect the privacy and safety of the athletes.  Despite this, many people have questioned whether the rules are too strict and should be relaxed in certain circumstances. The debate over parental access has been ongoing for several years, and this latest incident is likely to reignite the discussion.  For Lake, the decision to pull out of the Commonwealth Games has been a tough one, but it is one that she feels she had to make. She is an exceptional athlete with a bright future ahead of her, and it is hoped that she will return to competition soon and continue to excel.  In the meantime, the Commonwealth Games will undoubtedly still be an exciting and competitive event, with no shortage of talented athletes from around the world vying for glory. The debate over parental access may continue, but for now, the focus will be on celebrating the achievements of those who take part in the competition.
