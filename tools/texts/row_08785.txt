In just over one week, the magnificent tribute to the Commonwealth soldiers will be complete - each poppy a painful reminder of the monumental loss of human life suffered in the conflict. The installation, called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red is the brainchild of ceramic artist Paul Cummins, with setting by stage designer Tom Piper, and is predicted to raise around £11.2million for charity. The installation will remain on display until Armistice Day on November 11, when the last poppy is planted. Afterwards, they will be taken up and posted to their new owners after every single poppy was sold for £25 each to raise funds for military charities, including Help for Heroes and Combat Stress. The very next day, the same army of 8,000 volunteers who began planting them on July 17 will remove each ceramic poppy individually, before sending it off to be washed and posted on to its new owner.

chatgpt: London - The annual Roll of Honour ceremony took place on Monday evening at the Tower of London poppy display. The installation, titled "Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red," has received widespread attention and is now almost fully complete with almost all of the 888,246 ceramic poppies now in place. The Roll of Honour event involves members of the public nominating a fallen soldier, whose name is then read out at the ceremony each evening. Monday's ceremony commemorated Private John Parr, the first British soldier killed during the First World War. Since the installation opened in early August, millions of people have visited the Tower of London in order to see the poppies and pay their respects. Ninety-six-year-old war veteran George Batts, who himself served in Burma during World War Two, was one of those in attendance at the ceremony last night. Speaking to reporters, he stated that he was "amazed" by the display. The installation has captivated people from all walks of life, with many taking to social media to share pictures and their thoughts. One popular hashtag on Twitter, #TowerPoppies, has been retweeted over 17,000 times. However, the poppy display has not been without controversy. Some critics have accused the organisers of being "overly sentimental," while others have argued that the installation risks glamorizing war. In response to these concerns, the project's creators have stated that their intention was simply to create a "thought-provoking" artwork which would encourage people to reflect on the sacrifices made by those who fought and died during the conflicts of the past century. Despite the criticisms, the poppy installation appears to have tapped into a deep sense of national sentiment. British Prime Minister David Cameron visited the site earlier this year and said that he was "moved" by the display. The poppies are due to be removed from the Tower of London on 11th November, the day on which Britain traditionally marks Armistice Day. However, it is expected that the installation will later go on tour, providing people around the country with an opportunity to see the artwork. In conclusion, the annual Roll of Honour ceremony at the Tower of London poppy display provides an important opportunity for people to reflect on the sacrifices made by those during the conflicts of the past century. While some have criticised the installation for its sentimentality, it has undoubtedly captured the imagination of millions of people around the world, and enabled us to think more deeply about the enormous impact that war has had on our society.
