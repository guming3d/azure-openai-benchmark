chatgpt: Tragedy struck a Tulsa, Oklahoma family on Monday when 26-year-old Christa Engles was fatally shot in the head by her young son. The boy, whose age has not been released, reportedly found a high-caliber handgun and fired a single shot, hitting his mother as she was changing the diaper of her youngest child, a one-year-old daughter. The body was discovered by Engles' mother-in-law, who lives in the home. It is not clear how long the young boy had been in possession of the gun before the incident or how he managed to locate it, but authorities are investigating. Engles' husband, Brian, was out of the state at the time of the shooting. He and his wife had recently celebrated their five-year wedding anniversary, and family members say they were devoted to each other and their children. The tragic incident has prompted renewed calls for stricter gun control laws. "This is exactly the kind of senseless violence that we need to be preventing," said local activist Sarah Jackson. "It's heartbreaking that a young boy was able to access a firearm and use it in this way." Others, however, argue that the blame lies not with the gun but with the parents who failed to properly secure it. "This is a tragedy, no doubt about it," said gun enthusiast and NRA supporter John Smith. "But it's also a reminder that responsible gun ownership is absolutely essential." Investigators are now trying to piece together what happened in the moments leading up to the shooting. They are interviewing family members and examining evidence from the scene, including the gun itself. Meanwhile, friends and neighbors are rallying around the Engles family, offering support and condolences. A crowdfunding campaign has been set up to help cover funeral expenses and other costs associated with the tragedy. The death of Christa Engles is a devastating reminder of the dangers posed by unsecured firearms, particularly in households with young children. It also underscores the urgent need for lawmakers and gun owners alike to take steps to reduce the risk of accidental shootings and prevent future tragedies.
