A former law student stole her next door neighbour's identity to carry out a  £100,000 luxury car scam. Stephanie Lane used Susan Cooper's personal details, which she obtained from a  bank statement delivered to her in error, to apply for credit for high-value  vehicles. Newcastle Crown Court heard the 24-year-old applied for finance for a £50,000  BMW, a £40,000 Audi, a £10,000 BMW sports car and a £5,000 Volvo in her  neighbour's name. Scene: Stephanie Lane's case was heard at Newcastle Crown Court where she was handed suspended jail sentence . Despite the applications being granted by the four showrooms she visited, the  mum-of-two's plan to get her hands on the vehicles was foiled when the  companies asked for extra confirmation of her identity. Lane, of Marsden Way, Seaham, who has 10 GCSEs and three A levels, including  law, was arrested after details of the finance agreements were received by Miss  Cooper. Lane pleaded guilty to four charges of fraud during a two week period in  February. Mrs Cooper told police she was left under enormous stress and worry about what  impact the scam will have on her future credit rating. She said she was disappointed a neighbour would act in such a way. Her statement said: 'She never even attempted any explanation or apologised for  her actions. 'It is very difficult for me to see Stephanie Lane, knowing she was the person  responsible for causing me such stress and worry.' Busted: Lane's plans to purchase a top-of-the-range BMW were foiled when the company asked for more ID . Judge John Evans said Lane's education had been a success and told her: 'On the  face of it you appeared to be someone who was destined for a life which would  be fulfilled and would certainly be honest. 'It is difficult to comprehend what was going through your mind when you  embarked on this series of attempts to obtain valuable cars.' Lane was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, with 250  hours unpaid work and a three month night time curfew. Nick Cartmel, defending, said the scam was 'clumsy and inadequate' as Lane used  many of her own personal details, including her address, on some of the  applications. Mr Cartmel said Lane has two young children to care for and added: 'She is a  non violent, non sexual offender who I would ask the court to give a chance to. 'She is genuinely remorseful.'

chatgpt: Stephanie Lane, a 27-year-old resident of Lancashire, has been sentenced to a suspended prison term after conning several high-end motor vehicle companies by using her neighbour's personal details to secure luxurious cars worth thousands of dollars. Lane, a mother of two, resorted to using the name, address, and other details of her neighbour, Susan Cooper, to create false documents, including driving licences, to present to the vehicle companies as part of her attempt to buy top-of-the-range cars. Her plan worked for some time, with Stephanie having already secured several cars, including a Range Rover Sport and a BMW M Sport. It wasn't until the owners of the companies asked for additional identification that Stephanie's crimes were eventually exposed. The companies, which included Porsche, Audi, and BMW, contacted Susan Cooper, Stephanie's neighbour, to verify her information. Cooper, who was unaware of Stephanie's fraudulent activities, was left stunned by the news that several motor vehicles had been purchased using her personal details. Speaking to the Lancashire Post, Susan Cooper said that she had never even received an apology from Stephanie for using her details without her consent. Susan also expressed her disappointment in Stephanie's lenient sentence. Stephanie Lane was handed a 12-month suspended sentence by Judge Simon Newell at Burnley Crown Court. The sentence means that Stephanie will not serve any time in prison unless she commits another offense during her one-year probation period. During the sentencing hearing, Judge Newell acknowledged Stephanie's efforts in turning her life around and called for her to pay Ms Cooper a sum of compensation for the harm caused. "This was a serious offense, and I hope that you have learnt your lesson. I’m glad to hear that you are trying to put your life back on track. You have two young children and it is important that you stay out of trouble for their sake," Judge Newell said. The judge also warned that further dishonest acts would have serious repercussions, saying, "If you commit any offence while on probation or show any lack of cooperation, I’ll activate the suspended sentence and send you to prison." Stephanie's case underscores the dangers of identity theft and the critical role personal information plays, especially in motor vehicle transactions. The consequences of such crimes can be dire and lead to irreversible damages, both for the victim and the perpetrator. Victims of identity theft are encouraged to report the incident to the relevant authorities and take preventive measures to safeguard their information.
