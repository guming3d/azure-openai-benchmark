article: By . Richard  Shears . A British sea captain was behind bars on a remote island in Papua New Guinea last night after being arrested in connection with the sinking of one of his ships last year, in which 162 people drowned. Peter Sharp, originally from the Shetland Islands, was ordered to surrender his British passport before being locked up on the island of East New Britain where he has been charged with 162 counts of manslaughter by criminal negligence. He was also charged with sending an unseaworthy vessel, the 259 ton Rabaul Queen, to sea, before it sank off the coast of Morobe Province in February last year. Tragedy: 162 people drowned after the Rabaul Queen, owned by British national Peter Sharp, capsized off the coast of Morobe Province in February last year . Police said at the time that they did not know exactly how many people had died as it was believed there had been a number of children under the age of three on board whose names were not recorded on the ship's manifest. Mr Sharp, 69, who has lived in Papua New Guinea for a number of years, was arrested after a prolonged police investigation and a Commission of Inquiry into the sinking of the vessel, owned by his company, Rabaul Shipping. A four man police team, led by Detective Chief Inspector Ben Turi, arrived in East New Britain earlier this week and took Mr Sharp into custody.

Owner Peter sharp has been charged with 162 counts of manslaughter . Following a lengthy interview he was locked up in a police cell in the town of Kokono as his lawyer and family tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain bail for him. The Commission of Inquiry found in September last year that the Rabaul Queen was not seaworthy, unsafe and should never have departed on its final voyage. The commission found that weather and sea conditions at the time she ship capsized were gale force and it should not have been at sea. Tragic: The incident happened when the ferry was travelling between two different parts of Papua New Guinea . The inquiry found that Mr Sharp had demonstrated that he had little or no respect for people, including those in authority. Reports said that his 'gross disrespect' was reflected in the 'appalling and inhumane conditions' in which he was prepared to let passengers on the Rabaul Queen travel and might explain in part why he was prepared to compromise the safety of passengers on board his ships. New Guinea Islands Divisional Commander Anton Billie said today that Mr Sharp was 'innocent until proven guilty and the matter is now before the courts.'

chatgpt: Peter Sharp, the owner of the MV Rabaul Queen ferry, now faces 162 counts of manslaughter by criminal negligence. The unfortunate incident that led to the charges took place in February 2012, when the ferry capsized and sank, resulting in the deaths of 162 people on board. Sharp also faces charges of sending an unseaworthy vessel to sea. This comes after an inquiry found that the vessel was unsafe and should not have been sent out in gale-force conditions. The incident happened when the MV Rabaul Queen was sailing from the city of Kimbe to Lae, both located in Papua New Guinea. The tragedy struck in the middle of the night and the ferry was quickly submerged. Many passengers were sleeping when the boat began to capsize and the chaos that ensued made survival almost impossible. The people on board were mostly local workers who were going home to celebrate the Chinese New Year with their families. The inquiry into the incident found that Sharp had not taken enough steps to ensure that the MV Rabaul Queen was safe to use. The vessel had several structural deficiencies which would have been noticed had proper maintenance been carried out. The report showed that the ferry capsized because it was not balanced properly, with cargo not stowed properly. In addition, the inquiry found that Sharp was aware of the gale-force and dangerous weather conditions, which were predicted to worsen. Despite this knowledge, he still allowed the ferry to embark on its journey. It has been suggested that this was because he was motivated by profit over the welfare of the passengers. The charges brought against Sharp are an indication that the authorities will not tolerate negligence on the part of those responsible for the safety of vessels. Speaking on the matter, the police prosecutor, Sylvester Kalaut, said that the accused had displayed "a wanton disregard of the safety of the passengers and crew" of the ferry. The charges are an indication that those responsible for the lives of others must operate within reasonable limits of care and caution. Many families have been left devastated by this tragedy and the charges brought against Sharp will not bring their loved ones back. However, it is vital that those responsible are held to account, as it serves as a deterrent to others in similar positions. The trial of Peter Sharp is one that will attract global attention, as it raises questions about the safety standards of vessels. It is hoped that the trial and eventual verdict will help to provide some closure for the families affected by this tragedy. In conclusion, the decision to charge Peter Sharp with 162 counts of manslaughter by criminal negligence and sending an unseaworthy vessel out to sea is a reminder that safety matters. It sends a clear message to all that steps must be taken to protect the lives of passengers and crew. The charges reveal the importance of timely maintenance of vessels and ensuring that the weather conditions are closely monitored before embarking on any journey.
