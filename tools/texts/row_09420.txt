chatgpt: A man who adapted his cars to become petrol tankers to steal fuel from petrol stations has been sentenced to eight months in prison. Ryan Lewis, 28, from Bradford, drove between petrol stations, filling up £130 at a time before fleeing the scene. Lewis had adapted both his Ford Focus and Ford Transit van into tankers to hold the stolen fuel. Lewis was caught in the act by police officers patrolling the area. The officers spotted Lewis driving his Ford Transit van, which had a large tank in the back, and became suspicious. When they followed him and saw him filling up from a petrol station before driving off without paying, they knew something was up. The police officers followed Lewis to another petrol station where they saw him repeat the same thing. This time, the officers were ready for him and pulled him over as he drove away from the petrol station. They searched his van and found over 600 litres of petrol stored in the tank. Lewis was arrested and charged with theft, as well as driving without insurance, and driving without a licence. He pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to eight months in prison at Bradford Crown Court. The judge who sentenced Lewis said that his actions were "reprehensible" and that he had shown a complete disregard for the law. He added that stealing fuel from petrol stations was a serious crime and that Lewis had caused significant disruption to the petrol stations he had targeted. The petrol stations affected have said that they are pleased with the outcome of the case and that they hope it will deter other people from attempting similar crimes. Lewis's case is a reminder that crime does not pay and that the police take theft very seriously. The public is urged to report any suspicious behaviour they see, and to never attempt to take the law into their own hands.
