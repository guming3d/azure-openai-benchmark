Electronic tags are being put on hospital bedding because nearly £400,000 a year is being lost on missing linen. Tags are being put on 300,000 sheets, gowns and pillowcases to stop them disappearing from NHS wards and operating theatres. The tagging is being implemented by an NHS laundry which was fed up after spending £390,000 last year replacing bed sheets and gowns not returned by its hospitals. Aneurin Bevan University Health Board's laundry service, Green Vale, in Cwmbran, South Wales, is adding electronic tags to hospital bedding in a bid to cut the bill for replacing lost and stolen items . A variety of reasons were blamed for the vanishing sheets and gowns including petty theft, staff throwing them away and patients taking them home. Now Aneurin Bevan University Health Board’s laundry service, Green Vale, in Cwmbran, South Wales, has fitted radio frequency identification tags to the 300,000 pieces of linen. Health Board facilities manager Alan Dudley said: ‘It will help detect inappropriate disposal or quickly and accurately assess the stock available. ‘The disappearance of the items may be because it has been disposed of by staff who may consider it too soiled to launder, stolen, or left with patients when discharged home. ‘In an effort to reduce these losses, bed linen, patient gowns and theatre wear is being tagged to enable it be traced accurately to and from hospitals.’ The tags will allow scanners to count the pieces being dispatched and received by the laundry and also to detect linen lost in waste bags or stored in cupboards. The service is tagging 300,000 sheets and hospital gowns after spending £390,000 on replacements last year . Mr Dudley said: ‘This will allow Green Vale to identify at which sites losses are occurring and to work with staff to determine the actual causes and take action to prevent these. ‘Where losses continue then health boards will be charged for replacing the linen providing an incentive to take effective action to reduce the cost to NHS Wales of lost linen. ‘Harnessing technology in this way demonstrates how we in the public service can do things differently and better.’

chatgpt: Green Vale, the laundry service of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board in South Wales, has taken a high-tech approach in managing its linen inventory. The company has fitted radio frequency tags to 300,000 pieces of linen, enabling accurate tracking of its whereabouts. The new system has been introduced to combat the issue of lost and stolen items. Last year, Green Vale spent a staggering £390,000 on replacing items that had gone missing. The introduction of the RFID tags aims to significantly reduce this cost. By attaching the tags to the linen, Green Vale can monitor every piece of inventory in real-time. The tags communicate via radio frequency and store a unique identification number for each item. As each piece passes through the laundry facility, its movement is tracked by the system, providing an accurate record of its location. The implementation of the new technology follows a successful trial period, during which staff captured data from 100,000 tagged items. The results showed that losses were significantly reduced when compared to items without a tag. The system has benefits beyond reducing losses, however. With accurate tracking of inventory, Green Vale can now better manage its stock levels. This ensures that there is always an adequate supply of linen available and that items are being used efficiently. It also reduces the need for excess inventory, which can be costly. Managing linen inventory can be a time-consuming task, and the implementation of RFID technology is set to significantly reduce the workload of Green Vale's staff. In addition, it will allow for a faster turnaround time for laundry, which is important in a hospital setting where clean linen is crucial for maintaining hygienic conditions. The move towards using technology in laundry services is not unique to Green Vale. Many hospitals and healthcare facilities are adopting RFID tagging to manage their linen inventory. The technology is also being used in other industries to track goods through the supply chain. Overall, the introduction of RFID tags to Green Vale's linen inventory is a positive step towards the efficient management of hospital resources. With reduced losses, better inventory management and faster turnaround times, the hospital is poised to provide better service to its patients.
