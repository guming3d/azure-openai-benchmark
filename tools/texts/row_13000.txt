'Sam is a homely, private, loving mother of four children aged six, four, two and one,' they said. 'She is hard-working, always presentable and this is completely out of character for her. 'She would never walk out and leave her children. If anyone knows where she is or what has happened, please contact the police.'

Detective Inspector Neil Devoto, from Dorset Police, said: 'We are extremely concerned for Samantha and while we are hoping for the best, sadly we believe she may have come to some harm. 'We have arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of her murder and he is currently being questioned. We do not know at this time Samantha's whereabouts. The young woman's family described her as 'a loving mother' and said her disappearance was 'out of character' 'Samantha's disappearance is completely out of character. She has never gone missing before and, from what we understand, it is almost unfathomable that she would have left her four young children. 'We also know that Samantha made heavy use of her mobile phone and social media and I would urge anyone who has had any correspondence with her since 3pm on Wednesday to call Dorset Police.' He added: 'I am calling on the public to check their garages, garden sheds and outbuildings in the area in the event Samantha may have taken refuge and fallen unwell.'
