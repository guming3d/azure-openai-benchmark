article: Drink-drive crash: Tracy Watts was four times over the legal alcohol limit when she crashed her sports car . A police officer is facing jail after she admitted crashing a sports car while four times over the drink-drive limit after binge drinking on a bottle of vodka. Tracy Watts was arrested after crashing her MG TF into a bollard along Southend seafront, Essex, while heavily drunk. Watts admitted she had drunk a bottle of vodka when questioned by cops at the scene of the early evening crash. The 31-year-old appeared at Southend Magistrates’ Court today wearing a black suit, white blouse and sky blue jumper. She hung her head as she appeared in the dock and pleaded guilty to a single charge of drink-driving. Watts, who worked as a WPC for City of London Police, was warned she faces up to six months in jail when sentenced. Lead magistrate Roger Harbidge said: 'This makes for very disturbing reading and it is only good fortune you did not injure anyone else. 'You must understand a custodial sentence is very likely in this case.' Watts will now have to wait to discover her fate while a full probation report is prepared. The court heard how Watts collided with a bollard along Eastern Esplanade, in Southend, at around 7.15pm on March 26 this year. Police and an ambulance rushed to the scene where Watts admitted to officers from Essex Police that she had consumed a bottle of vodka before the crash. No other people were injured and Watts was rushed to a local hospital and a blood sample was taken. She recorded a blood-alcohol level of 320mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - four times over the UK drink-drive limit of 80mcg per 100ml. Watts, from Shoeburyness, Essex, resigned from her role as a City of London police officer less than a fortnight after the crash.

chatgpt: A police officer who crashed her car after drinking a bottle of vodka has been warned she faces jail. WPC Tracy Watts admitted drink-driving after she was found to be twice the legal limit when her car collided with a parked vehicle in Southend, Essex. The 45-year-old had been on a night out and drank the vodka before getting behind the wheel. She was initially charged with dangerous driving, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison, but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of drink-driving. At a hearing at Basildon Magistrates' Court, the prosecution said Watts had been seen driving in an "erratic" manner before the crash. She swerved across the road and narrowly missed colliding with other vehicles. Watts was breathalysed at the scene and found to have 80 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms per 100 millilitres. The police officer, who has been suspended from duty, told the court she had been under "great pressure" at work and had turned to alcohol to cope. She said she was "shocked and ashamed" of her actions and apologised to the court. Watts, who has worked for Essex Police for 22 years, was warned she faces a custodial sentence when she is sentenced later this month. The prosecution said her actions had been "extremely serious" and called for a prison term. District Judge Anne Goldspring said: "The fact that you are a police officer makes it worse. You have let yourself down, your colleagues down and your profession down." The judge granted Watts bail on the condition she doesn't drive or consume alcohol until her sentencing on March 22. Essex Police said in a statement: "We expect our officers to uphold the law and act with integrity and honesty at all times. It is disappointing when an officer falls short of these standards." Drink-driving is a serious offence that can have devastating consequences. According to government statistics, in 2019 there were 5,554 accidents involving at least one driver over the legal alcohol limit, resulting in 220 deaths and 1,230 serious injuries. Drink-driving can also lead to a criminal conviction, loss of driving licence, and can impact on employment prospects. It is important to never drink and drive, and always arrange alternative transport if you plan on drinking.
