article: Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Two soldiers were killed and 14 others were injured Tuesday when a bomb planted under a military bus exploded in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, authorities said. The soldiers were on their way to work from another district of the capital. Three of the injured are in critical condition, authorities said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Violence continues on a daily basis in Sanaa, with thousands of troops still stationed on the streets. "Security has deteriorated over the last two months, and people are worried. Troops are in the streets, but in the wrong place in the wrong time," said Ahmed Bahri, a senior official in the opposition Haq Party. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network. Al Qaeda has stood behind a string of attacks on government troops but denied responsibility for a bus explosion that killed five soldiers last year. Tuesday's bus blast is the latest incident to rock the Yemeni capital in less than a week. On Sunday, two powerful explosions shook Sanaa, with one blast near the French embassy and the other near the Defense Ministry. Nearby houses were damaged and four civilians were injured. The Supreme Security Committee said Monday that the explosions were caused by rockets launched from rural areas surrounding the capital. Two Westerners, a German and a Briton, have been kidnapped in Sanaa in the past three days. The government says it has no information on their whereabouts. Neither embassy concerned has commented on the kidnapping incidents. The German was studying Arabic at a language center in the old city of Sanaa, while the Briton worked in the development sector in Yemen, Interior and Foreign Ministry officials said. Yemen has witnessed unrest since early 2011, when mass protests first broke out. Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced out of power a year later, after 33 years in office. Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa; CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

chatgpt: In the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, two soldiers lost their lives and 14 others were injured in a bomb blast that targeted a military bus. The attack occurred on Sunday morning, and no group has yet claimed responsibility for the incident. Authorities reported that the explosive had been placed beneath the bus, and it went off as the bus traveled through a densely populated area close to the district of Sawan. Emergency services rushed to the scene, and the injured were taken to nearby hospitals. This attack comes amidst a weekend that saw two explosions in Sanaa, prompting concerns about rising instability in the city. Additionally, reports have emerged that two Westerners were kidnapped in the capital over the weekend. The Yemeni authorities have been grappling with a number of security challenges in recent years. The country is facing a prolonged conflict between Houthi rebels and the Saudi-backed government. This situation has allowed extremists groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS to strengthen their presence in the country, and they continue to launch attacks against civilians and government targets. The United Nations has expressed concern over the escalating violence in Yemen, calling on all parties to respect international human rights and humanitarian law. Speculations about the identity of perpetrators behind these attacks are rife, with some pointing their fingers at extremist factions that have been battling for power in Yemen. While neither Houthi rebels nor the government have claimed responsibility for this particular attack, both groups have been implicated in similar incidents in the past. The ongoing insecurity threatens to destabilize Yemen further, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the country. The UN has warned that millions of people in Yemen are facing starvation, and the fighting has disrupted medical services, education, and essential supplies. With these concerns in mind, it remains to be seen what steps the Yemeni authorities will take to address these security challenges and protect civilians from harm.
