A benefits cheat who claimed he was so disabled that he could not turn over in bed was caught out after officials spotted him playing in the local football league. Pete Iron pocketed more than £48,000 after telling welfare officers that he could only walk with a stick for 40 yards and fell frequently. But undercover investigators filmed the  43-year-old – nicknamed Pistol Pete – putting in  energetic performances as the star midfielder  for Sunday league team Solent Lions FC.

Iron, from St Helens, on the Isle of Wight, admitted failing to notify changes of circumstances to obtain benefits between 2005 and 2011 when he appeared before magistrates. However, the bench decided its sentencing powers were not enough and he was committed to Newport Crown Court. Sentencing him to six months in prison, suspended for a year, and a six-month community supervision order, Recorder John Trevaskis said: ‘I accept this claim did not start out as a fraudulent one but it was incumbent on you to notify your circumstances had changed.’ Iron is repaying the sum in £25 a week instalments, meaning he will be nearly 80 by the time his debt is cleared.

chatgpt: Pete Iron, a 43-year-old man from Hampshire, UK, has been ordered by a court to repay a total of £48,000 in disability living allowance and other benefits that he received fraudulently. Iron claimed that he struggled to walk unaided and needed help to perform basic everyday tasks due to his disability. However, he was caught red-handed playing in midfield for a local football team, Solent Lions FC, contradicting his supposed incapacity. Iron's deceitful behavior came to light when the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) received a tip-off regarding his footballing activities. Upon investigation, it was revealed that Iron had been playing competitive football on a regular basis since 2012, even though he had previously received over £35,000 in disability living allowance, as well as other benefits, such as council tax support and housing benefit. Iron insisted that he still suffered from a debilitating condition, but the court was not convinced. The prosecutor stated that Iron had "deliberately deceived" the DWP and fraudulently obtained funds that were meant for people who genuinely needed support due to their disability. Iron's actions were described as "shameful and disgusting". The judge ordered Iron to repay the full £48,000 at a nominal rate of £25 per week. This means that he will be 80 years old by the time the debt is cleared. The court also ordered Iron to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and issued him with a four-month electronic curfew, restricting his movements at night. The case highlights the importance of ensuring that public funds are used correctly and effectively. Disability living allowance and other benefits are intended to provide much-needed help to those who genuinely need it. Fraudsters like Iron deprive those in genuine need and take advantage of taxpayers' hard-earned money. The DWP has welcomed the court's decision and urged people to report suspected benefit fraudsters. The department has a dedicated team, the Fraud and Error Service, which investigates cases of suspected benefit fraud. Anyone who suspects a fraudulent claimant is encouraged to contact the service, anonymously if preferred. Iron's case also serves as a reminder that fraud investigation and prosecution can be conducted effectively, and that people who try to cheat the system will ultimately face consequences. In this case, Iron's love for football proved expensive as his fraudulent scheme was exposed, and he was held accountable for his actions. The court's ruling against Iron sends a clear message to anyone who might be considering making fraudulent benefit claims. It is important to ensure that public funds are used correctly and that those who are genuinely in need receive the support they need.
