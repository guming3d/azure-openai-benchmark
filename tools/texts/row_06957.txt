chatgpt: Late Tuesday night, 28-year-old Regina Marie Coleman was arrested in Maryland for child endangerment. The police were alerted by a passerby who heard the sound of children crying inside a car that was parked in a mall parking lot around 8 pm. When the police arrived, they found two of Coleman's daughters aged six and three, alone in the locked car. The children were sweaty and flustered, which prompted the police to call for an ambulance. Fortunately, after examination, it was determined that the children were unharmed. During questioning, Coleman initially told the officers that she had only been inside the mall for 10 minutes. She claimed she was searching for a missing wallet. However, upon further investigation, it was found that Coleman had been at a local makeup counter having her makeup done for over 90 minutes.  When asked about her wallet, Coleman was initially evasive. However, the officers searched her bag and found the missing wallet inside. Coleman's actions clearly placed her young children in danger, and could have had severe consequences. The children have since been taken into the care of relatives while social services evaluate whether they can be returned. Child endangerment is a serious offense, and Coleman is set to appear in court where she will face the full weight of the law. Cases of child endangerment are becoming increasingly common in society today. Parents, guardians, and caregivers should be mindful of the welfare of children in their care at all times, and should not leave them unattended, particularly in hot or dangerous conditions. Legal action will be taken against those who put children's lives at risk, as was the case with Coleman.
