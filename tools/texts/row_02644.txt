article: Gregory Hippy, 26, used his garage as a cannabis factory, in which police found 28 plants (pictured) A man whose surname is Hippy has been told he faces prison after police found £8,000 worth of cannabis growing in his garage. Gregory Hippy, 36, converted the garage of his home in Lincoln into an extensive cannabis factory. When police raided the house in May this year, they discovered 28 cannabis plants, which had a street value of £8,000. Magistrates heard Hippy had converted the garage for the sole purpose of cannabis growth. The court heard bricks had been removed from the garage wall and ventilation pipes had been installed. There were also white plastic sheets on the walls, the court was told. Prosecutor Shirley Wilson said: 'The drug experts said there was a strong commercial element to this grow.' The court was told how Hippy found the drug growing equipment in the property when he moved in. Tony Freitas, defending, said: 'He says he bought the seeds on the internet. To his shock, they kept on seeding so he kept on going with it. 'He says all the equipment was at the address from the previous tenant. 'He says he was simply doing it because it was cheaper than buying it.' Hippy admitted producing a class B drug when he appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court, but he denied selling it for profit. He was granted unconditional bail until his sentencing, due to be held at a later date. Magistrates heard Hippy converted the garage (pictured) for the sole purpose of cannabis growth.

chatgpt: A 26-year-old man, Gregory Hippy, has been found guilty of producing a class B drug after police discovered a cannabis farm in a converted garage. Lincolnshire Police raided his home, where they found 28 plants worth approximately £8,000. Hippy admitted to officers that the garage was being used solely for the purpose of growing cannabis. During his trial, Hippy denied any intention to sell the drugs for profit, claiming that the cannabis was purely for personal use. However, the prosecution argued that the sheer number of plants indicated otherwise. The court heard that Hippy had purchased equipment, including lighting and a ventilation system, to facilitate the growth of the plants. In his defense, Hippy claimed that he had been using cannabis for medicinal purposes, to alleviate back pain caused by an old injury. However, this argument was dismissed by the judge, who highlighted that this was not a valid justification for producing an illegal drug. Hippy was subsequently found guilty of producing a class B drug and was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years. The judge also imposed a community order, requiring Hippy to complete 120 hours of unpaid work, as well as a drug rehabilitation program. The police welcomed the verdict, stating that they will continue to take action against those who produce and sell illegal drugs. Chief Inspector Mark Kirwan, who oversaw the investigation, said: "This case demonstrates our commitment to tackling drug-related crime in our communities. We will not tolerate the production and supply of illegal drugs, and will continue to work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice." The case serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of producing and selling illegal drugs. Despite claims of using cannabis for medicinal purposes, the law remains clear on the illegality of such actions.
