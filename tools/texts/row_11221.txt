chatgpt: Former NBA star, Charles Barkley, recently shared a surprising revelation during an interview with Jimmy Fallon. The 51-year-old recounted how he almost passed up on his chance to play with the Philadelphia 76ers back in 1984 because of a salary dispute. According to Barkley, he was offered a one-year deal worth $75,000 by the 76ers at the time. However, he didn't think that was enough and was willing to hold out for a better offer. "I told my agent, 'I don't care what happens, I'm not playing for $75,000!'" Barkley recalled. Despite his stance, Barkley still attended the team's training camp, where he tried to pull a trick by deliberately gaining weight in the hope that he would be cut from the team and could renegotiate his contract with the 76ers. "I gained like 20 pounds in two weeks," Barkley admitted. "I showed up at 304 pounds!" However, things didn't go according to plan, and Barkley's weight gain only helped him secure a spot on the team. Looking back, he couldn't believe his folly. "I said to myself, 'Hell no, now I'm fat and poor!'" Barkley said. Eventually, Barkley signed with the 76ers and played for them for eight seasons. He also went on to play for the Phoenix Suns, Houston Rockets, and the 1992 Dream Team that won gold at the Barcelona Olympics. Barkley's story highlights the financial struggles that young players often face in the NBA, especially when just starting out. While salaries have increased significantly over the years, many players still need to navigate their way through the tricky business of contracts and negotiation. But for Barkley, it all worked out in the end, and he remains one of the greatest players in NBA history. While he may have briefly thought he was "fat and poor," his journey serves as a reminder that success is often the result of perseverance and hard work.
