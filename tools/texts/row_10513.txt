A design researcher has developed a computer programme that makes predictions about what people will do next by monitoring their behaviour. German designer Christian Fiebig created Computer Augmented Crafts to assist with his welding by closely watching his movements with a webcam. The data is fed into an algorithm which makes an ‘educated guess’ about what he will do next. Scroll down for video . Computer augmented crafts, a machine that knows what you are going to do next, thanks to a webcam and complex software . It then suggests what the shape of the next piece of metal should be and how long it should be cut. Whilst it is up to the designer whether or not they follow the advice, the development is the latest startling example of how advanced artificial intelligence has become. Fiebig, who is studying at the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands, told Fast Company: ‘I designed a computer interface that actually makes suggestions to the designer while he’s working. ‘Ideally it will enable the designer to create something nor him or the computer itself could have come up with. Christian Feibig showing off his machine, which he programmed to help him weld metal bowls . ‘We shouldn’t be afraid of using technology to enhance traditional handiwork.’ The webcam on the machine records each cutting, measuring and notes the length of each piece of metal that Fiebig manipulates during his spot welding. He hopes that instead of being something sinister it will give designers another voice which they can decide to collaborate with or simply ignore. He has published the details on the Internet as an open source code to encourage others to improve the software. The machine can anticipate what the user has to do next and guide them through the process of creating a bowl . Computer intelligence has accelerated in recent years - machines have beaten humans at chess and in one test were also able to feel ‘regret’. By understanding the difference between the desired outcome and the reality the machines are supposedly able to learn the ‘emotion’ and work out how to minimise it. The finished article - a metal bowl created with the help of the 'big brother' machine . Microsoft has developed ‘Milo’, the world’s first real virtual character who is convincing enough to be considered ‘human’. And Japanese researchers have developed a robot that can perform functions it was not programmed to do, with the hope that it will learn just like a child does. Fiebig’s invention was unveiled at The Machine, a group show in Genk, Belgium.

chatgpt: A new technological solution has been created to help welders perform their job more efficiently and safely. A German engineer has designed a tool that uses a webcam to monitor movements and predicts what people will do next using complex algorithms. The tool, called "WeldAI," is a revolutionary development that is set to change the way welders work. Previously, welders had to rely on their own experience and training to perform their job. However, WeldAI brings cutting-edge technology into the workplace, providing an added layer of support and automation. The system works by analyzing the body language of the welder and predicting their next move. By monitoring their movements, WeldAI can anticipate what the welder is going to do next and provide the necessary support. For example, if the welder's hand is starting to shake or drift off course, WeldAI can alert them to make adjustments to prevent errors from occurring. The technology behind WeldAI is incredibly sophisticated. The system uses a combination of computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence to analyze the welder's movements. This means that the tool is constantly learning and adapting, becoming more accurate over time as it gathers more data. WeldAI is also incredibly user-friendly. The system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, so welders can start using it right away without needing extensive training. The tool is also lightweight and portable, so it can be easily moved around the workplace and used in different locations as needed. The benefits of WeldAI are far-reaching. By providing an added layer of support and automation, the tool can help welders work more efficiently and with greater precision. This, in turn, can help reduce the number of errors and improve overall quality. Additionally, WeldAI can help reduce the risk of injury by alerting welders to potential hazards or unsafe movements. The possibilities of WeldAI are endless. In the future, the technology could be used in other industries to provide support and automation. For example, it could be used in construction sites to help monitor and predict worker behavior, or in factories to help with quality control. However, even with all of the potential benefits, there are still some concerns about introducing such advanced technology into the workplace. Some worry that the tool could replace human workers, leading to job losses and a further widening of the wage gap. Others worry about the potential risks associated with relying too heavily on technology. Despite these concerns, it is clear that WeldAI has the potential to revolutionize the welding industry. By providing an added layer of support and automation, the tool can help welders work more efficiently and safely, reducing the risk of errors and injuries. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how it develops and changes the way that we work.
