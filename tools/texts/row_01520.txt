Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell has been accused of 'cashing in' by accepting the job of chairman of Frontier Economics, which has been working on Heathrow Airport's third runway bid . Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell has been accused of ‘cashing in’ on his Government connections by accepting a top role with a private consultancy. Critics say there is a conflict of interest in his new job as chairman of Frontier Economics, which has been working on Heathrow Airport’s third runway bid. The leading financial consultancy lobbies ministers on behalf of its high-profile clients, mainly blue chip companies. Lord O’Donnell, who received a peerage when his reign as Britain’s top civil servant ended, takes over from former Downing Street policy advisor Sarah Hogg, who is stepping down after 14 years at the company. It comes at a crucial time for the controversial third runway bid, for which the firm has highlighted the potential economic benefits. A report published by Frontier this month says the UK could miss out on £14billion of trade in the next decade without it. Steve Reed, a Labour member of the House of Commons public administrations select committee, said: ‘There are far too many cases of civil servants taking well-paid jobs in the private sector so they can cash in on their contacts in government.’ During his time as Cabinet Secretary, between 2005 and 2011, Lord O’Donnell presided over a large increase in the number of consultants employed by Whitehall departments. He joined Frontier in 2012 as a senior advisor and was promoted yesterday to chairman. A spokesman for Frontier said he had not been involved in its work with Heathrow, and said: ‘Gus acts in full accordance with the Civil Service rules and his primary focus is to work with the team at Frontier to build the company into an even stronger European economics advisory business.’ Lord O’Donnell, an economist, said he was looking forward to his new role, saying: ‘Not only is Frontier at the forefront of applying economics to tough public and private sector issues, it has an internal culture that is second to none.’ Non-executive board members include Lord Turnbull, Lord O’Donnell’s predecessor as Cabinet Secretary.

chatgpt: Gus O'Donnell, the former Cabinet Secretary, has accepted a top role with a private consultancy, prompting criticism that he is "cashing in" on his connections. O'Donnell has been appointed chairman of Frontier Economics, a move that has raised concerns about a conflict of interest. O'Donnell was Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2011, and was responsible for overseeing the UK Civil Service. He left the role in 2011 and has since worked as a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Critics argue that O'Donnell's new role at Frontier Economics, which provides economic consulting services to a range of clients, including governments and companies, represents a clear conflict of interest. They point out that O'Donnell's former position at the heart of government gives him an invaluable insight into the workings of Whitehall and could allow him to influence policy decisions in favour of Frontier Economics' clients. In response, O'Donnell has stressed that he will not lobby the government on behalf of Frontier Economics, and will instead focus on providing strategic advice to the company. He has also pointed out that he has been appointed on the basis of his skills and experience, rather than his connections. Nevertheless, the appointment has reignited the debate about the revolving door between government and the private sector, with some arguing that it is unethical for former senior officials to take up roles in industries that they previously regulated. Others argue that individuals should be free to choose their own career paths, and that it is up to companies to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest. O'Donnell has defended his decision, arguing that he wants to continue to make a contribution to public policy debates. He also stressed that he will continue to adhere to the government's code of conduct for former ministers and civil servants, which requires individuals to seek advice before taking up new roles. Frontier Economics is one of the UK's leading economic consultancies, and has advised a range of clients, including the European Commission and the UK government. The company is known for its work on competition policy, energy regulation and public policy. The appointment of O'Donnell has been welcomed by Frontier Economics, with chief executive Gus Faucher saying that he is "delighted" to have him on board. Faucher added that O'Donnell's "wealth of experience and expertise" would be invaluable to the company as it seeks to expand its range of services and clients. Overall, while O'Donnell's decision to take up a role at Frontier Economics may be controversial, it is not uncommon for former senior officials to move into the private sector. The important thing is to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest and that individuals continue to adhere to the highest ethical standards.
