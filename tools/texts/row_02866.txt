article: Boaz Myhill started his first Premier League for 10 months on Monday night after Ben Foster injured his calf in training. It was not exactly a good omen for West Brom. His previous four league matches each ended in defeat. Scroll down for video . Boaz Myhill was making his first appearance in the Premier League since December 2013 on Monday night . Myhill was beaten by Fellaini's excellent strike but did at least break his losing streak in the league . Stephane Sessegnon scored his first Premier League goal of the season - and it was an absolute belter. Registering at a shot speed of 62.1mph, Manchester United goalkeeper was left with no chance as West Brom burst into a surprise ninth minute lead. The goal came from a devastating move, which showed how quickly the Baggies can turn defence into attack. It took just under 11 seconds for the home side to work the ball from Boaz Myhill's gloves to the back of David de Gea's net, as Andre Wisdom showed pace and vision to feed Stephane Sessegnon. The Benin midfielder still had plenty to do when the ball reached him on the edge of the box, but his strike gave De Gea no chance. As opposed to Louis Van Gaal, who instructed his team to play a third different formation of the season, Alan Irvine stuck with the 5-2-3-1 system he has employed throughout this campaign. It was also the same outfield line-up that brought him wins against Tottenham and Burnley. Louis van Gaal's tactical adjustment saw United struggle, but his substitutions seemed to work . Van Gaal remained seated in the dugout the entire 90 minutes, while Irvine stood at the edge of his technical area. Angel Di Maria has had a hand in seven goals in six Premier League appearances.

chatgpt: Former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal changed his formation once again, but it failed to spark a win for his team as they were held to a 0-0 draw against West Bromwich Albion on Monday night. The game was marred by a number of contentious refereeing decisions, but it was ultimately the failure of United to create clear-cut chances which caused frustration among their supporters. The game began with United deploying a 3-5-2 formation, with Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Daley Blind making up the back three. However, this formation failed to produce the desired result, with West Brom boss Alan Irvine sticking to a successful 4-4-2 tactic which saw his team control proceedings for large parts of the game. United struggled to create any real opportunities, with midfielder Michael Carrick drawing the ire of supporters for a number of misplaced passes. Boaz Myhill, who had lost his previous four Premier League games, was rarely tested. Van Gaal made a change in the second half, switching to a 4-4-2 formation, but it yielded no immediate results. A number of fouls by both teams highlighted the tension of the occasion, with referee anthony Taylor coming under heavy criticism for some questionable calls. West Brom nearly took the lead through Saido Berahino, who latched onto a loose ball in the area, but saw his shot agonisingly hit the post. United's best chance of the game came from a Juan Mata free-kick, but it was comfortably saved by Myhill. The draw leaves United in fourth place, seven points behind third-placed Arsenal and nine points behind leaders Chelsea. The result will have done little to alleviate the pressure on van Gaal, with the Dutchman already under scrutiny for his team's underwhelming performances this season. Meanwhile, the point earned by West Brom sees them move up to 14th in the league table, four points clear of the relegation zone. Irvine will be pleased with the way his team performed, particularly given their recent poor form. Overall, it was a frustrating night for United and their fans, who will be hoping for a much-improved performance in their next game against Liverpool on Sunday. Van Gaal will need to find a solution to his team's lack of creativity if they are to have any chance of closing the gap on the teams above them. As for West Brom, they will take great heart from a solid performance against one of the Premier League's top sides, and will look to build on this momentum in their next match against Hull City on Saturday.
