article: (CNN) -- Townsend Farms is recalling bags of a frozen fruit mix commonly used in smoothies because they could be contaminated with the hepatitis A virus, the company said in a statement. Townsend's Organic Antioxidant Blend is suspected in an outbreak of the virus that has affected five Western states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thirty-four people have been infected with hepatitis A, and 11 of them have been hospitalized as of Monday. Infections have been reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, the CDC website said Tuesday. Nineteen of the 25 ill people interviewed by the CDC reported eating the Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend. The fruit mix with contaminated ingredients was sent to Costco stores and Harris Teeter stores. At Costco, the recalled codes include T012415 through T053115; consumers can find these on the back of the package near the words "BEST BY." Harris Teeter packages have "BEST BY" codes of T041615E or T041615C. The outbreak has been traced to pomegranate seeds from Turkey that are in the Townsend Farms fruit mix, according to the company statement. The mix contains pomegranate seeds and other produce from Argentina, Chile and the United States. "There is no indication that cherries and other berries are contaminated," said William E. Gaar, an attorney for Townsend Farms. State health departments, the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC continue to investigate. The company was notified about the outbreak Thursday by the CDC, which sent investigators to the Townsend Farms processing plant in Fairview, Oregon, Gaar said. Hepatitis A is usually transmitted via contaminated food or water, or by someone who's infected, according to the Mayo Clinic website. Frequent hand-washing is recommended to limit the spread of hepatitis A. The highly contagious infection inflames the liver and limits its ability to function. "Mild cases of hepatitis A don't require treatment, and most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage," the Mayo Clinic website says. Severe cases can lead to liver failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A annually worldwide. Consumers who may have eaten the contaminated product should contact their doctor, and the product should be thrown away immediately. CNN's Jacque Wilson and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Townsend Farms, a popular organic food company, is recalling their Organic Antioxidant Blend containing frozen fruit following an outbreak of hepatitis A. A total of 34 cases linked to the product are being investigated by health officials. Experts have traced the outbreak back to pomegranate seeds that were imported from Turkey and used in the blend. Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that inflames the liver and limits its ability to function properly. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain, and can last for several weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning to consumers who may have purchased the Organic Antioxidant Blend containing frozen fruit from Townsend Farms, urging them to discard the product immediately or return it to the store for a full refund. The recall affects products sold under the name Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend in 3-pound bags with the UPC code 0 78414 40444 8. The CDC recommends that all individuals who consumed the product purchased between late February and late April 2021 receive a hepatitis A vaccination as soon as possible. The vaccine is effective in preventing infection if administered within two weeks of exposure.  Townsend Farms has released a statement expressing their concern for those affected by the outbreak and apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the recall. The company is cooperating with health officials in their investigation and has suspended the production and distribution of the Organic Antioxidant Blend containing frozen fruit until further notice. The recall serves as a reminder of the importance of food safety and the potential risks of consuming contaminated products. The CDC urges consumers to always wash their hands thoroughly before handling food and to avoid consuming raw or undercooked products, particularly when traveling to areas with a high risk of foodborne illnesses. It is also important to stay informed of any food safety concerns and recalls. Consumers can sign up for email alerts from the FDA or CDC to stay up-to-date on the latest product recalls and safety information. As the investigation continues, health officials are working to identify the source of the contaminated pomegranate seeds and ensure that steps are taken to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.
