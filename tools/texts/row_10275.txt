If you're feeling guilty about taking a break from your text books or revision notes to read this article, relax - you're doing the right thing. Research shows learning is much more effective when spread over time than relying on last-minute cramming. The developing skills of hundreds of thousands of people were analysed as they learned how to play a simple online game. Study: Academics found that learning over time was more effective (file picture) Academics concluded it was better to practice for a while and then have a rest compared to continuously playing in the hope of improving. In fact, leaving an entire day between sessions strengthened performance, rather than weakened it. Professor Tom Stafford, a psychologist from the University of Sheffield who helped analyse the data, said: 'The study suggests that learning can be improved. 'You can learn more efficiently or use the same practice time to learn to a higher level.' More than 850,000 people were monitored as they played Axon, which involves rapid decision-making to click on the correct parts of a screen to grow neurons. Players were found to improve faster when they left gaps between sessions because it allows the brain to file away information. Those who played for two hours on two consecutive days generally did better than someone who practised continuously for four hours, for example. Gap: The results showed that resting for a day improved rather than weakened results (file picture) Professor Stafford said the perception that more is learned by cramming is illusory and recommended taking breaks between study sessions. The amount of time spent learning is not as important as how well the studying is structured, he explained. Up to a quarter of students at some leading universities are estimated to have experimented with 'cognitive enhancing drugs' in the hope of boosting grades. A black market in prescription-only medicines such as Modafinil, a stimulant used to treat sleeping disorder narcolepsy, has sprung up. Medical experts are concerned about the long-term effects, which are not known. Short-term effects include vomiting, headaches, irrational behaviour, palpitations and poor sleep patterns. A separate study last year found 61 per cent of students stayed up late the day before an exam and 40 per cent crammed throughout the night. Around two-thirds changed their diet before exams in the hope certain foods would help boost their memory. This included 53 per cent who started eating oily fish and 46 per cent who had more fruit and vegetables. A third even admitted wearing 'good luck underwear' to improve their exam chances. Revision expert Patrick Wilson said at the time that students should stick to proper revision. 'The best way to feel truly confident and help beat that stomach-churning exam angst is to prepare for each exam in advance, making sure you have a dedicated structure for your revision schedule,' he added.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by Sheffield University suggests that the age-old adage "practice makes perfect" may not be entirely accurate when it comes to learning. The study, which was conducted through an online game platform, analyzed the performance of thousands of individuals and found that those who took breaks between practice sessions actually performed better. The game, which was developed by researchers at Sheffield University, was used to test the effectiveness of spaced learning techniques. This technique is based on the principle that people retain information better when it is spread out over a longer period of time, rather than being crammed into a short period.  The study analyzed the performance of over 2,000 individuals who played the game at different intervals. The participants were divided into three groups: those who played the game without any breaks, those who took a short break of 24 hours, and those who took an extended break of one week. The results of the study were clear: those who took breaks between practice sessions outperformed those who did not take any breaks at all. Specifically, those who took a 24-hour break outperformed those who did not take a break by a significant margin.  The study found that those who took breaks were able to better retain the information they had learned, which in turn made them better performers in the game. The researchers suggested that this is because the brain needs time to process and consolidate information, and taking breaks allows for that process to happen more effectively. The findings of the study have important implications for educators and policymakers. The traditional approach to education has been to cram as much information as possible into a short period of time, but the results of this study suggest that this may not be the most effective approach. Instead, students may benefit more from spaced learning, which allows for breaks between learning sessions. The study's lead author, Dr. Tom Stafford, said: "Our results suggest that taking breaks between learning sessions can significantly improve the retention of information. This has important implications for anyone involved in education or training, from teachers and trainers to policymakers and employers." The study also has practical implications for individuals who are looking to improve their own learning and performance. It suggests that by taking breaks between practice sessions, individuals may be able to improve their own retention of information and performance in a given task. The study is just the latest in a growing body of research that suggests that spaced learning may be a more effective approach than traditional cramming. As technology advances, educators and policymakers will need to continue to adapt their teaching methods to incorporate these new findings and ensure that students are getting the most benefit from their education.
