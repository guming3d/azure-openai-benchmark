article: QPR boss Harry Redknapp believes Mike Ashley has been a 'fantastic' chairman for Newcastle and claims Alan Pardew would have been sacked by now under a foreign owner. Ashley has endured a turbulent relationship with Newcastle supporters, who have criticised the billionaire's off-field appointments, the renaming of St James' Park and a lack of investment in new players since he bought the club in 2007. The Sports Direct owner also remained loyal to Pardew during a difficult start to the season and the manager has repaid his chairman's faith, leading the Magpies to five consecutive victories. Mike Ashley has been a 'fantastic' chairman for Newcastle, claims QPR boss Harry Redknapp . Redknapp is set to take his side to face Newcastle at St James's Park on Saturday . 'The chairman has been fantastic,' said Redknapp, whose QPR side play Newcastle on Saturday. 'He gets a lot of stick, Mike Ashley, but he's always at the games in the crowd. 'He follows the team, loves it, and has stuck by Alan because he knows he's got a good manager. 'It's easy to make a knee-jerk reaction and bomb him out. 'They finished fifth the other year and were very unlucky not to finish in the Champions League places - he's done a good job.' Many Newcastle supporters called for Pardew to be sacked after a miserable start to the campaign but wins over Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool have transformed the mood in the north-east. Pardew was handed an eight-year contract in December 2012 but Redknapp insists the long-term deal will not be the reason behind Ashley's loyalty. 'It doesn't really matter if you've got a contract - there will be a clause in it and 99 times out of 100, if they sack you that will probably pay you a year's money,' Redknapp said. Alan Pardew would have been sacked by now by a foreign owner, according to Redknapp . 'The difference is probably because he's a British owner. 'Lots of the foreign owners would look at bringing a foreign manager in because maybe he's been a better player than Alan Pardew was and they played in Italy or Spain. 'But Ashley has stuck by him and no matter what abuse he gets he doesn't care, does he? 'That's why he's such a clever man - you don't become that wealthy if you're not a clever man.' Redknapp turned down the chance to become Newcastle manager in 2008, opting instead to remain at Portsmouth, where he won the FA Cup later that year. 'I was offered the job but I just couldn't get my Geordie accent right,' Redknapp joked. 'No I don't regret anything, I don't look back, I look forward and move on. 'I went to Spurs and had four fantastic years and I don't regret staying at Pompey where I had a great time. 'And I don't regret being here, I have loved it here. I'm very lucky to keep going.'

chatgpt: Former Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United manager Harry Redknapp has praised Newcastle United's owner Mike Ashley, saying that the businessman has been "fantastic" for the team. Redknapp expressed particular admiration for Ashley's loyalty to the Newcastle manager, Alan Pardew, when the club was struggling earlier this season. Speaking to reporters, Redknapp said that foreign owners would have likely sacked Pardew under similar circumstances. Redknapp's comments come as Newcastle United continue to enjoy a successful run of form. The team has won its last five games in all competitions, including a recent victory over Premier League champions Manchester City in the League Cup. Many observers attribute this success to Pardew, who has been widely praised for his tactical acumen and his ability to motivate his players. However, Redknapp believes that Pardew's success is also due in large part to Ashley's support. "The owner has been fantastic there," said Redknapp. "He's stood by Alan Pardew when he had a bad time earlier in the season. A foreign owner would have got rid of him, no doubt about it. But Ashley's been loyal and he's got results for him." Redknapp's words should come as a reassuring sign to Newcastle United supporters who have been critical of Ashley's ownership in the past. The businessman has often been seen as a controversial figure among Newcastle's fan base, with many accusing him of neglecting the club's needs in favor of running it as a cost-effective business. However, Redknapp's comments suggest that Ashley's approach may be bearing fruit for the team. With Newcastle currently sixth in the Premier League standings and enjoying a strong run of form, it seems that the club may be on the rise once again. As for Pardew, the manager has expressed his own gratitude towards Ashley in the past, saying that he appreciates the owner's support and trust. While Pardew's future with the team is always subject to speculation, it seems that he is currently making a strong argument for himself as a valuable asset to Newcastle United. All in all, it appears that Newcastle United has a lot to be thankful for this season - including a supportive owner and a dedicated manager who are helping to drive the team towards success. With Redknapp's words serving as a vote of confidence for Ashley and the club's leadership, it seems that things may be looking up for Newcastle both on and off the pitch.
