The alleged killer, who is now deceased after committing suicide in a nearby field, is believed to have been connected to the newly-elected mayor of the town. Police are currently investigating claims that the mayor was having an affair with the wife of a constituent, who may have been the motive behind the attack on Leboucher. While the investigation is ongoing, authorities have not yet confirmed any direct link between the affair and the attack. Neighbors of Leboucher are shocked by the news, describing him as a quiet and friendly man who kept to himself. Many residents say that they saw him walking his dog or working in his garden, but they never suspected that anyone could have a reason to hurt him. The mayor has declined to comment on the investigation, but sources close to him have denied the allegations of an affair. Some members of the community have expressed concern about how the scandal could affect the image of the town and the trust placed in public officials. Meanwhile, the police have revealed details about the attacker, who has been identified as a 30-year-old resident of the same town.
