article: Los Angeles (CNN)  -- My rosary-packing mom taught me not to say that four-letter word that begins with "h," not talking about hell but hate. But she forbids lying, too, so I am going to be straight -- I HATE driving on the 405 Freeway. I avoid the 405 like poison oak, or wild-eyed people you randomly meet on story shoots who want you to pitch their product. The 405 is a time bandit, a concrete thief that steals hours as you take agonizing drives in awful traffic. Quakes, riots, Lohan and now this? l live in the San Fernando Valley, but the 405 is a mandatory evil for times when I must head to LAX for CNN trips or vacation. I tolerate the 405 by blasting the radio or stopping at Tito's Tacos in Culver City like it's some oasis. The only thing more horrendous than the 405 is the 405 in rush hour. The only thing more horrendous than the 405 in rush hour is the 405 in rush hour during an accident. The only thing worse than the 405 in rush hour during an accident is to throw in construction. 'Carmageddon' officially on in Los Angeles . The 405 defines relationships. A budding romance might wilt under pressure of having to drive or cross the 405 for a rendezvous. True friends will endure the 405's whims. The 405 tests commitment -- to work, athletic teams and even family. My relatives who are clustered up the 101 Freeway in Solvang and points beyond fortunately have zero reason to drive the 405 to get to my house, But to them, the 405 is a barrier they still must navigate in Encino, like the Alps, or the Straits of Magellan. During "Carmageddon" I will test whether it's faster to fly from Burbank to Long Beach via JetBlue or just drive it. I will win this contest because it takes time to board a plane, and I can mainly avoid the 405. I'll slip around and past it, using the almost as heinous Interstate 5 and the 710 to get to Long Beach. The 405 is almost completely out of range as I maneuver far away from its reach, as if I'm dodging English archers. But for all my abject hate for the 405, I want this billion-dollar HOV lane, improvement and overhaul to work. I am rooting for the pain to be eased by new lanes, bridges, on ramps, off ramps interchanges and attitude.

chatgpt: CNN senior producer Paul Vercammen has expressed his frustration towards driving on the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles. He described that it steals hours from his life and often results in prolonged periods spent in agonizing traffic. Despite his seething hatred towards the highway, he hopes that the planned interruption this weekend will lead to a reduction of the pain and discomfort that it has caused many Los Angeles residents. The 405 Freeway plays a critical role in connecting Orange County and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. It is notorious for its perpetual traffic jams, which are consistently ranked as among the worst in the country. As such, it is not surprising that Vercammen detests driving on it, as it has robbed him of many precious hours. In a recent article, he wrote, "I HATE the 405 Freeway. It steals hours from my life. Agonizing hours spent inching through, stopping, starting, and creeping forward for miles on end. I've driven all over the world, but there is no highway that tests my patience like the 405." Despite expressing his dislike for the highway, Vercammen is also acknowledging that this weekend's planned construction could be a significant milestone in the long-standing quest to fix the traffic congestion on the 405. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is scheduled to start concrete pour operation on the Sepulveda Pass Bridge that will temporarily shut down the northbound and southbound lanes of the 405 Freeway. This news comes as a welcome relief to many Los Angeles residents who have had to cope with the constant traffic congestion on the 405 Freeway. Vercammen observed that there is a sense of cautious optimism that traffic might improve after the construction. "The bus route will be impacted; nearby side streets will suffer. Still, for those who survive or avoid the upcoming traffic maelstrom, this weekend may prove to be the dawn of a new day for the 405," Vercammen said. Metro has assured the residents of Los Angeles that the construction work will be completed successfully while limiting the disruptions it causes as much as possible. The contractor has been working on the Sepulveda Pass Bridge project for over two years to replace part of the aging structure. In conclusion, many Los Angeles residents share Paul Vercammen's frustrations regarding the 405 Freeway's constant traffic congestion. While the planned construction this weekend may cause disruption, it is hoped that it will lead to less pain and discomfort for those who depend upon the highway for their daily commute.
