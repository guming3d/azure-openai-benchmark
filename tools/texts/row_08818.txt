article: The European Tour is beginning a search for just the fourth chief executive in its history after the announcement that George O'Grady will step down. O'Grady, who has been with the Tour for more than 40 years, confirmed on Wednesday that he has asked the board of directors to begin the process to appoint his successor. The 65-year-old, who will remain in his role until that successor is found, became chief executive on January 1, 2005, succeeding John Jacobs - who led the Tour's formative years from 1971 to 1974 - and Ken Schofield, who took over on January 1, 1975.

In a statement released by the European Tour, O'Grady said: "In the aftermath of what I believe to have been the best presented Ryder Cup since my first involvement in the contest at Royal Lytham in 1977, I felt this was the right time to ask the board to begin the search for my successor. "It is my firm belief that, coming towards the end of what has been another incredibly successful season, we are now seeing the green shoots of recovery across Europe and I am pleased that this coincides with all our building blocks, in terms of key television and sponsorship contracts, being in place. "I have agreed with the board to stay not only for the time it takes to appoint a new CEO but also for sufficient additional time after that to see them properly settled in. The board also agreed that, at that stage, I will take up a role as president of international relations which will see me represent the European Tour through the Olympic Games in 2016."

European Tour chairman David Williams added: "On behalf of the board and all of the members of the European Tour I would like to thank George for his contribution to the European Tour and professional golf generally over the last 40 years. "The European Tour and its players are admired throughout the world of golf and George has played a key part in building global relationships and developing the Tour. He has always respected the traditions of the tour and built on the strong foundations put in place by John Jacobs, Neil Coles and Ken Schofield. "The Tour is now embarking on a new phase in its development and that is why George has considered that it is the right time to ask the nominations committee to find his successor." An announcement about the process had been planned for the week of the DP World Tour Championship, but media reports on Tuesday forced the Tour's hand. The Tour said no further comment will be made until the season-ending tournament in Dubai in a fortnight's time.

chatgpt: On Wednesday, the European Tour announced that their chief George O'Grady will be stepping down from his position. O'Grady has led the organization for over a decade and will remain in his role until a successor is found. The news came as a bit of a surprise to the golf world, as O'Grady has been a widely respected figure in the industry. Under his leadership, the European Tour has grown in both size and prestige, and has attracted some of the game's top players to its tournaments. O'Grady's departure will undoubtedly leave a void at the top of the organization. Despite this, the European Tour has already begun the search for a new chief, with a number of potential candidates already being touted for the role. Whoever is eventually appointed will have big shoes to fill, but can take comfort in knowing that they will have the support of an experienced and knowledgeable team behind them. One person who will no doubt be supporting the new chief is George O'Grady himself. After stepping down, O'Grady will take on a new role as president of international relations, where he will continue to be involved in the organization's affairs. In this capacity, O'Grady will be responsible for maintaining relationships with other golfing bodies around the world, as well as representing the European Tour at events around the globe. One such event will be the 2016 Olympic Games, where golf is set to make its return as an official sport after a gap of over a century. O'Grady's new position will see him take on the role of ambassador for the European Tour, helping to promote the organization and the sport in general to a global audience. It is fitting that O'Grady should be representing the European Tour at the Olympics, as he has been a passionate advocate for the tournament's return to the games. He has also been instrumental in helping to establish the European Tour's role in the development of golf in emerging markets, and has worked tirelessly to promote the sport to a wider audience. Despite his many achievements, however, O'Grady remains focused on the future of the European Tour, and the challenges that lie ahead. In a statement released on Wednesday, he said: "I am proud of what I have achieved during my time at the European Tour, but I believe that it is now time for a new leader to take the organization forward. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition, and look forward to continuing to work with the European Tour in my new role." It remains to be seen who will take the reins at the European Tour, but it is clear that the organization is in good hands, both with O'Grady's continued involvement and with the talented team that he has assembled around him. With the support of the golfing community and a new leader at the helm, the European Tour is sure to continue its growth and success in the years to come.
