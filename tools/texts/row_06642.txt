article: People living in Blackpool, Manchester and Middlesbrough are twice as likely to die as other parts of the country, a new study revealed today. Analysis of death rates shows how differences in income, employment and health impact on the life chances in different areas. A new interactive map shows how mortality rates differ, and how improvements in health mean there have been large falls in some areas including Cambridgeshire, Tamworth and Camden. In 2012, the average mortality rate in the UK was 538.6 deaths per 100,000 people. The rate was lower in England (523.9), but 567.8 in Wales, 640.1 in Scotland and 567 in Northern Ireland. The interactive map released by the Office for National Statistics shows how mortality rates have changed across the country from 2001 to 2012 . In England, the North East had the highest mortality rate with 592.9 deaths per 100,000 population, while the lowest was in the South East with 482.8 deaths. The local authority in England with the highest Age-Standardised Mortality Rate was Blackpool (721.0 deaths per 100,000 population) while Christchurch had the lowest (379.6 deaths per 100,000 population). Among men, the death rate in Blackpool was 879.3 per 100,000, Burnley 841.8 and Manchester 836.5. For women the death rate was highest in Middlesbrough (604.8), followed by Burnley (602.7) and Blaenau Gwent (596.9). A new map released by the ONS also shows changes in mortality rates in the decade from 2001 to 2012. Mortality rates for men slumped by 40 per cent East Cambridgeshire, 38 per cent in both Tamworth and Camden and 37 per cent in Epsom and Ewell. For women, Camden saw a 39 per cent fall, Uttlesford was down 35 per cent, Lichfield 33 per cent, Chiltern 32 per cent and Haringey 31 per cent. The ONS said: ‘Substantial variation in mortality rates between different local areas reflects underlying differences in factors such as income deprivation, socio-economic status and health behaviour (for example smoking and alcohol consumption).’ Slide the bar along to see how mortality rates changed across England and Wales between 2001 and 2012.

chatgpt: New data released by the Office for National Statistics has revealed that in 2012, the average mortality rate in the United Kingdom was 538.6 deaths per 100,000 people. While this figure may seem concerning, it's important to note that there were significant differences between regions. The data showed that the Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR) was highest in Blackpool, where 721 deaths were recorded, and lowest in Christchurch, where the ASMR was 379.6. The ONS has stated that these local variations are linked to factors such as income deprivation, socio-economic status, and health. The ONS report highlights that areas with higher levels of poverty tend to have higher mortality rates. In Blackpool, for example, around 30% of households are classified as being in income deprivation, compared to just 3% in Christchurch. This disparity is likely to be a contributing factor to the difference in mortality rates between the two areas. The link between socio-economic status and mortality rates is also evident in the data. The ASMR in areas with higher levels of deprivation was found to be almost double that of areas with lower levels of deprivation. This suggests that those living in more deprived areas may face a range of challenges that impact their health and wellbeing, including poorer access to healthcare and increased exposure to environmental risks. Dr. Richard Allen, head of the ONS Centre for Health and Disability said: "These figures give us an insight into the variations in mortality rates across the country and enable us to identify areas that may require additional support to improve health outcomes for residents." The report highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve the health of those living in more deprived areas. By focusing on issues such as access to healthcare, environmental risks, and socio-economic factors, it may be possible to reduce mortality rates and improve health outcomes for the most vulnerable members of society. In conclusion, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics has revealed significant variations in mortality rates across the United Kingdom. While the average mortality rate may be relatively low, the disparities between regions highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve health outcomes for all. Through a better understanding of the factors that contribute to these disparities, it may be possible to reduce mortality rates and improve the health and wellbeing of communities across the country.
