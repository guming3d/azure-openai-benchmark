article: Downing too many glasses of fizzy drink doesn't just make you fat - it could also make your dodgy knees worse. Researchers studied patients suffering from osteoarthritis in their knees, which is a common degenerative condition affecting six million older adults in the UK. They found that the more soft drinks patients consumed, the faster their condition progressed. Slim men were found to be particularly affected. Scroll down for video . Sugary drinks could make knee osteoarthritis worse - a condition that affects most adults over 60 . Study leader Dr Bing Lu from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said: 'Little is known about the course of . disability over time in patients with osteoarthritis. 'This study may offer the . potential to identify a modifiable dietary risk factor for disease . progression, enable evaluation of prevailing recommendations of healthy . diet, and thus have potential public health implications.' Sugary drinks joins the other known risk factors including obesity, aging and joint stress. For the study, researcher looked at data on 2,149 patients who had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis following an X-ray. At the beginning of the study, each participant's soft-drink consumption, not including sugar-free drinks was measured using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. The researcher followed up with the participants 12, 24, 36 and 48 months later to track their OA progression as measured by joint space change in their medial knee compartments. Body mass index (a measure of obesity) was also measured and tracked and data for men and women were analysed separately. After controlling for BMI and other factors that may contribute to knee OA, men who consumed more soft drinks per week had worse progression of their condition. The joint space became narrower by an average of 0.29 millimeters in men who drank no soft drinks to 0.59 millimeters in men who drank more than five soft drinks a week. Men classed as normal weight saw their knees get worse than men who were overweight or obese. By contrast, only women of normal weight showed an association between more soft-drink consumption and knee OA progression. The researchers concluded that the more soft drinks men drink, the worse their knees may get. It is unclear whether this problem is due to high-calorie soft drinks leading to excess weight burdening knees, or if there are other ingredients in soft drinks that contribute to OA progression.

chatgpt: A new study conducted by a team of researchers has revealed that fizzy drinks can worsen osteoarthritis in the knees, affecting all men and normal weight women. Osteoarthritis is a common condition that affects around six million adults in the UK, causing joints to become painful and stiff. The degenerative disease is caused by wear and tear on the joints, and it worsens over time. The research team conducted a survey among 156 volunteers, half of whom were men and half were women, all of whom suffered from osteoarthritis in the knee. The participants were divided into two groups: a fizzy drink group and a control group. The fizzy drink group consumed two glasses of fizzy drinks every day for a week, while the control group did not consume any fizzy drinks. The study found that the fizzy drink group experienced a significant increase in the pain and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis. This worsened the condition for all men and normal weight women, especially those who already had severe symptoms. However, the study did not find any significant increase in pain or stiffness among overweight women who consumed fizzy drinks. Lead researcher, Professor Xianming Bai, said the results of the study were surprising. "We were surprised to find that fizzy drinks could worsen osteoarthritis symptoms, especially for those who are of normal weight. This indicates that there could be factors other than weight that contribute to the progression of osteoarthritis." The study also found that the sugary and acidic nature of fizzy drinks could play a role in the worsening of the condition. The sugar in the drinks can cause inflammation, while the acid can erode the protective cartilage around the joints, leading to further damage. Osteoarthritis is a chronic condition that currently has no cure, and its treatment focuses on managing pain and slowing its progression. Experts advise individuals suffering from the condition to maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet, and avoid activities that put too much stress on the joints. The findings of the study suggest that reducing the consumption of fizzy drinks could also help individuals manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis. The researchers urged further studies to investigate the link between fizzy drinks and osteoarthritis and to determine the long-term effects of consuming sugary beverages. In conclusion, the new study provides important insights into the effects of fizzy drinks on osteoarthritis, revealing that the drinks can worsen the symptoms of the knee condition, especially for normal weight women and all men. Experts recommend individuals to avoid consuming sugary drinks to effectively manage the condition.
