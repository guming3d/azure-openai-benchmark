article: Ever wondered why a drink of sweet orange juice turns horribly bitter after brushing your teeth? According to experts, the sensation is down to a specific chemical, known as sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), a detergent commonly found in toothpaste. This detergent specifically suppresses sweet taste receptors on the tongue, and destroys compounds designed to inhibit bitter sensations. Scroll down for video . Orange juice tastes horribly bitter after brushing your teeth because of a specific chemical, known as sodium lauryl sulphate, SLS, (pictured) commonly found in toothpaste. It suppresses sweetness taste receptor cells in the mouth and destroys compounds  called phospholipids, which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors . The chemical analysis was carried out by researchers from the American Chemical Society in Washington. In a video, the scientists explained millions of people have experienced the unpleasant combination of brushing their teeth before reaching for a glass of orange juice, only to find the taste is more bitter lemon than sweet orange. They added that the typical human mouth has more than 10,000 taste buds and 100 taste receptor cells. These are designed to detect five different types of taste - sweet, sour, bitter, salty and the newly recognised umami, or savoury. In a video, the scientists explained millions of people have experienced the unpleasant combination of brushing their teeth (illustrated with a stock image) before reaching for a glass of orange juice, only to find the taste is more bitter lemon than sweet orange . The reason why orange juice tastes horribly bitter after brushing your teeth is because of a chemical known as sodium lauryl sulphate. It is found in most toothpaste. This detergent - which makes toothpaste foam - specifically suppresses sweet taste receptors on the tongue. It also destroys compounds in the mouth called phospholipids, which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors. Toothpaste has four main ingredients, which give the paste its consistency. Water adds body, abrasives help get rid of plaque, fluoride prevents cavities and detergent makes it lather or bubble. The most frequently used detergent in toothpaste is sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), which has already been noted for its strange effect on the mouth’s ability to taste. And now the new research has found that SLS suppresses sweetness taste receptor cells in the mouth. It also destroys compounds in the mouth called phospholipids, which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors. The study team said: ‘This opens up a clear pathway for bitter molecules to reach taste receptors in the mouth. ‘This is the most likely reason why orange juice turns from sweet to sour immediately after you brush your teeth.’ The findings were published in the American Chemical Society’s online video journal Reactions.

chatgpt: Toothpaste is not just a morning ritual, but an essential part of dental hygiene. We all know that toothpaste helps clean our teeth and freshen our breath, but few understand what goes into making it. Toothpaste contains four key ingredients that come together to create the perfect blend: water, abrasives, fluoride, and detergent. Each ingredient plays a crucial role in toothpaste's effectiveness. Water is one of the primary ingredients in toothpaste, and it provides the paste's body. Water helps bind the other ingredients together while keeping the paste moist and easy to squeeze out of the tube. Without water, toothpaste would be dry and difficult to spread. Abrasives are the gritty particles in toothpaste that help remove plaque from our teeth. These particles act as a sort of scrubbing agent that helps remove the bacteria and debris that accumulates on our teeth. The abrasives must be strong enough to remove plaque but not so strong that they damage tooth enamel. Fluoride is another essential ingredient in toothpaste, as it helps prevent cavities. Fluoride helps harden tooth enamel and makes it more resistant to acid. It also helps to repair any existing damage that may lead to cavities. Many types of toothpaste contain fluoride, but it's important to ensure that there's a suitable amount for it to be effective. Lastly, detergent is added to toothpaste to make it lather. The most commonly used detergent in toothpaste is sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). While it helps create a pleasing texture and foaming sensation, SLS can suppress sweetness taste receptor cells in the mouth, according to recent studies from Journal of Neurosciences. This chemical also destroys compounds called phospholipids, which inhibit bitter taste. Both these effects combine to make sweet orange juice taste bitter after brushing our teeth. This sensation is a result of SLS interfering with our taste buds' ability to perceive sweetness. The destruction of the phospholipids, which inhibit bitter taste, makes way for bitterness. There are alternatives to SLS; however, they tend to be more expensive, making them less common in toothpaste. The bitter aftertaste from toothpaste can be frustrating, but it's short-lived. Additionally, while SLS may affect our tastes temporarily, it's important to remember that the benefits of toothpaste far outweigh any potential negative effects. Brushing our teeth regularly with toothpaste containing fluoride and abrasives is critical to maintaining good dental hygiene. In conclusion, although we may take toothpaste for granted, it's an essential part of our daily routine. Understanding what goes into toothpaste and how it works can help us make informed choices when it comes to our dental health. While the bitter aftertaste from the most commonly used detergent, SLS, may be bothersome, it's a small price to pay for the benefits of proper dental hygiene.
