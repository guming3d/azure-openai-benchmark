A family branded the 'original neighbours from hell' was finally evicted from their council house today after 97 separate incidents of anti-social behaviour. The four members of the Newell family abused, spat at and threatened to kill residents in Mountain Ash, South Wales, who put up with three years of 'total misery'. A court heard the Newells made so much noise shouting and screaming that their next door neighbours had to watch television with subtitles. Thrown out: After 97 complaints from neighbours the Newell family from Mountain Ash, South Wales, have finally been evicted from this house . People living nearby were left suffering from depression and nervous illnesses caused by the Newell family's behaviour. PC Sian Weyman told magistrates: 'The effect the family was having on neighbours was immense. 'They have been exposed to years of continued noise, banging, shouting, screaming, swearing and recently threats. 'Neighbours have expressed concerns for their personal safety and for their property.' The residents of the terraced house in Mountain Ash, South Wales, were named as 54-year-old Hilary Newell, her two adult sons Matthew Newell and Mark Pugh and her ex-husband David Newell. Merthyr Tydfil magistrates heard police and Rhondda Cynon Taff Council had investigated 97 separate complaints. The Newells were contacted 'on dozens of occasions' including warning letters, one-to-one meetings and interviews in an attempt to resolve the problems. Ordeal: Police said that people nearby became ill because of 'continued noise, banging, shouting, screaming, swearing and threats' But the court yesterday made a premises closure order and said the family should be immediately evicted. They were given until 4pm to remove their personal belongings before the property was boarded up. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'They were the original neighbours from hell. 'They never gave a thought to anyone else living here - they were trouble from start to finish. 'People's lives have been ruined by their awful behaviour - it has been total misery. 'I'm glad the court was tough with them because they've had enough chances.' David Jones, head of protection at Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, said: 'We worked tirelessly to resolve this issue for the benefit of the local community before resorting to this extreme measure.'

chatgpt: A Welsh family has been accused of making the lives of their neighbours a "total misery" with their constant noise and threatening behaviour. The Newell family, who live in a quiet residential area, are reported to have caused years of distress to those living nearby, with reports of banging, shouting, screaming, swearing and threats of violence. According to local residents, the disturbance caused by the family was relentless, with many people feeling unable to speak out for fear of retribution. It is reported that police were called to the area on numerous occasions, but little action was taken to resolve the situation, leaving residents feeling helpless. Speaking to the media, one neighbour described the ordeal as "absolutely awful", with another saying that they had "never experienced anything like it before". Some residents were reported to have sold their homes or moved away from the area as a result of the ongoing noise and harassment. The Newell family have defended their actions, claiming that they were simply "living their lives" and that their neighbours were exaggerating the situation. However, a court heard that a number of incidents had been reported, including one where the family's teenage son threatened to burn down a neighbour's home. The family were eventually brought to court, where they were issued with an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) prohibiting them from causing further distress to their neighbours. The judge also ordered them to pay costs of over Â£3,000. The case has highlighted the challenges faced by those living next to neighbours who show little regard for those around them. While the vast majority of people value their community and work towards maintaining good relations with those around them, a minority can cause significant disruption and distress. The importance of addressing anti-social behaviour in our communities cannot be overstated, with authorities and individuals alike working to ensure that everyone can enjoy a safe and peaceful living environment. Initiatives such as neighbourhood watch schemes and community liaison groups provide support to those who feel vulnerable or isolated, while robust enforcement action can help to deter those who seek to cause trouble. The Newell family have since moved away from the area, with their former neighbours expressing relief that they can now enjoy much-needed peace and quiet in their homes. However, the impact of their actions will be felt for some time, with many residents left shaken and traumatised by the experience.
