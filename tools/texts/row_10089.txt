article: Police are investigating a suspected poisoning attack that killed hundreds of tropical fish in a newly-opened pet shop. Around 300 fish were killed after a thick 'carpet of food' was poured into six tanks at Paws pet shop in Musselburgh, East Lothian. Staff believe a suspicious couple who were left unattended may have deliberately carried out the sabotage. 'Heartbreaking': Sam Lawson, 24, at Paws pet shop in Musselburgh, East Lothian, where 300 fish were killed . The total cost of the damage is estimated at £2,000 as tank filters will have to be replaced. Shop owner Sam Lawson, 24, faced the 'heartbreaking' task of spending six hours removing all the dead fish. She said: 'You wonder what goes through people's minds. 'Even if someone had a problem with me, there is no reason to hurt the animals. This has been an attack on Paws. Sabotage fears: It is thought a thick 'carpet of food' was poured into six tanks at the shop poisoning the fish . 'Whoever did this, it took thought and planning as they were in and out in a matter of minutes.' Miss Lawson said that the tanks were laced with toxic liquid and elevated levels of ammonia were detected in the water. Staff claimed the water had turned an unusual orange colour and many of the dead fish were tropical cichlids worth up to £20 each. No signs of life: Miss Lawson had to spend six hours removing the dead animals from the once-teeming tanks . Dr Martin Brammah, a tropical fish expert, said 'an ammonia spike in the water' was one of many possible causes. He said: 'If you wanted to poison them you could do it quite easily. 'If you have too many fish and then more food is added, ammonia is produced. It could have been a problem with the water supply, or even a lose wire. 'If someone poured something like a can of Irn-Bru in that could easily do it, particularly if the tanks are on a centralised system.' Jenny Quirk, 30, had been supervising the shop while Miss Lawson spent her birthday with her family. She believes that an older man and a younger woman went into the aquarium while she was busy dealing with customers in the front of the shop. She said: 'I feel so awful because I was minding the shop. Sam's the owner and doesn't take a lot of time off and she was away for her birthday. 'She must have thought "I can't even leave the shop for half a day." I feel like I have let her down.' Miss Lawson is now installing CCTV cameras in the store to prevent another attack. A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed a probe had been launched and called for witnesses to come forward. He said: 'Police Scotland officers responded to a complaint from the owner of a pet shop that someone poisoned most of the tropical fish in the shop by putting excess food into the tanks. Enquiries are ongoing.'

chatgpt: A pet shop in East Lothian was the site of a suspected attack that resulted in the death of around 300 fish. Shop owner Sam Lawson discovered the incident after arriving for work on Monday morning. Lawson had to spend six hours removing the dead fish from their tanks. Upon examining the scene, shop staff believe that a man and a woman may have been responsible for the poisoning of the fish. A formal investigation into the matter has also been launched, and the authorities are looking into the possibility of foul play. Mr. Lawson was distraught at the loss of the fish and believes that the incident was a targeted attack against his business. He said, “I just can't believe anyone would do something like this. We’ve had vandalism in the past, but nothing like this.” The extent of the damage caused by the attack is not yet clear, and the shop owners have faced significant financial losses as a result of the incident. The shop is known for its wide range of exotic fish and had a regular customer base that relied on the quality of the store's products. The owners of the shop are now working to replace the dead fish in the tanks and restore their business to its pre-incident level of functioning. They are also hoping for swift action from the authorities to bring the culprits to justice. In response to the incident, animal welfare campaigners have also spoken out about the importance of taking animal cruelty seriously. A spokesperson for PETA said, “This kind of attack is not only cruel but also illegal. We urge law enforcement officials to take swift action to bring those responsible to justice and ensure that animals are protected from such malicious acts.” This incident is not the first of its kind in the wider UK pet industry. In recent years, there has been an increase in pet shops reporting vandalism, thefts and acts of cruelty against animals. This trend is being attributed to the rise in illegal exotic animal trading and the black market for pets. The shop owners are now urging other businesses in the sector to take precautions to safeguard their stores against potential attacks. They believe that it is essential for the pet industry to come together to protect the welfare of animals and ensure that incidents like this do not happen again. The East Lothian police have called on the public to come forward with any information that could help their investigation. They have assured the community that they take incidents like this very seriously and will do everything in their power to find the culprits. Local authorities are also working with the shop owners and are regularly monitoring the area to prevent any further incidents. The incident has highlighted the need for better security measures in pet stores and the importance of holding those responsible for animal cruelty to account. In conclusion, the suspected attack that resulted in the death of around 300 fish at a pet shop in East Lothian has unleashed a wave of concern and anger in the local community and animal welfare activists. The shop owners are now working to restore their business and hoping for swift action from the authorities to bring the culprits to justice.
