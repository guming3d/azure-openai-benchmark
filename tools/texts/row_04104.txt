chatgpt: Anatoly Moskvin, a 52-year-old man from Russia, was arrested after his parents discovered his disturbing obsession. According to local authorities, Moskvin had been collecting dead bodies of young girls for over a decade. Moskvin's parents became suspicious when they visited his home and noticed multiple life-size dolls sitting in his bedroom. Upon further investigation, they discovered that the dolls were not just ordinary playthings but were in fact, mummified corpses of young girls. Moskvin's twisted obsession allegedly began in the mid-90s when he became interested in linguistics and history. He had a particular fascination with cemeteries and would often spend his evenings walking through them, taking note of the names and birth dates of those who had passed away. Over time, Moskvin reportedly began to steal the bodies of young girls who had passed away, bringing them back to his home where he would use various methods to mummify them. He dressed the corpses in clothing and jewelry and placed them throughout his home, treating them like real people. Moskvin's parents claim that they had no idea what their son was doing and were shocked to learn of his sick fetishes. They immediately contacted local authorities who arrested Moskvin and charged him with desecration of graves and dead bodies. Police were able to recover the corpses of at least 26 young girls from Moskvin's home. Some of the corpses had been stripped of their flesh, while others were found dressed in clothing and makeup. Authorities say that Moskvin's obsession with dead bodies is one of the most disturbing cases they have ever seen. They are working to identify the girls whose bodies were found in Moskvin's home and are trying to notify their families. Neighbors and friends of Moskvin were shocked to hear of his arrest, describing him as a quiet and reserved man who kept to himself. They say that they never suspected that he was capable of something so heinous. Moskvin is currently being held in custody and has yet to make a statement in his defense. His parents, who are still in shock, have not commented on the situation. The discovery of Moskvin's sick fetish has sent shockwaves through the community, leaving many questioning how someone could be capable of such gruesome acts. Authorities are urging anyone with information about this case to come forward and assist in the investigation.
