article: Kabil (CNN) -- Millions of Afghans were glued to their television sets on Tuesday night to watch the first ever professional boxing match staged in the war-torn country. They were treated to a title fight between Hamid Rahimi, who was born in Afghanistan and grew up in Germany, and Tanzania's Said Mbelwa, with the World Boxing Organization's Intercontinental middleweight belt up for grabs. While millions watched it live on two Afghan TV channels, including state-run RTA, hundreds of people, including senior government officials, lawmakers and diplomats packed into the Loya Jirga hall in Kabul amid tight security to watch the fight, with tickets changing hands for between US$50 and US$100. Rahimi claimed victory in the seventh round after Mbelwa's shoulder was injured. "This belt is not mine, this belt is Afghanistan's belt. It's yours. I love you," an ecstatic Rahimi told the crowd from the ring. The event, billed as the "Fight 4 Peace," was another milestone in the country's rehabilitation after life under the Taliban, when it would likely have been banned. The group, which ruled much of the country between 1996 and 2001, prevented the population from taking part in many activities seen as un-Islamic, with restrictions placed on many sports. Kabul's main sports arena, Ghazi Stadium, was infamously used as a venue for public executions and stonings during the 1990s. "I am sure none of the two [fighters] would even dare to get into the country, if the Taliban were still ruling. I am so happy that now we are moving towards a future where the world is giving us a recognition," Sayed Ahmad Peerzada, a shopkeeper, told CNN. The excitement was also echoed on social media, with thousands taking to Twitter and Facebook to show their support for the match. Khalid Quraishi, an Afghan living abroad, wrote on his Facebook page: "Hamid Rahimi opened a new chapter in the boxing history in Afghanistan! Thanks to his opponent for accepting to come to Kabul too!" The result even resonated at the Presidential palace in Kabul, as President Hamid Karzai offered his congratulations to both boxers. "The president, besides congratulating Rahimi, thanks his Tanzanian opponent who came to Afghanistan to take part in this fight," a statement from Karzai's office said. Rahimi was born in Afghanistan in 1983 and escaped to Germany with his family in 1992 after the country was embroiled in civil war. He has won 20 of his 21 matches so far.

chatgpt: An Afghan-born fighter, Hamid Rahimi, took part in Afghanistan's first-ever professional boxing fight on Saturday, August 19th. Rahimi, who now lives in Germany, claimed an impressive victory in the seventh round of the match against Tanzania's Said Mbelwa. However, the win was bittersweet, as Mbelwa had to withdraw due to a shoulder injury. This historic event marks a significant moment for Afghanistan, where sports - particularly combat sports - have been heavily restricted in the past. During the Taliban regime, which lasted from 1996 to 2001, sports such as boxing were banned altogether. The capital's sports stadium was even used as a site for public executions. To overcome these challenges, Rahimi had to train rigorously, sometimes in secret. The boxer, who represented Afghanistan at the London 2012 Olympics, hopes that his participation in the fight will help to promote the sport in his home country. Speaking to reporters after the match, he said, "We want to show the world that Afghanistan is not just about war and terror, but we have people, we have talent, we have something to show to the world." The fight was held in the heavily guarded InterContinental hotel in Kabul, which is located in the city's diplomatic quarter. Security was tight, given the country's past struggles with terrorism and instability. Speaking about the event, Afghanistan's Deputy Minister of Information and Culture, Mujataba Alibek, said, "This is a great day for Afghanistan. We hope this will show the world that we are no longer just associated with war and terror, but also with positive things." Rahimi's win was celebrated by many Afghans, including those who watched the match on TV. One fan, Javid, told reporters, "It was great to see an Afghan win. It was a historic moment for our country." Another fan, Maryam, added, "I hope this will encourage more Afghans to take up sports, especially boxing." Despite the challenges that Rahimi faced, he remained determined to showcase his talent and represent his home country. His victory in Afghanistan's first-ever professional boxing match is not only a significant milestone for his personal career but also for the country's sports scene. It's a hopeful sign that sports can play a crucial role in promoting peace, unity, and progress in Afghanistan, even in the face of adversity.
