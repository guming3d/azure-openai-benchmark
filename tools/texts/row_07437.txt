article: It is a problem common to Sunday League football pitches up and down the country. But for one player in a Christian league, his objection to dog dirt on the turf forced him to take an early bath. Lance Perry was given his marching orders while representing Rowley College in the West Midlands Christian Football League after warning his team mates about 'dog s***' on the pitch. The Christian league has a zero tolerance policy on swearing, so the referee brandished a red card and sent Perry from the field. A footballer in a Christian league was sent off after he warned his team mates about 'dog s***' on the pitch . The player's well-intentioned warning came in a bottom of the table clash against St Thomas Aldridge and the referee's actions took both sets of players by surprise. Rowley boss Pete Bennett said: 'The league does have a zero policy to foul language and referees can sometimes interpret that rather crazily. 'We couldn't believe it when the red card came out. He protested as far as he could.' Birmingham County FA has now wiped the record clean and dropped a one-match ban after being informed the expletive was not a critique of the referee. Disciplinary boss Mike Fellows said: 'We have looked at the words used, and the way they were used. 'Obviously if the response had followed a question about how the ref was performing, the red card would have stayed. 'Actually, s**t is in the Oxford English Dictionary. Clearly in this case the word was not used as a term of abuse. 'However fully support the stance of the West Midlands Christian Football League in their zero tolerance to foul and abusive language. 'A considerable amount of their teams play in public parks. For users of these park and their families, it's the last thing they would want to hear.' The player raised a problem common to many Sunday League teams, but his language earned him an early bath (stock image) Despite Perry's absence, Rowley College (who play in black and red stripes) romped to a 5-1 win, which leaves them three off the bottom of the division. Boss Bennett added: 'Thankfully common sense has prevailed. In fairness, the league has been very good.' The West Midlands Christian Football League was formed in 1979 and features both Christian and non-Christian players. Its mission statement says it exists to allow men to play in a league 'that is morally, decently and ethically sound of action and speech, and is honouring to the name of Jesus Christ.'

chatgpt: In a recent football match played in the West Midlands Christian League, Lance Perry, a player from Rowley College, was sent off for breaching the league's zero tolerance policy on swearing. However, his warning to his teammates regarding dog waste on the pitch saved him from a one-match ban. The incident occurred during a game at the league's grounds where Perry cautioned his teammates about the dog excrement on the field. It was a typical Sunday league match, and the teams were battling it out in the second half. Perry noticed the mess on the pitch and immediately warned his fellow players. His warning was taken in good faith by his team members, but the referee judged Perry's actions as a breach of the league's conduct code. According to the league's policy, any use of foul language or offensive gestures on the pitch is strictly prohibited. Even a single violation can result in a player receiving a red card, and in Perry's case, that is precisely what happened. He was shown a red card and had to leave the pitch, as his warning was interpreted as a breach of the code. However, the league authorities reconsidered their initial decision and exonerated Perry. The reason was that his warning concerning the dog waste was not considered a term of abuse. The league's disciplinary board understood Perry's actions were meant to ensure the safety of all players and officials involved in the game. The decision generated mixed emotions among the spectators and the footballing fraternity as a whole. While some hailed the decision as fair and just, others believed that the league's conduct code needed to be reviewed. In an interview with a local news outlet, Perry talked about the incident, stating that he was glad that his warning helped protect the players from potential injuries. He also expressed his gratitude towards the league authorities for considering his appeal and dropping the one-match ban. Perry vowed to continue playing the game he loves with the same passion and zeal. In conclusion, the incident involving Lance Perry during the West Midlands Christian League game has shone a spotlight on the issue of conduct codes in amateur football. It also highlights the importance of player safety and the need for all stakeholders to work towards ensuring that the game is played in a safe and respectful manner at all times. While the league's disciplinary board has done well to exonerate Perry, there is a need to review and revise the conduct code to ensure that it is fair and just for all players involved.
