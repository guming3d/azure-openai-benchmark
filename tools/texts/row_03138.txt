article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- One Goh, the 43-year-old California man charged with fatally shooting seven people this month at the Oikos University in Oakland, has not eaten while being held in jail without bail, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday. "He came to our custody three weeks ago, and he is drinking water -- liquids -- and he's not eating food. We say 'he is not eating' because a strike would be in protest of something, and he is not," said Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the sheriff's office. "He says he is not eating because he feels shame, but what that means nobody really knows," Nelson added. Goh is receiving psychological care, Nelson said. Goh, who is Korean-American, is charged with seven counts of murder with special circumstances and three counts of attempted murder in a mass shooting earlier this month at Oikos, a small college that caters primarily to the Korean-American Christian community. His next court appearance is April 30. District Attorney Nancy E. O'Malley has said Goh voluntarily left Oikos in November because he was upset. Goh "wanted some money back for tuition he had paid, and it is also clear that he focused on one particular administrator at the school who was not present at the school" on the day of the shooting, O'Malley told reporters. The seven fatally shot victims, all from California, were: Katleen Ping, 24; Judith Ona Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia H. Sim, 21, of Hayward; Sonam Choedon, 33, of El Cerrito; Grace Eunhea Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris Ifeyinwa Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro; and Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38, of San Francisco, according to prosecutors. Goh is also charged with the attempted murder of Dawinder Kaur, 19; Ahmad Javid Sayeed, 36; and Grace Kirika, 43, O'Malley said. Goh allegedly used a .45-caliber gun with four fully loaded ammunition magazines, and most of the rounds were fired, authorities said.

chatgpt: One Goh, the suspect in the mass shooting that occurred at Oikos University, appeared in court last week and was formally charged with seven counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. The shooting took place in 2012 and claimed the lives of seven people, including six students and one staff member. Goh is currently being held in jail without bond and has reportedly been refusing food. The sheriff's office revealed that Goh is drinking fluids but not eating anything. Jailers also stated that Goh has been expressing feelings of "shame" but didn't provide any further explanation. The suspect's arraignment was delayed multiple times due to concerns about his mental health. However, a judge ruled that Goh was competent to stand trial after two court-appointed psychiatrists evaluated him. During the hearing, the prosecution requested that Goh be held without bail, citing the severity of his alleged crimes. The defense argued that Goh's mental health issues and lack of a prior criminal record should be taken into consideration. Goh's attorney also expressed concerns about the legal process, stating that the publicity surrounding the case may make it difficult to find an impartial jury for the trial. The shooting at Oikos University was the worst mass shooting in Oakland's history at the time. Reports stated that Goh had targeted a nursing program at the school that he had previously attended but had dropped out of. Goh was allegedly seeking revenge for being teased and disrespected by other students. The trial for Goh's case is expected to be a lengthy and complex process. However, victims' families and the community are hoping for justice to be served and closure to be found after almost a decade since the tragic shooting occurred.
