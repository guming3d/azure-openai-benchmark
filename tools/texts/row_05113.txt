article: By . Chris Pleasance . Giorgio Orsoni, 67, is reported to be under house arrested charged with funding foreign political parties . The mayor of Venice is among 35 people arrested after a multi-billion pound project to stop the city from flooding was hit by an anti-corruption probe. Mayor Giorgio Orsoni, 67, is under house arrest, accused of illegally financing political parties. Authorities say 20million euros (£16million) was diverted to overseas bank accounts and used to fund foreign parties. According to the BBC, the corruption took place during the tender process to build the so-called Moses barriers. The £4billion Moses project involves building more than a mile of barriers to seal off Venice lagoon in the event of high tides or flooding. The project was first put forward in 1966 but the barriers only started being built 11 years ago, and the first was installed last year after delays and financial problems during Italy's economic crash. Italian financial police confirmed that Giorgio Orsoni had been arrested and the ANSA news agency said he was being investigated for alleged corruption, extortion and money laundering. Prosecutors Luigi Delpino and Carlo Nordio said: 'The investigation shows that a great portion of the funds was used to finance political forces at the city, regional and national level, and corrupt high-level public officials.' A spokeswoman for the Venice city government had no immediate comment, and centre-left mayor Giorgio Orsoni's spokesman did not respond to phone calls. The arrests were the result of a . three-year investigation that led to the arrest last summer of the head . of the consortium building the ambitious but long-delayed system of . so-called Moses barriers. It is the latest in a series of Italian bribery investigations involving high-profile public works projects. A series of unrelated corruption . investigations, mostly involving bribery or embezzlement accusations, . have implicated former high-ranking government ministers in recent . months. The £4billion Moses project involves around a mile of barriers being built to seal off three entrances to the lagoon in the event of high tides and flooding . Investigations have revolved around some of the biggest Italian public works projects including the Milan world's fair, Expo 2015, and an Italian-funded water project in Iraq. Most recently, a former interior minister was accused of helping a businessman flee Italy to escape a Mafia association sentence. The string of arrests has prompted comparisons to the Clean Hands anti-corruption investigations of the 1990s that toppled an entire political class. The one clear difference this time is that the alleged bribery involves individuals from across the political spectrum rather than political parties enriching themselves. The latest arrests put more pressure on Premier Matteo Renzi to take action, after his appointment of an anti-corruption czar earlier this year. Over the weekend, the European Commission flagged the deep-rooted problem of corruption as an issue hampering investment and economic renewal in Italy, which ranked 69th in Transparency International's perceived level of public sector corruption last year - behind Montenegro and just ahead of Kuwait.

chatgpt: Giorgio Orsoni, a former mayor of Venice, is among the 35 people who have been arrested over allegations of corruption related to a multi-billion pound project to stop the city from flooding. Prosecutors are alleging that Orsoni played a central role in diverting around £16 million (€18 million) from the project to pay foreign political parties. The project to build a complex mobile flood barrier system, known as MOSE, was launched in 2003 to stop the centuries-old issue of the Venetian Lagoon from flooding the city. The project was plagued by delays, controversies, and soaring costs, with the final price tag estimated to be around £4.3 billion (€4.9 billion). According to prosecutors, Orsoni, who served as mayor of Venice from 2010 to 2014, was behind a scheme to divert funds from an organization in charge of the MOSE project to pay off political parties in France and other countries. Orsoni has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crimes. Prosecutors also allege that a prominent local businessman, Diego De Poli, was the "mastermind" behind the corruption scheme. De Poli, who was called "the king of MOSE" by Italian media, has been charged with embezzlement, corruption, and money laundering. The arrests are part of a wider crackdown on corruption in Italy. In recent years, the country has made significant efforts to tackle corruption and improve its image abroad. However, corruption remains a significant problem in Italy, particularly in the political realm. The allegations surrounding the MOSE project are particularly damaging for Venice, a city that relies heavily on tourism and is in a constant battle against rising waters. The MOSE project was supposed to be the answer to the city's flooding problems, but it has now become a symbol of corruption and inefficiency. The arrests have sparked outrage among the people of Venice, who have long been frustrated with the delays and controversies surrounding the MOSE project. Many Venetians are calling for a complete overhaul of the project and are demanding that those responsible for the corruption face justice. The MOSE project is not the only major infrastructure project in Italy that has been plagued by corruption and delays. In recent years, several high-profile projects, including a high-speed railway line and an airport expansion, have been mired in controversy and allegations of corruption. The Italian government has vowed to continue its fight against corruption and to improve transparency and accountability in public projects. However, the MOSE scandal serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead, particularly in a country where political corruption has been a pervasive problem for decades. In conclusion, the arrests of Giorgio Orsoni and 34 other people for their alleged involvement in a corruption scheme linked to the MOSE project have shocked the people of Venice and raised concerns about the country's ability to tackle corruption. The scandal has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in public projects in Italy and the importance of holding those responsible for corruption accountable.
