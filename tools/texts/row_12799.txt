article: Gloomy prediction: Jacques Attali says the euro has a 'one in two' chance of collapsing in the coming month . Britain was last night planning for the collapse of the eurozone as Spain weighed up a bailout that could cost UK taxpayers £5billion. The Government is preparing for the biggest mass default in history and the break-up of the single currency bloc. Analysts warned that euro meltdown would wreak havoc in the banking system and plunge the global economy back into recession. Whitehall sources said contingency plans are being drawn up – and indicated that the longer the euro limps on, the more time Britain has to prepare. Fears are mounting that Greece will be forced to default on its debts as the crisis threatens to sink Spain and Italy. The storm hit Belgium last night as the country’s credit rating was cut from AA+ to AA by Standard & Poor’s amid tumbling confidence in the region. And a leading French economist, Jacques Attali, the former president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said there was only a 50-50 chance of the euro surviving until Christmas. Sources in Madrid said the new Spanish government is considering applying for international aid to shore up its battered finances. It is thought a bailout of around £340billion would be required to keep the country afloat – with as much as £5billion coming from Britain through the International Monetary Fund.

chatgpt: Italy's bond yields have almost doubled in the past month, leading to concerns about the country's financial stability. The yield on the country's 10-year bond rose to 6.77%, up from 3.65% in just a few weeks. The increase has led to fears that Italy's debt crisis could escalate and reverberate throughout the European Union. The rise in Italian bond yields also caused the FTSE to claw its way up after a 0.5% fall earlier in the day. The FTSE closed up by 0.6% at 6,985 points. The rise was a relief for investors who had been fearful of another round of market turmoil. The increase in bond yields comes at a time when Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, is seeking to pass sweeping reforms aimed at boosting economic growth. The reforms face opposition from trade unions and other groups, which has created political uncertainty. Experts have warned that the yield on Italy's 10-year bond reaching above 7% would cross an "unsustainable" threshold, which could further destabilize the country's economy. The yield increase could make it even more difficult for Italy to borrow money in the future, considering the high levels of debt already accumulated by the country. The increase in bond yields has also exposed the vulnerability of Greece and other weaker countries within the EU. With Italy being one of the largest economies in the EU, its economic woes could have a ripple effect throughout the region, triggering fresh concerns about the future of the eurozone. Hungary has also suffered a blow after its credit rating was downgraded to 'junk status' by rating agency Standard & Poor's. The downgrade was due to concerns about the country's debt levels and the government's controversial policies, which have raised concerns about Hungary's ability to meet its debt obligations. The downgraded credit rating is a significant blow to Hungary, which has been slowly emerging from its deep recession in recent years. The downgrade could lead to increased borrowing costs for the country and further undermine investor confidence. The Hungarian government has been criticized for its policies, including its crackdown on the media and civil society, as well as its attempts to undermine the independence of the judiciary. These policies have raised concerns about the country's political stability and whether it is committed to upholding the rule of law. The downgrade comes as Hungary is also facing criticism from the EU about its handling of the refugee crisis. The EU has accused Hungary of not doing enough to help refugees, and the country has faced criticism for its decision to build a border fence to keep migrants out. Hungary is not alone in its struggles with debt and political instability. Greece, Italy, and other countries in the EU are also facing similar challenges, which have fueled concerns about the future of the eurozone. In conclusion, the rise in Italian bond yields and Hungary's credit rating downgrade are just the latest indicators of the fragility of the European economy. The ongoing debt crisis and political instability within the EU have highlighted the need for reform and better coordination among EU member states. The situation will continue to be monitored closely in the coming weeks and months to determine the long-term impact on the European economy.
