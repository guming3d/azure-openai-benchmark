article: BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Six Italian men were shot dead in the German city of Duisburg on Wednesday in an execution-style killing linked to a mafia feud. Police remove a body from the scene. Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato said the shootings appeared to be linked to a feud between two mafia clans in the southern region of Calabria, home to the 'Ndrangheta organized crime group. Here are some key facts about the group: . ORIGINS: . -- The Calabrian "Honored Society", known as "'Ndrangheta", in the Calabria region of south Italy is the equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia. -- 'Ndrangheta began as a defense network for impoverished rural peasants against aristocratic landlords. Members emigrated to Canada and the United States, and were discovered running an intimidation scheme in Pennsylvania mining towns in 1906. HOW DOES IT WORK? -- They are known as "The Honored Society", Fibbia or Calabrian mafia. Instead of the pyramid structure of bosses used by other mafia, The 'Ndrangheta" uses families based on blood relationships, inter-marriages, or being a Godfather. Each group is named after their village, or after the family leader. TWENTIETH CENTURY EXPANSION: . -- When Calabria began the process of industrialization and urbanization in the late 20th century, the 'Ndrangheta became interested in drug trafficking, weapons sales and public works and construction. THE PRESENT: . -- In 2004, authorities uncovered an international drugs trafficking network involving gangs in South America, Australia, and Europe. Drugs from Colombia were destined for countries such as Greece and Bulgaria. -- Italian officials estimated at the time that 80 percent of Europe's cocaine had arrived from Colombia via Gioia Tauro's docks in Reggio Calabria. -- Italian anti-organized crime agencies have estimated that the 'NDrangheta earns about $30 billion annually, mostly from illegal drugs, but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction, restaurants and supermarkets. -- There are believed to be about 100 'Ndrangheta families in Calabria, who have become more successful than their Sicilian counterparts because their family ties are closer.

chatgpt: Six young Italians were found shot in the head in the western German city of Duisburg, with five of the victims already dead and one dying later on. According to the police, the victims were between 16 and 39 years old, all of whom were likely involved in organized crime in Italy. Authorities were alerted to the scene after receiving reports of gunshots in the early hours of Saturday morning. Upon arriving at the scene, they found four bodies lying on the street and two others who were severely injured. Despite their efforts, one of the injured later died in the hospital. The gruesome discovery has shocked the local community, and the police have launched a massive investigation into the matter. The authorities are yet to identify the victims and their families, and the reason behind their presence in the city has to be determined. However, investigators believe the killings may be linked to organized crime in Italy. They suspect that the victims were involved in a criminal activity that has spilled over into Germany. Duisburg, in particular, is known for being a hub of criminal activity, and it's not the first time such criminal activities have taken place in the city. In 2007, six Italian men were killed in a mafia-style shooting in Duisburg, and the city has been dealing with the consequences of the crime ever since. The Italian government has expressed its concern over the situation, and authorities are expected to provide support to the German police in their investigation. The incident highlights the ongoing issues of organized crime in Europe, and the fact that criminal activities are not limited to specific countries but rather spread across borders. The investigation is ongoing, and the police have requested that anybody with information regarding the incident should come forward and assist with the investigation. The authorities are keen on solving the case and bringing the perpetrators to justice.
