article: Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- The younger son of political activist Aung San Suu Kyi arrived in Myanmar on Tuesday for a long-awaited visit with his mother, from whom he'd been separated for a decade. Kim Aris arrived about 7:30 a.m. Tuesday at the international airport in Yangon, the former national capital, which also is known as Rangoon. Myanmar air force security officials escorted Aris, speeding his arrival without going through standard immigration. Suu Kyi, also escorted by security officials, was quickly able to greet her son. About 100 of her supporters were on hand for Aris's arrival from Bangkok, Thailand, where he had waited for weeks in limbo for a Myanmar visa. Mother and son left the airport together, bound for her home. It was not immediately clear how long Aris planned to stay in Myanmar. Aris last saw his Nobel Peace Laureate mother in 2000, when he spent about two weeks with her, according to one of her attorneys. Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on November 13, after spending most of the past 20 years under house arrest or in prison. Myanmar's military regime freed her days after holding the country's first elections in two decades, which critics worldwide dismissed as a sham. The junta's party declared a landslide victory. Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party boycotted the November 7 elections, faulting the military junta. The regime had enacted a new law that forced the NLD to choose between honoring Suu Kyi as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections. The NLD won a landslide election victory in 1990, but the military junta rejected the results. This year, the generals refused to allow international monitors to oversee its elections and overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip. The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged Myanmar's regime over the years. For her efforts, she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.

chatgpt: After being separated for a decade, Aung San Suu Kyi and her son, Kim Aris, were finally reunited in Yangon, Myanmar on November 12th. The political activist, who has spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest or in prison, was released from her most recent confinement on November 13. Aris had waited in Bangkok for weeks in limbo while he sought a Myanmar visa to visit his mother.  The meeting marked the first time Suu Kyi had seen her son in person in over a decade. Despite being permitted to leave Myanmar for medical treatment over the years, she had been unable to secure permission for her son to join her outside the country. In the time that had passed since they had last seen one another, both had experienced significant changes. Suu Kyi had become a global symbol of peaceful resistance to military rule, while Aris had grown into a man. Their reunion sparked scenes of jubilation among supporters of Suu Kyi, who has long been revered as a hero in Myanmar. Many had feared they might never see her free again after her latest detention began in 2010. Her release has raised hopes that Myanmar's democratic transition will continue to progress. Suu Kyi's most recent confinement came at a time of significant transformation for the country. After decades of military rule, Myanmar began its transition to democracy in 2011. Under the leadership of President Thein Sein, the country has undertaken a series of political, economic, and social reforms. These include the release of political prisoners, the ease of media censorship, and the help of long-standing ethnic conflicts. In recognition of these efforts, Thein Sein has received praise from world leaders and the international community alike. However, Suu Kyi's release from house arrest and the reunion with her son serve as a reminder that change in Myanmar has not come without sacrifice. Suu Kyi's dedication to peaceful resistance has come at a great cost to her personal life, having spent much of the past two decades confined to her home. Yet despite this, she remains committed to working towards a better future for her country and its people. As Myanmar continues its transition to democracy, the country will undoubtedly face many challenges along the way. However, the reunion of Aung San Suu Kyi and her son serves as a reminder that the struggle for democracy is a deeply personal one, and that as long as there are people like Suu Kyi, who are committed to the cause, it will always endure.
