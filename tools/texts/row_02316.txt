The bridge - the first iron bridge of its kind in the world - has required significant maintenance since it was first built in 1779. The location of the bridge was chosen because East Shropshire was an important industrial area because of the huge coal deposits near the surface.

The Gorge and its ten museums spread along the valley by the River Severn attract 500,000 visitors every year bringing £20million to the local economy of Telford and Wrekin and the wider Shropshire area.

chatgpt: Eric Pickles, the British Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, announced today a £12 million grant to preserve the iconic Ironbridge Gorge for future generations. The gorge, first built in 1779, is considered the birthplace of the industrial revolution and has been listed as a World Heritage Site since 1986. It is described by writer Charles Hulbert in 1837 as 'the most extraordinary district in the world.' The grant will be used to enhance and maintain the Gorge’s ten museums in Shropshire, which attract around 500,000 visitors every year, bringing in approximately £20 million to the local economy of Telford and Wrekin. During the announcement at the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust, Pickles stated that the grant will ensure that the gorge “will be preserved for generations to come” and will “continue to be a place of international significance.” The Ironbridge Gorge, located in Shropshire, was the site of the first iron bridge in the world, built by Abraham Darby III in 1779. The area quickly became a hub of innovation, with numerous ironworks and factories being built over the course of the following decades. This explosion of industry was crucial in the development of the modern world, as it saw the birth of new technologies such as the steam engine and the railway. Today, the Gorge is a popular tourist destination and an important cultural landmark. The Gorge is home to ten museums, including the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust, which houses exhibitions on the history of the area and its industrial heritage. These museums attract visitors from all over Britain and the world, who come to learn about the profound impact that the Ironbridge Gorge had on human history. The grant awarded by Eric Pickles will help to ensure that these museums continue to be well maintained and that they can continue to educate visitors about the importance of the Ironbridge Gorge. It will also help to preserve the unique heritage of the area and ensure that future generations can appreciate and learn from this historic site. The Ironbridge Gorge is not just historically significant, it is also a vibrant and thriving part of the local economy. The area’s ten museums attract around 500,000 visitors every year, who contribute approximately £20 million to the local economy of Telford and Wrekin. This grant will help to ensure that the Gorge continues to be a popular destination for tourists, providing jobs and opportunities for the local community. The announcement of this grant by Eric Pickles has been welcomed by historians, cultural experts, and local residents alike. It is seen as a vital investment in the preservation of one of Britain’s most important historical sites, and a boost to the local economy. As Pickles himself stated, the Ironbridge Gorge “is an international treasure and I’m delighted we’re able to help preserve its place in history.” In conclusion, the £12 million grant awarded by Eric Pickles in support of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust and its ten museums is a crucial investment in the preservation of the world's first industrial revolution site. The grant ensures that the Gorge will continue to be an international landmark for generations to come and will bring much-needed economic support to the local community. The preservation of the Ironbridge Gorge shows the value of investing in our cultural and historical heritage, helping to educate and inspire people for years to come.
