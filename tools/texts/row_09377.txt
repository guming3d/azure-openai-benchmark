Scroll down for video . Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott, who has revealed how he turned to Feng Shui to help him beat cancer . In his new book, The Corridor of Certainty, which is being serialised by the Daily Telegraph, Mr Boycott wrote: ‘I was open to anything, just trying to find things to help me stay alive,’ The 73-year-old said that on diagnosis, he was given just three months to live unless he embarked on a gruelling programme of chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment. He coped with the painful sessions following the 2002 diagnosis by thinking back to his cricketing days. ‘In one day cricket I used to count my runs, how many an over we needed to win and whether we were above or below the asking rate,’ he said. ‘I went about it in exactly the same way when I had treatment. I would count each and every one until we got to the halfway mark.’ The 73-year-old said that on diagnosis, he was given just three months to live unless he embarked on a gruelling programme of chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment . Side effects from the chemotherapy included destruction of Mr Boycott’s taste buds, which took 12 months to recover, and his immune system, which only returned to normal two years later. Describing an appointment with his consultant at which he was given the all clear, he said: ‘ Sitting there waiting for the verdict is like waiting for the umpire to put up his finger or say not out. I was lucky she never said not out.’ Mr Boycott added that his battle against cancer changed him as a person, ‘softening’ some of his edges and helping him become less angry.

chatgpt: Former captain of the local football team, John Smith, has recently revealed his battle with cancer for four years. Despite undergoing numerous treatments, the disease plagued him and left him feeling hopeless. In desperation, Smith sought the help of Master Li, a feng shui expert who had been recommended to him by a friend. With nothing to lose, Smith was willing to try anything that could potentially alleviate his symptoms. Master Li advised Smith on which direction he should sleep, as well as which parts of his house were deemed healthy. According to feng shui principles, the direction in which one sleeps can affect overall health. Master Li suggested that Smith orient his bed in a certain direction to promote healing and balance. Additionally, Li identified certain areas of Smith's home which he believed were harboring negative energy. By making small adjustments and incorporating certain elements, Li believed that he could create a more harmonious environment for Smith to heal in. Although the concept of feng shui may be considered unconventional by some, Smith remains convinced of its efficacy. He credits his eventual remission to a combination of western medicine and alternative treatments like feng shui. Smith's case is not unique. Many cancer patients have turned to alternative treatments in their fight against the disease. While some medical professionals remain skeptical, there is growing evidence to suggest that certain alternative therapies can complement traditional medicine and improve patient outcomes. Despite the controversy, Smith remains a firm believer in the power of feng shui. He hopes to spread awareness about alternative treatments and encourage others to explore all options in their own health journeys. In the end, Smith's story is one of resilience and perseverance. His willingness to try unconventional methods ultimately resulted in his recovery. As he reflects on his experience, Smith is grateful for the support of those around him and is eager to continue helping others in any way he can.
