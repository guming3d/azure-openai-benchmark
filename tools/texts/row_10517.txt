article: (Entertainment Weekly) -- Once upon a time -- oh, let's just call it North America in the mid-'90s, shall we? -- Weezer and Alanis Morissette were an inescapable part of the cultural landscape, churning out buoyant rock-radio hits (Weezer), wordy, eccentric anthems (Alanis), and MTV-friendly videos (both) with impressive consistency. Alanis Morissette struggled to find a way to stay current after her last album failed to do well. Each act's follow-ups, however, have failed to yield quite the success of their initial impact. So how, in the face of a never-ending rush of fresh industry blood, does an already established act stay relevant? For Morissette, the answer on new CD "Flavors of Entanglement" seems to lie, for better or worse, in going through a really, really bad breakup. The same kind of passion that fueled the 15-million-selling '95 smash "Jagged Little Pill" (was there ever a woman more excellently scorned than the Alanis who excoriated her lover on "You Oughta Know"?) is all over "Entanglement" -- thanks to a well-publicized split with actor fiance Ryan Reynolds. Granted, at 34, she still writes too often in the histrionic, no-one-has-ever-felt-what-I-feel style of a feverishly journaling liberal-arts major. Even so, the rawness of her hurt adds heft to eff-you screeds like the thunderous "Versions of Violence," and she's found an able partner in producer and co-writer Guy Sigsworth, a onetime Björk collaborator. His dense, swirling compositions seem to push Morissette's boundaries, conjuring her inner Princess of Darkness on the glitchy, gothy "Straitjacket" and exploring Far Eastern exotica on the tabla-tinged opener "Citizen of the Planet." But her most affecting moment may be the most stripped down. A barely-there piano is all the accompaniment needed on the broken, fragile ballad "Not as We," on which her voice cracks heartbreakingly over the lines "From scratch begin again, but this time, I as I/And not as we." Somehow, a devastating personal experience has galvanized her songwriting in a way that domestic bliss, as showcased on 2004's disappointing "So-Called Chaos," could not. EW Grade: B+ .

chatgpt: Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette has released her seventh studio album, "Flavors of Entanglement", which was released on June 2, 2008. The album marks the end of a turbulent period in Morissette's life, as she had recently broken up with her actor fiancé, Ryan Reynolds, and had experienced other personal struggles in her life. The album's most affecting moment is also its sparest. "Not As We," a brooding ballad, features Morissette's signature confessional lyrics and showcases her powerful voice. The track was co-produced and co-written by English musician Guy Sigsworth, who had previously worked with artists such as Björk and Madonna. Throughout "Flavors of Entanglement," there is a sense of raw emotion and vulnerability in Morissette's lyrics. The album tackles themes of heartbreak, self-discovery, and healing. Morissette has stated that it was her intention to create an album that reflected her personal journey and would also resonate with her fans. Speaking about the album, Morissette said, "I wanted to make an album that felt like a companion to people who were going through a tough time. It's important for me to create music that is honest and authentic." In addition to Sigsworth, Morissette worked with a number of other collaborators on the album, including multi-instrumentalist Zac Rae and drummer Blair Sinta. The result is a richly layered album that blends elements of rock, pop, and electronic music. "Flavors of Entanglement" received positive reviews from music critics, with many hailing it as one of Morissette's strongest albums. The album debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 chart and was eventually certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Overall, "Flavors of Entanglement" is a powerful and deeply personal album that showcases Morissette's talents as a songwriter and vocalist. With its confessional lyrics, diverse musical styles, and collaborations with talented musicians, the album stands as a testament to Morissette's continued relevance in the music industry.
