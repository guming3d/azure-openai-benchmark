There must have been a weakness in the wall for it to happen. 'I know these walls are all around the area but they shouldn't be by a children's play area. 'Harley is getting better now but he has been in so much pain and been so scared. A Blaenau Gwent council spokeswoman said it was clear that the wall had been vandalised due to gaps in the standing wall where stones had been removed. This had caused a layer of stones to collapse. She said: 'We are now working with Gwent Police in order to make further investigations. Several follow-up visits to the site have also been made'.
