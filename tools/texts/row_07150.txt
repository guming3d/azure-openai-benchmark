article: Watching a chef at a San Francisco restaurant slam frozen meat into the sidewalk is enough to make your stomach turn, not to mention the customers who may have had the misfortune of eating it. Captured on video outside Lucky River, a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco's Sunnyside neighborhood, the chef appears to lift and slam two slabs of beef up and down onto the ground. When a concerned inspector from the city's health department arrived to question the apparently bemused staff, they simply said the man was attempting to tenderize the meat and 'defrost' it by beating it off the concrete.

However, when local news made the trip down to examine the exact section of sidewalk they discovered it was covered in gum, cigarette butts and general filth. The owner of the restaurant said that the defrosting incident was an isolated one and that the meat was never used in any meals. KPIX showed the gross footage to neighbors, Steve Vender and London Lacey. 'It's highly unsanitary, I don't know how they're gonna clean the meat off after that. They're gonna wash it but it certainly doesn't look very appealing,' said Vender.

According to KPIX, Lucky River scored a satisfactory rating on its last health inspection. However, reviews on Yelp have been less than generous, with one person mentioning a boiled caterpillar in the vegetables. 'Yup. They boiled a caterpillar, Extra protein I guess,' they wrote. 'I won't eat there again,' said Lacey. 'I will not eat there at all.' After seeing the shocking video, the San Francisco Public Health Department gave the owners of Lucky River just one month to clean up their act or face closure. If the owners do not get their staff to enroll in an eight-hour Food Manager Class, earn and print food handlers cards and go on remedial food safety courses within one month, the restaurant will be forced to close.

chatgpt: San Francisco, CA - A San Francisco restaurant is at the center of controversy after a chef was caught on camera beating meat in public. The Lucky River restaurant, located in the city's Sunnyside neighborhood, was seen using questionable food preparation techniques. A video posted on social media shows a chef outside the restaurant, beating a piece of meat on the sidewalk. The footage quickly went viral, sparking outrage among the community. Upon being confronted about the practice, staff at the restaurant reportedly shrugged it off, stating that it was a common practice in their kitchen. However, many area residents were alarmed by the unsanitary practice and called for action. The video also caught the attention of health officials, who later visited the restaurant to investigate. While the inspection didn't uncover any immediate health concerns, the officials have warned that such practices can potentially pose a risk to public health. Following the backlash, the owner of Lucky River issued a statement to clarify the situation. In the statement, the owner explained that the meat seen in the video was not served at the restaurant. "We take pride in our food quality and food safety standards, and what was captured on video does not represent our values or practices," the statement read. However, many in the community remain skeptical of the restaurant's claims, citing a history of questionable practices at the establishment. This is not the first time Lucky River has faced controversy. In 2019, the restaurant was fined for health code violations, including mice droppings and dirty cooking surfaces. The restaurant has also been accused of violating labor laws by underpaying employees. Local resident Emily Williams stated, "I'm not surprised to hear about this. Lucky River has a history of not following the rules, and it's about time they faced consequences for their actions." The incident at Lucky River serves as a reminder of the importance of food safety and the need for stricter regulations in the restaurant industry. While the outcome of the investigation remains open, it's clear that the community will be keeping a close eye on the restaurant and its operations in the future.
