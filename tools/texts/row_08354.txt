So many migrants flooded into Britain from Eastern Europe that authorities were unable to count them, Whitehall admitted yesterday. Official migration figures missed out nearly half a million people who came to the UK after their countries joined the EU in 2004, according to a newly-published document. The scale of the problem was only revealed in the 2011 census, which showed the population was even bigger than estimated. A document shows migration figures missed out nearly half a million people who came to the UK after their countries joined the EU in 2004 . The admission comes amid growing concern over immigration, as Britain prepares to open its doors to citizens from Romania and Bulgaria. Workers from the two countries will have free access to jobs in this country from the end of the year, but the Government has failed to confirm how many people they expect to arrive. The 2011 census found there were 464,000 more people living in England and Wales than originally thought. Now a paper, published by the Office for National Statistics, has acknowledged for the first time that the majority of the people who slipped through the net were Eastern European migrants. Between 2002 and 2010, mass immigration under the Labour government was running at its highest. Until now ONS officials claimed at least 200,000 were long-term British inhabitants. But the new ONS paper said: 'At national level the difference is believed to be largely due to international migration. 'In particular an underestimate of the number of immigrants from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that joined the EU in 2004.' A paper, published by the Office for National Statistics, has acknowledged for the first time that the majority of the people who slipped through the net were Eastern European migrants . The mistake led to repeated pronouncements that there were 700,000 or fewer Poles and Eastern Europeans in Britain. Now authorities accept that the figure is actually more than a million. The ONS results show the difference between the official population count and the real population was more than 25 per cent in some places. In Newham in East London there were supposed to have been 242,400 residents before the census. That figure has now been scaled up and revised to 310,500. Romanian and Bulgarian citizens may work freely in Britain at  the end of this year because  the seven-year period in which Westminster was allowed  to impose restrictions is at an end. Both countries joined the EU in 2007. A BBC poll last week found  that more than 8 per cent of Romanians and nearly 14 per cent of Bulgarians said they would consider migrating to Britain. The MigrationWatch think-tank believes around 50,000 Bulgarian and Romanians will arrive every year for the next five years.

chatgpt: The scale of an issue concerning the number of undocumented migrants living and working in the United Kingdom was only revealed in the 2011 census, according to a recent admission. This revelation comes as the nation prepares to open its doors to citizens from Romania and Bulgaria. The UK has been facing a long-standing concern of illegal immigration that poses a wide range of social, economic, and political consequences. The government has been under pressure to tackle the problem, particularly with the recent influx of migrants from war-torn countries in Syria and other regions. It has been revealed by the Office for National Statistics that official records showed 1.91 million people living in the country, who did not have legal residency rights. The figure, released in 2011, was higher than the previous estimates that had stated that illegal immigrants only numbered around 600,000. Various reasons have been cited for the presence of illegal immigrants in the UK, including visa overstays, undocumented migrants, and illegal entry into the country. While the matter has been a concern for several years, the issue of undocumented migrants became even more urgent as the government prepared to open its doors to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria. Following the accession of these countries to the European Union, some UK politicians were apprehensive about the possible influx of migrant workers from these two countries. Some lawmakers suggested that the country would be overwhelmed with workers who would come and compete for jobs with the existing British workforce. The UK government’s response to the issue has been to strengthen the country’s immigration policies and regulations. The government has introduced legal documents checks and biometric residence permits to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants. The government has also collaborated with the European Union to address the issue. In 2016, a partnership between the UK and various EU member states was established to share information and intelligence concerning illegal immigration. The partnership aimed to tackle the problem of illegal migration across the continent and help countries’ efforts in securing their borders against illegal migration. The issue of illegal immigration remains a major challenge for the UK government, particularly with the recent turmoil in the world. The pandemic has created an unfavorable environment for economic migrants as the employment rate has dropped significantly. The Home Secretary is set to announce plans for a more robust strategy in dealing with this contentious issue. A new multi-agency approach that will engage all relevant departments is to be instigated to formulate a plan on how to tackle the problem. In conclusion, the revelation of the scale of the issue of illegal immigration in the UK by the 2011 census has brought to light the challenges that the country faces in dealing with illegal immigration. The government has taken steps to address the problem, but much more needs to be done to ensure that security in the country is upheld.
