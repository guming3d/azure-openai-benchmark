Britain was yesterday ranked the eighth best country in the world in which to do business – but continues to be held back by high taxes, red tape and debt. The World Economic Forum – which organises the annual Davos gathering of global leaders – said the UK was up from 10th last year and was now ‘firmly back’ at the top table. It was the highest ranking of the century and follows decades of decline under Labour, as rising taxes, stifling bureaucracy and ballooning debts damaged business and pushed Britain down to as low as 15th in the competitiveness league table. On the up: Britain was yesterday ranked the eighth best country in the world in which to do business - but continues to be held back by high taxes, red tape and debt . ‘The United Kingdom continues to make up lost ground in the rankings this year, rising two more places and now settling firmly back in the top 10,’ said the WEF in its Global Competitiveness Report. The Treasury welcomed the report as proof that government reforms, including cutting corporation tax and relaxing planning laws, were having an impact. But the WEF warned that Britain’s economic situation remained grim and said the world faced ‘a long period of economic uncertainty’ as the debt crisis in the eurozone raged. It said the ‘macroeconomic environment’ – the general state of the economy – was weak, with the UK falling from 85th place last year to 110th out of 144. London's Canary Wharf: The World Economic Forum - which organises the annual Davos gathering of global leaders - said the UK was up from 10th last year and was now 'firmly back' at the top table . And the report raised particular concerns over government finances, with Britain’s budget ranked 137th in the world – meaning only seven countries were worse off. The UK fared worse than Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast and Spain but better than Greece, the United States and Ireland. The WEF, which scores each country according to 12 ‘pillars of competitiveness’, said ‘the most problematic factors for doing business’ in Britain included ‘access to finance’ – a crisis highlighted by the Daily Mail’s Make The Banks Lend campaign. Other problems were tax rates and regulations, government bureaucracy, an inadequately educated workforce, poor infrastructure, burdensome employment laws and a weak work ethic among staff. The report will pile pressure on the government – and the apparently business-friendly junior ministers appointed in this week’s reshuffle – to improve Britain’s competitiveness and drive growth. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government’s reforms are supporting the UK becoming more competitive, such as creating a more flexible and educated workforce, simplifying our tax system, and reducing the main rate of corporation tax – as well as scrapping burdensome regulation and simplifying planning rules.’ Switzerland came top of the WEF world rankings, with Singapore in second place and Finland in third.

chatgpt: The United Kingdom has been ranked fourth in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index for 2021, rising dramatically from its 10th place ranking last year. This year's ranking marks the highest the UK has ranked this century, with its previous best being a fifth place ranking in 2007-2008. The Global Competitiveness Index measures the productivity and competitiveness of countries based on factors including infrastructure, business dynamism, innovation, and macroeconomic stability. Switzerland topped the rankings, followed by the United States and Singapore. The UK surpassed countries such as Germany, Japan, and South Korea to secure its fourth place position. The report praised the UK's digital capabilities, with the country ranking fourth globally in terms of technological readiness. It also highlighted the country's strong institutions and efficient legal framework, as well as its world-class universities and research institutions. However, the report did identify some areas where the UK could improve its competitiveness, including skills gaps and the need for greater innovation. Despite the UK's strong universities, the report noted that the country still has low levels of technological adoption, and called for greater investment in research and development. The UK's improved ranking comes as the country continues to navigate the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic, which hit the UK particularly hard in the early stages, saw the country's GDP fall by 9.9% in 2020. While the UK has since rebounded somewhat, with growth of 4.8% in the second quarter of 2021, many economists have warned that the country's recovery is still fragile. In response to the report, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the country's efforts to improve its competitiveness, saying: "I am delighted to see that the UK has risen to fourth place in the Global Competitiveness Index. This is a testament to the hard work and innovation of our business leaders, entrepreneurs, and workers, and it shows that we have a strong foundation to build on as we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. "We remain committed to investing in our digital infrastructure, improving our universities and research institutions, and supporting innovation and entrepreneurship across the UK. By doing so, we can ensure that the UK remains a world leader in innovation and competitiveness for decades to come." The UK's improved competitiveness ranking may also have implications for the country's ongoing negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union. While the two sides have yet to reach an agreement, the UK's new fourth place ranking could bolster its negotiating position and provide some support for Johnson's vision of a "Global Britain" that is open for business with partners around the world. Overall, the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index for 2021 demonstrates the remarkable strides that the UK has made in recent years to improve its productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. While challenges remain, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK's fourth place ranking provides a strong foundation for the country's continued economic recovery and growth in the years ahead.
