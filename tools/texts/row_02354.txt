article: (CNN) -- Crew members aboard the International Space Station are awaiting word on how to deal with leaking ammonia from an outside cooling system, NASA said Thursday in a news release. The six-man crew is not in danger, NASA said. The space station crew reported seeing small white flakes floating away from the station, the space agency said. NASA helped locate the leak with external cameras while the crew used hand-held cameras pointed out windows. The leak was in a cooling loop in a solar array that has leaked before. NASA said crew members tried to fix the leak in November. It is unclear whether this is the same leak or a new one. The cooling system could shut down within 24 hours, it said. It is devising a plan to reroute other sources of power so that all systems remain fully operational. Ammonia is used to cool each of the solar arrays that provide electricity to station systems, NASA said. Three crew members -- commander Chris Hadfield of Canada, NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko -- are scheduled to leave the station on Monday at 7:08 p.m. ET. Hadfield asked NASA if the leak will affect the undocking. Capsule Communicator Doug Wheelock said officials at the Mission Control Center in Houston don't see anything that they can't overcome technically, but they would have more information in the morning. Three crew members, NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian counterparts Alexander Misurkin and Pavel Vinogradov, will remain on the space station when the others leave. They will be joined at the end of the month by three new crew members -- NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg, Russian cosmonaut Fiyodor Yurchikhin and European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano, who are due to launch aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on May 28. The space station is operating normally aside from the leak, NASA said.

chatgpt: NASA has reported that ammonia is leaking from a cooling loop on a solar array outside the International Space Station (ISS). This is not the first time a leak has occurred in the same system. Crew members attempted to fix a leak in the system back in November. Despite the repeat issue, NASA assures the public that there is no danger to the crew members currently aboard the space station. The crew has been advised to stay inside the main living quarters until the issue is resolved. The ammonia is used to regulate the temperature of the ISS and its equipment. Without proper cooling, both the space station and its technology would run the risk of overheating, which could be catastrophic. The immediate concern for NASA is to fix the ammonia leak. This will involve replacing a coolant pump in one of the space station's eight power channels. NASA is currently determining the best way to conduct the repair, which may involve a spacewalk. NASA has also confirmed that the leak has not impacted the scheduled departure of three crew members on Monday. The crew was already planning to return to Earth aboard a Soyuz spacecraft after a six-month mission aboard the ISS. The Soyuz spacecraft is designed to depart from the space station regardless of any maintenance work that may be taking place. This is just one of the many challenges that NASA has faced in maintaining the operations of the ISS. Over the years, the space agency has dealt with everything from cracked windows to oxygen leaks. But through diligent monitoring and a dedicated team of experts, the ISS continues to provide vital research opportunities for scientists across the world. NASA has not yet released a timeline for the repair work on the ammonia leak. Nevertheless, the agency remains committed to ensuring that the ISS continues to be a safe and sustainable home for the brave men and women who call it home.
