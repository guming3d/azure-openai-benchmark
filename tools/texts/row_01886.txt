article: Malala Yousafzai is donating $50,000 she was awarded after winning the World Children's Prize to rebuild U.N. schools in Gaza . Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl shot in the head by the Taliban for championing girls' right to education, is donating $50,000 to help rebuild schools in Gaza. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala, 17, is using cash she was given for winning the World Children's Prize to rebuild U.N. schools destroyed by fighting between Israel and Palestine. Malala, who was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen on a school bus two years ago, praised the U.N. agency for 'performing heroic work to serve children in Gaza, in very difficult circumstances.' She added: 'The needs are overwhelming – more than half of Gaza’s population is under 18 years of age. They want and deserve quality education, hope and real opportunities to build a future. 'This funding will help rebuild the 83 schools damaged during the recent conflict. Innocent Palestinian children have suffered terribly and for too long. 'We must all work to ensure Palestinian boys and girls, and all children everywhere, receive a quality education in a safe environment. 'Because without education, there will never be peace. Let us stand together for peace and education because together we are more powerful.' Dozens of Gaza's schools were damaged or destroyed during the 50-day war, in which Israel accused Hamas of hiding weapons near the buildings to maximise civilian casualties for political ends. UNRWA commissioner-general Pierre Krähenbühl said: 'We share with you the profound belief in the importance of education as a means to lift young girls and boys out of isolation and oppression. The money will help to rebuild 83 schools damaged in this summer's fighting between Israel and Palestine, in which Hamas was accused of hiding rockets near classrooms (stock image) 'You have become a symbol of the boundless potential that lies within each and every child on earth. 'You are an aspirational figure to the next generation in Palestine and beyond. You are an inspiration to all of us. Thank you.' UNRWA was established in 1949, and its mission is to assist 5million Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

chatgpt: Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has announced that she is donating her entire $50,000 cash award from the World Children's Prize to rebuild 83 schools in Gaza. The 17-year-old Pakistani education activist was honored last week with the prestigious award at a ceremony in Mariestad, Sweden. Malala's generous donation comes in the wake of the 50-day war that devastated the Gaza Strip this summer, leaving thousands of people homeless and dozens of school buildings destroyed. The region's educational infrastructure took a heavy blow from the conflict, which killed over 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians. "I'm honored to announce all the money that I am getting from the World Children's Prize will be donated to help children in Gaza and to help rebuild 83 schools damaged in the recent war," the young advocate said in a statement. "This is where I will invest my prize money, because I believe that education is the only solution. Education first." Malala, who was shot in the head by Taliban militants in 2012 for advocating girls' rights to education, has become a global symbol of hope and an advocate for youth empowerment. She founded the Malala Fund with her father Ziauddin Yousafzai to promote the right to education for all children, especially girls. The World Children's Prize, also known as the "Children's Nobel Prize", is awarded annually to individuals who have made significant contributions to the lives of children around the world. The prize is awarded by a jury of children from 15 different countries who vote for the recipients. "Malala Yousafzai is an outstanding role model and a true inspiration for us all," said Liv Kjellberg, director of the World Children's Prize Foundation. "Her courage, dedication and unwavering commitment to education for all children, especially girls, make her a deserving recipient of this year's World Children's Prize." The rebuilding of schools in Gaza is a crucial step towards restoring hope and stability in the region, and improving the quality of education for thousands of children who have been affected by the conflict. Malala's donation is a shining example of how one person's generosity and commitment to education can make a real difference in the world.
