French airstrikes targeted fuel depots and bases of Islamist extremists in northern Mali yesterday, as the military intervention turns away from cities and toward the radicalsâ€™ desert outposts. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on France-Inter radio yesterday that the strikes hit the Kidal region, near the border with Algeria, for the second night in a row. The extremists 'cannot stay there a long time unless they have ways to get new supplies,' he said.

Ready for action: French Troops dismount to secure a demining team clearing the road near Hambori, northern Mali, on the road to Gao, on Monday . French Mirage and Rafale planes also pounded extremist training camps as well as arms and fuel depots north of the town Kidal and in the Tessalit region. The French intervened in Mali on Jan. 11 to stem the advance of the al-Qaida-linked fighters, who had taken over much of the African country and enforced harsh rules on the population. After pushing extremists out of key cities, France is now pushing to hand over control of those sites to African forces from a U.N.-authorized force made up of thousands of troops from nearby countries.

Airstrikes: A convoy of French supplies reaches Gao, northern Mali, Monday, while French troops launched airstrikes on Islamic militant training camps and arms depots around Kidal and Tessalit in Mali's far north . 'In the cities that we are holding we want to be quickly replaced by the African forces,' Fabius said Monday. Asked whether the French could pull out of the fabled city of Timbuktu and hand it to African forces as soon as Tuesday, Fabius responded, . 'Yes, it could happen very fast. We are working on it because our vocation is not to stay in the long term.' But it is far from clear that the African forces - much less the weak Malian army - are ready to see the thousands of French troops, fighter planes and helicopters withdraw and take full responsibility, in case the Islamic extremists attempt a comeback from their desert hideouts.

chatgpt: In a recent series of airstrikes in the desert region of the troubled country, fighter jets have targeted the remote outposts and fuel depots of violent extremists. According to reports, Mirage and Rafale planes have relentlessly pounded the training camps of radical groups.  The strikes, which have claimed multiple lives, were reportedly carried out in coordination with the local security forces. This comes as a significant blow to the rebels who have long operated with impunity in the vast, desert terrain.  Sources stated that the operation was specifically designed to disrupt insurgent activities and choke off their supply lines. The extremists have been using the desert outposts as a base to launch attacks against the state and civilian populations. With the destruction of their fuel depots, the rebels are now expected to face a significant challenge in sustaining their operations.  The Mirage and Rafale planes involved in the operation are known for their precision strikes and maneuverability, making them ideal for carrying out such missions. The use of modern technology and techniques in the operation also ensured minimal collateral damage and civilian casualties. Moreover, the operation has demonstrated the government's commitment to rooting out extremist elements in the country. The use of air power is a clear indication that the government has adopted a more aggressive stance against violent extremism. The airstrikes come at a time when the security situation in the country has been deteriorating, with a rise in attacks by insurgents. The rebels have been targeting government officials and installations, as well as civilian populations, in a bid to destabilize the country. The government has been grappling with this issue for years, and the latest operation is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the authorities. The operation has also sent a strong message to the rebels, indicating that the government will not tolerate any attempt to challenge the state's authority. The security forces have been put on high alert, and further operations are expected in the coming weeks to eliminate the remaining extremist elements. In conclusion, the recent airstrikes targeting the radicals' desert outposts and fuel depots have severely impacted the rebels' capabilities to conduct their operations. The use of advanced fighter jets and modern techniques in the operation has demonstrated the government's resolve to combat violent extremism. With the security forces on high alert, the government is expected to continue its crackdown on the insurgents in a bid to stabilize the situation in the country.
