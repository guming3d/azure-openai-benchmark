Scientists appear to have traced the irresistible pull of the refrigerator at 2am to the 'night munchies" gene. When the PER1 gene is faulty, the natural mechanism that synchronises sleeping and eating goes awry, they believe. This can lead to 'night eating syndrome', the inability to avoid feeling hungry at night which in some people can disrupt sleep and lead to over-eating and weight gain. The discovery was made by conducting tests on mice with two human genes, PER1 and its partner PER2, which has previously been linked to sleep disturbances. When PER2 was defective in the mice, as expected they dozed off earlier than usual. But de-activating PER1 affected eating behaviour, leading to mice wanting to eat when they should be sleeping. 'For a long time, people discounted night eating syndrome as not real,' said lead scientist Dr Satchidananda Panda, from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. 'These results in mice suggest that it could actually be a genetic basis for the syndrome. 'We really never expected that we would be able to decouple the sleep-wake cycle and the eating cycle, especially with a simple mutation. It opens up a whole lot of future questions about how these cycles are regulated.' When the researchers restricted access to food, offering it to the mice only at normal meal times, they found that even animals with the faulty PER1 gene maintained a normal weight. Over a 10-week period their weight was no different to that of animals with functioning PER1 genes. When the PER1 gene is faulty, the natural mechanism that synchronises sleeping and eating goes awry, they believe . This showed that the weight gain caused by faulty PER1 was entirely due to meal mistiming and not other metabolic factors. The scientists believe that normally, PER1 and PER2 are kept synchronised and turned on and off at the same time, keeping sleep and eating cycles aligned. But a mutation in PER1 can break this link, leading to an urge to eat at night. The research is reported in the journal Cell Reports.

chatgpt: Scientists have made a breakthrough discovery that could explain why some people have a late-night craving for food. Conducting tests on mice with two human genes, they have found that a mutation in PER1 can break the link between that gene and PER2. This, in turn, could lead to an urge to eat at night. The PER1 and PER2 genes work together to regulate a person's circadian rhythm, which is the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Normally, these genes are kept synchronized, meaning that people have a natural craving for food in the morning and less of an appetite in the evening. However, a mutation in the PER1 gene can disrupt this synchronization, leading to nocturnal cravings. The study, which was published in the journal Cell Reports, involved mice that were genetically modified to have the human version of the PER1 and PER2 genes. Researchers found that when the PER1 gene was mutated, the mice would eat more at night, even though they were given the same amount of food as other healthy mice. Lead author of the study, Dr. Shujing Ong, said that the findings could potentially have implications for people who struggle with late-night snacking. "Our results suggest that a mutation in PER1 may be a contributing factor to why some people struggle to resist snacking at night," Dr. Ong said. "By understanding the biological mechanisms involved, we may be able to develop new treatments or strategies to help people who have this problem." Dr. Ong also highlighted the importance of maintaining a consistent sleep-wake cycle to regulate our eating habits. "Our study reinforces the idea that maintaining a regular sleep schedule is crucial for overall health, including maintaining a healthy weight," she said. "Additionally, this research further emphasizes the importance of understanding the genetic underpinnings of circadian rhythms and how they impact our behavior." While these findings are exciting, it's important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the link between the PER1 gene and late-night snacking in humans. Nonetheless, this discovery could pave the way for developing new strategies to help people regulate their eating habits and improve their overall health.
