article: (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, a well-known basketball fan, will treat British Prime Minister David Cameron to a little March Madness Tuesday as the two head to Ohio to catch an NCAA men's tournament basketball game. There will be two games tipping off the tournament in Dayton, Ohio, a swing state. During halftime of the first game, Western Kentucky versus Mississippi Valley State, the two leaders will conduct a joint interview. The leaders' trip to the game comes as Obama launched his new tournament "bracket challenge" on his campaign website. Obama is asking those who visit the website to predict who will win the college basketball championship and to compare their picks against his. "It's college basketball time again â€” and as friends and co-workers gather around the water cooler to talk top seeds and Cinderellas, here's your chance to fill out a bracket with the President himself," the website says. The site promises to publish the names of anyone who does better than the president once the tournament is over. Obama has publicly picked brackets in years past, drawing heat from Republicans last year for appearing in an ESPN segment to unveil his picks in March 2011. RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said the White House should "explain why filming an ESPN special on the NCAA tournament should be a priority on his public schedule." Before revealing the picks, the president did urge viewers to go to usaid.gov to donate to charities that were assisting in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that had devastated Japan that month. For the record, Obama picked Kansas, Duke, Ohio State, Pitt for his 2011 final four and chose Kansas to take the championship. It didn't. UConn won, beating Butler. It is unclear if Obama would reveal this year's picks during his interview with Cameron on Tuesday. But Cameron's visit will not be all fun and games. On Wednesday, the two leaders will be back in Washington conducting extensive meetings about a range of topics including Afghanistan and Syria, the White House said. "There's a strong working relationship and actually even a strong personal bond between Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama," White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said last week. "We maintain a special and a essential friendship and partnership with the government and people of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is our NATO ally and our closest partner in the world." On Tuesday, the two co-authored an op-ed piece in the Washington Post titled " An alliance the world can count on." "The alliance between the United States and Great Britain is a partnership of the heart, bound by the history, traditions and values we share. But what makes our relationship special â€” a unique and essential asset â€” is that we join hands across so many endeavors. Put simply, we count on each other and the world counts on our alliance," the leaders said in the article.

chatgpt: The NCAA tournament is set to tip off its first games in Ohio on Tuesday, March 16th. Fans and basketball enthusiasts all over the country will be tuning in to watch their favorite teams compete for the championship title, but there's another reason to tune in for the first game. During halftime of the first game, the two leaders of the tournament, NCAA President Mark Emmert and CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus, will conduct a joint interview. This will be an opportunity for viewers to gain insight into the planning and execution of such a massive event. The NCAA tournament, also known as March Madness, is one of the most anticipated sporting events of the year. Each year, 64 teams are selected to compete in a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. The tournament is broadcast on CBS and Turner Sports, drawing in millions of viewers from all over the world. In addition to the joint interview, former President Barack Obama has launched an NCAA bracket challenge on his campaign website. This marks the third year in a row that Obama has participated in the challenge, using his personal Twitter account to promote it and engage with his followers. The bracket challenge is a fun way for fans to get involved in the tournament by predicting the outcomes of the games. Participants can fill out brackets online to compete against each other and have a chance to win prizes. Obama's love for basketball is well known, and he has frequently spoken about how important the sport has been as a source of community and camaraderie in his life. In fact, Obama's passion for hoops was so great that he installed a basketball court in the White House, where he would often play with aides and friends. The NCAA tournament is not just a sporting event, but a cultural phenomenon that brings together people of all ages and backgrounds. Fans from all over the country come together to cheer on their favorite teams, filling arenas and bars with excitement and anticipation. This year's tournament is particularly significant because it is taking place during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The NCAA and its broadcast partners have taken great care to ensure the safety and well-being of the players, coaches, and staff involved in the tournament. Stringent testing and safety protocols have been put in place to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus. Only essential personnel will be allowed in the arenas, and all games will be held in Indianapolis, Indiana, to reduce the potential for travel-related exposures. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the NCAA tournament remains a beacon of hope and resilience for sports fans everywhere. It is a testament not only to the athletic prowess of the players but to the dedication and hard work of the officials, coaches, and staff who make the tournament possible. As the first games of the tournament tip off on Tuesday, fans will be eagerly tuning in to see their favorite teams take the court. But they will also be watching for the joint interview from the two leaders of the NCAA, and perhaps even filling out their own brackets to compete with Barack Obama. The NCAA tournament is more than just a sporting event. It is a celebration of the best of college athletics, a showcase of talent and teamwork, and a source of joy and excitement for fans all over the world. May the games begin.
