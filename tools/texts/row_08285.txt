article: (CNN) -- The Spanish football season is set to get under way this weekend, after strike action by players which forced the opening round of fixtures to be postponed was ended on Thursday. Players from Spain's top two divisions went on strike earlier this month, in a bid to force the league to increase the fund which protects players' wages should clubs experience financial difficulties. The strike ended after the Spain's Professional Football League (LFP) guaranteed the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) payments owed to 200 players would be made. "The Strike Committee of AFE and the LFP have reached an agreement which guarantees through various means the salaries of footballers," read a statement on the AFE's official web site. How match fixing ruined the beautiful game . "After the meeting held today on August 25th, 2011 between the AFE and the LFP, the strike planned for Friday 26th, Saturday 27th, Sunday 28th and Monday 29th has been called off." Another result of the talks is that players will now be able to leave their club if they are owed three months wages or more. The resolution means the season will now begin with the second round of fixtures, with the first match of the campaign set to be Real Sociedad's trip to Sporting Gijon. "We want to thank all the Spanish and non-Spanish footballers that play in our league championship," continued the statement. "We want to let you know how proud we are of all of them, for their show of unity and solidarity without precedent that they gave for many companions who were going through truly tough times." Reigning Spanish and European champions Barcelona will not start their domestic season until Monday, due to their participation in Friday's European Super Cup match against Porto. Their opponents will be last term's third-place team Villarreal, who defeated Danish outfit Odense on Tuesday to reach the groups stages of the European Champions League. Last season's Copa del Rey winners Real Madrid kick-off their season away to Real Zaragoza on Sunday. As the strike in Spain came to an end, Italian players moved a step closer to similar action after the country's clubs voted in favor of changes to the collective contract signed by all footballers. Teams in Italy's Serie A, the top division, and Serie B, the second tier, want to hand coaches the power to force unwanted players to train away from the first team. They also want to introduce changes to the tax paid by the competition's highest earners. "We dictated the precise conditions yesterday to renew the collective agreement. Our demands are reasonable and balanced," Serie A chief Maurizio Beretta told the league's official web site. The row has cast doubt over whether this weekend's opening fixtures can take place, with champions AC Milan set to take on Cagliari on Saturday.

chatgpt: Football fans in Spain can breathe a sigh of relief as the planned player strike has been called off ahead of this weekend’s matches. The dispute, which has been ongoing for several weeks, reached a boiling point earlier this week when the players’ union threatened to strike over unpaid salaries and bonuses. However, after negotiations with the league, an agreement has been reached and the strike has been called off. The league has agreed to pay the money owed to the players, which has been a major point of contention between the two sides. This came as a big relief for players and fans alike as the strike would have brought the sport to a grinding halt. This news has been met with relief by many of the players who were preparing to strike. “We are very pleased that the league has finally agreed to pay us what we are owed,” said one player who wished to remain anonymous. “It has been a long and difficult process, but we are glad that we were able to resolve this issue before it escalated any further.” Meanwhile, in Italy, players are also preparing to strike over planned changes to the collective agreement governing their rights and working conditions. The details of the proposed changes have not been made public, but the Italian players’ union has stated that they are concerned about the impact these changes could have on their working conditions. The strike is expected to take place in the coming weeks, and could potentially disrupt the football season in Italy. This follows a similar strike by Spanish players earlier this year, which was only narrowly averted after last-minute negotiations between the players’ union and the league. Football fans in Italy can only hope that a similar resolution can be reached before the strike takes place. The Italian league has already faced a number of challenges this season, including the disruption caused by COVID-19, and a strike by players would only add to the chaos. It remains to be seen whether the Italian players’ union and the league can reach a resolution before the strike takes place. If they are unable to do so, it could have serious consequences for the remainder of the season, and potentially damage the reputation of Italian football. Football fans across Europe will be watching these developments very closely in the coming days, as the future of the sport is on the line. While the resolution of the Spanish player strike is certainly good news, the situation in Italy highlights the ongoing challenges that the football industry faces, as players fight for their rights and working conditions in the face of increasingly volatile market conditions.
