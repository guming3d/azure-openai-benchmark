chatgpt: Eurostar, the high-speed railway service connecting the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, celebrated its 20th anniversary in style by setting a new Guinness World Record for the world's longest champagne bar on a train. The event took place on one of Eurostar's sleek trains which whisked guests from London's St Pancras station to Paris' Gare du Nord, a journey it has been making since its inaugural journey on the 14th of November 1994. The record-setting event was hosted by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc who led the passengers through a tasting of an exquisite menu of dishes paired with champagne. Mr. Blanc, who has been working with Eurostar for the last two decades, created a tantalising menu of canapés showcasing his culinary expertise. The dishes were perfectly paired with a selection of champagne provided by Eurostar's bar team. The event was attended by more than 60 specially invited guests who were treated to a seven-course tasting menu which included smoked salmon with grapefruit and fennel as well as beef carpaccio with truffle mayonnaise. Every course was accompanied by a glass of champagne, and guests could enjoy views of the French countryside as they were whisked at 186mph towards Paris.
