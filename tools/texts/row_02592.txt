article: (CNN) -- Ferocious rain has caused heavy flooding in the Philippine capital and the surrounding region, killing at least seven people, driving tens of thousands of others from their homes and bringing life in many areas to a standstill. The national weather agency, Pagasa, issued a red alert for the Manila metropolitan area and nearby provinces on Tuesday morning, warning that "severe flooding is expected." The torrential monsoon rains, intensified by a tropical storm out over the ocean, had already caused significant disruption on Monday, forcing the closure of financial markets and government offices not involved in the emergency response. Those measures continued Tuesday as photos and videos showed flood waters reaching waist or chest deep on some roads in the Manila region. iReport: Flooding clogs streets of Manila . The water at several dams in the region is reaching a critical level, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said in a statement. The disaster council reported that seven people had so far died as a result of the rain and floods, most of them by drowning. The deaths occurred across various provinces on the main Philippine island of Luzon. More than 130,000 people have had to leave their homes and seek shelter with friends and relatives or in evacuation centers, the council said. The floods also prompted airlines to cancel flights and authorities to suspend school classes. Seventy percent of central Manila was flooded on Tuesday morning, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing Johny Yu, officer in charge of the Manila Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. The pouring rain and rising water are grimly familiar to the Manila metropolitan region's 12 million residents, as August is generally the area's wettest month. Severe flooding in the region a year ago, also caused by monsoon rains, killed scores of people. Oil spill from sunken ferry in Philippines hurts coastline, fishermen .

chatgpt: The Philippines' national weather agency has issued a red alert for the Manila area as the capital city reels from the effects of heavy rainfall that has been pounding the region for days. The torrential rains have caused widespread flooding, leading to the death of seven people and the displacement of tens of thousands. The flooding has been so extensive that 70% of central Manila is now underwater, according to the national news agency. This has resulted in the closing down of schools, government offices, and financial markets. Local authorities have been forced to issue evacuation orders, and emergency response teams are working round the clock to provide assistance to those affected. The Philippine Red Cross has deployed rescue and relief teams to the affected areas, providing food, water, and other essential supplies to those affected by the flooding. The rapid response has been essential in helping to stem the loss of life and reduce the impact of the disaster. One of the main challenges facing the rescue teams has been the sheer scale of the flooding. In some areas, water levels have reached up to a meter high, making it difficult for rescue boats to navigate through the streets. This has led to a huge backlog of rescue operations, with many people still in need of assistance. Despite the challenges, local authorities and emergency responders are working tirelessly to help those affected by the disaster. They have urged the public to remain vigilant and to follow safety guidelines to avoid any unnecessary risks. This latest disaster comes as the country is still reeling from the effects of Typhoon Vamco, which hit the Philippines earlier this month, causing widespread flooding and landslide. The government has assured the public that they are doing everything they can to provide assistance and support to those affected by the flooding. In the meantime, the public has been urged to stay informed and to follow safety guidelines to avoid any unnecessary risks. With no sign of the rainfall abating anytime soon, the situation remains precarious, and the public must remain vigilant.
