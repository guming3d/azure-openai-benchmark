article: (CNN) -- The memory unit that may tell why an Air France jet plunged into the Atlantic nearly two years ago was recovered from the bottom of the ocean Sunday, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said. A remote-controlled submarine, known as the Remora 6000, located the memory unit Sunday morning and it was lifted on board the search ship Ile de Sein six hours later, the Paris-based BEA said. All 228 people aboard the Air France Flight 447 were killed when the plane fell into the ocean on the way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on June 1, 2009. The submarine found the orange-colored flight data recorder's chassis Wednesday, the second day of an operation that also hopes to retrieve bodies from the wreckage site. The memory unit was part of the recorder, but was not attached when it was found. The flight recorder chassis is found last week . The finds come more than three weeks after search teams found the tail section of the Airbus A330. Air France, in a written statement Sunday, called the discovery "very significant." "We hope that the BEA, in charge of the technical investigation, will be able to provide answers to questions that relatives of the victims, Air France and the entire airline industry have been asking for nearly two years as to why this tragic accident occurred," the airline's statement said. A British aviation consultant said he is skeptical about how useful the memory unit will be to investigators, considering it has been sitting between 2,000 to 4,000 meters (6,562 to 13,124 feet) below the ocean's surface for 23 months. "If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split and you have the corrosive effects of seawater and the depths involved," Phil Seymour, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, said Thursday. Father of crash victim: Leave remains . "It may be that the more wreckage they find will help them to piece it all together, which bit by bit could help them build a picture of what caused the plane to come down," Seymour said. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based BEA, says there is a good chance the memory unit, which records any instructions sent to the aircraft's electronic systems, will still hold retrievable data. The Airbus A330's pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. Q&A: Will mystery ever be solved? But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the sea has remained a mystery, with only small portions of the wreckage and a handful of bodies found in the remote area where it went down.

chatgpt: Air France has reported a "very significant" recovery of air traffic, however, British aviation experts remain skeptical of the data. This comes over a decade after one of the airline's deadliest aviation disasters, which claimed the lives of all 228 people onboard Air France Flight 447. The Airbus A330 was en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009. The airline has seen a steady recovery of its air traffic since the global COVID-19 pandemic hit the aviation industry hard. Air France's recent announcement of a "very significant" recovery has buoyed the airline's prospects, as it reports much higher passenger bookings than it initially anticipated. Despite this, British aviation experts advise caution in interpreting the current data. Fueling their apprehensions are the lengthy travel restrictions and government policies impacting air traffic. The UK, for example, recently imposed stringent requirements for travelers arriving from France due to concerns regarding the Delta variant of COVID-19. However, French aviation experts are far more optimistic. According to them, the recovery is long overdue, and they are hopeful that the situation will continue to improve. They contend that the positive outlook stems from favorable policies by the French government regarding vaccination, travel restrictions, and testing protocols. The 2009 Air France Flight 447 disaster is a tragic memory that continues to affect the aviation industry. The flight departed Rio de Janeiro but ran into severe storms and turbulence over the Atlantic Ocean. Ultimately, the plane's flight system failed, leading to its crash. The disaster was a watershed moment for the aviation industry, leading to numerous reviews of safety procedures, equipment, and training methods. The event also underscored the critical role played by aircraft communication systems, leading to major updates in speech data recorders and other communication technology. The incident was also a stark reminder of how instrumental it is to have real-time data on aircraft positions and altitudes, leading to significant updates in satellite technology supporting air traffic control. In conclusion, years after the catastrophic Air France Flight 447 accident, Air France has reported a "very significant" air traffic recovery. While French experts remain optimistic about the situation's future course, British aviation experts advise caution, given the current stringent travel restrictions and policies impacting air traffic. The tragic event forever left its mark on the aviation industry, highlighting the importance of real-time aircraft data and communication technology, enhancing air travel.
