The country's Socialist party leader Ivica Dačić was midway through a discussion about Balkan politics when the young woman, wearing a short mini dress, uncrossed her legs to reveal she wasn't wearing any underwear. The YouTube video, a clear copy of the famous scene starring Sharon Stone in the 1992 film Basic Instinct, has already had 2.7million hits. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

'The whole case will be fully investigated,' Dačić's national security adviser, Ivica Toncev, was quoted as telling the Serbian daily Blic. 'This was Serbia being mocked, not the prime minister. The prime minister's office will not let this go unpunished,' said Toncev. His office did not respond to requests for comments on the interview or the investigation. The episode, set-up and filmed by a private Serbian production company, was not aired and the trailer for its prank television show Nemoguca Misija (Mission Impossible) was removed from its website. Copycat: The stunt was a clear attempt to recreate the famous scene, starring Sharon Stone, in the 1992 film Basic Instinct . The interviewer, a former model from Croatian Playboy, said Dačić was a 'real man'. 'I have only good words for the prime minister,' Blic quoted 35-year-old Branka Knezevic as saying. 'He is strong and sturdy, a real man for that position. He's exactly who should lead the country.' Serbs were divided over the clip which commentators said reflected the dubious mix of politics and low-brow pop culture in Serbia, a phenomenon that emerged during the wars and sanctions of the 1990s as federal Yugoslavia collapsed. 'He handled it well,' said 28-year-old Belgrade clerk Dejan Perovic. 'He's a man, and no man could remain emotionless in such a situation.' Pensioner Olga Mijatovic was less impressed. 'It was contemptible,' she said. 'It was humiliating both for Dačić and the country and he should have banned it immediately and dismissed his entire public relations team.' Dačić, 47, is also Serbia's interior minister and was formerly the spokesman for late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic during the bloody 1990s collapse of Yugoslavia.

chatgpt: Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dačić and his staff were left fuming on Tuesday after a prank on a talk show made the leader the butt of jokes around the world. During an appearance on the morning program "Morning, cherry, cherry" on the national broadcaster RTS, presenter Ivan Ivanović reenacted Sharon Stone's leg-crossing scene from the movie "Basic Instinct," leaving Dačić visibly uncomfortable. Reacting to the embarrassing incident, an aide to Dačić said the country had been mocked by the stunt. "This was completely inappropriate and deeply disrespectful to the prime minister and our people," the aide said. "We expect an immediate apology from the broadcaster and for the presenter to be disciplined." The incident quickly went viral, with a YouTube video of the prank garnering over 2.7 million views. The video shows the presenter seated beside Dačić, who is flanked by two female aides. As Ivanović recreates the famed scene, the prime minister awkwardly tries to shift his legs and maintain his composure. The incident has sparked national outrage, with many calling for the presenter's resignation and the broadcaster to issue an apology. Despite the backlash, Ivanović has defended his actions, saying that he was simply trying to inject some humor into the dry political interviews that are a regular feature of the show. "I apologize to the prime minister if he was offended, but I think people need to lighten up and not take everything so seriously," Ivanović said. "We are just trying to make entertaining television and inject some humor into our politics." The incident has put a spotlight on the uneasy relationship between the Serbian government and the media. Critics of Dačić's government have accused it of suppressing press freedom and cracking down on critical reporting. The government, meanwhile, has defended its actions as necessary to protect national security and stability. The controversy over the prank has also served as a reminder of the enduring power of social media to shape public opinion and drive debate. With millions of people around the world watching the video of the incident, the story has spread far beyond Serbia's borders, fueling global discussions about politics, humor, and the role of the media in society. As the fallout from the incident continues to unfold, many are calling for a renewed focus on the importance of respect and professionalism in politics and the media. Whether or not the presenter and broadcaster will issue an apology remains to be seen, but the incident has certainly left a lasting impression on Serbian politics and society.
