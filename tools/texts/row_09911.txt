article: (CNN) -- Tropical Cyclone Evan is battering the South Pacific with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph and gusts up to 144 mph, according to the Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii. And things might get worse. Forecasters predict Evan could get stronger over the next 36 hours, evolving into a more powerful Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 126 mph, as it creeps southwest, away from the Samoan islands and toward Fiji. Fiji's meteorological service said Evan was expected to arrive in that country's waters by Sunday. The National Weather Service in Pago Pago, American Samoa, canceled its gale warning Thursday, but reiterated high surf and small craft advisories for the islands, expecting gusts up to 35 mph, heavy rain and towering waves. There were reports of two deaths in Samoa, an independent country with a population of 183,000. American Samoa is a U.S. territory with a population of about 55,000. Journalist Cherelle Jackson told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that there was heavy damage in the Samoan capital of Apia, with houses flattened by the storm. Storm surge and high surf, which the U.S. National Weather Service said could reach 20 feet in the islands, was making a mess of Apia, Jackson said, adding water and power service had been knocked out. Many of the open-style Samoan homes, or fales, which don't have windows or doors, sustained heavy damage, she said. "I don't think we were well prepared because the warning didn't get serious until late last night," Jackson said in a phone interview with the Australian network. Jackson said food could be a problem once the storm passes because the trees that supply Samoan staples, such as breadfruit, taro and bananas, had taken a heavy hit from the storm's winds. "The breadfruits are just all over the road," she said. The New Zealand high commissioner in Apia, Nick Hurley, told Radio New Zealand of heavy damage. "From what I have seen and heard it has made a huge impact on, for a start, all the vegetation, the trees, the infrastructure, all around Apia the power is out. A lot of people don't have any water . The trees have snapped, in a lot of cases have actually come down across roads, crashed into the fale, onto the houses," Hurley is quoted as saying. CNN's Jessica King contributed to this report and Brad Lendon and Mark Morgenstein wrote this report .

chatgpt: Tropical Cyclone Evan is making headlines as it moves through Samoa and American Samoa. The deadly storm, which is the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane, has caused widespread destruction in the region. According to reports, several people have lost their lives as a result of the severe weather. The cyclone made landfall in Samoa on December 13 and has since been battering the islands with strong winds, heavy rain, and flooding. Samoa Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele has declared a state of emergency for the country, urging residents to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their homes. The situation in American Samoa is not much better. The US territory has also been hit hard by the storm, with officials confirming that there have been fatalities and the destruction of property. Many residents have been forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding and damage caused by the cyclone. The National Weather Service has warned that Evan is expected to continue on its path towards Fiji, where it is expected to hit on December 16. Residents in Fiji are being advised to prepare for the storm by stocking up on food, water, and other essential items. The Fijian government has also activated an emergency response plan in anticipation of the cyclone's arrival. Tropical Cyclone Evan has already left a trail of destruction in its wake, and the situation could get worse before it gets better. It is important for residents in affected areas to heed the warnings of officials and take all necessary precautions to ensure their safety. The cyclone is a stark reminder of the devastating impact that natural disasters can have on communities. In recent years, the Pacific has been hit by a number of severe weather events, including Cyclone Winston in 2016 and Cyclone Gita in 2018. These storms caused significant damage and loss of life, highlighting the need for continued efforts to build resilience and preparedness in the region. As Tropical Cyclone Evan continues to move towards Fiji, the world is watching and hoping for the best. It is our hope that the people of Fiji will be able to weather the storm and emerge safely on the other side. Our thoughts are with those who have been affected by this deadly cyclone, and we stand ready to support relief efforts in any way we can.
