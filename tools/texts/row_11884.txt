article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Church of England is offering unmarried parents who want to tie the knot the option of having baptisms for their children at the same time. Statistics show an increasing number of couples live together before their wedding day, the church says. The offer is a response to demand after church-sponsored research showed that 20 percent of couples getting married in a church already had children, whether together or from a previous relationship, the church said. It is also a way to make the church more welcoming for unmarried parents and their families, a church spokesman said. The church is issuing new guidelines to priests that encourage them to offer parents the option of having a baptism or thanksgiving service for their child's birth at the same time as their wedding. The guidelines also advise priests on how to perform the dual ceremonies, the spokesman said. "Patterns of relationship and marriage within society are presenting new opportunities for the church," said Bishop of Wakefield, Stephen Platten, who chairs the Church of England's Liturgical Commission. "We are therefore offering guidance on how thanksgiving for the gift of a child, or indeed baptism, might be incorporated within a marriage service so that the church can respond pastorally to our changing world if a priest feels it would be advisable to offer this option." What do you think of the offer? Have your say . It has always been possible to hold both ceremonies at the same time, but priests didn't always know how to go about it, spokesman Howard Dobson said. The guidelines make it easier for priests to know how to offer and perform the dual ceremonies, he said. Research from Britain's Office of National Statistics shows that for many couples, having children is now the first major milestone of adult life, ahead of marriage -- in contrast to their parents' generation, the church said. Statistics also show an increasing number of couples now live together before their wedding day, the church said. The Church of England said it hopes the ideas "will help churches show their welcome for couples with children, and give the whole family a special occasion and a new beginning."

chatgpt: The Church of England has announced plans to become more accepting of unmarried parents. Research conducted by the Church revealed that an estimated 20 percent of couples who get married already have children. In response to this, the Church is now offering the opportunity for baptism during the same service as their wedding. This move is seen as a way to be more welcoming to unmarried parents, who may have previously felt excluded from the Church due to the lack of recognition for their family situation. The Church is hoping that this change will encourage more people to feel comfortable attending services and participating in church life. The Reverend Dr. Sandra Millar, Head of Life Events for the Church of England, stated that “We are seeing an increasing number of couples who already have children, but who would like to get married in church, and this often forms part of their decision to baptise their child.” The new approach by the Church of England is in line with their wider aim of being more inclusive and modernizing their practices. The move also comes at a time when fewer people, particularly young adults, are engaging with the Church and it is seen as a way to broaden their appeal. Parents who would like their child to be baptized during their wedding ceremony will first need to meet with their local clergy to discuss their plans. The baptism will then take place alongside the wedding service, with the family and friends in attendance. The Church of England has been making strides towards being more accepting of diverse family structures in recent years. In 2019, the Church updated their marriage vows to include a promise to support each other as equals, regardless of gender. These changes reflect a shift in attitudes towards family diversity and inclusivity in the Church of England, and the hope is that more people will be attracted to their message of love and unity through embracing this modern way of celebrating family. In conclusion, the Church of England’s new approach to being more welcoming to unmarried parents is a positive move that reflects the evolving attitudes towards family diversity and inclusivity. It is hoped that this will encourage more people to feel comfortable attending services and participating in church life, as well as broadening their appeal to a wider audience. With the Church continuing to make strides towards inclusivity, it seems likely that more changes will be on the horizon.
