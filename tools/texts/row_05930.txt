article: WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered its inspectors to make sure regional airlines' training programs are in line with federal regulations, authorities announced Tuesday. Regional airline Colgan Air's Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo, New York, on February 12. "It's clear to us in looking at the February Colgan Air crash in Buffalo that there are things we should be doing now," FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said. "My goal is to make sure that the entire industry -- from large commercial carriers to smaller, regional operators -- is meeting our safety standard." Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo, New York, on February 12, killing all 49 passengers and crew members aboard. One person on the ground was also killed. Federal investigators held hearings on Capitol Hill last month on the cause of the crash but have not concluded their inquiry. Several shortcomings of the crew came to light during the National Transportation and Safety Board hearings when it was revealed that Colgan Air Capt. Marvin Renslow failed to reveal two pilot exam failures in his job application. Testimony at the hearings also revealed that fatigue apparently contributed to the failure of Renslow and First Officer Rebecca Shaw to save the plane as it approached Buffalo Niagara International Airport. USA Today newspaper reviewed the safety board's accident reports over the past 10 years and found that in nearly every serious accident involving a regional airline during that time, at least one of the pilots had failed multiple skill tests. "In eight of the nine accidents during that time, which killed 137 people, pilots had a history of failing two or more 'check rides,' tests by federal or airline inspectors of pilots' ability to fly and respond to emergencies," USA Today reported Sunday. "In the lone case in which pilots didn't have multiple failures since becoming licensed, the co-pilot was fired after the nonfatal crash for falsifying his job application." In addition to reviewing regional airlines' training programs, Babbitt and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood have called on representatives from major air carriers, their regional partners, aviation industry groups and labor to participate in a "call to action" in Washington on Monday, according to a U.S. Department of Transportation news release. The review will address pilot training, cockpit discipline and other flight safety issues, the release said.

chatgpt: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced that it will be examining the training procedures at regional airlines. The aim is to ensure they meet the required federal standards. The decision comes after an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) into the fatal 2009 crash in Buffalo revealed pilot exam failures. The NTSB investigation found that the pilot in charge of the flight had failed multiple flight tests prior to the accident. This led to questions about training procedures and whether the pilot had been adequately prepared for the flight. The FAA's decision to examine the procedures at regional airlines is an effort to prevent similar incidents in the future. Reports by USA Today have uncovered troubling findings in the training procedures for pilots at regional airlines. In eight out of nine crashes at regional airlines examined by the publication, there were reports of pilot exam failures. This has raised concerns about the overall standard of training at these airlines. The FAA has stated that it will be focusing on pilot training records and the effectiveness of the training programs. The aim is to identify any shortcomings and ensure that training meets or exceeds the federal standards. This is in line with the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve safety in the aviation industry. Regional airlines play a crucial role in providing transportation to millions of people each year. However, concerns about safety procedures have been raised in recent years. The FAA's decision to examine training procedures is a welcome move for passengers and industry stakeholders alike. The FAA has urged regional airlines to cooperate fully with the review process. They have also emphasized the importance of ongoing training and monitoring to ensure that pilots are equipped to handle all potential scenarios. The safety of passengers and crew is paramount, and the FAA is committed to taking all necessary steps to maintain the highest safety standards in the aviation industry. In conclusion, the FAA's decision to examine training procedures at regional airlines is a positive step towards improving safety standards in the aviation industry. The NTSB investigation into the fatal Buffalo crash, along with reports of test failures at regional airlines, highlight the need for a review of training procedures. The FAA's commitment to identifying and addressing any shortcomings is an important move towards ensuring the safety of all those who travel by air.
