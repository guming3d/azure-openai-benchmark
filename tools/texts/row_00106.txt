It is not the first place you would think to go for fine wine – but budget store Lidl says it has been overwhelmed with demand for a £19.99 claret. The supermarket, perhaps  better known for discount lager than classy Bordeaux, is stocking a reputable St Emilion Grand Cru as part of a push for affluent  shoppers trying to bag a bargain. The Château Laroze 2007 is the most expensive wine ever sold by the German-owned chain. Lidl’s ‘Wine Cellar’ also includes a 2011 Châteauneuf du Pape at £12.49 and a 2011 Sancerre at £9.99.

Chateau Laroze is planted with 68 per cent Merlot, 26 per cent Cabernet . Franc and 6 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon. In the Chateau Laroze blog, the owner describes the wine as having sex appeal. Guy Meslin wrote in 2009: 'If any wine has sex-appeal, this one does. All the ingredients are melded and in place. 'The wood is nicely blended in and quite flattering, and nicely sets off the very fresh fruity hints. 'The tannins are not especially powerful, but contribute sheer silk and velvet. 'The finish prolongs all this with an emphasis on the aromatic freshness.' The supermarket launched its wine range after realising customers were willing to spend money on the finer things . He said: 'This is a Grand Cru Classé . which means it is at the top of the Bordeaux quality hierarchy and one . has to expect to pay more for it. 'This is very fine, showing the . fragrant aromas of St Emilion, a depth of flavour unusual for the . vintage and a wonderful long finish, the hallmark of a great Bordeaux.' Lidl is alone in selling the Château Laroze 2007 – it is only available from wholesalers otherwise. Lidl increased its share of the groceries market by 10 per cent between October and January.
