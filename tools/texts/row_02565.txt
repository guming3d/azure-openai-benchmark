The idea behind the concept is to make sure that every animal is made to feel just as important and valued as their human companion.  Of course, there are plenty of hotels and resorts that have tailored their services to meet the needs of pet owners, but few have gone to the lengths that the ME London has to ensure that furry guests have the very best experience possible. Each animal that stays at the hotel will receive chef-prepared food and snacks, as well as plush and cozy bathrobes, towels and shampoo to help them relax and settle into their new surroundings.
