New Mexico officer Joshua Terrell tried to catch Jal police chief Larry Burns having sex inside and up against an ambulance on city property because he wanted to sabotage his run for magistrate. Despite catching Burns on camera with a woman while wearing his gun and badge, the dastardly plan came back to haunt Terrell after he gave the footage to local television instead of Jal city manager, Bob Gallagher.

Initially, Burns was suspended for two weeks without pay while an investigation was launched. That discovered that Terrell planted the camera and led to his dismisal for violating eight different policies including using a key to access the ambulance bay when he was not authorized to be there. And, because he did not keep the video evidence internal, he is not protected from the sack as a whistleblower, because he released it to the public. 'To try to destroy a person that he did not like – I thought we didn't need Terrell with a badge or a gun,' Mr Gallagher said to KRQE.

'It would have been very easy if he had just come in with the tape and said, 'Mr Gallagher, I think something is going wrong in the department'.' Gallagher said that Burns did make an error of judgement, but that no evidence could be found that he committed a crime or was even on duty when the tape was filmed. The police chief, Larry Burns, also serves as the town of Jal’s Emergency Medical Services Director. 'In this case there was no criminal activity whatsoever, there was no proof whatsoever that it was on duty when he should have been working, ' said Gallagher according to Opposing Views. 'I think it was lapse of judgment. Something that I don’t think will keep him from being able to perform his duties when he comes back.'

chatgpt: Jal, New Mexico - Jal police chief Larry Burns has been suspended for two weeks after an explicit video of him having sex was recorded and leaked by one of his own officers, Joshua Terrell. The footage was leaked by Terrell, who had a personal grudge against Burns and was hoping to stop him from becoming a magistrate. Terrell's actions backfired, however, as he was promptly fired from his position for violating privacy rules. The video, which has gone viral on social media, shows Burns with a woman who is not his wife. The video was reportedly recorded using a smartphone camera and leaked to the public without Burns' knowledge or consent. The scandal has shocked the community and raised concerns regarding the conduct of local officials. The incident also highlights the dangers of personal biases among law enforcement. Many residents have expressed support for Burns, while others have called for his resignation. Some have also criticized the police department for allowing an officer with a personal vendetta against the chief to continue to work alongside him. Jal Mayor Tom Dunlap issued a statement condemning the actions of both Burns and Terrell. "The behavior of these two individuals is completely unacceptable and does not reflect the values of our community or our police department," Dunlap said. "We are committed to fully investigating this matter and taking appropriate disciplinary action." Burns has not publicly commented on the incident, but sources close to him have stated that he is embarrassed and deeply sorry for his actions. Some members of the community say they feel sorry for Burns, while others believe he should be held accountable for his behavior. The incident has also raised questions about the ethics of citizen journalism and the dangers of viral social media videos. While many believe the video should not have been leaked, others argue that it is important for citizens to hold law enforcement officials accountable for their actions. As the community comes to terms with this scandal, it is clear that the repercussions will be felt for some time. The incident has rocked the city of Jal and highlighted the importance of transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct among law enforcement officials.
