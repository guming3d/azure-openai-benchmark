article: It is not often that skyscrapers double up as theme park rides - but this new design for a building in Miami is breaking the mold. Plans for the unusual SkyRise Miami have just been approved, combining two thrilling rides with a building that looks like a giant slide. The £262million ($428million) construction is set to become an icon in the Florida city as Miami's tallest building, standing at 1,000ft high - and has already been dubbed 'Miami's Eiffel Tower'. Scroll down for video . Deluxe: The £262 million project will include three observation decks and exclusive night clubs . Jewel of the harbour: SkyRise Miami will rise out of Port Miami to be an unmissable 1,000ft . Outside entertainment: With nightlife sorted, the building also features three rides for thrill-seekers . And while it will boast three observations decks, a sky-high bar and nightclub, it is the idea for two thrilling rides that has caught the public's attention. Thrillseekers will be able to indulge in SkyRise Drop, and experience that allows people to base jump off the skyscraper attached to a 'high-speed controlled-descent wire'. And if that isn't enough, they will also be able to try SkyPlunge, being locked into a harness before freefalling 50 stories. An exclusive club and a bar will cater for adults wand the SkyRise Flying Theater will provide additional entertainment. The Sky High Club will be the height of exclusivity for the vibrant Miami and South Beach club scene being 1,000ft up while a fine dining restaurant will have the same views a floor down in a more subdued setting. Before: The area in Port Miami where construction has been approved for SkyRise Miami . Decked out: The top of SkyRise Miami where three observation decks, bars and restaurants will be found . Sense of place: The tower will rise out of Port Miami and overlook South Beach and the city . For the rides, SkyRise Drop is essentially a base-jumping experience with a high-speed controlled-descent wire system instead of self-activated parachute. The second ride, SkyPlunge, will see visitors strapped into a harness and sent into a 50-storey drop before a rapid deceleration keeps them from the ground. Finally, the SkyRise Flying Theater is a motion-based simulator similar to Soaring at Disney World’s Epcot.

chatgpt: Miami is about to have a new landmark in town - SkyRise Miami, the city's very own Eiffel Tower. A unique building that is 1,000-feet tall and is going to be completed in 2017. SkyRise Miami is the brainchild of Jeffrey Berkowitz, who envisioned it as "an iconic destination that will give a new meaning to the Miami skyline." Heralded as one of the most innovative and adventurous construction projects of the decade, the SkyRise Miami is going to offer an unparalleled experience for thrill-seekers with its gut-wrenching, bungee-jumping ride. The SkyRise Miami is getting its final touches, which will make it an even bigger attraction for the city of Miami. What sets the SkyRise Miami apart is the fact that it has been designed to provide a unique experience to its visitors, something that other high-rise buildings fail to do. The SkyRise Miami is different in terms of design since it has a cube shape, and it has no beams or columns. However, the star attraction of the SkyRise Miami is the 'Sky Drop.' This adrenaline-fueled ride will have visitors free-falling from the top of the building, resembling a base jump. This thrilling ride will allow visitors to experience the thrill of bungee-jumping without actually having to do it. The Sky Drop is the first of its kind and is sure to draw adventure-seekers from all over the world. Apart from the 'Sky Drop,' SkyRise Miami will have several other attractions to offer visitors. A rotating observation deck, which will offer 360-degree views of the city, restaurants and cafes, and a movie theater, which will display movies on a four-story screen, are just a few examples of the SkyRise's many attractions. Furthermore, the SkyRise Miami is also expected to serve as a crucial economic driver for the city. The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and bring in millions of dollars to the regional economy. In closing, the SkyRise Miami is not only going to be a unique attraction for the city, but it will also generate employment opportunities for its residents, and its economic impact on the city is going to be significant. The SkyRise Miami is a testament to the city's rich culture and bold identity as one of the world's premier destinations, making it a must-visit place for thrill-seekers and tourists alike.
