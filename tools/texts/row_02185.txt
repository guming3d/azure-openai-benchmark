article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Honey has been used to treat wounds since ancient times, but recent years have seen a surge of medical interest in the sticky stuff. Research has shown that honey has antibacterial properties. Manuka honey has been the subject of particular interest, with the results of a study just published by Sydney University finding that it has powerful antibacterial properties, and is even effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Associate Professor Dee Carter, from Sydney University's School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences said: "Our research is the first to clearly show that these honey-based products could in many cases replace antibiotic creams on wounds and equipment such as catheters. Using honey as an intermediate treatment could also prolong the life of antibiotics." "Most bacteria that cause infections in hospitals are resistant to at least one antibiotic, and there is an urgent need for new ways to treat and control surface infections." She added: "We don't quite know how these honeys prevent and kill infections, but a compound in them called methylglyoxal seems to interact with a number of other unknown compounds in honey to prevent infectious bacteria developing new strains that are resistant to it." Honey is a complex substance, containing up to 800 compounds and its complexity means it has been difficult to pinpoint exactly how it kills bacteria. Manuka is a type of honey that is made by bees pollinating the flowers of the Manuka bush, a member of the Leptospermum family that grows naturally in New Zealand. Now, an Australian company is claiming to have produced the world's most potent medical-grade antibacterial honey, made by bees pollinating the Australian jellybush, also a member of the Leptospermum family. Australia's Medi Bioactive Honey Company claims its Berringa antibacterial honey has twice the antibacterial content of normal manuka honey, and has launched the product in the UK. Dr Rose Cooper of the University of Wales Cardiff School of Health Sciences has researched honey's antibacterial action and has written a book called "Honey in Modern Wounds Management." Cooper told CNN that there are many components in honey that contribute to its antibacterial nature. She says its high sugar content, low water content and low pH are all factors. Additionally, some honey produces hydrogen peroxide, which can kill bacteria. Since 2004, Britain's National Health Service has licensed the use of manuka-honey wound dressings and sterilized medical grade manuka-honey creams.

chatgpt: An Australian company has recently claimed that it has produced the world's most potent honey with powerful antibacterial properties. Honey has been widely recognized for its medicinal benefits for centuries. Honey has natural antibacterial properties and is used to treat a variety of conditions, from sore throats and coughs to burns and wounds. Research has shown that honey has potent antibacterial properties due to its high sugar content and low water content making it difficult for bacteria to grow within the substance. Additionally, honey has an enzyme that produces hydrogen peroxide, which is commonly used as an antiseptic. Manuka honey is a particular type of honey made by bees that pollinate the manuka plant, which is native to New Zealand. The manuka plant has been traditionally used in Maori medicine for centuries. In recent years, several studies have shown that manuka honey has even more potent medicinal properties than traditional honey. Manuka honey has been shown to be effective in treating conditions such as acne, eczema, and rosacea. It has also been used to treat wounds and burns, as well as for digestive health and treating sore throats. The Australian company, known as "Superbee Honey Factory," claims to have produced the world's most potent honey. This particular honey is made from bees that pollinate a variety of plants, including the manuka plant, resulting in a blend of different honey flavors with stronger antibacterial properties than just manuka alone. The company claims that their honey has a unique "Total Activity" factor, which measures the antibacterial potency of the honey. The higher the Total Activity factor, the more potent the honey's antibacterial properties are. The company's honey has a Total Activity factor of over 25+, which is significantly higher than the industry standard for manuka honey's potency. This indicates that Superbee's honey has a stronger antibacterial effect than most other manuka honeys on the market. While the company's claims have not yet been independently verified, the potential health benefits of manuka honey and the unique blend of different plant pollens used in their honey is an exciting development for the industry. There is no doubt that honey, particularly manuka honey, has a host of potential health benefits. Its potent antibacterial properties have been studied extensively, and it is a widely accepted natural remedy for various conditions. Superbee Honey Factory's claim of producing the world's most potent honey only adds to the growing body of research on the potential of honey as a powerful medicinal tool.
