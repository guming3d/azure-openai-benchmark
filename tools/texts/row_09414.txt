article: (CNN) -- People in poorer countries send text messages more often than those in wealthier countries. Men in Spain and Germany access the Internet on their phones twice as much as women do. And use of online social networks grew dramatically in Egypt and Russia over the past year, most likely as part of the recent political upheavals in those countries. These are among the results of a new report that measured the usage of digital communication in 21 countries. The survey by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project found that text messaging is now a widespread global phenomenon: In the countries polled, 75% of cell phone owners say they text. In almost all the countries surveyed, the use of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter didn't change much from 2010 to 2011. Two notable exceptions were Egypt, where 28% of respondents now use social networks -- up from 18% last year -- and Russia, where social-networking use rose from 33% to 43%. Facebook and other networking tools played a prominent role in the revolution that toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in February. Protesters organized so effectively on social networks that the Egyptian government shut down the Internet for five days in an unsuccessful attempt to quell the uprising. Observers say social networks also have helped mobilize protesters in Moscow, where tens of thousands have filled the streets to speak out against Russian parliamentary elections they say were rigged. The Pew survey found that only 6% of Internet users in Russia were not on social-networking sites. Researchers conducted the survey face-to-face and via telephone in the spring of this year. Sample sizes in each country ranged from 700 in Japan to more than 4,000 in India. Among the survey's other findings: . -- Of the countries surveyed, text messaging was most common in Indonesia and Kenya, where 96% and 89% of people said they regularly send texts. By contrast, 67% of people in the United States were frequent texters. -- In Spain, 29% of male cell phone owners use their devices to access the Internet, compared to 13% of female phone owners. This mobile-Web gender gap was also pronounced in Germany (26%/11%) and in Turkey (30%/14%). -- Social networking is generally more common in wealthier nations, largely driven by the fact that they have higher rates of Internet access. For example, 53% of respondents in Israel and 50% of respondents in the U.S. said they use social networks, compared with 5% in India and 2% in Pakistan.

chatgpt: A recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center has shown a dramatic increase in the use of social networks in countries such as Egypt and Russia during periods of political upheaval. The report, which measured the usage of digital communication in 21 countries, also revealed interesting differences in communication habits between people of varying economic status. In less wealthy countries such as Kenya, texting remains a popular method of communication compared to wealthier nations. This is likely due to the higher cost of smartphones and internet access in those areas, making text messaging a more economically feasible option. However, the report did note that smartphone ownership is on the rise, even in less affluent countries. The Pew Research Center's report also revealed differences in online communication habits between different age groups. Younger people tend to use social networks more frequently, with over 80% of young adults in countries such as the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom using social media. Interestingly, the report also showed that people in countries with greater internet access tended to use online communication more for personal reasons, while those in countries with less access used it more for business purposes. This suggests that the digital divide between wealthy and poor nations not only affects personal communication but also has a significant impact on global business and the economy. The survey's findings highlight the importance of digital communication in our modern world, particularly in times of political turmoil. Social networks have become a vital tool for organizing and sharing information, allowing people to connect with each other and share their experiences in real-time. This has been particularly evident in countries such as Egypt and Russia, where social media played a significant role in mass protests and political campaigns. As the world becomes increasingly dependent on digital communication, it is important to bridge the digital divide between wealthy and poor nations to ensure equal access to technology and information. Countries must work together to provide affordable internet access, especially in areas such as Africa and South Asia, where internet penetration rates are low. In conclusion, the Pew Research Center's report highlights the significant role that digital communication plays in our daily lives, and the impact it can have on politics, business, and the global economy. As technology continues to evolve and shape our world, it is crucial that we work to ensure equal access to communication tools and technologies for all, regardless of economic status or geographic location.
