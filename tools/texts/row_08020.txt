Another hoard of lost masterpieces has been discovered in Austria by investigators looking into art looting by the Nazis. The works were allegedly recovered from a property belonging to the reclusive son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, one of Hitler's aides . The works were allegedly recovered from a property belonging to the reclusive son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, one of Hitler’s aides. Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, claimed he had inherited the collection from his father, who took orders from the dictator to buy and sell ‘degenerate art’ during the Second World War. He aroused suspicion in 2010 when German customs officials stopped him on a train from Switzerland carrying a large sum in cash. When authorities raided his Munich apartment in February 2012 on suspicion of tax evasion, they stumbled upon the vast art collection. Investigators were then led to another property owned by Mr Gurlitt in Salzburg, western Austria, where they discovered a further 60 paintings. An artwork by the German painter Franz Marc: At the end of the war 'Monuments Men' - the American army's art sleuths - quizzed Gurlitt's father on suspicion of criminal art dealing but he was never charged . Last week, a Vienna-based journalist revealed the existence of the third house linked to Mr Gurlitt, which is thought to have been used as a storage depot for the family collection. The large estate in the village of Bad Aussee, Styria, is home to Roman salt mines that were used to store some 6,000 artworks, which Hitler tried to destroy shortly before the war ended. It is estimated that less than half of the collection, recently featured in the George Clooney film The Monuments Men, was returned to the original owners. The total number of works recovered now stands at 238.

chatgpt: A stunning collection of art, including a bronze sculpture by Renoir and drawings by Gauguin, Cezanne, and Picasso, has been found in Germany. The haul was recovered from the property of the reclusive son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, one of Hitler's aides who had been ordered to sell "degenerate art" during the Second World War. The Gurlitt collection has been the subject of much controversy since it was first discovered in 2012. The collection contains over 1,400 works of art that Hildebrand Gurlitt had amassed during the war, many of which were believed to have been looted from Jewish families. The discovery of this new haul, consisting of 219 works of art, is a significant addition to the Gurlitt collection. The bronze sculpture by Renoir, entitled "Venus Victorious," is a particularly notable piece. The sculpture depicts the goddess of love and beauty holding a bow, with a quiver of arrows at her feet. It is believed to have been created in 1914, during Renoir's later years. The drawings by Gauguin, Cezanne, and Picasso are also highly significant. They include sketches, studies, and finished works by these three masters of modern art. Among the sketches are studies of female nudes, still-life compositions, and landscapes. The recovery of this haul is a major victory for the German authorities, who have been working tirelessly in recent years to uncover looted art from the war. It is believed that the works were taken from museums, galleries, and private collections during the war, and have been hidden away in various locations ever since. The discovery of the Gurlitt collection in 2012 was a turning point in this effort, and since then, much progress has been made in tracing the history of the art and returning it to its rightful owners. The new haul is expected to shed further light on the workings of the Nazi regime and its efforts to suppress modern art. The fate of the Gurlitt collection remains a contentious issue, with legal battles still underway over its ownership and restitution. However, the latest discovery is a reminder of the importance of preserving art and culture, and the ongoing efforts to rectify the injustices of the past.
