chatgpt: England have dropped two places to No 15 in the latest FIFA world rankings, according to the governing body's official website. This follows a disappointing performance in the World Cup last year, where they lost to Croatia in the semi-finals and later to Belgium in the third-place play-off. Gareth Southgate's side has since struggled to regain their form, drawing against Bulgaria and Kosovo in Euro 2020 qualifying matches. Meanwhile, Africa Cup of Nations winners Ivory Coast have climbed two places to No 20 in the world rankings. They emerged victorious in the 2015 edition of the tournament, but were eliminated in the group stages in the next two editions. However, they bounced back this year to lift the trophy for the second time in their history. The team's standout performers included Wilfried Zaha, Nicolas Pepe, and Franck Kessie. Another team that has seen a significant rise in the rankings is Australia. The Asian Cup winners have climbed an impressive 37 places to No 63 in the world rankings. They lifted the trophy for the first time in their history earlier this year, beating Japan 1-0 in the final. The team was praised for their defensive solidity throughout the tournament, conceding only two goals in seven matches. Australia's climb in the rankings can be attributed to their strong showing in the Asian Cup, as well as their performances in recent friendly matches against South Korea and Germany. Coach Graham Arnold has built a solid foundation for the team, with players like Aaron Mooy, Mat Ryan, and Tom Rogic standing out in midfield. The top five teams in the world rankings remain unchanged, with Belgium, France, Brazil, England and Uruguay making up the top five. European champions Portugal have jumped two places to No 6, while Croatia have fallen four places to No 8 after a disappointing UEFA Nations League campaign. The world rankings are determined using a points-based system, which takes into account a team's results over a four-year period. The system is designed to reward teams for performing well in major tournaments and against strong opponents. The rankings are used to determine seeding for major tournaments like the World Cup and the European Championships. Fans and pundits alike will be eagerly awaiting the next update to the FIFA world rankings, which are due to be released in September. With several big tournaments on the horizon, including the Copa America and the African Cup of Nations, there is sure to be plenty of movement in the rankings over the coming months.
