article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- Most of a 1,300-year-old Tibetan town popular with tourists was destroyed by a fire over the weekend, renewing concerns over commercial development at Chinese heritage sites. The blaze, which raged for 10 hours on Saturday, destroyed at least 240 houses or two thirds of the ancient settlement of Dukezong in Yunnan province, southwest China, according to Xinhua state news agency. The town was known for its well-preserved Tibetan dwellings and the fire spread easily from one wooden house to the other after starting in a small hotel. Some 2,600 residents were evacuated from the scene, but no casualties were reported, Xinhua added. The possibility of arson has been ruled out, and the cause of fire is still under investigation, local authorities said. More than 1,000 firefighters and volunteers battled the flames, officials said, but the narrow streets made it difficult for fire trucks to maneuver. Fire fighters also found that hydrants were empty due to a shutdown in water supply during sub-zero winter conditions, according to Chen Tianchang, head of the fire service for the Deqen Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the region where the town is located. The town forms part of a county now called Shangri-La, which with its dramatic scenery claims to have inspired the fictional paradise described in the 1933 novel by British author James Hilton. The fire also renewed concerns over commercial development in China's ancient towns, which have witnessed growing numbers of tourists in recent years. There have been a string of fires at heritage sites in recent months, Xinhua reported. In October, a blaze tore down an ancient building complex in Hongjiang, central China and a covered bridge in the Western city of Chongqing was destroyed by fire in November. Another fire also raged in the old town of Lijiang, Yunnan in March. Li Gang, director of the region's cultural relics protection department, told Xinhua that the traditional gaps between the wood buildings in Dukezong to prevent fires had been filled in by restaurants, shops and guesthouses as "tourism booms." "We have to reconsider the traditional principle of architecture while enhancing fire extinguishing facilities," Li said.

chatgpt: A popular tourist destination in Southwest China has been devastated by a raging fire that destroyed nearly two-thirds of an ancient town, but fortunately, there were no reported casualties. The town of Dukezong, located in China’s Yunnan province, is known for its well-preserved Tibetan dwellings and has been attracting tourists from all over the world. However, on a recent Thursday, the town was left in ruins following an intense inferno that swept through the area. The fire is believed to have started in a hostel before spreading to other buildings, eventually engulfing the ancient town. Nearly 240 houses and businesses have reportedly been destroyed, and it took over 10 hours and more than 2,600 firefighters to extinguish the fire. Despite the extensive damage, officials have assured the public that none of the residents or tourists have been harmed during the incident. However, many who have visited the town in the past are heartbroken to see the loss of such a cultural gem. The town of Dukezong was founded over 1,300 years ago and was once a pivotal stop along the ancient tea horse trading route. The town’s well-preserved Tibetan-style buildings have also made it a popular destination for tourists from around the world. The blaze has also sparked concerns over commercial development in ancient towns, with some questioning whether the rapid modernization could be contributing to an increased fire risk. Local officials have indicated that they plan to investigate how the fire started and what measures could be taken to prevent a similar disaster in the future. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of commercial development in ancient towns throughout China. While some argue that it helps to preserve the historic sites by bringing in tourism revenue, others are concerned that it could lead to the loss of cultural heritage and potentially put these ancient towns at risk. It remains to be seen what impact this tragedy will have on future development plans for Dukezong and other ancient towns in China. However, for now, the focus remains on rebuilding and preserving the cultural legacy that was left in ashes by this tragic blaze.
