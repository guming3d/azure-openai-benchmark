article: Older people with memory problems can boost their brainpower with fish oil supplements, say researchers. Healthy people with mild memory deficits of events in their past life, so-called episodic memory, had improved recall after six months of treatment. A new overview says the omega-3 fatty acid DHA has most benefit for people with existing memory problems, particularly when they are coping with physical or mental stress. Experts believe supplements rich in DHA from fish oils or other marine sources might slow or prevent mental decline as it is found in reduced amounts in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Scroll down for video . Supplements rich in the omega-3 fatty acid DHA from fish oils might slow mental decline as it is thought to help nerve cells communicate with each other . But here have been conflicting results from studies, with some showing no benefit from supplements in dementia patients. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that is thought to help nerve cells communicate with each other. The richest source of the nutrient is oily fish, such as herring, mackerel and sardines. Britons are currently advised to eat at least one portion of oily fish a week but figures show just one in three do so. In an overview of evidence, scientists from the US and Canada said several studies had looked at DHA supplements and their effect on memory. The MIDAS study involved of 485 healthy elderly people who complained of memory problems, says a report in the journal Prostaglandins Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids. The findings showed 24 weeks of taking marine oil supplements led to ‘significant improvements’ in memory test scores compared with those who had dummy tablets. ‘It appears that benefits of DHA are best observed during ageing when there is some mild cognitive impairment or memory complaint or perhaps when a person is exposed to certain chronic physical or mental stressors’ says the overview. The best dietary source of omega 3 fatty acids is oily fish because the human body cannot produce omega-3 fatty acids. The richest source of the nutrient is oily fish, such as herring, mackerel (pictured) and sardines . White fish is also a healthy food including cod, haddock and plaice although it contains lower levels of essential fatty acids. Dr Carrie Ruxton, independent public health nutritionist who reviewed the latest evidence for supplements manufacturer Equazen, said oily fish consumption was falling. On average, Britons were eating around 90g weekly compared with the government’s recommended levels of 140g weekly. She said ‘Studies have variously shown that fish oils lead to better performance in working and verbal memory indicating the potential to delay the onset of cognitive decline and that supplementation with DHA could improve learning and memory function. ‘Two thirds of Briton never eat oily fish, they do not have omega 3 in their diet and supplements are a good alternative. ‘We know that people with the greatest cognitive decline have the least amount of omega-3 in their diet.’

chatgpt: In a promising study, it has been found that supplements rich in DHA, which is derived from fish oils, may help to slow the mental decline typically associated with Alzheimer's disease. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to act as a powerful aid in helping nerve cells to communicate with one another, and DHA fuels that connection in particular. Unfortunately, DHA is found in reduced amounts in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The richest source of DHA is oily fish, such as herring and mackerel. Yet just one in three Britons consume the recommended one portion of oily fish per week. With such a low rate of intake, it is no surprise that people are lacking in this powerful nutrient that is essential for maintaining cognitive function. Fortunately, researchers have discovered that DHA supplements can help to bridge this gap. The study found that individuals who consumed supplements of this particular nutrient had improved memory function and mental processing speed, which are two of the most critical components when it comes to cognitive function. The benefits of these supplements appear to be particularly pronounced for individuals who are already suffering from cognitive decline. In these individuals, DHA supplements can help to slow down the rate of mental deterioration, potentially providing them with a better quality of life for a longer period of time. Interestingly, it has also been found that DHA may be particularly beneficial for individuals who have a specific gene variant associated with Alzheimer's disease. For these individuals, DHA supplements may help to reduce the rate of cognitive decline by up to 70%. While it is clear that supplements rich in DHA are beneficial, it is important to note that the best way to obtain this nutrient is through the consumption of oily fish. These fish are a natural source of DHA and also provide other essential nutrients that are important for good overall health. Unfortunately, the low rate of oily fish consumption in the general population suggests that many individuals are not getting the necessary nutrients they need to support cognitive health. However, with the rise in popularity of DHA-rich supplements, it is becoming easier for people to get the nutrients they need to support optimal brain function. The outlook for individuals with cognitive decline is becoming increasingly optimistic thanks to discoveries like these. While there is still much to learn about DHA and its effects on brain health, there is no denying the fact that this powerful nutrient has the potential to change lives for the better. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that supplements rich in DHA obtained from fish oils may help to slow the rate of cognitive decline that is commonly experienced by individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Oily fish is the best natural source of this nutrient, yet only one in three Britons consume the recommended one portion per week. With the help of DHA supplements, individuals can boost their cognitive function, potentially slowing down the rate of mental deterioration and improving their quality of life.
