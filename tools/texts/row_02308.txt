article: By . Mia De Graaf . A family was left distraught after their five-month-old Labrador ate their £400 holiday money the day before they set off. Murphy has a habit of eating everything he can find from socks to skirting boards. So when mother-of-two Donnah Dear left cash for a four-day holiday to Torremolinos on the kitchen counter, he couldn't resist. Shock: Donnah Dear, 37, and her sons Oliver, three, and Toby, six, with Murphy who ate £400 of their cash . It wasn't until she and partner Ben Lawson, 36, came home to pack that they discovered what had happened. Ms Dear, 37, said: 'It just disappeared. There wasn't a trace of it, not a corner of a note or anything. 'We spent ages looking before we realised Murphy must have eaten it.' Determined to go on the holiday with their sons Toby, six, and Oliver, three, they left the puppy at home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, with Mr Lawson's mother Jill. Incredibly, by the time they returned £375 of the cash had emerged intact - and Barclays agreed to put the chewed-up cash back in their account. Despite emergency surgery since, to recover an eaten sock, the remaining £25 has not been found. The family had been planning to spend the money they saved during a four-day trip to Torremolinos . Ms Dear added: 'We thought 'oh no we are going on holiday with no money, that's really bad' - but it was okay, it didn't ruin our trip. 'We managed to get enough money together so it was alright. 'As we queued to get on the plane we heard that Jill had got about £300 back, by the time we returned it was £375. 'The last £25 has disappeared. 'We took the money to Barclays and although the notes had been chewed up and stuck back together they put the money in our account, which was really good of them.' Despite recovering the money, Ms Dear, who runs an estate agents with Mr Lawson, said: 'Murphy will be our first and last dog. 'He honestly eats everything and we aren't actually sure what to do about it.'

For the Dear family, their trip to Torremolinos, Spain, turned out to be an unforgettable experience, thanks to their 10-months old puppy, Murphy. Donnah Dear, her partner, Ben Lawson, and their two sons were all set for their holiday, with a to-do list to tick off before they left. One of the tasks included changing £400 into euros for their expenses while on vacation. Ms Dear promptly headed to the airport to get the cash and left it on the kitchen top, confident that everything was in order for their trip. Little did she know that their furry friend, Murphy, had other plans. While the family was away, the mischievous pup found his way into the kitchen and helped himself to the cash. When the family returned home, they were shocked to find the euros scattered all over the kitchen floor, along with pieces of ripped-up notes. Ms Dear, distraught at the situation, didn't know what to do next. "I couldn't believe it when I saw the mess in the kitchen. I had already exchanged all the money I had, and now it was gone." She added, "Murphy looked pleased with himself, wagging his tail as if to say, 'Look at me, I'm rich.'" Despite the challenging situation, the family took the incident in good spirits and found humor in Murphy's antics. The incident even garnered a lot of attention on social media when Ms Dear posted the hilarious incident on her Facebook page. Many people found the story amusing and shared it on their profiles. While Ms Dear acknowledged that it was an expensive lesson, the family managed to make light of the situation and carry on with their much-awaited vacation. It's safe to say that Murphy became the star of the show, with frequent mentions of him and his 'money heist" in their conversations during the trip. As for the Dear family, they learned the importance of keeping valuables out of reach of pets, particularly when they are away from home. They also acknowledged that holiday mishaps can happen, no matter how well-planned a trip may seem. Nonetheless, the memory of Murphy's 'heist' will remain a lasting memory for them and a reminder of how challenges can turn into humorous events with the right perspective.
