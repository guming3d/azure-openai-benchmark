article: (CNN) -- All five remaining inmates held in the Mississippi pardons controversy have now been released from prison. Mississippi's Supreme Court last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour granted on his way out of office, rejecting a challenge by the state's attorney general. In a 77-page, 6-3 ruling Thursday afternoon, the court found the pardons "may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch." Attorney General Jim Hood argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers, but the court found the final decision rested "solely with the governor." "We are mindful that the victims and their families are entitled to be interested in the subject matter of this case, and they are undoubtedly -- and understandably -- concerned with its outcome," Justice Jess Dickinson wrote for the majority. But in the cases before them, it was up to the governor to " decide whether the Constitution's publication requirement was met." In a statement after the court ruling, Barbour said it "reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state," but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates' victims. But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Michael Randolph called the decision "a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons, and an immeasurable loss for the law-abiding citizens of our state." Hood argued that the state Constitution required that for a pardon to be valid, notices be filed, each day, for 30 days in newspapers where their crimes were committed. But during a February Supreme Court hearing, Barbour's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30-day notice rule was "an unconstitutional encroachment" on the governor's power. Thursday's ruling is the final word on the case, but Hood said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter. "We do respect the decision of the Court, but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families. It is these victims and family members who have lost today and the criminals who have won," he said in a statement, echoing Randolph's dissent. Among the 214 inmates Barbour pardoned before he left office in January were four convicted murderers who had worked as "trusties" at the governor's mansion. Critics argued that the governor failed to consider the families of their victims before freeing them. All four and an armed robber also pardoned by Barbour had remained free while the issue worked its way through the courts, and were freed under Thursday's decision. Five other inmates who had remained behind bars awaiting a ruling have been released. Barbour has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated. CNN's Martin Savidge and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Mississippi's Supreme Court recently upheld a series of controversial pardons which were issued by the state's Governor before leaving office. The pardons were called into question after it was revealed that no proper notice was posted in newspapers prior to their issuance. Despite this, the state's Attorney General has stated that there was nothing inherently illegal about the pardons themselves.  The pardons, which were issued by former Governor Haley Barbour, have been a source of controversy in Mississippi for several years. Many critics allege that the pardons were issued in a rushed and haphazard manner, with little consideration given to the potential consequences. Others argue that the pardons were a long-overdue attempt to address systemic problems within Mississippi's criminal justice system, which has been criticized in the past for being overly harsh and punitive. Regardless of how one feels about the pardons themselves, it seems clear that they have had a significant impact on a number of different individuals and communities throughout Mississippi. Many of the individuals who were pardoned by Governor Barbour were serving lengthy sentences for nonviolent offenses, such as drug possession or driving under the influence. These individuals were given a second chance at life and granted a fresh start, something which many of them have said they are immensely grateful for. However, the pardons have also had a significant impact on the victims of these individuals' actions. Many of the victims have spoken out against the pardons, arguing that they represent a betrayal of justice and a failure to take seriously the seriousness of the crimes committed. The Attorney General's recent statement that no proper notice was given before the pardons were issued has only added to this controversy, as many now wonder if the pardons were issued in a legal and ethical manner. In response to these concerns, Governor Barbour has defended his decision to issue the pardons, stating that it was a difficult but necessary choice. He acknowledges that his decision has been difficult for the victims of the inmates who were released, but also believes that it was important to give these individuals a second chance at life. He has also emphasized that the pardons were issued in accordance with state law and that no wrongdoing took place. Despite this defense, however, many in Mississippi remain skeptical of the pardons and the manner in which they were issued. Some have called for a more thorough investigation into the pardons, while others are simply left wondering what the future holds for criminal justice reform in Mississippi. Regardless of what happens next, however, it seems clear that the legacy of Governor Barbour's decision will continue to be felt throughout the state.  In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Mississippi's controversial pardons is unlikely to be resolved any time soon. While some feel that the pardons were a necessary step towards reforming the state's criminal justice system, others see them as a betrayal of justice and a failure to take seriously the consequences of individuals' actions. Ultimately, the decision to issue pardons is a difficult one, and it remains to be seen what the long-term impact of Governor Barbour's decision will be on Mississippi's criminal justice system as a whole.
