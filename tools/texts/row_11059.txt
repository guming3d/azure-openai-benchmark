article: Paris (CNN) -- A librarian in northern France made what may be the discovery of his lifetime when he uncovered a rare Shakespeare's First Folio in his library's collection. There are fewer than 240 known copies of the First Folio -- the first printed collection of 36 of William Shakespeare's plays, produced in 1623, seven years after his death -- so turning up a new one is an unlikely event. For Remy Cordonnier, director of the medieval and early modern collection at the library in Saint-Omer, the moment he realized what he held in his hands was one of excitement -- and disbelief. He was preparing an exhibition on Anglo-Saxon authors in September when he came across the First Folio. It was missing some pages, which is why it had been misfiled many decades ago. "We looked deeper and we realized quickly that it was not a common edition," Cordonnier told CNN. At first, the director could not believe what he had found. "I think I have 2.5 million pounds in my hands," he told his boss. He then sought advice from Eric Rasmussen, a Shakespeare expert at the University of Nevada in Reno. "I am not an expert myself on Shakespeare's pieces, so I wanted to have the opinion of an expert," said Cordonnier. "This is why I contacted Eric Rasmussen to make sure they did not already know about the First Folio. He was actually in London working on the Shakespeare year at the British Library and agreed to come to authenticate the document." Rasmussen's authentication, just this past weekend, confirmed what Cordonnier had suspected. The Saint-Omer library was home to a Shakespeare's First Folio. This discovery "will add prestige to the region and help reconnect with our illustrious history, unfortunately forgotten for a century and a half," Cordonnier said. The library still plans to make the First Folio part of the Anglo-Saxon exhibition, but it will not be put on display. "It is going to be digitized to be accessible to the public, at least virtually," Cordonnier said. The precious book, meanwhile, will be stored in a safe to protect it from any damage. According to the British Library, which holds four copies, the First Folio was produced by two of Shakespeare's fellow actors and closest friends, John Heminge and Henry Condell. Although some of the playwright's works had been published before in a smaller, poorly edited format, the roughly 900-page book was the first to unite almost all of them, categorized as "Comedies, Histories and Tragedies." Without the First Folio, much of Shakespeare's work would have been lost to subsequent generations. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, with 82 First Folios, has the single largest collection of the books, representing one-third of the world's existing copies. Shakespeare turns 450 this year . CNN's Marion Lory reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.

chatgpt: In an exciting discovery, a librarian stumbled across a previously unknown copy of Shakespeare's First Folio in the library in Saint-Omer. The book, which was printed in 1623, is one of fewer than 240 known to exist in the world. The librarian found the copy misfiled in the library and quickly sought the help of a U.S. Shakespeare expert, who authenticated the book. The First Folio is a collection of Shakespeare's plays, compiled by two of his fellow actors and friends after his death. It was first printed in 1623 and contains 36 plays, many of which would have been lost without its publication. It is considered one of the most important books in English literature and is highly sought after by collectors. The copy found in Saint-Omer had been misfiled for decades, and it is unclear how it came to be there. The librarian who made the discovery was stunned and immediately sought the help of the U.S. expert to verify the authenticity of the book. The expert quickly confirmed that the book was indeed a First Folio and was in excellent condition. The discovery of a previously unknown First Folio is a rare and exciting event for both scholars and collectors of Shakespeare's works. There are only a few hundred known copies of the book in existence, and each one is highly valuable. Collectors and institutions around the world are willing to pay millions of dollars for an authentic copy of the First Folio.
