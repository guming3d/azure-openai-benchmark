article: Gun-related homicides and crime are "strikingly" down from 20 years ago, despite the American public's belief that firearm crime is on the upswing, a new study said Wednesday. Looking back 50 years, a Pew Research Center study found U.S. gun homicides rose in the 1960s, gained in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s and the early 1990s, and then plunged and leveled out the past 20 years. "Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago," the researchers say. A Pew survey of Americans in March found 56% believed gun-related crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12% said it's lower. The survey said 26% believed it stayed the same and 6% didn't know. Chicago's record murder rate: Don't blame guns alone . The new study found U.S. firearm homicides peaked in 1993 at 7.0 deaths per 100,000 people. But by 2010, the rate was 49% lower, and firearm-related violence -- assaults, robberies, sex crimes -- was 75% lower in 2011 than in 1993, the study found. Those drops parallel an overall decline in violent non-fatal crime, with or without a gun, the study said. In fact, gun-related homicide rates in the late 2000s were "equal to those not seen since the early 1960s," the study found. Explanations for the drops the past 20 years aren't clear, the study said.

"Researchers have studied the decline in firearm crime and violent crime for many years, and though there are theories to explain the decline, there is no consensus among those who study the issue as to why it happened," the researchers say in a summary. Despite the decline, the United States still has a higher rate of homicide than other developed countries, the study says. But America doesn't have a higher rate for all other crimes. The United States also has a higher rate of gun ownership than any other developed country, the study said. NRA's LaPierre says gun rights struggle a 'long war'

chatgpt: According to a recent study conducted by Pew, firearm-related homicides and crime have dropped significantly since their peaks in 1993. These drops closely parallel the overall declines in violent, non-fatal crime. This positive trend is a welcome one, but the study notes that there is no consensus as to why it has happened. Despite these declines, however, America still has a higher rate of homicide than any other developed nation. While the country has made progress in reducing the number of homicides related to firearms, much work remains to be done to make it safer for all. The Pew study analyzed data from the FBI and found that firearm-related homicides dropped from a rate of 7.0 per 100,000 people in 1993 to 3.6 per 100,000 in 2010. Similarly, firearm-related crime fell from a rate of 16.8 victimizations per 1,000 people in 1993 to 4.8 per 1,000 in 2014. These drops follow the overall trend in violent, non-fatal crime, which also declined significantly during this period. According to the study, the number of violent victimizations per 1,000 people fell from a rate of 79.8 in 1993 to 20.1 in 2014. Despite this good news, there is no clear consensus as to why these declines have occurred. Some theories point to increased incarceration rates, while others credit improved policing methods or the decline in the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. Regardless of the reason for these declines, much work remains to be done in the fight against gun violence in America. The country's higher-than-average rate of homicide is a serious concern, and policymakers should continue to explore measures to reduce the number of deaths related to firearms. Some of the potential solutions include expanding background checks for gun purchases, banning assault weapons, and funding research into the causes and effects of gun violence. It is only by taking proactive steps in this fight that we can hope to reduce the number of deaths and make our communities safer for all.
