article: Boss: BG Group had been planning to pay chief executive Helge Lund (above) a £12million 'golden hello' on top of his annual pay of up to £13million . The major energy firm which proposed a £25million pay package for its new boss has scaled back the deal following shareholder outrage – to around £18million. BG Group had been planning to pay chief executive Helge Lund a £12million ‘golden hello’ on top of his annual pay of up to £13million. But following mounting criticism and the prospect of a revolt over the deal, the firm has been forced to cut this back. Because of new targets tied to the firm’s financial performance against industry peers such as BP and Shell, the company estimates that he will now receive around £4.7million from the welcome package instead of £12million. A vote on the deal, which had been planned for two weeks’ time, has also been scrapped because the new package is in keeping with the company’s existing pay rules. Had the vote gone ahead, it was likely the company would have suffered an embarrassing defeat. Four of its largest investors had criticised the deal publicly, with several major pension advisory groups also coming out against it. ‘The board should never have put shareholders in this position,’ said Martin Gilbert, chief executive of fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management – one of BG’s top ten investors. ‘We were very surprised the board chose to give him these awards in the first place.’ Pressure is now increasing on the company’s pay chief, Sir John Hood, to step down. Sir John, the former Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, concocted the original pay package. He gets £153,000 a year for his part-time role, which includes leading the remuneration committee. BG has admitted it used ‘expert’ pay consultants when setting pay levels, but a source added: ‘The remuneration committee is ultimately responsible for pay matters, including this package.’ Major energy firm: BG Group proposed a £25million pay package for its new boss, but has scaled back the deal following shareholder outrage - to around £18million . BG, which was demerged from British Gas in 1997, admitted it had been forced into the decision. A statement said: ‘The board believes that Mr Lund is an exceptional candidate. 'However, a significant number of shareholders questioned the structure of the package. Both the board and Mr Lund recognise and wish to respond to shareholder concerns.’ BG was previously accused of ‘blackmail’ by shareholders after warning that Mr Lund was not obliged to join the firm if investors did not support the £12million package. Yesterday it confirmed that he would be joining, despite his awards being scaled back. The move was widely welcomed by business leaders who had previously criticised the pay deal. The Institute of Directors applauded the climbdown after describing the initial package as ‘excessive and inflammatory’. Simon Walker, the IoD’s director general, said: ‘While substantial, the total remuneration now falls within proper limits for a company of BG’s size and international importance.'

chatgpt: The energy firm BG Group has been facing mounting criticism over its decision to offer a £12m 'golden hello' to new CEO Helge Lund. The payment would have been in addition to Lund's annual pay, which could potentially reach up to £13m. However, the prospect of a revolt from shareholders over the excessive payment has led to the firm rethinking its decision. BG Group had argued that the 'golden hello' was necessary to attract a high-caliber CEO like Lund, who has a proven track record in the industry. Lund previously served as CEO of Norwegian energy giant Statoil, where he helped to boost the company's profitability and expand its operations. But critics argued that the payment was excessive and out of line with industry standards. The backlash against the proposed payment also highlighted concerns over executive pay and the widening gap between the salaries of top executives and their employees. BG Group's decision to offer Lund a 'golden hello' was not unusual in the industry, where such payments are often used to attract top talent. However, the amount offered by BG Group was larger than most, and attracted a great deal of scrutiny from investors and the media. The mounting criticism of the deal, combined with the prospect of a revolt from shareholders, appears to have led to a change of heart among BG Group's leaders. The company announced earlier this week that it was reconsidering the payment, and would seek to engage with shareholders and other stakeholders before making a final decision. The announcement was welcomed by some investors, who had previously expressed concerns over the 'golden hello'. However, others criticized the company for not anticipating the backlash earlier, and argued that the U-turn reflected poorly on BG Group's leadership. The debate over executive pay has been a hot topic in the UK in recent years, as concerns over income inequality and the potential impact on social mobility have come to the fore. Critics argue that excessive executive pay can undermine morale among employees, and lead to a culture of greed and self-interest at the top of companies. BG Group is not the only company to face criticism over pay in recent years. A number of high-profile CEOs, including those at BP and HSBC, have come under scrutiny for their salaries and bonuses. However, the situation at BG Group has been particularly contentious, due to the size of the payment and the company's position in the energy sector. The firm is one of the largest producers of liquefied natural gas in the world, with operations in more than 20 countries. Despite the controversy surrounding the 'golden hello', Lund's appointment has been welcomed by many in the industry. He is widely regarded as a skilled operator, and his experience is seen as an asset in a rapidly-changing and challenging global energy market. It remains to be seen how the debate over executive pay will play out at BG Group, and in the wider UK business community. However, the controversy over Lund's 'golden hello' has highlighted the need for companies to be more transparent and accountable when it comes to executive pay, and to take into account the views of a wider range of stakeholders.
