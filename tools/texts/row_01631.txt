Callous: Richard Henderson has been jailed for five years after being found guilty of breaking into a hospital and stealing a handbag from a patient. Right, Hull Royal Infirmary, the scene of his sickening crime . The court heard Henderson, who had a history of drug abuse, had broken into the hospital on May 3 at 1.30am. He crept into the ward where Ms Johnson was sleeping and stole her handbag from a bedside table. The next day he returned to the scene of his crime and even spoke to Ms Johnson while she had a cigarette outside. She was in the hospital receiving treatment. His twisted crimes were rumbled at 2am when he was seen by a member of staff rifling through the jacket of a colleague in a doctors' consulting room.

chatgpt: A drug addict who targeted a vulnerable woman with no legs while she slept has been sentenced to jail for five years. Richard Henderson, a 39-year-old man, carried out a series of sick crimes against the victim, in his latest attempt to claim disability benefits illegally. Henderson had stolen the identity of an invalid, who was entitled to the disability benefits, in order to claim them for himself. He was charged with identity theft, theft of benefits, and fraud. He had also been charged with burglary and assault for his attack on the woman. The court heard that he had been high on drugs at the time and was looking for money. The victim, a 35-year-old woman, is physically disabled and cannot move her legs. Henderson targeted her while she was asleep in her house and assaulted her. He then stole her purse, which contained some cash and her credit cards. While leaving the house, he also took her mobile phone and some of her jewellery. Henderson was later caught by police who traced him through his use of the stolen credit cards. In his defence, he argued that he was suffering from drug addiction and had committed the crime to support his drug habit. However, the judge presiding over the case rejected his arguments and handed him the maximum sentence possible under the law. In passing the sentence, the judge described Henderson as a dangerous and depraved individual who posed a grave threat to society. He also noted the traumatic impact the crime had on the victim and her family, noting that she had been left traumatised and unable to trust anyone. The victim's family, who were present in court, expressed their satisfaction at the sentence, saying that it would send a strong message to others who might consider committing similar crimes. The case highlights the growing problem of identity theft, particularly among vulnerable individuals. Such crimes can have serious implications for the victims, who may find it difficult to reclaim their identities and recover any losses that they have suffered. The authorities are calling on individuals to be vigilant and protect their personal details, particularly their social security numbers and banking information. In conclusion, the sentencing of Richard Henderson, the drug addict who targeted a woman with no legs, is a stark reminder of the dangers of identity theft, and the need to remain vigilant in protecting our personal details. His actions have had a lasting impact on the victim and her family, and the severe sentence imposed by the court reflects the gravity of his crimes.
