article: Port St. Joe, Florida (CNN) -- One by one, with a hand as steady as a surgeon's, Lorna Patrick removes eggs from a sea turtle's nest on a Florida beach. "If it falls, you probably killed the hatchling that's developing inside," said Patrick, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Patrick admits she holds her breath each time she takes an egg out of the sand and places it in the foam cooler. Sand is delicately placed in the cooler between and on top of each egg. Patrick uses the sand from the nest, which is located just a few inches from the beach's surface. This process is part of an unprecedented sea turtle relocation program. Moving sea turtle nests days before the eggs are to hatch has never been done before. It is also the first time that wildlife experts had to deal with oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. "Shy of letting the hatchlings swim in oil, it's our best alternative," said Sandy MacPherson, the national sea turtle coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service. "We're confident if they go into oil they're going to die." Patrick is working on the second sea turtle nest to be moved since the program started. Ninety percent of the United States' sea turtle population can be found on Florida's beaches, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It is estimated that 700 nests can be found in the Florida Panhandle, an area vulnerable to the oil spill. "This is a huge relocation effort," said Thomas Strickland, assistant secretary of interior for fish and wildlife and parks. "As many as 50 to 100,000 eggs over the next six to eight weeks will be dug up." An average nest has anywhere from 100 to 120 eggs. Sea turtles come out of the water a few feet from the coastline and lay their eggs in the warm sand. Loggerhead turtle eggs, the type Patrick is handling, usually hatch within 60 to 70 days. The eggs are moved just over a week before they are expected to hatch. Wildlife officials want to keep the eggs in their natural environment as long as possible. "Through the eggs it's believed they actually connect to the landscapes where they were born," Strickland said. Once the turtles mature it is hoped that they will return to the original nesting area and the natural birthing cycle will continue. Once Patrick's two coolers are full, with the nest's 107 eggs, they will start a journey across the state. A special climate-controlled truck donated by Federal Express will deliver the eggs to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The coolers will be stored in a special NASA building that will be regulated to the warm summer temperatures to which the eggs are accustomed. Instead of the beautiful white sandy beach, the hatchlings will be born in the transport coolers. Once they break out of their shells, the warm blue Atlantic Ocean will be awaiting them.

chatgpt: In a race against time to save the sea turtle population from the devastating impact of the recent oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. wildlife experts have undertaken an unprecedented effort to relocate their eggs to a safer location. For the first time in history, a team of wildlife experts is manually moving sea turtle eggs from their natural nests on the Florida Panhandle to the Kennedy Space Center, a designated safe site located nearly 450 miles away. The eggs are being collected from beaches that are at imminent risk of being contaminated by the oil spill. The relocation process involves carefully removing the eggs from their nests using specialized equipment and transporting them in temperature-controlled containers. Upon arrival at the Kennedy Space Center, the eggs will be housed in a special building operated by NASA. Officials hope that by storing sea turtle eggs at the Kennedy Space Center, they can maximize the chances of survival for the threatened species. The eggs are expected to hatch in a few weeks, and once they are old enough, they will be released back into the Atlantic Ocean to rejoin the rest of the sea turtle population. The oil spill disaster has already had a devastating impact on marine life in the Gulf of Mexico, with dolphins, whales, and other species washing up on shore in record numbers. However, sea turtles are especially vulnerable to the effects of the spill, which can disrupt their food sources, destroy their habitats, and make it difficult for them to reproduce. Sea turtles are a vital part of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, and their conservation is essential to the long-term health of the region's coastal environment. However, the oil disaster has put their survival at risk, making the relocation effort all the more critical. The Kennedy Space Center was chosen as the relocation site due to its unique features and technical capabilities. The NASA facility is located on the central-east coast of Florida, away from the oil spill area, and has a special building suitable for the care and release of the sea turtle hatchlings. Scientists involved in the relocation project say they are cautiously optimistic about the outcome. They believe that this unprecedented effort to move sea turtle eggs by hand could be a crucial step in the conservation of the species. However, there are still many challenges ahead for the relocation project. Wildlife experts will have to perform regular check-ups on the eggs to ensure they are developing well, and they will have to take extra precautions to protect the hatchlings from predators once they are released into the ocean. The relocation project is a massive undertaking that requires a coordinated effort between multiple agencies and organizations. It has been made possible thanks to the dedication and hard work of countless individuals who are committed to preserving the natural beauty of the Gulf of Mexico and its inhabitants. As the relocation effort continues, conservationists and wildlife experts are calling on the public to be vigilant and report any cases of stranded or compromised sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico. By working together, they hope to minimize the impact of the oil disaster on these beloved creatures and ensure that they remain an integral part of our ocean's ecosystems for generations to come.
