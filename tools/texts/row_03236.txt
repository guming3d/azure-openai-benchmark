Roswell, New Mexico sprang to international fame on July 8, 1947, when the local newspaper reported the capture of a 'flying saucer' by government officials in the town. Over the decades since the discovery, conspiracy theorists have insisted that the debris came from an alien spacecraft, and that the fact was covered up by the military. The continuing belief of alien activity in the area led the Air Force to launch an investigation into the crash in 1995. Officials concluded that the 'UFO' was part of a balloon launched into the atmosphere as part of a secret government surveillance programme aimed at the USSR. However, many have refused to accept that explanation, alleging a conspiracy to hide the existence of extra-terrestrial life.
