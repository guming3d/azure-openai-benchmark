article: By . Daniel Martin . Bank of England staff have been awarded more than £25million in bonuses since the start of the credit crunch, it emerged yesterday. The payments have been handed out despite the fact that Governor Sir Mervyn King and his top team failed to anticipate the global financial crisis, and did nothing to prevent the Libor interest-rate rigging scandal. Figures yesterday showed that the level of payouts actually increased last year by £200,000 to £4.9million – as Britain returned to recession. Gloom: . Executives at the Bank of England have received bonuses of up to . £30,000 despite Governor Sir Mervyn King and his staff failing to . predict the credit crunch or the Libor interest-rate scandal . One MP called the taxpayer-funded sums ‘rewards for failure’. Over the past five years, thousands of Bank of England executives have received up to £30,000 in performance-related pay. The awards, handed out between when the credit crunch began in 2007 and this year, have totalled £25.3million. They come on top of generous salaries which exceed £150,000 a year for some of the Bank’s senior staff. However, Sir Mervyn, his deputies and members of the committee which set interest rates, are not among those who have received the extra money. Labour MP John Mann said paying bonuses to their staff when the Bank has performed so badly sets ‘a terrible example to commercial banks’, which have been accused of paying too much in bonuses. He added: ‘They [the Bank] should be leading the way in creating a new banking culture, not leading the way in paying excessive bonuses.’ Sir Mervyn has had to revise the Bank’s economic forecasts a dozen times since the credit crunch began, most recently on Wednesday, when he downgraded a previous 0.8 per cent growth prediction to zero. Last month the Bank of England injected an additional £50 billion into . the economy through its quantitative easing programme bringing the total . stock to £375billion . Mr Mann, a member of the Commons Treasury select committee, added: ‘It beggars belief that they could be paying bonuses at this time. They failed to pick up on the Libor scandal, they failed to pick up on other wrong-doings. ‘They have failed to properly analyse what is happening in the economy. It is totally wrong that they should be rewarded for failure.’ A spokesman for the Bank of England defended the bonuses. She said: ‘Our staff are on a two-year pay freeze which began in 2011. ‘Bonus payments are based on individual performance. The pot has been frozen at 6 per cent of the total salary bill for the past three years. Average awards for the past five years have been between £2,000 and £3,000.’

chatgpt: Thousands of bank executives in the UK have been granted performance-related bonuses, with some of them reaching as high as £30,000. This news comes only a few days after Governor Mervyn King warned that an economic recovery for the country could take years, and he slashed the growth forecast for the year to zero. Despite the grim economic outlook, the bonuses have been awarded in recognition of individual performance, leading many to question the appropriateness of rewarding bankers when the economy is in such a precarious state. In response to the news, Labour MP John Mann has criticized the bonuses and stated that it is wrong to reward bankers for failure. Many experts believe that the bonuses are somewhat controversial because they are being awarded at a time when ordinary households are struggling to make ends meet. This comes amid widespread austerity measures, job losses, and cuts to public spending. Critics believe that the banking industry has played a significant role in the current economic downturn and therefore should not be rewarded in the current climate. A former Bank of England chief has also weighed in on the debate. Mr. Eddie George, who led the Bank of England from 1993 to 2003, believes that the banking industry has failed to learn the lessons of the credit crunch, which occurred over five years ago. He stated that banks should have done more at that time to avoid a repeat of the crisis. The bonuses have caused controversy among politicians, regulators and the public alike. Some argue that bankers are being rewarded for exploiting customers, while others believe that the bonuses are being given out to help retain talent in the banking industry, which could potentially help the UK regain its position as a leading financial centre. It remains to be seen whether the banking industry will change its ways in light of the ongoing criticism. However, many would argue that the rewards of the business should be more evenly distributed and aligned with public interest. Amid the calls for reform, many are urging for a more balanced approach to be taken so that the biggest beneficiaries of the banking sector are held accountable for their actions.  In the meantime, what is clear is that many people are unhappy about the decision to award large bonuses, and it has reopened the discussion of ethics within the banking industry. The pressure on banks to reassess how they operate in the future is only likely to grow, and the public will be watching closely to ensure that they act in the best interests of everyone.
