article: (CNN) -- One of three malnourished men found earlier this month in the garage of a Houston home has died, police said Tuesday. He and the other men told police they'd been held captive before they were discovered July 19. William Merle Greenawalt, 79, was pronounced dead six days later, Houston police said in a statement, which did not detail a cause of his death. The two other men, ages 59 and 64, who were allegedly held captive have been released from hospitals to the care of the state's Adult Protective Services. Walter Renard Jones, 31 -- a grandson of the home's owner -- has been charged with injury to the elderly by act and injury to the elderly by omission, according to Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva. The charges came after officers responded to a call at a modest single-story Houston home and found three men "living without any level of care," police said. "The three men claimed to have been misled by the suspect (Jones) into residing at the home in exchange for food and shelter," police added. "All three men claimed the suspect used force and coercion to keep them there for the purpose of monetary gain." Investigators were looking into whether the men had been forced to hand over their government aid, including disability, Social Security and veterans checks. At least some of the alleged captives were believed to be homeless. "What the men initially told us was they were lured there with the promise of cigarettes and food," Silva said earlier this month. The men told the officers that they had been held for varying lengths of time. One man told them it felt like 10 years, but Silva said earlier this month, "Whether it goes into years or not is unknown." CNN's Greg Botelho, Ed Lavandera and Joshua Rubin contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Houston police discovered three men living in a garage without any level of care, according to a statement released on Tuesday. Unfortunately, one of these men later died, and police have yet to give a cause of death. The statement also revealed that the remaining two men have been released from area hospitals. Houston police have charged a grandson of the home's owner in the case. The grandson, whose identity has not been released, is believed to have been responsible for the care and welfare of the three men. Neighbors and local authorities are stunned by the discovery. "I've never heard of something like this happening in our neighborhood," said one neighbor who wished to remain anonymous. The three men were reportedly found living in deplorable conditions. The garage had no running water, and the men had no access to proper hygiene facilities. According to police, the men were malnourished and had not been receiving proper care. The investigation into this tragic case is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge. However, the incident has raised concerns about elder abuse and the care of vulnerable individuals in our society. "Everyone deserves to live with dignity and respect, regardless of their age or health status," said an area official. "We must do better to protect our vulnerable populations and ensure that they receive the care they deserve." This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of caring for our elderly and vulnerable populations. It is important that we all stay vigilant to ensure that no one is living in unsafe and unsanitary conditions. As the investigation continues into this tragic case, authorities are hopeful that justice will be served, and that steps will be taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
