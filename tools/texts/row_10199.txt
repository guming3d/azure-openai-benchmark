Amid revelations that the National Security Agency has the ability to intercept data going between servers and other computers, tech giant Google now says it will encrypt all messages sent through its Gmail email service to prevent prying eyes from looking at private messages. In a blog post made Thursday by head Gmail security engineer Nicolas Lidzborski, Google said that every time a user checks or sent email, it will be encryped as the data goes to and from Google's servers. Although Google has given Gmail users the ability to sign into their accouints through an encrypted connection (known as HTTPS) since 2010, Gmail will now automatically default users to the more secure network.

'In addition, every single email message you send or receive—100 percent of them—is encrypted while moving internally,' the post reads. 'This ensures that your messages are safe not only when they move between you and Gmail's servers, but also as they move between Google's data centers—something we made a top priority after last summer’s revelations.' Those revelations were made last year by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, who leaked documents about global surveillance efforts used by the agency, including snooping on emails. Reports have indicated that the NSA was hacking into fiber optic cables used by tech companies to send data to and from data servers scattered around. The trouble is that the data sent through these cables is usually not encrypted, which allowed NSA spies easy access to the information being sent.

Encrypting messages not only protects users from the NSA, but from computer hackers as well. 'By protecting the connection between you and Google servers, they protect you against tons of attackers,' Mikko Hypponen, a security researcher in Finland, told CNNMoney.com. However, Google hasn't NSA-proofed Gmail completely. The agency still has the ability to send out National Security Letters compelling a company to release information. And the federal government hasn't been shy requesting data from Google. In a transparency report, Google said that for the first half of 2013, it received 25,879 requests for user information from government agencies and courts.

chatgpt: Google has taken a significant step towards protecting user privacy with its latest security upgrade. The company has confirmed that all messages sent and received through Gmail are now encrypted, providing an extra layer of security for its users. The move comes in response to revelations made last year by former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden, which suggested that the spy agency was able to intercept private messages sent through Gmail. Encryption essentially involves scrambling messages so that they cannot be intercepted easily, making them extremely difficult to decipher. With Gmail now encrypted, users can be confident that their private conversations will remain just that - private. It's a move that has been welcomed by privacy advocates, who say that the new feature is long overdue. Some have even gone so far as to say that the encryption is now strong enough to thwart even the most determined hackers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the move to encrypt all emails has not been without controversy. Critics argue that it could hamper criminal investigations, making it more difficult for law enforcement to track illegal activities. Some have also argued that the move could play into the hands of terrorists and other dangerous groups, who could use encrypted messages to plan attacks. Google, however, has sought to downplay such concerns, stating that it will still comply with lawful requests for information from federal officials and courts. In the first half of 2013, the company received nearly 26,000 such requests, highlighting just how sensitive user information has become in the digital age. Despite the concerns, it seems clear that encryption is likely to become an increasingly important feature of online communications. Some experts predict that it will eventually become a standard feature across all communication platforms, including social media and instant messaging apps. For now, however, Gmail users will no doubt be delighted to know that their messages are now more secure than ever before. As the debate around privacy rages on, Google's latest move is a significant step in ensuring that personal data remains just that - personal.
