chatgpt: Poland has achieved a historic first after defeating Germany 2-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Warsaw. The victory comes after years of failed attempts to overcome their rivals who are known for their success in international football. The game took place at the National Stadium in Warsaw, where Polish supporters flooded the stands in a sea of red and white. The first half was filled with chances for both sides, but it was Poland who eventually broke the deadlock in the 51st minute. Arkadiusz Milik received a cross from Kamil Grosicki and headed it past Manuel Neuer to give Poland the lead. Germany tried to get back into the game but found themselves struggling against a solid Polish defense. The home side continued to create chances and were eventually rewarded with a second goal in the 88th minute. Sebastian Mila picked up a loose ball and fired it into the back of the net. The win was met with jubilation from the Polish fans, who had waited for this moment for a long time. Robert Lewandowski, the Polish striker, was also ecstatic about the win, but warned his team not to slip up in their next game against Scotland. In a post-match interview, Lewandowski said, "We can't dwell on this victory for too long. We still have a long way to go, and we need to focus on our next game against Scotland. They are a tough team, and we can't afford to take them lightly." Scotland, who defeated Georgia 1-0 through Shaun Maloney, will play Poland in a crucial Group D encounter on October 14th. The game is expected to be a tough battle for both sides, with Scotland looking to maintain their winning form and Poland looking to continue their momentum after defeating Germany. Gordon Strachan, the Scotland manager, praised Poland for their win against Germany and acknowledged that his team faces a tough challenge ahead. "Poland is a fantastic team, and I think they showed that today. We will need to be at our best if we want to get a result against them."
