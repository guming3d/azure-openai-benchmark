Advisor: The disclosure comes just days after Mr Campbell revealed that he is considering standing for Parliament . Tony Blair was last night accused of helping to secure a plum job for Alastair Campbell’s firm on a ‘dictator’s payroll’. The claim was made after US Government documents revealed the extent of links between the former Prime Minister and the lobbying company that employs his former spin doctor. According to US Justice Department papers, the authoritarian Kazakhstan regime in central Asia is represented in the US ‘through Windrush Ventures Limited, through Portland PR Limited’. The entry appears to indicate that Mr Blair, whose multi-million- pound earnings are channelled into Windrush, secured the contract in Washington for Portland,  a public relations firm for which Mr Campbell acts as an adviser. Mr Blair has always denied receiving money to ‘whitewash’ Kazakhstan’s human rights record, insisting that he has been advising on political reforms to ‘make a difference’ to the country and ‘is not personally making a profit’. However, the US document appears to confirm suspicions that Mr Blair has used his connection with its ruler, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to broker a lucrative deal for his former aide. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘This appears to confirm what we have long suspected: that Blair has been directly involved in securing plum jobs for his cronies.’ The disclosure comes just days after Mr Campbell revealed that he is considering standing for Parliament and that he will advise Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 Election. The former Downing Street communications chief has been spotted in the oil-rich state, which has been ruled for more than two decades by Mr Nazarbayev – a Soviet-era hardman whose regime has been criticised for serious human rights abuses. According to the Justice Department document, the Windrush/Portland arrangement was registered with the US Government in September 2011. Sources said that such a deal was likely to be worth millions of pounds a year. Portland said: ‘We provide communications support for the government of Kazakhstan. It is mentioned on our own website, as is the fact that Alastair Campbell is one of our advisers.’ A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘We don’t lobby but we do carry out work on social and economic reform in Kazakhstan.’ Close: Tony Blair pictured with President Nazarbayev when he was still Prime Minister, he denies that he has received money to 'whitewash' Kazakhstan's human rights record .

chatgpt: Newly released government documents have shone a light on the extent of connections between former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and a lobbying group that employs his former spin doctor Alastair Campbell. One entry in the documents suggests that Blair helped secure a contract for Campbell with a public relations firm that represents Kazakhstan in the United States. The revelation has raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest and undue influence in the political process. Critics have argued that such links can give private interests undue influence over public officials and can undermine the democratic process. Blair's connections to the lobbying group have long been a subject of controversy. The former Prime Minister has been accused of using his influence to further the interests of the group, which represents clients in a range of sectors including finance, energy, and healthcare. The documents, which were released under a freedom of information request, reveal that Blair was in regular contact with senior figures at the lobbying group during his time in office. They also show that Campbell was extensively involved in the group's activities, providing strategic advice and communications support. The entry suggesting that Blair helped secure a contract for Campbell with a public relations firm that represents Kazakhstan in the US has further intensified scrutiny over the former Prime Minister's links to the lobbying group. Kazakhstan is a country with significant interests in the energy sector, and it has been suggested that Campbell's work for the public relations firm may have involved lobbying on behalf of Kazakhstan in the US. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of Blair or Campbell, but the revelations have fuelled concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest and the need for greater transparency in the political process. Critics have called for tighter regulation of lobbying activities and greater transparency over the links between public officials and private interests. The revelations will also raise renewed questions about the role of former Prime Ministers in private lobbying activities. Blair's post-political career has been defined in part by his extensive lobbying work, which has seen him advise a range of governments and private clients across the world. The extent of Blair's links to the lobbying group and the potential for conflicts of interest will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks and months. For critics, the case raises fundamental questions about the integrity of the political process and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the public sphere.
