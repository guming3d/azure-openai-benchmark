chatgpt: West Midlands police have issued a frantic appeal for assistance as they search for Stacey Ball, an 18-year-old woman who abducted her one-year-old daughter, Zoe Page, from her foster family during a supervised visit in Willenhall.  The child had been placed with the foster family after being in the care of social services, and the visit was meant to be a routine one. However, during the visit, Ball suddenly snatched the child and fled in a dark car. The police were immediately alerted to the incident and have been conducting a search for the mother and child.  The police have expressed increasing concern about the welfare of the child and are urging anyone with information to come forward. Detective Chief Inspector Clare Fitzgerald said, "We are becoming increasingly concerned for the welfare of Zoe as it is very out of character for her to be away from her usual care arrangements."  Ball is described as being around 5ft 6ins tall with long, dark hair. At the time of the abduction, she was wearing black leggings and a white t-shirt. The police have also released a photo of the child in hopes of aiding the search.  The police have been conducting extensive searches of the area and have appealed to the public for information. They have urged anyone who may have seen Ball or knows of her whereabouts to contact them. Det Chief Insp Fitzgerald added, "We urge anyone who knows where Stacey or Zoe may be to come forward so we can ensure they are both safe and well." The incident has also prompted concerns about the safety of children in social services care. Commenting on the case, a spokesperson for the local council said: "We are deeply concerned by this incident and will be reviewing our procedures around supervised contact visits."  The case has also sparked debate about the role of the police in preventing such incidents from occurring. Some have criticised the police for not doing enough to protect vulnerable children in the care of social services, while others have praised their efforts to locate the child and bring her to safety.  As the search for Ball and her daughter continues, the police have reiterated their appeal for anyone with information to come forward. They have also urged anyone who may be harbouring the mother or the child to come forward and help bring the situation to a safe and swift conclusion.
