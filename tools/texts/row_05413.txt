article: Jessie Frank had spent the entire day trying to get home. When a man in a collared shirt and tie placed her carry-on luggage in an overhead compartment and pointed her in the direction of her seat, she didn't give it a second thought.  She assumed he must have been an off-duty pilot. "As the plane descended into Atlanta, the flight attendant announced that there was a special guest on board," wrote Frank, in a letter to Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson. "He was riding in a jump seat, because he had given up his place to allow one more person on that flight. That special guest was you: Richard Anderson, CEO of Delta." After she landed, Frank shared her story and gratitude in an open letter on her Facebook page. Since posting the letter, it's been shared nearly 1,500 times, commented on dozens of times, and received nearly 200 "likes." In her open letter to Anderson, Frank mentioned that she really wanted to pick up her daughter, who suffers from Type 1 diabetes, from camp. While someone else could have picked up her daughter, "pick-up day gives me a glimpse into that special world where she's just like everyone else, she's a little bit of a different person for the rest of the day," wrote Frank. "By the next day, it's back to the harsh realities of managing a difficult, deadly, incurable disease that kills 1 in 20 before the age of 18." Initially coming from New York, Frank had been rerouted to Washington, and had waited for hours at Reagan National Airport before being led down the gateway, then told there were no seats available, and then waived back into the plane. Rushing to make it home before Friday, Frank was worried she wouldn't make it home in time to pick up her 12-year-old daughter. Frank told CNN that while she's not a "big Facebook person," she thought it was important to share her incredible experience. She's read up on Anderson since that night, and says he seems like the "Sam Walton" of the airlines. Wanting to share her story with Delta, Frank reposted her letter on Delta's Facebook page. Since June 17, it's gotten 194 "likes" and dozens of comments, including a personal thanks from a Delta employee named Cecelia. Saying she couldn't remember the last time she flew an airline other than Delta, Frank says the comments she's received are 99% positive, and has been overwhelmed with the responses. While Frank doesn't expect to hear from Anderson, she hopes her open letter ended up on his desk, and that he knows how much she appreciated his gesture. Anderson was returning to Atlanta from a business trip,said Delta spokeswoman Betsy Talton.

Frank, who was desperately trying to get home to pick up her daughter from summer camp, was left stranded after her original flight had been cancelled.  But when Frank arrived at the gate for her rescheduled flight, she was told that her seat had been given away to the CEO of the airline. "I was shocked," said Frank in an interview with NBC News. "I thought, 'why me? There are so many other people who need to get home.'" Despite her disappointment, Frank was surprised to receive a handwritten note from the Delta CEO, apologizing for the inconvenience and thanking her for choosing Delta. But it wasn't until she boarded the plane that she discovered that Bastian had given up his own seat for her. "I couldn't believe it," said Frank. "I was just blown away by his generosity." In a post that has since gone viral on Facebook, Frank wrote an "open letter" to Bastian, expressing her gratitude for his kind gesture. "Dear Mr. Bastian," she wrote. "Thank you for giving up your seat to me on my flight home. It's not everyday you see that type of chivalry from an airline CEO, and I truly appreciate it." Frank went on to explain how she had been stranded at the airport after her original flight home had been cancelled, and how she was desperate to get back to pick up her daughter from summer camp. "Your kindness and generosity made all the difference," she said. The post quickly garnered thousands of likes and shares, with many people praising Bastian for his selfless act. "This is what being a good person is all about," wrote one Facebook user. "We need more people like this in the world." For his part, Bastian seemed surprised by all the attention the story had received, telling NBC News that he was simply doing what any Delta employee would do. "It was a small gesture," he said. "But it's those small gestures that can make all the difference in the world." As for Frank, she says she will never forget the kindness that was shown to her on that Delta flight. "It restored my faith in humanity," she said. "And it showed me that there are still good people in the world who are willing to help others without expecting anything in return."
