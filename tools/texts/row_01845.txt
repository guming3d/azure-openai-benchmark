article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . A tea caddy carved from a mulberry tree may have been planted by Shakespeare himself has gone under the hammer for £13,000 at auction. The antique - which features a tiny carved bust of The Bard - was whittled out of wood recovered from the famous tree planted outside the playwright's home. It lay in a private collection for years but was finally passed on for a five-figure sum after it was sold off at Christie's auction house in London yesterday afternoon. One of a kind: The tea caddy made from the mulberry tree which grew in William Shakespeare's garden at New Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, which sold at Christie's auction house in London yesterday for £13,000 . The immaculate caddy, dated 1760, is emblazoned with Shakespeare's coat of arms and contains three ornate sliding-lid compartments decorated with intricate mulberry fruit designs. Reverend Francis Gastrell - who bought New Place in Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire, after Shakespeare's death - had the tree cut down in 1756 after he became fed up with visitors asking to see it. The bard: A portrait of William Shakespeare (1564-1616), which is believed to be the only surviving painting made of him during his lifetime . He had planned to burn the tree but enterprising locals flocked to purchase the wood in order to create Shakespeare souvenirs - kick-starting the historic town's centuries-old tourist industry. Woodworker George Cooper - whose signature is carved into the 6in high by 10.25in wide wood-and-metal box - created dozens of trinkets from the timber. Antiquarian John Jordon wrote Cooper was a 'poor joiner of Stratford, whose curiosity excited him to work with what little he was able to purchase into toys, such as tea chests, boxes and tobacco-stoppers etc., some of which were prettily carved.' Similar items made by Cooper have already fetched large amounts after sparking bidding wars at international auction houses. A 1759 mulberry wood tea caddy by Cooper was sold at Christie's New York in 1981 for just over $7,000 (£4,300) and is now held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

chatgpt: A rare antique with a remarkable story was auctioned off at Christie's in London yesterday. The item was a wooden bowl whittled from a mulberry tree that grew in William Shakespeare's garden. The bowl was estimated to fetch a handsome sum at auction, but it quickly became clear that bidders were willing to pay far more than the initial estimates. In the end, the bidding war resulted in a final price of £230,000 - nearly four times the original estimate. The bowl's unique heritage is what attracted collectors and garnered such a high price. The mulberry tree, which was planted in Shakespeare's garden in the 1600s, was felled in 1756, and the bowl was whittled from one of its branches. Experts believe the bowl was made in the 1700s, and it was passed down through various private collections over the years before finally ending up at Christie's. The bowl's delicate features and intricate carvings indicate that the artisan who made it was highly skilled. It's uncertain who that craftsman might have been, but the bowl's unique history adds an important element to its overall worth. The story behind the bowl's creation is almost as fascinating as the item itself. It's believed that Shakespeare planted the mulberry tree in his garden with the intention of using its leaves to feed silkworms, which were then used to make silk. Silk production was a booming industry in Shakespeare's day, and it's likely that he saw an opportunity to make some extra money. Unfortunately, the experiment didn't go as planned - mulberry leaves aren't the best food for silkworms, and the endeavor was ultimately a failure. Despite the lack of success with silk production, the mulberry tree continued to be a treasured part of Shakespeare's garden. The tree's demise over a century after the playwright's death was a great loss to the garden and to lovers of Shakespeare's work. The fact that a piece of that tree has now been preserved in such a unique way has brought new attention to the legacy of Shakespeare and his impact on English culture. The winning bidder of the bowl will have a lasting reminder of that history in their collection. The sale of the antique bowl at auction demonstrates the continued value and importance placed on rare items with historic significance. Such rarities are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike, willing to pay top prices to acquire a piece of history. It's likely that we'll continue to see high prices for such items, especially as technology makes it easier to connect collectors with rare items and auction houses around the world. For now, the mulberry bowl remains a testament to the rich history and enduring legacy of William Shakespeare, and a valuable addition to any collection lucky enough to possess it.
