chatgpt: AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd appeared in court on Thursday after being charged with threatening to kill and possession of illegal drugs. The 60-year-old was given an extra bail condition, ordering him not to take illicit drugs. The charges, which Rudd denies, arose from a confrontation with a former employee that occurred in September. The prosecution has given a brief outline of what led to the charges: following his dismissal, the former employee became the target of threatening phone calls, and he ultimately contacted police. After police searched Rudd's home, they found a small amount of methamphetamine and cannabis, leading to the drug possession charges. Rudd's lawyer has called the charges against his client “spurious,” and insists that any threatening statements made by Rudd were intended as “just an angry phone call.” However, prosecutors maintain that the evidence against Rudd is strong, and they are confident in their case. The drummer was granted bail with the aforementioned conditions, and is due back in court in February. The threatening to kill case will be heard in Tauranga District Court. Rudd has had a tumultuous few years, with a string of legal issues and health problems. In 2014, he was charged with attempting to procure the murder of two men, as well as drug possession. Although the murder charges were later dropped, he was sentenced to eight months of home detention for the drug charges. Despite these setbacks, Rudd has remained an important part of the AC/DC lineup. He first joined the band in 1975, and has played on some of their most iconic albums, including Highway to Hell, Back in Black, and The Razors Edge. The news of Rudd's legal troubles has been met with disappointment by AC/DC fans around the world. Despite his status as a rock icon, however, it is clear that he is not above the law. If convicted, he could face serious consequences, including imprisonment and fines. For now, Rudd's future with AC/DC remains uncertain. The band has yet to comment publicly on the charges, and it is unclear whether he will be with them for upcoming tour dates. As his legal troubles continue to unfold, fans will be watching closely to see how this iconic drummer's story plays out.
