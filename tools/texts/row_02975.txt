Professional fire-fighters who have fought blazes in the Channel Tunnel for the past 18 years are to be replaced by untrained security guards, it emerged today. It follows a breakdown in contract talks between Eurotunnel, which manages the undersea link, and the Pas-de-Calais fire service (SDIS). The company was trying to renegotiate a 2m pounds plus annual deal with SDIS but the French fire-fighters pulled out. Threat: A damaged Eurotunnel shuttle train following an a blaze in 1997.

A Eurotunnel spokesman said they 'regretted' the SDIS decision, adding: 'We have never skimped on security and are looking for the best solutions to take over the SDIS work.' The last major fire in the Channel Tunnel was on September 11, 2008, when a blaze broke out on Eurotunnel shuttle train carrying a number of lorries and drivers. It lasted for 16 hours and reached temperatures of 1000 C, yet swift action by the Calais fire-fighters meant only 14 people out of 32 on the train suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation. Repairs to the tunnel cost more than Â£50 million, with new emergency warning measures introduced afterwards. There were two earlier blazes - the first in 1996, two years after the tunnel opened, and one in 2006. The Calais fire brigade has a base just 10 minutes from the French entrance to the Channel Tunnel, at Coquelles, with staff able to mobilise almost immediately.

This was one of the main reasons that Eurotunnel has hired some 40 permanent fire-fighters at Coquelles for the past 18 years. 'These few minutes are crucial to dealing with any fire,' said a brigade source. 'We acted in seconds following the blaze in 2008.' Negotiations between Eurotunnel and the Calais brigade have taken place every two years, with Eurotunnel regularly praising their 'remarkable dedication and professionalism' Now Onet, a Marseille-based security company, is said to be ready to take over fire-fighting duties from the Calais brigade from January 1st. They have already begun advertising for staff, calling for men and women who are 'serious, calm and - ideally - have done some work as volunteer fire-fighters or five years in industrial fire prevention.' However, there is no expectation that any of the new guards will be professional fire-fighters.

chatgpt: Negotiations have broken down between the chiefs of the Eurotunnel group and officials from the Calais fire service, following a dispute over fire safety measures in the undersea tunnel. The Channel Tunnel, as it is also known, has seen three fires since its opening in 1994, raising concerns about the safety of passengers, workers, and goods transported through the facility. The latest round of discussions between Eurotunnel and the Calais fire brigade ended without a resolution, with both sides holding vastly different opinions on the best way to improve safety in the tunnel. The chief issue at hand is the distance between the tunnel's entrance and the fire brigade's base, which is located only ten minutes away. While the fire service believes that it can respond quickly to any emergency, representatives from Eurotunnel have argued that this proximity is simply not enough. They have requested additional safety measures, such as the installation of water sprinklers, which they believe are critical for preventing or containing a fire in the tunnel. Eurotunnel has also asked for more frequent safety inspections and drills. In response, the Calais fire service has emphasized the significant safety measures that are already in place, including a sophisticated ventilation system, regular safety inspections, and a fleet of specialized firefighting vehicles. They argue that these measures, combined with their proximity to the tunnel, provide ample safety assurance to all parties. Despite the impasse, both sides seem to agree on the importance of safety in the tunnel. The Calais fire service recognizes the unique challenges of responding to incidents in an undersea environment, and has committed to exploring various options for improving safety measures in the tunnel. Eurotunnel, for its part, has reiterated its commitment to ensuring that the facility remains safe for everyone who uses it. This dispute highlights the challenges that arise when different parties hold different opinions on the best way to approach safety measures. While Eurotunnel has clearly identified what it believes to be critical safety measures, the Calais fire service is confident that the current arrangements provide sufficient protection. Ultimately, it will be up to both parties to meet in the middle and find a way forward that satisfies all concerns. The Channel Tunnel to the United Kingdom from France is one of the most important transport links in Europe, providing a fast and efficient way to transport people and goods. As such, ensuring that it is safe is of the utmost concern for everyone involved. Hopefully, negotiations between Eurotunnel and the Calais fire service can resume soon and a solution can be found that everyone can agree on.
