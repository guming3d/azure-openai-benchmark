article: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A police officer was killed Monday in a suicide bombing at the gate of a police station in Islamabad, authorities said. The bombing took place at a police station in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. The explosion occurred on Pakistan Day, a national holiday. The bomber apparently walked up to the police station and blew himself up at its gate. The station houses a special intelligence-gathering branch of Islamabad police. Two people -- the suicide bomber and a police officer -- were killed, police told CNN. Pakistan's GEO-TV reported three people were dead and 10 wounded in the blast. The blast blew the doors off the police branch and damaged a mosque adjacent to the building, according the network. "Parts of the bodies, the human bodies, are spread around the area," GEO-TV's Hamid Mir told CNN. The explosion was heard at CNN's offices, 2 or 3 miles away. Members of the police branch housed in the building help protect government officials such as the prime minister, CNN's Reza Sayah said, and with the explosion, someone is "trying to send another message to the federal government here in Islamabad."

If the blast was a suicide bombing, it would be the second in the area within a week, Mir said. On March 16, a suicide attack targeted a bus station near Islamabad. The office targeted Monday is in a crowded area, said Mir, who added: "This intelligence office is not secret. It's a very well-known intelligence office." However, the area was not in a high-security zone, he said. Asked about the Pakistanis' attitude toward these repeated attacks, Mir said public opinion in Pakistan was divided. "Everybody's against the terrorism, but they think the Americans also need to change their policies. They are in trouble after 9/11. America is secure, but the people in Pakistan are not secure." CNN's Ram Ramgopal contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A loud explosion rocked the streets of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, on Monday as the nation celebrated its national day. According to witnesses, the blast was heard near the special police branch located in the city's eastern region. Reports suggest that a suicide bomber targeted the police facility, causing significant destruction and leaving numerous people injured. The police branch, which is responsible for security across the capital, had been on high alert in anticipation of potential militant activity during the national day celebrations. Despite rigorous security measures, the bomber was able to penetrate the police facility, leading to the devastating blast. As the dust settled and emergency services rushed to the scene, eyewitnesses reported seeing charred vehicles and debris scattered across the area. Hospitals across the city were inundated with the injured, with medical staff working tirelessly to provide urgent medical attention to those who had been caught up in the attack. No immediate claims of responsibility have been made in connection with the bombing. However, the incident is the latest in a string of attacks that have targeted Pakistani security forces and civilians in recent years. The volatile security situation in Pakistan has been further complicated by the ongoing insurgency in neighboring Afghanistan, which has led to increased militant activity across the country. Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of those who lost their lives or were injured in the attack. In a statement, he praised the bravery of the country's security forces and vowed to continue the fight against terrorism. The incident has sparked outrage and concern across Pakistan, with many questioning the effectiveness of the country's security measures. The attack also comes at a time when Pakistan is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already overwhelmed the country's healthcare system. As investigations into the incident continue, Pakistanis remain on high alert, with security officials urging members of the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. The attack is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by militant groups in Pakistan and the need for continued efforts to improve security and counterterrorism measures.
