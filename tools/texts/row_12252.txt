Sleeker look: Lyft co-founder John Zimmer displays his company's new mascot - a 5in-long plastic replica of the original fluffy mustache which goes on the dashboard . About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday. Commenting on the haircut, a representative for Lyft said: 'The new glowstache marks an exciting moment for Lyft as we embark on the next chapter of our growth. 'We’ll begin rolling the glowstache out to Lyft drivers across the country in the coming weeks.' Lyft is one of several companies that allow customers to use a smartphone app to book and pay for rides in a private car. It currently operates in more than 50 U.S. cities. The big pink mustaches were introduced as part of Lyft's launch effort in 2012. Makeover: About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday . However, the symbol stuck around longer than expected because it continued to create hype. More importantly, Lyft president John Zimmer said the gimmick made people smile. However, recently it was decided a makeover was needed. Jesse McMillin, the company’s new creative director, told Wired.com: 'A lot of times you’d see people driving around and [the fluffy pink mustache] was cockeyed, or matted, or windblown.' Lyft phased out the original mustaches a few months back in place of the sleeker glowstaches. Lyft users open an app on their iOS or Android smartphones and signal drivers to pick them up and take them to their destinations. The app matches them with the nearest driver. Drivers attach  pink mustaches to their cars to identify themselves to passengers. Instead of using official taxi operators or limousine service drivers, Lyft recruits regular people who wish to make extra money by offering rides in their own cars in exchange for 'donations' from passengers. Some of Lyft's NYC founding drivers include a NY firefighter, a mother going back to school who runs a youth organization that revolves around teens and art, a honor student & MTA maintenance worker using Lyft to help pay off loans, a school teacher and father of three sons who are all actors, and a space suit designer . Drivers are screened with criminal background checks, and they must be licensed with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.

chatgpt: Lyft, the ridesharing giant, has given its iconic fuzzy pink mustache a makeover. The recognizable decoration, which has adorned the front grille of thousands of Lyft vehicles for years, has been replaced with a sleek 5-inch-long plastic replica that now goes on the dashboard. The new mascot not only looks more modern, but it also lights up. This feature will enhance visibility of the Lyft vehicles at night, making them easier to spot for customers. Riders can now be sure they're getting into the right vehicle with even more ease. The mustache has been a core part of Lyft's brand identity since the ridesharing company's inception in 2012. It was originally intended to make the drivers' cars more easily recognizable to their passengers. With its bright pink color and fluffy texture, the mustache was a fun feature of Lyft vehicles that has now become synonymous with the brand. However, as Lyft has grown and expanded, the mustache has not kept up with the company's evolving identity. The redesign is part of a larger rebranding effort for Lyft, which aims to give the company a more modern look and feel. The new mascot is just one of several changes that Lyft has made to its brand in 2021. The new design was first announced in June 2021, and it has already begun to appear on Lyft vehicles across the country. The company has also updated its app and website with a new logo and updated color scheme. The new branding has been met with mixed reactions from riders, with some lamenting the loss of the fuzzy pink mustache and others welcoming the updated look. Lyft has also been introducing new features to its platform, such as the ability to book rides in advance and a new subscription service that offers discounted rates for frequent riders. The company has been competing with rival Uber in the increasingly crowded ridesharing market, and these updates aim to help Lyft stand out in the space. Lyft's decision to retire the mustache is not without precedent. In 2017, the company replaced the mustache with a smaller, sleeker version that attached to the front grille of cars. However, that new design was not well-received by the public and Lyft ultimately brought back the original mustache. This time around, Lyft seems to be embracing the change more fully. The new design is accompanied by a marketing campaign that highlights the company's commitment to innovation and progress. The message is clear: Lyft is not just a ridesharing company with a fluffy pink mustache, but a modern, tech-forward platform that has evolved with the times. As Lyft continues to expand and compete with the likes of Uber and other ridesharing companies, the updated branding and new features may help the company stand out in a crowded market. Only time will tell how successful the rebranding effort will be, but the new plastic mustache is a clear sign that Lyft is moving forward into the future.
