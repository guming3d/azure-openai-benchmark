David Cameron will today try to launch talks on a free trade deal between Europe and the US that could be worth £380 a year for every British household. The Prime Minister wants to use this week's G8 summit in Northern Ireland to launch formal negotiations on an agreement that could be worth up to £10billion to the UK and £85billion worldwide. He will argue that a free trade deal – similar to that which operates inside the EU – would 'turbo-charge the transatlantic economy'. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron arrives at Belfast International Airport to attend the Enniskillen G8 summit where he wants to launch formal negotiations on an agreement with the U.S. 'These trade deals matter, because they mean more jobs, more choice for consumers and lower prices,' he said. Trade, tax and transparency were three vital drivers of growth that could produce 'transformative results', he said. Mr Cameron said he wanted 'a meeting where we can look each other in the eye' to solve the problems. But the most important issue is how to promote economic recovery, with action needed to boost growth, create jobs and reduce poverty, he added. 'Let's be clear, we still need to deal with fiscal deficits,' he said. 'Each country needs to press on with sorting out its public finances. Each country needs active monetary policy to kickstart the affordable loans and mortgages that businesses and families need. 'And each country needs to deal with the problem of youth unemployment by pursuing the structural reforms and flexible labour markets that are vital for competitiveness and jobs.'

France has urged for any trade agreement to include special protections for its film and TV industries against U.S. imports. There is also uncertainty over another of the Prime Minister's G8 priorities – an international deal to crack down on tax havens. Another key aim of the summit is a global deal on the payment of ransoms to terror groups who take hostages. Mr Cameron hopes it will 'choke off' a source of terror funding, given that some countries do still pay ransoms. 'It's an ambitious agenda. It's a very practical agenda,' he said.

chatgpt: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will argue that a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States would "turbo-charge" the transatlantic economy. The proposed agreement would be similar to the one that currently operates within the European Union. Johnson and other members of the UK government have long believed that a trade deal with the US would be a crucial element of the country's post-Brexit economic strategy. The Prime Minister has repeatedly stated his desire to build a "golden age" of UK-US relations. Speaking ahead of a planned meeting with US President Donald Trump, Johnson said, "I don't want to exaggerate the potential of a free trade deal with our American friends, but I do think that it has the potential to be a win-win situation for both sides. If we can agree on a deal that removes trade barriers and opens up new markets, we could see a real boost to the transatlantic economy." The proposed UK-US trade deal would be modeled on the one that currently operates within the EU. This would involve the two countries removing tariffs on goods and services, and setting up mechanisms for resolving disputes. However, there are concerns about the impact such a deal could have on the UK economy, particularly in terms of food standards. There have been calls for the UK to maintain its current regulations when it comes to things like animal welfare and genetically modified crops. Critics have also argued that a UK-US trade deal could lead to increased privatization of public services. Despite these concerns, the UK government is pushing ahead with its plans to negotiate a trade deal with the US. Johnson's meeting with Trump is seen as a key part of this process, and the Prime Minister is expected to use the opportunity to lay out his vision for a post-Brexit UK-US partnership. Overall, the proposed UK-US trade deal is seen as a major opportunity for both countries. If negotiations are successful, it could open up new markets and create jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. However, there are also risks involved, particularly when it comes to maintaining food standards and protecting public services. It remains to be seen how these issues will be addressed during the negotiations.
