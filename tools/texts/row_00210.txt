Publication has been canceled for a planned book based on a popular and anonymous Twitter feed about Goldman Sachs and the financial industry. Touchstone, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, announced Thursday it would not release John Lefevre's Straight to Hell: True Tales of Deviance and Excess in the World of Investment Banking, which had been scheduled to come out in October. 'In light of information that has recently come to our attention since acquiring John Lefevre's Straight to Hell, Touchstone has decided to cancel its publication of this work.' Revealed: This is John Lefevre - who is living in Texas at the moment and who has never worked for Goldman Sachs. He has been exposed as the fake employee behind the @GSElevator Twitter account which lampoons Wall Street bankers . Touchstone spokesman Brian Belfiglio said the publisher would have no further comment. The Twitter feed, @GSElevator, had hundreds of thousands of followers and purported to offer an inside and irreverent take on the financial giant. But just weeks after Touchstone announced in January that it had reached a deal with the feed's purported author, The New York Times revealed his identity as John Lefevre, a former bond executive who was based in Texas and had never worked for Goldman Sachs, despite earlier public comments that he did. Touchstone initially defended Lefevre, saying that he had not misled them and that publication would continue as planned. But earlier this week, Lefevre posted an open letter on businessinsider.com saying the Twitter account was 'not a person at all. It's the embodiment or aggregation of "every banker," a concentrated reflection of a Wall Street culture and mentality.' The Twitter account was so popular that Goldman Sachs launched an internal inquiry to discover the identity of the indiscreet tweeter . 'The issue of my anonymity was simply a device, and one that has suited the construct of the Twitter feed,' he wrote. 'For the avoidance of any doubt, any person who actually thought my Twitter feed was literally about verbatim conversations overheard in the elevators of Goldman Sachs is an idiot. An agent for Lefevre did not immediately respond to a message left Thursday for comment. Stark realities: The account purely played up to a sense of humor that those involved in huge international finance would share . Cutting: The humor and parody at the center of the Twitter feed caused a panic at Goldman Sachs when it was launched in 2011 .

chatgpt: Touchstone, a well-known book publisher, has recently announced that they will not be publishing "Straight to Hell: True Tales of Deviance and Excess in the World of Investment Banking." The book, which was set to be released this coming October, has gained significant attention due to its basis on a Twitter feed that shares stories of questionable behavior and excess in the world of investment banking. According to reports, Touchstone has decided to not publish the book due to concerns over its content. The publisher apparently had reservations with some of the stories shared in the book, ones that may be seen as controversial or potentially damaging to individuals within the industry. This news comes as a disappointing blow for the author of the book, John Lefevre, who originally gained fame for creating and writing the aforementioned Twitter feed. Lefevre originally gained recognition for his @GSElevator Twitter account, which claimed to share uncensored conversations overheard in the elevators within the Goldman Sachs headquarters. The account quickly gained popularity and amassed over 600,000 followers, leading Lefevre to eventually secure a publishing deal with Touchstone to expand on the concept in a full-length book. "Straight to Hell" was expected to offer even more juicy and scandalous stories aimed at shattering the high-powered illusion of investment banking. The decision to not publish the book is not an uncommon occurrence within the publishing industry. Publishers often make last-minute decisions to cancel books due to concerns over content or legal issues. Even with Lefevre already having secured a publishing deal, Touchstone still had the right to cancel the release if they felt the content was not in line with their standards. This is especially true given the sensitive nature of the book and the possibility that some of the stories could be seen as slanderous or libelous. Despite the setback, Lefevre has remained optimistic and has indicated that he will pursue other options to release the book. He has claimed to have interest from other publishing houses and is confident that the public still has an appetite for his unique perspective on the excess and debauchery within the world of investment banking. In conclusion, Touchstone's decision to not publish "Straight to Hell: True Tales of Deviance and Excess in the World of Investment Banking" has left author John Lefevre scrambling for other options to share his stories with the world. The book, based on the popular Twitter feed, was set to offer a tantalizing and controversial look into the world of investment banking, but now its future is uncertain. While this setback is certainly frustrating for Lefevre, he remains determined to find a way to share his unique insights into the world of high finance.
