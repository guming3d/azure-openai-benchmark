chatgpt: Maher's partner Debbie Brett and sister Margaret Francis have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to steal and assisting an offender. This follows Maher's own arrest in February in connection with the theft of millions of pounds from a security van in 1993. The arrests were made by Essex Police, who have been carrying out an extensive investigation into the theft for several years. The stolen cash, which amounted to £1.2 million, has never been recovered. Maher himself is due to appear in court in March, charged with theft from the security van. The arrest of his partner and sister suggests that the police believe there may have been other individuals involved in the theft, and that they may have helped Maher to evade capture for so long. Debbie Brett, who is 47, was arrested at an address in Eastbourne, while Margaret Francis, 64, was arrested in Woodford Green. Both were taken to a police station in Essex for questioning. The police have yet to reveal any further details about the arrests, but it is thought that they may be related to Maher's alleged involvement in the theft. Maher, who was living in the United States under a false identity, was extradited to the UK in 2012. He has denied any involvement in the crime. The theft of the security van, which took place in Felixstowe in 1993, remains one of the UK's most notorious unsolved heists. Maher, a security guard who was driving the van, disappeared shortly afterwards, along with the stolen cash. He was eventually tracked down in the United States, where he had been living under the name Michael Sabatino. He denied any involvement in the theft, claiming that he had been kidnapped and held hostage by a group of Irish criminals. However, the police were able to build a case against him, and he was extradited to the UK to face charges in 2012. His trial is due to begin in March, and he faces a possible jail sentence if he is convicted. The arrest of Maher's partner and sister suggests that the police may believe that he had help in carrying out the theft, and that they may have been involved in helping him to evade capture for so long. Whether this will lead to further arrests remains to be seen, but it is clear that the investigation into the theft of the security van is far from over.
