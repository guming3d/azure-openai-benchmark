Ambulance crews have been blasted for endangering public safety after paramedics stopped to pick up an injured badger and gave it a lift to the vets - where it was put down. Rescue teams spotted the injured animal as they returned from taking a patient to hospital at 3am on October 28. Their Good Samaritan act has been criticised by a whistleblower who claims they put public health at risk. The badger (not pictured) was spotted at the side of the road by paramedics who rushed it to the vets in their Ambulance (not pictured) - prompting fears for public health . South Central Ambulance Service NHS . Foundation Trust (SCAS) admitted crews transported the badger after . spotting it on the road near Banbury, Oxon. A worker wrote on Facebook: 'We found an injured badger in the road about 3am on night shift the other night. 'I rang my vet and we took it down to her in the ambulance. She put it down (it was too far gone for saving). :(' But the whistleblower, who has not been named, accused the service of endangering patients’ safety. They said: 'My concern is that it sounds like a dying wild badger was transported to a vet via an emergency ambulance. 'This is obviously a risk to patients and to the public - the chance of infection e.g badger tuberculosis, the risk of a patient being allergic to badger hair, possible badger bodily fluids etc. 'Was the ambulance thoroughly cleaned afterwards? Are people happy knowing their tax money was spent on transporting an ill badger?' SCAS confirmed staff had used an ambulance to transport an injured badger to a veterinary practice in Banbury on October 28, but denied there was any risk to public health. Spokesman James Keating-Wilkes said: 'In the early hours of October 28 an ambulance crew returning from hospital to base encountered what they believed to be a dead badger in the road in Banbury and, believing that this posed a danger to other road users, stopped to move it to the side of the road. 'On approaching the animal the crew noticed that the badger was alive and in considerable distress. 'They contacted a local vet who asked them to bring the badger in to a veterinary practice approximately half a mile from the scene, which they did. South Central Ambulance Service has a compassionate and caring workforce. The crew’s actions will be reviewed. At no point was patient safety compromised.' Despite the efforts to save the badger, it was taken to West Bar Veterinary Surgery in Banbury, Oxon., where it was put down.

chatgpt: A whistleblower has made a shocking claim that a rescue mission conducted last month, which involved the crew placing themselves in harm's way, may have endangered the public's health. The crew reportedly put future patients "at risk of TB and allergic reactions". The mission involved rescuing several individuals who were stranded on Mount Everest. The rescue team, which included a medical unit, was dispatched to the mountain to provide assistance to the stranded climbers, who were reportedly suffering from altitude sickness and other medical complications. According to the whistleblower, however, the medical team failed to take proper precautions when treating the climbers. The individual claimed that the team members were exposed to high levels of TB and other infectious diseases, which could have spread to the general public. The whistleblower also alleged that the medical team failed to take proper measures to protect themselves from allergens that were present on the mountain. The alleged lapse in safety protocols could have put the crew at risk of experiencing severe allergic reactions. The revelations made by the whistleblower have caused concern among members of the medical community, who have criticized the medical team for its lack of foresight and poor execution of safety protocols. "The actions of the medical team during this rescue mission were extremely reckless and irresponsible," said one medical professional. "It is completely unacceptable to place the public's health at risk in this way." Despite the criticism, the head of the medical team has defended their actions, stating that they followed all necessary safety protocols and that there was no risk to the public's health. "The safety of our crew and the public is our top priority," they said. "We took every precaution necessary to ensure that everyone involved was protected from harm." However, these reassurances have done little to quell concerns among members of the public, who have called on officials to launch an investigation into the matter. Some have also criticized the rescue mission itself, arguing that it was unnecessary and put the lives of the rescue team at undue risk. As of now, it is unclear whether the claims made by the whistleblower are true or not, and officials have yet to announce an investigation into the matter. However, the incident has underscored the importance of safety protocols and the need for medical professionals to take greater care when treating patients in high-risk environments. In conclusion, the recent allegations made by a whistleblower that a rescue mission to Mount Everest may have put the public's health at risk have caused alarm among members of the medical community and the public. While the claims are yet to be investigated, they serve as a reminder of the importance of safety protocols and the need for medical professionals to take greater care when treating patients in high-risk environments.
