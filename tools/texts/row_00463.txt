chatgpt: Mercury, a four-day-old kitten, was found with his front legs allegedly amputated by a weed whacker. The poor kitten was left to fend for himself until he was rescued and taken to a veterinary hospital. Upon examination, it was discovered that Mercury's right arm stopped just before the elbow, and his left arm went slightly after the elbow. His left rear foot only has one toe, making it impossible for him to walk properly. Despite the harrowing experience, Mercury's owners say he is a fighter and has been taking his situation in stride. They have been giving him round-the-clock care and love, and the kitten has been responding well to their efforts. However, as much as they would like to help him, they say he is not a candidate for a prosthesis on either front limb. According to the vet who examined Mercury, to be a candidate for a prosthesis, a cat would need at least 40% of the limb intact. Unfortunately, Mercury's injuries are too severe, and the vet has recommended exploring other options, such as a front wheelchair. The good news is that Mercury is still growing, and once he reaches maturity, he may become a candidate for a wheelchair, which will give him greater freedom of movement. Despite the challenges, Mercury's owners say they are hopeful for his future. They have been considering training him to become a therapy cat, using his unique story to inspire and motivate others who have faced similar challenges. The story of Mercury has touched the hearts of many, prompting an outpouring of support and love. Many have been following his journey on social media, sharing words of encouragement and sending care packages to help with his recovery. His owners say they are grateful for the support and plan on providing regular updates on Mercury's progress. Many are outraged by the barbaric act of cruelty that was inflicted upon Mercury. Animal welfare organizations are calling for stricter laws and harsher punishments for those who mistreat animals. They say that incidents like this highlight the need for greater education and awareness about animal welfare. In conclusion, Mercury's story is a testament to the resilience and strength of animals. Despite the odds stacked against him, he continues to fight and inspire others with his determination. His owners say they are committed to giving him the best life possible, and they hope that his story will serve as a beacon of hope for others facing similar challenges.
