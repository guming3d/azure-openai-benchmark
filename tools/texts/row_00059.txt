article: (CNN) -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims that the Italian gave himself a blood transfusion. Ricco -- who only returned to the sport last March after being handed a 20-month ban for doping during the 2008 Tour de France -- was admitted to a hospital in Modena on Sunday. His father told reporters at the time that Ricco had been suffering from a high fever and suspected kidney failure. But Italian media claimed the 27-year-old had admitted to doctors that he had made himself ill by injecting contaminated blood. And now his team have issued an official statement, saying they have found enough proof of a doping infraction to suspend the rider with immediate effect. The statement said: "Internal research results following the illness and rumors regarding Ricco have given the team sufficient reason to suspend the Italian with immediate effect." It continued: "Last Tuesday, the team started an urgent investigation following the hospitalisation of Riccardo Ricco. Three days later the results of this study brought the team to the conclusion that an immediate suspension of Ricco was required. "The violation of internal regulations of the team and other indications justify this measure. The team cannot prejudge but emphasises that a zero-tolerance policy towards doping is practised." Blood doping -- an action that increases the amount of red blood cells available to carry oxygen to the muscles -- has been a problem in cycling for a number of years, with disgraced 2006 Tour de France winner Floyd Landis admitting last year that he blood-doped during his career. Blood cells are not damaged by freezing, consequently a "blood doper" can remove blood from their body, safely store it, and re-inject it when increased aerobic capacity and stamina is needed. However, if the blood is stored incorrectly, it can become infected, resulting in severe illness if transfused. The practice of blood doping is banned by all official sporting governing bodies and Ricco now faces expulsion from competitive cycling if found guilty, as well as a possible jail sentence in a country where all forms of doping are classed as illegal. Ricco has yet to react to the claims surrounding his hospital stay.

chatgpt: Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team has announced the suspension of one of its star riders, Riccardo Ricco, after finding enough evidence of his involvement in doping. The team has not revealed the exact nature of the doping infractions, but it was severe enough to warrant suspension from the team. Ricco, a 27-year-old Italian, has been in the headlines for various controversies in the past, including being banned for 12 years by the Italian Olympic Committee for blood doping. His recent hospitalization has further fueled the speculations around his doping practices. Last week, Ricco was admitted to an Italian hospital with a high fever and kidney problems. Italian media claimed that the cyclist fell ill after injecting blood that was infected with a virus. There have been no official reports to confirm these claims. Ricco has been one of the most controversial riders in the sport of cycling, with a history of doping violations. In 2008, he was kicked out of the Tour de France after testing positive for the banned blood-booster EPO. The following year, he was found guilty of doping at the Giro d'Italia and was handed a 20-month ban. Despite the numerous controversies surrounding Ricco, many cycling fans and experts had believed that he had turned over a new leaf and was committed to riding clean. His performances on the road for Vacansoleil have been impressive in recent years, which made the team's decision to suspend him even more surprising. Vacansoleil has been one of the leading voices in the fight against doping in cycling, and their decision to suspend Ricco shows that they are willing to take a tough stance on those who cheat. In a statement released by the team, they said that they were disappointed by Ricco's actions and that they would not tolerate doping in any form. The suspension will no doubt have a significant impact on Ricco's career, as it will likely make it difficult for him to find a new team. It also highlights the ongoing challenges that the sport of cycling faces in the fight against doping. In conclusion, the suspension of Riccardo Ricco by Vacansoleil is a significant moment in the ongoing battle against doping in cycling. It shows that even high-profile riders are not immune to scrutiny and that teams are willing to take a tough stance against cheating. It also raises questions about the future of Ricco's career and the sport of cycling as a whole.
