article: A sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin knew at once there was something fishy about John Pryzybyla's explanation for why he was reeking of alcohol. A criminal complaint filed in Adams County says the 75-year-old resident of Friendship told the deputy who stopped him that the reason he smelled like liquor is because he had been at a traditional Wisconsin fish fry and had eaten beer-battered fish. The complaint says the deputy had spotted Mr Przybyla driving with a broken taillight and making a U-turn on Highway 13 in Dell Prairie at around 2.30pm on October 12, followed his vehicle and discovered he had a revoked license. Something's fishy: When pulled over by a deputy in Wisconsin back in October, John Pryzybyla, 75, tried to explain away the smell of alcohol on his breath by saying he had just eaten beer-battered fish . Fish tale: The glassy-eyed driver told the arresting deputy he was returning home from a fish fry . The arresting deputy noted that the driver had bloodshot and glassy eyes, and that there was an open container of Red Dog beer in the passenger seat, CBS 58 reported. The traffic stop resulted in a DUI arrest - Pryzybyla's tenth in nearly two decades - after he failed a field sobriety test. Pryzybyla was then taken to Moundview Memorial Hospital for a blood test, which he refused to take claiming it was against his religion, according to Wisconsin Rapids Tribune. The arresting deputy was forced to obtain a warrant to compel Pryzybyla to take the test. Nurses at the hospital had to hold him down to draw blood. Long history: The traffic stop marked Pryzybyla's tenth arrest stemming from a suspected DUI offense . Crafty: The driver was taken to a hospital for a blood test, but told the staff it was against his religion . Although his blood alcohol content was determined to be at .062, which is below the legal limit, his history of DUI incidents bars him from getting behind the wheel with a blood alcohol content higher than .02. Pryzybyla has previous convictions in Milwaukee, Adams, and Columbia counties dating back to 1995. In 2011, he was sentenced to a year in jail and five years' probation. He is due back in court January 21 for a preliminary hearing.

chatgpt: In a recent incident in Adams County, Wisconsin, John Pryzybyla, 75, was arrested after being pulled over for driving erratically. Despite his excuse of having consumed fish fry, Pryzybyla failed a field sobriety test and was taken into custody by the police.  However, things took a bizarre turn when Pryzybyla attempted to resist submission to a blood test by claiming that it was against his religion. This claim left the officers and officials stunned, as it raised concerns about the genuineness of Pryzybyla's excuse and the validity of his claims.  Further investigation revealed that Pryzybyla had a history of nine previous convictions of driving under influence (DUI) in multiple jurisdictions. This raised serious questions about what measures could have been taken to prevent the repeated occurrence of such incidents. This incident has raised concerns regarding the penalties imposed on repeated offenders of DUI. It begs the question of whether stricter laws and punishments need to be put in place to curb such repeated offenses, especially when they put other drivers and pedestrians in danger. Organizations and communities have called for stricter penalties and evaluations of individuals with prior cases of DUI, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive background checks before issuing driver's licenses. They argue that not only would this help prevent repeated offenses, but it would also ensure the safety of other driver's and commuters on the roads. It is also important for people to be aware of the dangers of driving under the influence and the importance of taking responsibility for their actions. The choice to drink and drive not only puts the driver at risk but everybody else on the road. It is crucial that individuals understand the gravity of their actions and act responsibly. In conclusion, this incident serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible driving and the need for stricter penalties to prevent repeated DUI offenses. It is essential to put in place measures to ensure that individuals who repeatedly break the law do not continue to pose a danger to themselves and others.
