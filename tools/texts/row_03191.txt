This young Pied Cormorant wasn't in the mood to wait for dinner so instead stuck its head down its mother's gaping mouth to find something to eat. The mother bird had already tucked into her tea but the ravenous offspring also wanted a bite. These photographs were taken by Australian photographer Ofer Levy, 51, after he spotted the hungry bird in Centennial Park, Sydney. Dinner for two? The mother bird enjoys her fishy dinner while her offspring looks on . Starving: The hungry Pied Cormorant dives straight down its mother's throat looking for food . Mr Levy said: 'Here you can see a young Pied Cormorant trying to get partially digested fish from the parent's crop. 'It's pretty aggressive behaviour as the youngsters push their heads all the way down the parent's throat. 'They chase the adult bird and compete with each other to get to the food, so it's a pretty crazy moment to watch.' Pied Cormorant's are found off the coast of Australia and New Zealand and will dive for food in both shallow, still water and rapidly moving currents to get their meal. Famished: The young bird didn't want to wait around for dinner so had a quick look to see if its mother had any grub inside her . Taking a couple of weeks to get the perfect shot, Mr Levy said it was difficult to capture the feeding scene. 'It took me a lot of patience and persistence before I managed to capture this behaviour in front of me in the right distance and angle. 'I had to get in the pond with water up to my waist, but it was worth it to be able to get these pictures. 'It usually takes people a little while to look at my photographs before they actually realise what's going on, and that one bird's head is right down the other's throat.'

chatgpt: Australian photographer Ofer Levy captured a heartwarming scene in Sydney’s Centennial Park last week. As he was strolling through the park, he noticed a mother Pied Cormorant who had taken a break from fishing and was enjoying a well-deserved tea time. However, it was not long before her offspring turned up looking for a bite. The mother bird had found a peaceful spot by the pond and had started to tuck into her meal when her chick came waddling over, looking very interested in what she was eating. Without hesitation, the little one started to peck at her food, much to the mother's surprise. Levy quickly grabbed his camera and shared the adorable scene on social media. He commented on how it was one of the most beautiful things he had seen in a while and praised the mother bird for being so patient and loving towards her young. The photographs quickly went viral, with many people sharing their thoughts on the adorable encounter. Pied Cormorants are an indigenous species to Australia and are usually found near bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or ponds. They are known for their love of fish, which they catch by diving and swimming underwater. Despite the occasional meals being shared between the mother and her offspring, experts warn that feeding wild birds can often do more harm than good. While it may seem like a kind gesture, humans can unknowingly cause dependency and behavioral changes in the animals. Levy hopes that by photographing moments like these, he can raise awareness of the beauty of nature and the importance of protecting wildlife. He also expressed his appreciation for the opportunity to capture such an intimate moment between a mother and her chick, and how it serves as a reminder of the love and care that exists in the animal kingdom. In conclusion, the beautiful scene in which a mother Pied Cormorant shared her tea time with her chick was captured by Australian photographer Ofer Levy in Sydney’s Centennial Park. Levy’s heartwarming photographs show the delicate and nurturing relationship between a mother and child in the animal kingdom, but remind us also of the risks of interfering with nature.
