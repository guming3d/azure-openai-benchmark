article: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The families of two boys allegedly shot to death by a U.S. consular employee as they tried to rob him have filed a complaint with Lahore police against the American, accusing him of two murders, a police spokesman said. Nayab Haider said the complaint, called a "first information report," triggers an official investigation by police, who will submit their findings to a court. The court then will decide on what, if any, charges will be filed. The American was driving in a busy area known as Kartaba Chawk when two boys on a motorcycle tried to rob him, said another police official, Faisal Rana. The American shot both boys, he said. Rana identified the American as Raymond Davis. Alberto Rodriguez, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, confirmed that the man involved in the shooting is an employee of the U.S. consulate but did not confirm his identity. Rodriguez also said he could not confirm details of the police account. Rana said the man surrendered to police and was in custody. Rodriguez, however, could not say whether the man was in police custody or whether he had been turned over to the consulate. In addition, Rana said, a car from the U.S. consulate was involved in an accident that killed a motorcyclist while it was en route to the police station in response to the shooting incident.

chatgpt: The families of two boys who were killed in what police are calling an attempted robbery have filed a complaint against an American employed by the consulate in Lahore. The incident occurred last month, but details are only now coming to light. According to police, the two boys, both aged 14, tried to rob the American while he was in his car. The American, who has not been named, then allegedly shot both boys, killing them. The American was taken into custody following the incident. The families of the two boys have now filed a complaint alleging that their sons were killed unjustly. They claim that the American used excessive force in defending himself during the robbery attempt. The case has attracted attention because the American is employed by the US consulate in Lahore. The US embassy has declined to comment on the incident, citing privacy concerns. However, officials have acknowledged that the man in question is employed by the consulate. The incident has also raised questions about the use of force in self-defense. Pakistan has strict gun laws, and it is rare for citizens to own firearms. However, violence and crime are common in some parts of the country, and incidents like this are not unheard of. As the investigation continues, the families of the two boys are seeking justice for their loved ones. Meanwhile, the American remains in custody, awaiting trial for his alleged role in the incident.
