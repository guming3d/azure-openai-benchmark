A testy face-off between a 'Google employee' and a protester has now been revealed as a set up as the man who barked at the protester was a member of the same activist group. A local paper uploaded a video of a man getting off one of the private shuttle buses used by Google to transport employees from San Francisco to the company's headquarters about an hour's drive away. On Monday, a group of demonstrators stopped the bus, chanting that the company was one of the reasons why so many lower-income residents are being forced out of their homes in search of cheaper rent. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Looking for a fight: A man initially identified- incorrectly- as a Google employee got into a screaming match with a protestor and he told her to move somewhere else if she couldn't afford rent in San Francisco . The man, later identified as Max Bell Alper, gets off the bus and gets into a screaming match with one of the protestors, saying: 'Well then why don't you go to a city where you can afford it because this is a city for the right people who can afford it.' 'If you can't afford it, it's time for you to leave,' he continued. 'If you can't pay your rent, I'm sorry. Get a better job.' The man's true identity, after only identifying himself at the scene as a Google employee, was revealed later on Monday as a union organizer by the San Francisco Bay Guardian. 'This is political theater to demonstrate what is happening to the city. It's about more than just the bus,' Alper told The San Francisco Bay Guardian after the jig was up. Even though the protestor that Alper yelled at in the incident appears to be smiling- almost hinting that she may have been in on the joke- has said that she didn't know it was about to happen. She said she didn't even know who Alper was. Out of the loop: Even when the 'employee' was identified as union activist Max Bell Alper, the protestor remained committed to the fact that she, Erin McElroy, had no idea who he was or that it was a set-up . 'No I did not know him, he didn't tell me that he was going to be doing that,' said Erin McElroy, who heads the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project. Alper's group is fighting against the increasing inequality divide in the city which is forcing many out to the suburbs where rents are more reasonable. 'I'm really upset that this happened. We've calculated about 11,000 no fault evictions since 1997,' Alper said. 'These are enormous corporations that are investing in this community. These companies, like Google, should be proud of where they're from and invest in their communities.' WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .

chatgpt: In a surprising turn of events, a union organizer, who initially posed as a Google employee, got into an altercation with a protestor in San Francisco. The incident occurred during a recent protest against the high rent prices in the city, which has resulted in widespread displacement of low-income residents. According to eyewitnesses, the man, identifying himself as a Google employee, told the protestor to "go somewhere else" if they couldn't afford the rent in San Francisco. This incited a heated argument between the two, with the protestor accusing the man of being insensitive and out of touch with the struggles of the working class. However, it was later revealed that the man was actually a union activist who fights for the same cause as the protestors. He had disguised himself as a Google employee to gain access to the protest and engage in a dialogue with the tech giant about their role in the housing crisis in San Francisco. The incident has sparked a debate about the effectiveness of tactics used by activists and union organizers in their fight against gentrification and rising rent prices. Some argue that posing as an employee of a large corporation only adds to the confusion and misunderstandings surrounding the issue. Others point out that it can be a useful tactic in exposing the hypocrisy of tech companies and their impact on low-income communities. San Francisco has become a symbol of the growing divide between the wealthy elite and the working class in America. Tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have been accused of contributing to this widening gap through their rapid expansion and acquisition of real estate in the city. While many applaud the efforts of activists and union organizers in their fight against gentrification, others point out that the issue is more complex than simply blaming tech companies. The city's strict zoning laws, lack of affordable housing, and geographical constraints all contribute to the high rent prices and displacement of long-term residents. Despite these challenges, union organizers and activists continue to fight for the rights of workers and low-income residents in San Francisco and other cities across America. It is up to all parties involved to work towards a more equitable and sustainable future for everyone, regardless of their social or economic status.
