chatgpt: Mother-of-two Suzy McLeod was shocked to learn that printing out boarding passes for her family would cost £236. She had traveled to Spain for a family vacation, and was preparing to return home when she realized that she had not printed out the boarding passes for her kids and herself. In an effort to save money, Suzy had decided to forego the airline's option of printing out boarding passes for £55 per person at the airport. Instead, she planned to print them out herself. However, the hotel she was staying at informed her that it would cost £18 per boarding pass, which quickly added up to a total of £236 for the entire family. "I was absolutely dumbfounded that it was so expensive," said Suzy. "I couldn't believe that it cost more to print out a piece of paper than it did to purchase the actual flight tickets." Suzy's situation is not uncommon for travelers who do not have access to a printer or a smartphone to check in online. It is also not uncommon for hotels and other print shops to charge exorbitant fees for printing out boarding passes. This has led to criticism towards airlines for not providing more affordable options for travelers who are unable to print out their boarding passes at home or at the airport. Some airlines have responded by allowing travelers to check in and receive their boarding passes via mobile apps, saving time and money for both the passengers and the airline. Others have begun to offer kiosks at the airport where travelers can print out their boarding passes for free. Suzy's experience serves as a cautionary tale for travelers to always be aware of the potential costs associated with travel. It also highlights the need for more affordable options for services that are necessary for travel, such as printing out boarding passes. Overall, Suzy's story is a reminder that even the smallest details of travel can add up quickly, and travelers should be prepared for unexpected expenses.
