article: More than half of British homeowners say they cannot find a tradesman they trust, a survey shows (library image) British homeowners are not doing maintenance and repair work because they cannot find builders and other tradesmen they can trust, according to a survey. Finding trusted tradesmen has become such a problem that housing stock could be in a state of disrepair across regions of the UK, the Homeowner Survey from the HomeOwners Alliance and TrustMark found. More than half of homeowners (58 per cent) said they had difficulty finding a trusted builder to help with repairs or improvements, with 12 per cent of these people not doing the work and 26 per cent delaying the project. Some 40 per cent carried out the repairs or DIY themselves, 27 per cent did only the essential work and 28 per cent used tradesmen they were uncertain about. HomeOwners Alliance chief executive Paula Higgins said: 'Doing repairs, maintenance or improvements to your home are some of the biggest challenges homeowners face, and they find it far more difficult than it should be to find a reliable builder or tradesman to help them. 'For many it is quite rightly a major cause of concern - we have all watched those TV shows about cowboy builders and how your dream can turn into a nightmare. 'What is particularly worrying is that desperate homeowners are finding it so difficult to find good builders that they resort to delaying work, or simply not doing it all. 'The difficulties of getting good builders mean our national housing stock is ending up in a state of disrepair, affecting the lives of millions of householders.' Liz Male, chairwoman of the government-endorsed TrustMark 'find a tradesman' scheme, said: 'A nation of homeowners is at the mercy of leaflets through the door or findanyoldbuilder.com websites because they don't have a network of local tradespeople they can turn to. 'The price we pay are homes lacking TLC, an ever-deteriorating housing stock and the financial burden of Â£1.9 billion a year paying to fix botched jobs by tradesmen who were just not qualified to do the work. 'This is a ridiculous situation when we know there are so many excellent tradespeople out there who are totally committed to doing quality work and excellent customer service.' The Homeowner Survey from the HomeOwners Alliance and TrustMark found 40 per cent of people carried out the repairs or DIY themselves because they couldn't find a suitable handyman (library image)

chatgpt: A recent survey conducted by the HomeOwners Alliance and TrustMark has revealed that more than half of homeowners have found it difficult to find a builder they trust. This has led to a worrying trend of homeowners turning to uncertified tradesmen, with 28 per cent of those surveyed admitting to using tradesmen they weren't entirely sure about. The survey also showed that, in response to the difficulty in finding trusted builders, many homeowners are opting to carry out repairs themselves instead. In fact, 40 per cent of those surveyed said they chose to take on repair work themselves rather than hire a builder or tradesman. The survey highlights a growing issue within the construction industry, as customers struggle to find reliable and trustworthy tradesmen to carry out work on their homes. This can lead to a wide range of problems, from shoddy workmanship to serious safety concerns. One of the biggest challenges facing homeowners is knowing how to find a trusted builder. With so many builders and tradesmen operating in the market, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The HomeOwners Alliance and TrustMark survey highlights the importance of homeowners doing their research before hiring a builder or tradesman. Some of the key things to look out for are whether the builder or tradesman is registered with a professional body, whether they have all the necessary insurance and whether they have good reviews or recommendations from previous customers. Despite the difficulties in finding a trusted builder, it is important for homeowners to resist the temptation to cut corners by using uncertified tradesmen. While it might seem like a cheaper option in the short term, it can lead to much more serious and expensive problems down the line. Worryingly, the survey also showed that more than a quarter of those surveyed had experienced problems with builders or tradesmen who had carried out work on their homes. This highlights the importance of being vigilant and closely monitoring any work that is carried out on your property. Overall, the survey by the HomeOwners Alliance and TrustMark highlights the significant challenges that homeowners face when trying to find a trusted builder. However, by doing their research and taking the time to find a reputable builder or tradesman, homeowners can help to ensure that their homes are repaired and maintained to a high standard.
