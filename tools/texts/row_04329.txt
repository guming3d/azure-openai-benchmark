article: By . Sam Webb . This is the incredible moment a stealth bomber is refuelled over the Cornish coastline in a rare trip to England. Two B-2 Spirit aircraft from the U.S. Air Force have been deployed at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire. It is very unusual for the groundbreaking bombers to be deployed outside of the U.S., because their long-flying ability meaning they can normally operate from a domestic base. Scroll down for video . Sentinel of the sky: This is the incredible moment a U.S. stealth bomber is refuelled over the Cornish coastline. The high-tech aircraft, which has a wingspan of 52-metres and can fly for as long as 44 hours, was photographed above Cornwall's picturesque northern coastline. It was performing a mid-air refuelling with a KC-135 Stratotanker from RAF Mildenhall. The image was captured on June 11 by Senior Airman Christine Griffiths and now released by the U.S. Air Force. The U.S. military said the B-2 was 'participating in familiarisation training operations' in the UK. Admiral Cecil Haney, commander, U.S. Strategic Command, said: 'This deployment of strategic bombers provides an invaluable opportunity to strengthen and improve interoperability with our allies and partners. 'The training and integration of strategic forces demonstrates to our nation's leaders and our allies that we have the right mix of aircraft and expertise to respond to a variety of potential threats and situations.' The billion-dollar bomber, which has a crew of two, has an unrefuelled range of approximately 6,000 nautical miles and can hold 75-tonnes of fuel. File picture . The B-2-bomber photographed above Cornwall is assigned to 509th Bomb Wing, Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. Launched in 1997, the stealth bomber is one of the most recognisable aircraft ever launched and carries conventional and nuclear weapons. The billion-dollar bomber, which has a crew of two, has an unrefuelled range of approximately 6,000 nautical miles and can hold 75-tonnes of fuel. According to the US military, the B-2's 'stealth characteristics give it the unique ability to penetrate an enemy's most sophisticated defences and threaten its most valued, and heavily defended, targets'.

chatgpt: The United States Air Force rarely deploys its state-of-the-art B-2 aircraft outside of U.S. borders. However, the public recently got a glimpse of the aircraft's capabilities after a stunning photograph was released by the USAF. The B-2 is known for its capabilities in long-range bombing missions, and it's thanks in part to its ability to refuel mid-air. The aircraft can spend an astonishing 44 hours in the sky, making it a valuable asset in protecting national interests. One of the primary features of the B-2 is its ability to remain undetected by radar. This makes it an effective tool for surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations. The aircraft can also deliver precision-guided munitions to targets with incredible accuracy, allowing for surgical strikes without causing extensive collateral damage. While the B-2 is a formidable machine, it is rarely seen by the general public. The aircraft's most high-profile mission came in 1999, when it was used in the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia. The recent photograph of the B-2 was taken by one of the aircraft's crew members and released by the USAF. The image shows the aircraft soaring over the clouds, looking like something out of a science fiction movie. The release of the photograph has sparked renewed interest in the B-2, with many people curious about the aircraft's capabilities. While the aircraft is primarily used for military purposes, it's clear that there is an appreciation for the sheer engineering marvel that the B-2 represents. Overall, the B-2 serves as a symbol of American military power and technological innovation. Despite the fact that it is rarely deployed, the aircraft remains a critical component of the U.S. military's arsenal. As long as there are threats to national security, the B-2 will continue to play a vital role in keeping the country safe.
