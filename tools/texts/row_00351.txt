chatgpt: A woman and her two children had a narrow escape when their minivan was hit by a MBTA Fitchburg bound commuter rail train in Belmont, Massachusetts. The woman claimed she was following her GPS device when she drove the minivan onto the MBTA track at around 9 p.m. on Tuesday. After failing to get the car off the tracks, the trio fled the vehicle just in time as the train collided with it. The incident occurred in a residential area, with many witnesses witnessing the accident. The woman, whose name has not been released to the public, told the police that she was following the instructions on her GPS device, which led her to the tracks. However, she was unable to drive the car off the tracks, leading to the narrow escape. Despite the severity of the crash, there were no injuries reported, which left many people surprised. The Metro Transit Authority reported that no passengers or staff were injured during the incident, which is a significant relief to anyone who was following the news. The incident caused widespread disruption to the MBTA commuter rail service, with trains in both directions delayed for several hours. Passengers were asked to avoid the area, and shuttle buses were called in to transport people instead. According to authorities, the train involved in the accident was severely damaged and needed to be towed away. The Belmont police department and the MBTA are investigating the incident, which is an unusual occurrence. According to authorities, it is unclear how the GPS device led the woman onto the train tracks, and the incident highlights the dangers of following GPS instructions blindly. As technology becomes more integrated into our lives, incidents like these are bound to occur. Authorities are urging people to be cautious when following GPS instructions, especially when driving. It is a reminder that technology is not foolproof and relying entirely on it without paying attention to our surroundings can be dangerous. In conclusion, the incident in Belmont is a reminder that we need to be cautious when using GPS devices, and we should always pay attention to our surroundings. The good news is that no one was injured during the incident, which could have had far more severe consequences. The investigation is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge in the coming days.
