article: The Prime Minister said he would block Serbia and Albania from joining the EU unless there were stringent restrictions on how citizens could move across the continent . David Cameron threatened last night to veto any new members of the EU unless he won sweeping curbs on freedom of movement. The Prime Minister said he would block Serbia and Albania from joining unless there were stringent restrictions on how citizens could move across the continent. The poor Eastern European nations are next in line to join the union, and Turkey and  Bosnia could be next. Mr Cameron said curbs were needed to avoid the ‘huge mistake’ of the unrestricted opening of borders to Poland and other countries nine years ago, with hundreds of thousands coming to the UK for work. The threat, made after yesterday’s EU summit in Brussels, will put pressure on European leaders to increase restrictions on movement. It could see Serbian and Albanian people denied free movement in Europe until their countries’ average earnings or GDP reached a certain level, for example. Mr Cameron hopes it will also pave the way for a more general revision of EU treaties. Days before restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are lifted at the end of this month, he said: ‘The EU’s founding fathers simply did not envisage that the accession of new countries would trigger mass population movements across Europe.’ He added that free movement should not mean freedom to get ‘the best benefit deal’. Both Serbia and Albania want to join the EU, but any negotiations will take at least ten years. The threat, made after yesterday's EU summit in Brussels (above), will put pressure on European leaders to increase restrictions on movement.

No new EU member can be admitted without the support of all existing members. Mr Cameron said: ‘On new accessions, they are by unanimity so they don’t happen unless everybody agrees. So you do have a real opportunity . . . to insist on a different approach.’

chatgpt: The European Union is planning to bring in new members from poor Eastern European countries in the near future, following warnings of the dangers of a potentially unrestricted opening of borders. Turkey and Bosnia have both been discussed as potential new members, following Poland and other countries joining the union nine years prior. The union's expansion has been met with mixed reactions, with many pointing out the economic challenges that the new countries may pose. However, the new members could bring a range of benefits, including fresh trade opportunities, cultural diversity, and strategic alliances. Despite the potential benefits, the countries seeking membership are being closely scrutinized, with curbs being considered to avoid a repeat of the mistakes made nine years ago. The EU's Prime Minister has stressed the importance of avoiding a "huge mistake" that could threaten the stability of the union. The challenges facing Eastern Europe are many, with countries still struggling to rebuild after decades of communist rule. However, joining the EU would bring much-needed support, including investment, economic assistance, and access to new markets. Many in Turkey and Bosnia have been encouraged by the discussions, with some expressing the hope that the EU can lend a hand in addressing longstanding domestic issues. However, others have expressed concerns around sovereignty and the potential impact on national identity. The EU's willingness to expand is being viewed both as an opportunity and a challenge. As the union grapples with a range of internal issues, including Brexit and ongoing tensions with Russia, the potential addition of new members could bring fresh energy and perspective, but also added complexity and uncertainty. Overall, the move towards expansion represents a significant shift for the EU. While the economic and political challenges are many, there is hope that the union's continued growth can bring new opportunities, both for existing members and for those seeking to join. However, as the discussion around curbs makes clear, there is also a deep sense of caution, reflecting the recognition that the stakes are high. As the union continues to negotiate the complexities of expansion, it will be essential to ensure that the process is carried out with care and deliberation, taking into account the needs and concerns of all involved. Only in this way can the EU continue to grow and thrive, while preserving the stability and security that underpins its success.
