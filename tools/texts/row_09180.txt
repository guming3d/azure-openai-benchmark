European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has left individual governments to find their own economic solutions . The crisis in the recession-battered eurozone escalated yesterday as unemployment there soared to a record high of close to 20million. The jobless rate in the single currency bloc hit 12.2 per cent, far higher than in Britain and the US, statistics agency Eurostat said. Youth unemployment surged to a devastating 24.4 per cent – meaning one in four Europeans under the age of 25 who want work cannot find a job. The jobless rate among young Greeks reached 62.5 per cent while 56.4 per cent of young Spaniards and 40.5 per cent of young Italians are out of work. Anatoli Annenkov, senior European economist at French bank Societe Generale, said the worst-hit countries are at risk of a ‘lost generation’ who will never find work. It is feared that rocketing unemployment – particularly among the young – will fuel resentment against the euro and trigger a break-up of the single currency bloc. The European Commission warned this week that unemployment across the region is ‘unacceptably high’ and threatens ‘grave social consequences’. French president Francois Hollande said it could lead to the breakdown of Europe. ‘Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project,’ he said. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said European ‘unity’ was at risk.

chatgpt: According to the latest data released by the National Statistical Institute (INSEE), the proportion of unemployed people in France has reached its highest level since 1995. The report reveals that the country's unemployment rate rose to 10.8% in the third quarter of 2021, with 2.8 million people currently jobless. This represents a significant increase from the previous quarter, when the unemployment rate stood at 9.3%. The figures are particularly concerning, as France has not seen such high levels of unemployment since the early 1990s. The report also highlights the fact that French youth are bearing the brunt of the economic downturn, with almost a quarter of young people aged between 15 and 24 currently out of work. This is a worrying trend, as youth unemployment has a significant impact on the country's long-term economic prospects. Furthermore, the study found that the number of long-term unemployed - those out of work for over a year - has increased by almost 150,000 since last year, reaching a total of 1.4 million people. French President Emmanuel Macron has acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and has promised to take steps to address it. In a recent speech, he announced a new plan to help young people find employment, which includes the creation of 100,000 apprenticeships and internships. However, some experts believe that these measures are not enough to address the root causes of the problem. They argue that France needs to undertake significant structural reforms to boost its economy and create more job opportunities. The high unemployment rate in France is part of a broader trend across Europe, as the continent struggles to recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest data from Eurostat reveals that the overall unemployment rate in the Eurozone was 7.5% in September 2021, with 12 million people out of work. The situation is particularly severe in southern European countries such as Greece and Spain, where the unemployment rates are 15.5% and 14.7% respectively. These countries are still recovering from the sovereign debt crisis that hit the region in 2008 and have been further affected by the pandemic. In conclusion, the latest data shows that France is currently facing its most significant unemployment crisis in decades. The high levels of joblessness are particularly worrying for young people, with almost a quarter of them currently out of work. The government's plan to increase apprenticeships and internships is a step in the right direction, but more structural reforms are needed to address the root causes of the problem.
