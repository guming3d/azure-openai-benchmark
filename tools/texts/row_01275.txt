A civil rights group has devised a new kind of online test that measures a user's sense of human empathy to distinguish them from automatic spam posting programmes. The Civil Rights Captcha asks users to take a moral stance on a real-world civil rights issue by offering them three options about how they feel about it. Only one answer is correct, and that is the one which shows compassion and empathy. Moral stance: A new kind of Captcha asks users to prove they are human by choosing the morally correct response from a choice of three . For example, the Captcha might ask a user: 'In Kosovo people are tortured in detention. How does that make you feel?' It then asks them to enter either 'excited', or 'bothered', or 'great'. A Captcha is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a person. The acronym, coined in 2000 by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, is based on the word 'capture' and stands for 'Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart'. A common type of Captcha requires the user to type letters or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen, and the tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites. Are you human? The test was designed by Swedish campaign group . Civil Rights Defenders and draws from examples of incidents that breach . the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Devised by campaign group Civil Rights Defenders, an Swedish campaign group, the Civil Rights Captcha is intended to raise the profile of civil rights struggles worldwide. 'With over 200 million CAPTCHAs being solved everyday, we hope that by catching a tiny amount of those interactions we can help promote and empower our partners - brave human rights defenders, who often put themselves at great risk through their engagement for other people's rights,' they say. Most of the situations presented by the Captcha are based on real events where the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been breached. Civil Rights Defenders add that there is no content related to their work on the app that is based on their 'subjective and personal' values. The app is available as free code for any web developer to use on their site.

chatgpt: In today's world, it's easy to forget the importance of compassion and empathy amidst the fast-paced and often self-serving nature of our daily routines. However, recent breaches of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights serve as poignant reminders of the essential role these qualities play in our lives. Examples of such breaches can be seen across the globe, from war-torn countries where civilians are subject to heinous acts of violence, to more subtle but equally damaging forms of discrimination and inequality in our own communities. While these breaches may manifest in different ways, at their core they all involve a disregard for the inherent dignity and worth of every human being. It is precisely in these moments of crisis that compassion and empathy can make all the difference. When we take the time to truly understand and care about the experiences of others, we not only improve their lives but also enrich our own. In a world that often glorifies individual achievement and success, it can be difficult to prioritize the needs of others. But the truth is that compassionate action doesn't have to come at the expense of our own well-being. In fact, research has shown that those who practice empathy and compassion are more likely to experience feelings of happiness and fulfillment. This is not to say that choosing compassion is always easy; in fact, it can sometimes be incredibly challenging. It requires us to listen deeply to the perspectives of others, to confront our own biases and assumptions, and to take action even when it is not immediately convenient or rewarding. But the benefits of these efforts are immeasurable, both for ourselves and for the world around us. So the next time you find yourself faced with a choice, remember that every decision is an opportunity to practice compassion and empathy. Whether it is through a small act of generosity or a larger commitment to social justice, your actions have the potential to make a profound difference in the lives of others. None of us can solve all of the world's problems alone, but by choosing empathy and compassion, we can work together to create a brighter future for ourselves and for generations to come. Let us all take inspiration from the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and strive to embody its vision of a world where every individual is valued and respected.
