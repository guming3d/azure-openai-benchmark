She may have one less flipper - but this young seal has plenty to smile about after her life was saved by vets following a brutal attack. The eight-month-old, known as Pup 49, was found badly injured on a Massachusetts beach following a fight with another seal. Her horrific injuries included deep cuts all over her body which became seriously infected. She is now getting used to her new life with one less rear flipper at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut after vets were forced to remove one to stop the infection spreading through her body. The plucky pup's strength has nearly returned but she is still coming to terms with the amputation - occasionally swimming to the platform's edge and trying to haul herself from the water, ABC news reports. Workers at the aquarium have even installed a special ramp to help the pup get out of her pool. But things could have turned out very differently for the inquisitive creature, after she was left on the brink of death following a battle with an older seal off the New England coast. She was found stranded and emaciated in PlymouthÂ  Massachusetts last July. The seal, which was named Pup 49 after the ID number she was given when rescued, was also struggling to breath properly due to the impact of her wounds and infection.

chatgpt: A harbor seal pup in Massachusetts is on the road to recovery after nearly losing her life on a beach. The young pup had suffered deep cuts all over her body following a brutal battle with an older seal. Fortunately, she was found and rescued just in time. The pup was brought to the New England Aquarium's Animal Care Center in Boston for treatment. It was clear that she was in critical condition, with her wounds infected and her body weak from lack of food. The veterinarians at the Animal Care Center knew that they needed to act fast to save the pup's life. The first step was to perform surgery to amputate one of her rear flippers, which had been badly damaged in the fight. This was necessary to prevent the infection from spreading throughout her body. Despite the difficult surgery, the pup made it through and is now recovering well. According to the New England Aquarium, she is gaining weight and her wounds are slowly healing. The team at the Animal Care Center is working around the clock to give the pup the best possible care, including feeding her a special diet and providing her with antibiotics to fight off the infection. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting our local wildlife. Harbor seals are a protected species, and it is illegal to harass, hunt, or kill them. The New England Aquarium is reminding beachgoers to give harbor seals plenty of space and to avoid approaching them, especially during pupping season from May through August. Pups are born on beaches and are often left alone for long periods while their mothers hunt for food, so it's important not to disturb them. The aquarium also notes that if you see a harbor seal that appears injured or sick, it's important to contact your local animal control or wildlife agency, who can provide proper care and rehabilitation. The story of the rescued harbor seal pup has touched the hearts of many, with people from all over the world sending their well-wishes for her speedy recovery. The New England Aquarium has expressed its gratitude for the outpouring of support and is urging everyone to continue to protect our local wildlife by practicing responsible beach behavior. As for the pup, she has a long road ahead of her, but the team at the Animal Care Center is confident that with their help, she will make a full recovery and be able to return to the wild where she belongs.
