They were particularly happy to see that the fine lines on their . foreheads, cheeks and around their eyes had started to fade away. The night cream, which goes on sale today, is the first to harness the healing powers of thymosin beta-4. The protein can also rejuvenate skin by attracting young, healthy cells to areas that have been damaged by age, pollution, sunlight and smoking. Women who used the cream were happy to see that the fine lines on their foreheads, cheeks and around their eyes had started to fade away (file picture) But while levels of thymosin beta-4 are high in our late 20s and early 30s, they fall as we age. Simply putting it into a cream would be of little use, as the molecule is too big to break its way through the surface of the skin. So, scientists from Avon’s research and development department in New York screened more than two million compounds for ones that turn up the body’s own production of the protein. They hit on two compounds, including a Himalayan plant used in Chinese medicine, and incorporated them into the cream. The face cream also contains other ingredients designed to protect the skin against day to day wear and tear. In tests, the lotion helped stop a cut apple from turning brown. And used by women for two months, it improved the appearance of wrinkles by 30 per cent. Blotchiness was halved and sunspots a third better, according to a dermatologist’s assessment. The women’s own opinions were equally glowing, with some saying they looked eight years younger. Anthony Gonzalez, the Avon scientist behind the £20 cream’s development, said it was inspired by ‘powerful medical advances’. He added: ‘What we are doing is bringing new, healthy cells to where they are needed.’

chatgpt: A new face cream from Avon has been making headlines as women who tested it have reported feeling younger. The Clinical E-Defence deep recovery face cream contains a protein known as thymosin, which is believed to have regenerative properties. Thymosin is a protein that is naturally found in the body, and it is known for its ability to help regenerate tissue in damaged human hearts. In the Clinical E-Defence deep recovery face cream, thymosin is used to help repair damaged skin cells and restore a youthful appearance. According to Avon, women who tested the £20 cream reported feeling as much as eight years younger after using it. The cream is said to work by improving the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as improving skin tone and texture. The Clinical E-Defence deep recovery face cream is part of a growing trend in the beauty industry towards products that contain ingredients that have been shown to have health benefits. While many consumers are still wary of products that make medical claims, the success of the Avon cream suggests that consumers are willing to try products that are backed by scientific research. One of the biggest selling points of the Avon cream is its affordability. At just £20, the cream is a fraction of the cost of other anti-aging products on the market. This makes it accessible to a wide range of consumers, including those who may not be able to afford more expensive treatments. Of course, there are some who remain skeptical of the claims made by Avon. Some have pointed out that the women who tested the cream may have simply felt better about themselves after using it, rather than actually looking younger. Others have suggested that the sample size was too small to draw any real conclusions. Despite these concerns, the Avon cream is likely to continue to be a popular product. With its affordable price point and reported benefits, many consumers are likely to be willing to give it a try. Whether or not it actually lives up to its promises, the Clinical E-Defence deep recovery face cream represents an exciting development in the world of beauty products.
