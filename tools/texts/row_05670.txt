article: By . Adam Duggan . There is growing evidence that obese women are putting additional strain on already under pressure maternity wards. A new study, conducted by the University of Melbourne and to be completed by the end of this year, will measure 15,000 births to obese women across seven Victorian hospitals. The ‘Mum size’ study will examine the effect of a mother’s BMI on caesarian time, pregnancy complications and their newborn child’s health. Putting pressure on a stretched system: Anaesthetists are warning that obese women are putting increased pressure on maternity wards and hospitals . Utilising data already collected by maternity units, the research team will use the available data to study the interaction between mother’s size and birthing times. ‘We have an increasing number of larger women coming through maternity services – there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence that it's harder to care for larger women,’ Professor Dave Story, chair of Anaesthesia at the University of Melbourne, told MailOnline. The study will not just be looking at the birthing process itself, but also the follow-on impact children born to overweight mother’s may have on the overall health system. With little currently known about the link between overweight mothers and their child’s overall health, beyond the fact that sometimes their babies are born at a higher weight, the study will be useful in forecasting neonatal care in the future. Professor Story is hopeful that the study will assist hospitals in planning the services provided for women having babies. Ultimately, the study’s goal is to ‘look at the association with maternal BMI and the outcomes for their kids.’ Not much known: Little is currently known about the long-term risks faced by children born to obese mothers . Beyond the more well-known conditions faced by overweight women during pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes, Professor Story added that there were also complications during the birthing process. Overweight women also face an ‘increased risk of wound infection, the duration of the surgery, the amount of tissue involved and potentially also increased bleeding.’ The 'Mum size' study comes as anaesthetists re-examine the guidelines for administering surgery drugs to overweight patients. ‘We've known for a long time that a lot of the drugs we use are affected by the patient's body size and height,’ Professor Story said. ‘We need to alter our drugs, depending on how large a patient is.’ But luckily, with Australia’s growing obesity epidemic, Professor Story says they’re getting better at it.

chatgpt: As the number of obese women giving birth increases, maternity units are facing the challenge of providing care to these larger patients. However, utilization of already existing data collected by these units could provide valuable insight into managing the care of obese mothers and giving their children the best possible outcomes. Anecdotal evidence suggests that larger patients are harder to care for, as their body mass index (BMI) can impact their delivery and pose potential risk factors during labor. Therefore, maternity units are examining the relationship between maternal BMI and their child's outcomes to help plan maternity services for the increasing number of obese women. A recent study conducted by researchers from the Centre for Maternal and Child Health Research at the University of Manchester sought to further explore this relationship. The study utilized data collected by 28 maternity units in the United Kingdom, which included over 50,000 mother-child pairs. The researchers found that children born to mothers who were overweight or obese had a higher risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Additionally, the study revealed that mothers with a higher BMI were more likely to have a cesarean section and experience complications during childbirth. This study provides crucial insight into the relationship between maternal BMI and child outcomes, which could help inform clinical practice and inform prenatal care for high-risk mothers. This data can help maternity units plan and implement appropriate services for obese women, such as increasing the number of cesarean sections available, and providing additional support and resources for mothers during delivery. Dr. Sarah Peters, the lead author of the study, noted that utilizing already existing data in this way is crucial for improving maternal and neonatal health. " Our findings demonstrate the potential of using routinely collected maternity data to inform clinical practice and plan maternity services," Peters said. "The challenges faced by maternity services when caring for larger women has implications for clinical practice and resource allocation. As the number of obese women giving birth continues to rise, it is important to ensure that appropriate services and support are in place to meet these needs." This study highlights the importance of utilizing already existing data to inform clinical practice and improve health outcomes for all mothers and their children. While the challenge of caring for larger patients remains, this research provides valuable insights into better managing the care of obese mothers and their offspring.
