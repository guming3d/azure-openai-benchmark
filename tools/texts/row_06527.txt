Lawsuit: Associated Investigative Services claims Zimmerman failed to pay more than $27,000 for protection services . A security company has filed a lawsuit against George Zimmerman, his wife and attorney claiming that they owe more than $27,000 for protection services. Associated Investigative Services filed the lawsuit in Orange County Circuit Court on Friday against Zimmerman, who is awaiting trial on second-degree murder charges in relation to the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. The civil complaint, which is also against his wife and attorney Mark O'Mara, claims O'Mara hired the company in June to provide security for the Zimmerman family but promised payments stopped after an independent trustee took over Zimmerman's defence fund. The company provided a detail for Zimmerman's second bond hearing on June 29, according to the complaint, and the arrangement stepped up into 'nearly constant' watch on Zimmerman's family. But AIS alleges payments stopped soon after an independent trustee took over the defence fund, the Orlando Sentinel has reported. The company says O'Mara told Zimmerman and the trustee wanted to 'clamp down' on the defence fund because it was running low. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract, among other claims, and requests a monetary judgment of $27,027.08. O'Mara told the Orlando Sentinel he was surprised the suit had been filed.He said 'We've paid them over $40,000' He said the company no longer provided protection to George and Shellie Zimmerman, partly because at one point it was billing them $7,000 per week, whereas they are now paying $700 a week for protection. The AIS complaint acknowledges the $40,000 paid and also says the company warned O'Mara the amount of security he requested was 'excessive'.

chatgpt: Associated Investigative Services, a security and investigation firm based in Florida, has filed a lawsuit against the lawyers of George Zimmerman, claiming that the firm was hired in June to protect Zimmerman and his family but never received payment for its services. George Zimmerman is a former neighbourhood watch volunteer who was acquitted in 2013 in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, in Sanford, Florida. Following the high-profile trial, Zimmerman established a legal defence fund to cover his legal expenses. According to Associated Investigative Services, it was hired to provide security services for Zimmerman and his family after threats were made against them. The firm claims that it provided services to the Zimmermans for over a month and was owed over $27,000 when it was informed by the defence fund's independent trustee that payments would not be made. The lawsuit filed by Associated Investigative Services alleges that Zimmerman's lawyers breached their contract with the firm and that they are owed the full amount for the services provided. The lawsuit also seeks interest and attorney's fees. However, George Zimmerman's attorney, Michael O'Mara, expressed surprise at the lawsuit, saying that the defence fund had already paid over $40,000 to Associated Investigative Services. O'Mara stated that he had been unaware of any disputes between the firm and the defence fund's independent trustee. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal troubles for Zimmerman, who has had numerous encounters with the law since his acquittal. In 2015, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and battery for allegedly throwing a bottle at his girlfriend. The charges were later dropped. In 2016, Zimmerman was involved in a road rage incident and was accused of threatening another driver with a gun. No charges were filed in that incident. It remains to be seen how the lawsuit filed by Associated Investigative Services will affect Zimmerman's legal defence fund, which has already faced criticism for accepting donations from supporters in the wake of his trial. The case also highlights the challenges faced by individuals who find themselves in the public eye and require protection services.
