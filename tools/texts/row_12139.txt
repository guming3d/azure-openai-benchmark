article: Paris, France (CNN) -- Three French hostages kidnapped in Nigeria have been released, the French government said Wednesday. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner announced their release "with great joy and deep relief," saying the Nigerian authorities had told him the news. The three French nationals were taken hostage in Nigeria September 22 while on a boat belonging to the oil services company Bourbon. They all appear to be in good health "despite difficult conditions while in captivity," Bourbon said Wednesday. They are undergoing medical and psychological tests under the company's care in Nigeria before returning to France, the company said. Kouchner expressed his "gratitude to the Nigerian authorities for the constant mobilization that led to the release of these three hostages." They were captured in an attack on their ship, the Bourbon Alexandre, Bourbon said at the time. It's not clear who captured them, but rebels said the following day that they had located them. "The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta can confirm that it has located the three abducted French nationals and another individual abducted in a separate incident on the same night," the group said in a statement September 23. "We are in negotiations with the abductors towards effecting a transfer of the men to the custody of MEND." The statement by the group's spokesman Jomo Gbono did not give details on who the kidnappers were. MEND did not issue a statement Wednesday when the French nationals were released. It is not clear who the fourth hostage was. Sixteen crew members were on the Alexandre when it was attacked by speedboats, Bourbon said. Thirteen remained on the ship and were unhurt, the company said. The company provides ship and underwater services to oil and gas clients worldwide. MEND, the key militant group in the oil-rich Niger Delta, is an umbrella organization of several rebel groups. It has been battling the government for years over a more even distribution of the country's oil wealth. CNN's Christian Purefoy in Lagos, Nigeria, contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Two French nationals who were kidnapped in Venezuela have been released after over a month in captivity. The news was greeted with "great joy" by French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner. The two hostages were working for an oil services company when they were abducted on September 22. It is not yet clear who was responsible for the kidnapping, although a rebel group claimed to have found them. The men were abducted in the eastern state of Anzoategui, where several foreign companies operate. Kidnappings are not uncommon in Venezuela, particularly in the oil-rich areas of the country. The French government had been working closely with the Venezuelan authorities to secure the release of the two detainees. The exact circumstances of their release have not been made public, but it is believed that a ransom may have been paid. Kidnappings of foreign nationals have been on the rise in Venezuela in recent years, with most victims being held for ransom. The Venezuelan authorities have been accused of not doing enough to tackle the problem, and the country's president, Hugo Chavez, has come under criticism for his perceived lack of action. Kidnapping is a serious issue in Venezuela and is affecting the country's foreign relations. The release of the two French hostages is a welcome development, but more needs to be done to prevent future abductions. The French government has expressed its gratitude to the Venezuelan authorities for their role in securing the release of the two men. It is hoped that the incident will prompt increased cooperation between the two countries in the fight against kidnapping. Overall, the news of the release of the two French nationals has been met with relief and a sense of hope that the situation in Venezuela can be improved. The safety and security of foreign nationals working in the country must remain a priority for both Venezuela and its international partners.
