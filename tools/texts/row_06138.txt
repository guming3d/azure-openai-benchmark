Kim Kardashian's divorce attorney told a judge Wednesday that the reality star wants to move on with her life but is 'handcuffed' to her estranged husband because the case is not yet ready for trial. Superior Court Judge Stephen Moloney told attorneys for Kardashian and NBA player Kris Humphries to return to court in mid-February to set a trial date to either dissolve or annul the couple's 72-day marriage. He didn't set a deadline for depositions and other pre-trial investigation to be completed, but indicated a trial could be held early next year if it is ready by Feb. 15. 'Handcuffed': Kim Kardashian's divorce lawyer says the reality star cannot move on with her life because her divorce case with estranged husband Kris Humphries is still not ready for trial, pictured on Tuesday in Florida . Humphries, a power forward for the Brooklyn Nets, is seeking an annulment based on fraud, but his attorney says he needs more time to collect documents from companies that handle Kardashian's reality shows. Kardashian is seeking a traditional divorce and her attorney Laura Wasser has cited both the marriage's short duration and a prenuptial agreement as reasons for why it should be quickly resolved. 'I don't think his client has a fraud case,' Wasser said in court of Humphries' attorney. 'I think there's a fishing expedition going on here.' Humphries' attorney Marshall Waller said he needed to be sure he had documents from E! Entertainment and NBC Universal before deciding the scope of his case, but that he was narrowing it down. 'I do understand the desire to get this case moved,' Waller said. 'There's nothing in particular about this case that makes it more important than anybody else.'

Wasser however said that unlike in a regular divorce proceeding, Kardashian cannot have her marriage dissolved and resolve other issues later. 'Ms. Kardashian is now handcuffed to Mr. Humphries,' she said. Kardashian filed for divorce more than a year ago, citing irreconcilable differences just weeks after the couple's star-studded and televised wedding. Humphries later filed for an annulment, claiming the marriage was based on fraud but he has yet to lay out any specific evidence for his claim. Wasser says Kardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, and current boyfriend, Kanye West, have been deposed in the case. Kardashian, 32, has not yet been deposed in the case. She is the star of the E! Entertainment Television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the network's top-rated show, which averaged more than 3 million viewers in its sixth season. She also appears on other series involving her family.

chatgpt: In a surprising development in the Kardashian-West divorce trial, Kris Jenner and Kanye West have been deposed. The news has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry and prompted speculation about the possible impact on the ongoing proceedings. Jenner, who is the matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner family, and West, who is the estranged husband of Kardashian, were both questioned under oath as part of the divorce trial. The depositions reportedly took place last week and lasted for several hours. The exact details of the depositions have not been made public, but sources close to the case say that both Jenner and West were asked about their personal knowledge of the relationship between Kardashian and West. They were also asked about any conversations they may have had with Kardashian about the divorce. The depositions are seen as a significant development in the case, as they could potentially provide crucial evidence for both sides. It is not clear what specific information was gleaned from the depositions, but legal experts say that the testimony could be used to support arguments about child custody, property division, and other key issues in the divorce. The Kardashian-West divorce has been making headlines for months, with the couple announcing their split in February of this year. Since then, there have been numerous rumors and reports about the reasons behind the breakup, with many speculating that West's mental health struggles and controversial public statements played a role in the split. Despite the drama, Kardashian and West have been working together to co-parent their four children, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. They have also been dividing their assets and coming to agreements about financial support for the children. Jenner, who has been a central figure in the Kardashian family's reality show empire, is no stranger to high-profile legal battles. She famously guided her daughter, Kim Kardashian, through her divorce from NBA player Kris Humphries in 2013, which was one of the most highly publicized divorces of the decade. As for West, the depositions represent the latest legal challenge for the rapper and fashion designer. He has been embroiled in a number of legal disputes in recent years, including a highly publicized battle with his former record label, and a lawsuit filed by fans who claim he failed to deliver on promises made about his latest album. Despite the stress and drama of the divorce trial, Kardashian and West are reportedly committed to maintaining a positive co-parenting relationship and moving forward with their lives. They both continue to have successful careers in the entertainment industry, and their fans and supporters are hoping that they will be able to find happiness and success in their post-marriage lives. As for the impact of the depositions on the trial, legal experts say that it is too soon to say. However, the fact that Jenner and West were deposed is a sign that the case is moving forward and that both sides are serious about resolving their differences in a way that is fair and equitable for everyone involved.
