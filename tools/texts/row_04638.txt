article: The DiGiorno Pizza Twitter account accidentally crashed a conversation about domestic violence yesterday by misunderstanding the meaning behind a trending hashtag, and sending out a joke tweet. Following the release of a video that clearly showed footballer Ray Rice's brutal domestic assault of then fiancée Janay Palmer in an Atlantic City hotel elevator, other abused and battered women took to Twitter to bravely share their stories, using #WhyIStayed. That is when the DiGiorno account tweeted, '#WhyIStayed You had pizza.' Scroll down for video . Big mistake: DiGiorno Pizza used a trending hashtag to make a joke about pizza, not knowing the hashtag was being used by abused  women who were sharing their stories following the release of the Ray Rice video . Many were angry and outraged the brand would joke about something so serious. The person behind the account quickly realized their mistake and apologized, writing, 'A million apologies. Did not read what the hashtag was about before posting.' That's not all either, as they also then spent the entire day writing back individual responses on Twitter to the thousands who voiced their disgust that the brand would make light of something so horrible. Apologies: So the person behind the Twitter account started apologizing... and apologizing ... and apologizing... and apologizing . The flub seems to have been forgiven by most as a result, including MSNBC TV host Ronan Farrow, who retweeted the brand's apology after he wrote to them, 'It's not delivery, it's domestic violence.' This, of course, is a rife on DiGiorno's popular slogan, 'It's not delivery, it's DiGiorno.' For good measure, the brand offered up one final apology this evening on Twitter, writing, 'We heard from many of you, and we know we disappointed you. We understand, and we apologize to everyone for this mistake.' Forgiven: After spending almost an entire day responding to complaints, it seems that many have forgiven the pizza brand . As for Rice, he was fired by the Baltimore Ravens and has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL following the release of yesterday's video. Earlier today, he spoke for the first time since the video surfaced, saying he and his wife 'are in good spirits' and that he must focus on being 'strong for my wife.'

chatgpt: In the aftermath of the Ray Rice scandal in 2014, many women took to Twitter to share their own experiences of domestic abuse, using the hashtag #WhyIStayed. The hashtag quickly went viral, with thousands of women sharing their stories of fear, shame, and desperation. However, not everyone on Twitter understood the seriousness of the situation. On September 8th, the official Twitter account of pizza brand DiGiorno tweeted out a joke that included the hashtag #WhyIStayed. The tweet read: "#WhyIStayed You had pizza."  Immediately, people on Twitter were outraged. Many pointed out the insensitivity of using a serious hashtag about domestic abuse to make a joke about pizza. It was a tone-deaf and ignorant move by the social media team at DiGiorno that could have serious repercussions for the brand. The individual behind the DiGiorno Twitter account quickly realized their mistake and issued an apology. They claimed that they had not understood what the hashtag meant and had only seen it trending on Twitter without context. The apology, however, did not satisfy many of the people who had been hurt by the tweet. The hashtag #WhyIStayed was meant to give a voice to victims of domestic abuse, not to be used as a punchline in a marketing campaign. Some called for a boycott of DiGiorno, while others demanded that the person responsible be fired. The incident highlights a larger issue of social media and the dangers of not understanding the context of a trending hashtag. It’s not enough to simply see what is trending on Twitter and join in on the conversation without understanding the underlying message. In the days following the tweet, the person behind the DiGiorno account spent hours apologizing and explaining their mistake. They also donated $5,000 to the National Network to End Domestic Violence as a way of making amends. While the damage to the brand was done, some saw the incident as an opportunity for education and awareness. Many suggested that other brands and individuals learn from the mistake and take the time to understand the context of hashtags and social media trends before joining in on the conversation. Overall, the DiGiorno tweet serves as a lesson in the power of social media and the responsibility that comes with using it. It also serves as a reminder that there is a time and a place for humor, and that making light of serious issues such as domestic abuse is never acceptable.
