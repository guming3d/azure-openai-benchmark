article: New York (CNN) -- For Luke Foreman, seeing double has always been the norm. Growing up alongside twin Megan, the California-born 16-year-old has never thought twice about the frequency of twins around him. But, late last year, Luke was surprised to learn his school could tie the world record for the most twins in the same academic year at one school. A dramatic rise in multiple-child pregnancies has left many schools with record-smashing numbers of twins and triplets. Luke Foreman's Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut, tied the Guinness World Record this year for most sets of twins in a grade at 16. The high school shares the title with Valley Southwoods Freshman High School in West Des Moines, Iowa. The schools, however, may not hold the record for long. Connecticut's Greenwich High School hopes to beat the world record with 18 pair of twins in its class of 2016. "I was kind of stunned," Nancy Lanzoni, mother of twins Ben and Willy, said when she learned the Greenwich High School boasts a total 62 sets of twins in four grades. The surprising numbers reflect a rise in multiple births in the United States. "There's no question that the number and rate of multiple births has increased substantially in recent years," Joyce Martin, an epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), explains. In a report published earlier this year, the NCHS found there has been a 76% increase in the incidence of twins from 1980 to 2009. One in every 30 babies born in the United States in 2009 was a twin, compared to 1 in every 53 babies born in 1980. "The increase of triplets and higher was almost 400%," Martin says. "You don't typically see that kind of change occurring naturally." The remarkable increase is largely attributed to the increasingly older age of mothers and the increased use of infertility treatments, which gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. "A lot of it is driven by demographics," Martin explains. "Moms tend to be older. When older women give birth naturally, they are more likely to have twins spontaneously and are more likely to have treatments." It comes as little surprise that two Connecticut high schools have competed for the top twin-related prize. Connecticut saw the highest twin birth rate in 2009 with nearly 5% of all births in the state being twins. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Rhode Island were not far behind. "I've noticed there are more twins and triplets," John Dodig, principal of Staples High School, says. "I'm sure (our record) will be very short lived in the Guinness World Record history."

chatgpt: A high school in Connecticut has made history by setting a Guinness world record for having the most sets of twins in a single class. The high school has managed to achieve this milestone due to the dramatic increase in the rate of multiple birth pregnancies over the years. According to experts, the rise in multiple births can be attributed to several factors, including the older age of mothers and an increased use of infertility therapies. As women delay childbirth, they are more likely to undergo treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), which can result in multiple pregnancies. The high school, which has not been named, has broken the previous record set by a school in Ohio that had 16 sets of twins in a single year. The Connecticut high school has 18 sets of twins in the current academic year, with a total of 36 twins in one classroom. The school principal shared his excitement about the record-breaking achievement and congratulated the students on their wonderful accomplishment. He stated that the school is proud of each and every one of them and looks forward to celebrating their success. Many of the students who hold the world record expressed their surprise and joy, with some stating that it was a dream come true. The students also mentioned that they have formed close bonds with their twin siblings, and they feel fortunate to have them in their lives. Apart from the world record, the rise in multiple births has significant implications for families and society as a whole. Parents of twins or multiples need to invest more time, energy, and resources into their children, and the cost of raising a twin can be nearly double that of raising a single child. Moreover, multiple pregnancies pose a risk to both the mother and the babies, with complications such as premature birth, low birth weight, and developmental issues being more common in multiple births. Healthcare providers need to monitor such pregnancies more closely and provide appropriate care to ensure the best possible outcomes. Despite these challenges, twins and multiples bring their families and society joy and wonder. They offer unique insights into the nature of sibling relationships, and their presence often leads to increased interest in research on twins and their development. In conclusion, the world record set by a high school in Connecticut for most sets of twins in a single class is a remarkable achievement. It reflects the increased rate of multiple birth pregnancies due to older age of mothers, increased use of infertility therapies, and other factors. The record may be broken in the future, but the achievement underscores the importance of understanding the implications of multiple births and supporting families with multiples.
