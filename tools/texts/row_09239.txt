The Bulgarians, who impressed against Liverpool and Madrid in their previous matches, signalled their intent with a brilliant header from Marcelinho that forced Basle keeper Tomas Vaclik to save on the stretch after 17 minutes. Ivory Coast midfielder Geoffroy Serey Die was then shown a straight red card for a bad foul on Ludogorets's Cosmin Moti, but the visitors still almost took the lead with keeper Vladislav Stoyanov making a brilliant one-handed save to deny Derlis Gonzalez. Ludogorets rarely looked like making the most of their numerical advantage, although Marcelinho almost broke the deadlock from a precise cross by Fabio Espinho just before the break.

In the second half, the hosts pressed forward bravely with Espinho testing Vaclik with long-range efforts, but their attacks frequently broke down in the absence of a truly top class striker. Basle coach Paulo Sousa had made three changes to the team that beat Liverpool 1-0, with Naser Aliji, Derlis Gonzalez and Davide Calla replacing Behrang Safari, Marco Streller and Ahmed Hamoudi, and they looked disciplined and determined despite playing with 10 men for more than 70 minutes until Minev's strike.

chatgpt: Yordan Minev's stunning strike from distance secured a late win for Bulgarian champions Ludogorets against Swiss giants, FC Basel. The victory has now brought Ludogorets back into contention in their Champions League Group B. The match was a closely contested one with both teams creating several opportunities to open the scoring. However, it was Ludogorets who came out on top thanks to Minev's 25-yard scorcher in the 90th minute. Sadly for FC Basel, their night ended in disappointment when Geoffroy Serey Die was shown a straight red card for a foul on Cosmin Moti. The Swiss side tried to regroup but were unable to convert any of their chances into goals, leaving them empty-handed. The win was critical for Ludogorets, who were coming off a loss to Group B leaders, Liverpool. With the victory, Ludogorets now sits alongside Basel and Liverpool with three points and are still very much in the mix for a place in the knockout stages. Speaking after the game, Ludogorets coach, Georgi Dermendzhiev expressed his delight at the team’s performance in such an important match. "I am proud of my team's fighting spirit and resilience. We knew we had to win this game if we wanted to keep our hopes alive and the players played with intensity and commitment," he said. The game was a clear display of Ludogorets' ability to rise to the occasion when it matters most. The Bulgarian champions showed determination and resilience throughout the entire match and waited patiently for their chance to strike. Although they struggled at times in midfield, the Ludogorets defence stepped up to the plate and delivered a solid performance. Cosmin Moti, in particular, was outstanding at the back, constantly thwarting Basel's attacking plays. The win has also been a boost for Ludogorets as they head into the next round of group matches. Speaking ahead of their next fixture against Basel, Georgi Dermendzhiev underlined his team's newfound confidence. "We know that we are not the favourites in our group, but we will play every game like it's our last. This result has given us the belief that we can compete at this level, and we will give everything to qualify for the knockout stages," he said. Overall, Ludogorets' victory against Basel was a significant boost for the team's morale and their chances in Group B. Yordan Minev's stunning goal will go down as one of the highlights of the tournament, and the team's fighting spirit will undoubtedly serve them well in the matches to come.
