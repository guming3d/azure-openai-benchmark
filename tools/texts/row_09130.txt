article: (CNN) -- Frank Lautenberg grew up in Paterson, New Jersey -- a tough mill town. Served in World War II, where he scampered up improvised rickety poles to string wire to keep the lines of communication open. Went to Columbia on the GI Bill, then made a fortune as co-founder of ADP. He was among the first to see how computers could revolutionize business, and he put the new technology to work processing paychecks. He made millions in business, but never abandoned his liberal roots. His generous support for progressive causes earned him a spot on Nixon's infamous Enemies List. In 1982 he defeated Millicent Fenwick -- the pipe-smoking, progressive Republican who was the inspiration for the Doonesbury character Lacey Davenport -- and became a senator. In 1988 I served as Frank's press secretary. Few bosses were tougher. He was running for re-election against golden boy Pete Dawkins -- Heisman Trophy winner at West Point, Rhodes scholar, Vietnam vet, Army general, millionaire banker -- a man so handsome, he was a model in ads for men's shirts. Frank was not as glib as Dawkins, so I told the press, "Frank may not be a great communicator, but he's a great legislator." That did not go over well. "I am paying you to say good things about me," he thundered. "I can get people to criticize me for free!" Lautenberg: The last 'swamp dog' Frank was so cantankerous, so combative, that he often called his 1988 campaign manager, the great James Carville, "the second opponent." But he rose to the occasion, besting Dawkins in a debate and embracing the nickname Dawkins used to dismiss him: "swamp dog." From that day to the last time I saw him, I would always ask Frank how the old swamp dog was doing. He never lost his bite. As a senator, Lautenberg leaves an impressive legacy. The Lautenberg Amendment helped free Soviet Jews and is still used by oppressed people seeking freedom in America. If you enjoy flying smoke-free, you can thank Frank. Firefighters who now have a right to know the chemicals they face in a fire can thank Frank. Millions who ride Amtrak or use mass transit can thank Frank. If you believe working people deserve a higher minimum wage, you can thank Frank. All of us who support the U.S.-Israel relationship can thank Frank. His brother and sister veterans have lost a friend, and those who support gun safety legislation have lost a powerful ally. Me? I have lost an example of toughness and tenacity. In an age of blow-dried, prefab, Ken-doll politicians, Frank was the real deal: a hard-bitten, gut-punching, proudly liberal swamp dog.

chatgpt: Frank Lautenberg, a former United States Senator who died this week, was a man who rose to success from humble beginnings in a tough New Jersey town. He earned a reputation for toughness throughout his career, which helped him win numerous competitive elections. Democratic strategist Paul Begala highlighted Lautenberg's remarkable legacy in a recent interview. He pointed out that Lautenberg was instrumental in the passage of several key pieces of legislation during his long career in the Senate. One of his most important accomplishments, according to Begala, was an amendment that helped free Soviet Jews. Begala noted that Lautenberg's legacy has had a profound impact on American politics. His influence can be seen in a number of areas, including transportation policy, where he was a strong advocate for Amtrak. Begala also credits Lautenberg with helping to create a more healthy and comfortable environment for airline passengers by supporting the introduction of a smoking ban on planes. Another key issue that Lautenberg championed was the minimum wage. He believed strongly that workers deserved fair compensation for their labor and worked hard to ensure that the minimum wage was increased to a level that would provide a decent standard of living. Throughout his career, Lautenberg was widely respected for his intelligence, work ethic, and dedication to public service. He served five terms in the Senate and was the last surviving World War II veteran to serve in that body. In an era of political polarization and division, Lautenberg was a model of civility and bipartisanship. Despite his many accomplishments, however, Lautenberg was always grounded in his roots. He never forgot where he came from and worked hard to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, particularly those who faced barriers to success like he did growing up. In the end, Lautenberg's legacy is a testament to the power of perseverance, hard work, and a commitment to public service. He left an indelible mark on American politics, and his contributions will be remembered and celebrated for years to come. As Paul Begala noted, if you like Amtrak, no smoking on planes, and a higher minimum wage, you have Frank Lautenberg to thank. His legacy will endure as a shining example of what a life devoted to public service can achieve.
