But there is nothing delicate about this rampant houseplant now - after it has enjoyed a fantastic growth spurt every year for half a decade. Gloria Baptist-Smith was given this red Clivia - an African species of plant - as a present seven years ago. Huge: Gloria Baptist-Smith was shocked when her pot-plant shot up and began produced oversized blooms . Before: The plant started out being tiny enough to keep in a tea-cup, and would have been even smaller than this specimen (file photo) And for the first two, its blooms remained decidedly manageable as the houseplant unobtrusively stayed in its diminutive terracotta home. But five years ago the plant began enjoying phenomenal growth - and has to be contained by a huge plastic bucket after it shot up to be almost five feet tall. Huge: The blooms, which last for around three weeks, are astonishingly large . Ms Baptist-Smith, from Burgess Hill in West Sussex, was astonished by the progress her pot plant has made - especially as she confesses to being far from green-fingered. She said: 'I'm not terribly good with plants, and I didn't expect anything really to come of it. 'For a while it just seemed to be fine, then suddenly, over the last five years or so, it has grown almost a foot every year. 'The bright red blooms it produces are bigger than my head. It reminds me of a triffid - the blooms are just massive.' Clivia are a species native to South Africa and Swaziland. They are a popular houseplant which are - in general - easy to maintain. According to the Chicago Botanic Garden, if cared for correctly the plants will burst into colour right in the very depths of winter. However, the plants are slow to grow, and often take several years to lay their roots before they are capable of springing up as Ms Baptist-Smith's specimen appears to have done. It is not unusual for a Clivia to reach heights of two or three feet once fully mature.

chatgpt: Gloria Baptist-Smith, a resident of Luton, received a plant as a gift seven years ago. The plant, a Clivia, hardly grew for the first two years. However, two years later, the plant started to experience growth spurts. Following the growth spurts, the Clivia started to grow steadily every year. Gloria watched with amazement as the plant grew taller and taller, year after year, until it reached almost five feet in height. Speaking about the experience, Gloria said, "When I first received the Clivia, I thought it was just an ordinary plant. I never imagined that it would grow so tall and become such a beautiful addition to my home. Watching it grow over the years has been such a joy." Clivias are known for their vibrant orange flowers, which bloom in the winter and early spring. They are relatively slow-growing plants and can take several years to reach their full height. Experts say that the plant's growth pattern is not unusual. In fact, many plants experience slow growth during their early years before experiencing growth spurts later on. The key to promoting healthy growth is to ensure that the plant receives enough sunlight, water, and nutrients. For Gloria, seeing the Clivia thrive has been a rewarding experience. She has even started to share clippings of the plant with her friends and family. "I never imagined that the plant would bring me so much joy and happiness," she said. "It's a reminder that sometimes, the most beautiful things in life take time to grow and blossom." The Clivia plant serves as a testament of Gloria's patience and care as a gardener. The beauty of the plant is a clear indication that every living thing has its own pace of development and growth.
