Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez were in the thick of it as Arsenal's squad trained ahead of their crucial Champions League play-off against Turkish side Besiktas. Arsene Wenger's men drew 0-0 in Istanbul - the first time they have failed to win a Champions League play-off match.

chatgpt: Arsenal players including Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez were spotted on the training ground on Monday ahead of their Champions League play-off match against Besiktas on Wednesday. The Gunners will be looking to secure their passage to the group stages of the tournament after a nervy 1-0 victory over Newcastle United in their opening Premier League fixture. There was concern among the Arsenal faithful after Olivier Giroud was forced to pull out of the team's victory against Newcastle United with a foot injury. Although Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger downplayed the severity of the injury, he did admit that he may need to buy a new striker as cover for Giroud. "We cannot afford to be without a striker for too long," Wenger said at a press conference on Monday. The Gunners will be hoping to build on their impressive home record against Besiktas. Arsenal have won their last seven home games in the Champions League, a record that stretches back to 2013. However, they will need to be on top of their game against a Besiktas side that has already defeated Feyenoord and PAOK in the qualifying rounds. Arsenal fans will be looking to Ozil and Sanchez to provide the magic on Wednesday. The pair were instrumental in Arsenal's success last season, with Ozil providing a league-high 19 assists and Sanchez scoring 16 goals in his first season in the Premier League. Both players will be eager to make an impact in the Champions League after disappointing performances in last season's competition. The two sides have played each other twice in their history, with Arsenal winning both times. The last meeting between the two sides was in 2001, when Arsenal emerged victorious in a 4-1 victory. Arsenal are currently priced at 4/11 to win the match, with Besiktas at 7/1 to pull off an upset. The Gunners will be hoping to secure their passage to the group stages of the Champions League for the 17th consecutive season. Wednesday's match will take place at the Emirates Stadium in London, with kick-off at 7:45pm (BST). Arsenal fans are expected to pack the stadium in a bid to see their team progress to the next round of the competition. As the Gunners prepare for their Champions League play-off match against Besiktas, all eyes will be on Olivier Giroud's fitness and whether or not Arsene Wenger will enter the transfer market for a new striker. The stakes are high, but Arsenal fans will be hoping to see their team continue their impressive home form and secure a spot in the group stages of the competition.
