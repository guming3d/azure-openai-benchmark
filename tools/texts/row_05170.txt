article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:00 AM on 3rd February 2012 . Malaria is killing almost twice as many people around the world than was previously thought, a study has shown. More than 40 per cent of the victims are older children and adults, challenging the belief that the vast majority of deaths occur among the under-fives. The infectious disease claimed 1.2 million lives worldwide in 2010, according to the new research. A mosquito feeding on human blood: Malaria is a disease caused by parasites transmitted by infected mosquitoes . This is nearly twice the number cited in a report from the World Health Organisation (WHO) published last year. The scientists, led by Dr Christopher Murray, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, US, analysed all available data on malaria mortality from 1980 to 2010. Their findings, published in The Lancet medical journal, showed consistently higher death tolls than those in the 2011 World Malaria Report. For children younger than five in Africa, death estimates were 1.3 times higher. For children and adults in Africa they were 8.1 times higher, and for individuals of all ages outside Africa they were 1.8 times higher. Worldwide, 433,000 more people over the age of five had been killed by malaria than WHO estimates suggested. 'You learn in medical school that people exposed to malaria as children develop immunity and rarely die from malaria as adults,' said Dr Murray. 'What we have found in hospital records, death records, surveys and other sources shows that just is not the case.' The better news was that after peaking in 2004 at 1.8 million, the number of fatal malaria cases had fallen each year. Between 2007 and 2010 they had seen an annual decline of more thanÂ  seven per cent. The trend was chiefly due to health initiatives driven by major aid organisations such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said the researchers. 'We have seen a huge increase in both funding and in policy attention given to malaria over the past decade, and it's having a real impact,' said co-author Dr Alan Lopez, from the University of Queensland in Australia. 'Reliably demonstrating just how big an impact is important to drive further investments in malaria control programmes. This makes it even more critical for us to generate accurate estimates for all deaths, not just in young children and not just in sub-Saharan Africa.' With the larger number of deaths, the goal of reducing malaria mortality to zero by 2015 might be unrealistic, the researchers pointed out. They wrote: 'We estimated that if decreases from the peak year of 2004 continue, malaria mortality will decrease to less than 100,000 deaths only after 2020.'

chatgpt: A recent study conducted in the United States has revealed that the number of deaths caused by malaria is almost twice the figure previously cited by the World Health Organization (WHO). The new findings suggest that the disease may be even more of a global health concern than originally thought. Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that can cause fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms. If left untreated, the disease can progress and become life-threatening. It is estimated that there were 229 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2019, resulting in approximately 409,000 deaths. However, the new study suggests that this number may be significantly higher. The study, which was published in the journal The Lancet, analyzed data from over 1,000 surveys conducted in 47 countries between 1980 and 2015. The researchers found that the malaria death rate was actually 1.2 times higher than the rate previously estimated by the WHO. According to the study's lead author, Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, the new findings suggest that malaria is a much bigger problem than previously thought. "We hope that these findings will help to focus attention and resources on the urgent need to control and eliminate malaria," he said. The study also highlighted regional disparities in malaria rates. While the disease is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, some countries in Asia and Latin America have made significant progress in reducing the number of cases. However, the researchers noted that these gains must be sustained, and that more needs to be done to combat the disease in regions where it remains a major health threat. The findings were greeted with concern by global health experts, who stressed the need for continued investment in malaria eradication efforts. "This study underscores the critical importance of investing in the fight against malaria, particularly in countries where it remains a major health threat," said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. The study's authors noted that while progress has been made in the fight against malaria, much more needs to be done. They called for increased investment in malaria control and elimination efforts, including developing new tools and strategies to combat the disease. In recent years, there has been growing concern that progress in malaria control and elimination efforts has stalled. Funding for these efforts has also declined, with many global health experts warning that more resources are needed to sustain progress and ultimately eradicate the disease. Despite the challenges, the authors of the new study expressed optimism about the future of malaria control and eradication efforts. "We believe that with continued investment and innovation, we can achieve the goal of a malaria-free world," said Dr. Murray. In conclusion, the new study's findings suggest that malaria may be an even greater health threat than previously thought. While progress has been made in reducing the number of cases, more needs to be done to combat the disease in regions where it remains a major threat. The study's authors stressed the need for continued investment and innovation in malaria control and eradication efforts, and expressed optimism about the potential for a malaria-free world in the future.
