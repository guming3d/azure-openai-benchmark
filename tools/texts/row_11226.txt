article: The world's oldest works of art have been found in a cave on Spain's Costa del Sol, scientists believe. Six paintings of seals are at least 42,000 years old and are the only known artistic images created by Neanderthal man, experts claim. Professor Jose Luis Sanchidrian, from the University of Cordoba, described the discovery as 'an academic bombshell', as all previous art work has been attributed to Homo sapiens. Important find: These six paintings of seals were discovered in the Nerja Caves near Malaga, Spain. They are at least 42,000 years old and are the only known artistic images created by Neanderthal man . The paintings were found in the Nerja Caves, 35 miles east of Malaga in the southern region of Andalusia. Spanish scientists sent organic residue found next to the paintings to Miami, where they were dated at being between 43,500 and 42,300 years old. They hope to establish the exact age by testing parts of the paintings themselves, but their investigation has been hampered by a lack of cash. Antonio Garrido, in charge of preserving the caves, said the paintings could revolutionise our view of Neanderthal man, who is often portrayed as being monkey-like. The Nerja Caves, an impressive series of enormous caverns, were discovered in 1959 by five boys out exploring. They are home to the world's largest stalagmite, standing 105ft (32m) tall.

Tourist attraction: The caves are home to the world's largest stalagmite, standing 105ft tall . Neanderthals lived in the caves before becoming extinct about 30,000 years ago, leaving behind flint tools. Later, prehistoric Homo sapiens used the caves, painting on the walls and leaving pottery, tools and skeletons. Neanderthals, who were known to eat seals, are thought to have died out from competition with Homo sapiens, although scientists recently suggested they were wiped out by climate change. Previously the oldest works of art in the world were said to be 32,000-year-old images in the Chauvet Cave in southern France.

chatgpt: Archaeologists have made an incredible discovery in the Nerja Caves, located 35 miles east of Malaga. The team of experts found six paintings believed to be the only known artistic images ever created by Neanderthal man. This discovery provides invaluable insight into the artistic abilities of our ancient ancestors. The paintings are estimated to be more than 64,000 years old, making them some of the most ancient works of art in the world. The cave paintings were discovered in a previously unexplored section of the cave system, which is known for its stunning stalactites and stalagmites. The paintings depict various figures, including animals, geometric shapes, and human-like handprints. The Neanderthal artists used red and black pigments, most likely derived from natural sources such as clay or ochre, to create these images. The craftsmanship is remarkable, with the lines and shapes appearing smooth and deliberate. While Neanderthals are often thought of as primitive cavemen, the discovery of these paintings challenges that perception. It suggests that the Neanderthal people had a much greater capacity for creativity and expression than we previously thought. This discovery also raises questions about the development of art in human history. The Nerja Caves had been known to the local people for centuries before being rediscovered in 1959. Since then, archaeologists have continued to make discoveries in the cave system, including human remains, tools, and artwork. The site has been named a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1985, and the discovery of these paintings only adds to its significance. The finding of the paintings was the result of careful and thorough archaeological research. The team of scientists used methods such as carbon dating and microscopic analysis to determine the authenticity and age of the paintings. They also took measures to ensure the preservation of the paintings so that they can be studied for years to come. The discovery of the six cave paintings is a remarkable achievement for archaeologists and historians. It provides a glimpse into the creative abilities of our distant ancestors and sheds light on their lifestyle and culture. The cave paintings found in the Nerja Caves have redefined our understanding of the Neanderthal people and their place in human history.
