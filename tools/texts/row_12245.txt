The carrier is reportedly refusing to honour the original business class bookings for around 900 customers - even though travel agents claim the carrier is responsible for the error.

chatgpt: Singapore Airlines has been facing issues recently after they erroneously marked down fares for premium class seats. The airline puts the blame on a technical glitch in their online booking system which allowed customers to purchase seats for an incredibly low price. The issue affected a limited number of routes including flights from Singapore to Manchester, Paris, and Zurich.  According to a statement released by Singapore Airlines, the issue was caused by a "temporary software glitch" which saw the fares for premium economy class seats sold at the rate of an economy class ticket. Unfortunately, this was only discovered after almost 900 customers had purchased the wrong class of tickets.  The airline has since reached out to affected customers and offered two options: pay the difference between the premium economy class ticket and the economy class ticket or opt for a full refund. For those that opt to pay the difference, they will be able to keep their premium economy class tickets. However, if customers refuse to pay, they must rebook their flights in the economy class or seek a full refund.  This technical issue affected several Singapore Airlines' flights over the weekend and some passengers took to social media to complain about the airline's handling of the situation. One Twitter user said, "Just got a call from @SingaporeAir saying that the economy tix I bought online were cancelled. They were giving away biz tix for SGD400 ($295). Great deal except that I have a useless flight now."  Singapore Airlines has acknowledged that the situation has caused inconvenience to affected passengers and apologized for the error. The airline has also taken necessary steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.  For frequent flyers of Singapore Airlines, this specific incident is unusual. The airline is known for its rigorous systems and procedures that ensure minimal disruptions to its operations. However, with the rise of global travel and increased reliance on technology, technical glitches are bound to occur. In this case, Singapore Airlines acted quickly to address the issue and offer affected customers reasonable solutions to their travel plans.  In summary, a temporary software glitch saw customers purchasing spectacularly cheap fares for premium economy class seats. Despite the airline's swift action and apologies, some passengers were still inconvenienced by their travel plans being cancelled. For the 900 who were affected, the airline has offered two options - pay the difference between the two tickets or opts for a full refund.
