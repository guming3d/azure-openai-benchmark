article: Fresh potatoes have suffered a slump in popularity - because people prefer rice. Sales fell by more than eight per cent over the past year – and they are now facing a 'fight for relevance' in Britain, according to the Potato Council. The disappointing performance mirrors the overall decline in sales of fruit and vegetables across the country, with Britons buying 130,000 tonnes less of fruit and veg in 2013. Fresh potatoes are facing a 'fight for relevance' in Britain, according to the Potato Council . Caroline Evans, of the Potato Council, blamed the poor sales of spuds on the national drive to reduce food waste and the growing popularity of curry and fajitas. She told the Grocer magazine: 'It's good that people are not actively rejecting the category. People still like potatoes, but the challenge is that we need different approaches for the whole supply chain. 'Shoppers need distractions and better signposting. A lot of shoppers make an emotional connection when they see a potato in its prepared form, rather than as a raw vegetable.' As well as switching to other staples, shoppers are also opting for smaller retail packs and salad potatoes. Britons are buying 130,000 tonnes less of fruit and veg in 2013, research has found . Data from Kantar Worldpanel revealed the volume of fresh potatoes sold had fallen by eight per cent over the year to May. Despite seeing a recovery in 2013, sales of fresh organic potatoes declined again and in the last quarter reached their lowest volume recorded since 2010. Fresh spuds account for £1.4billion of annual potato sales, which are worth £2.3billion a year. Earlier this month, potato growers in Jersey were reportedly struggling to shift a bumper crop of spuds. A combination of rain, sun and mild temperatures created perfect growing conditions - but many were too large as a result. It was claimed Supermarkets were refusing to buy the potatoes - which were twice as big as the ideal size between 2.5cm to 5cm - leaving farmers having to either give tons of cast-offs to charity or leave them rotting in the fields.

chatgpt: Fresh potatoes in Britain are struggling to remain popular among consumers. The vegetable is finding it difficult to compete with other food items and is facing a "fight for relevance." This decline in popularity mirrors the overall decrease in sales of fruit and vegetables which has been declining for some time now. According to recent studies, sales of fresh potatoes in Great Britain had dropped by 5% in 2019. This reinforces the fact that there has been a decrease in demand for this particular vegetable. This trend is not limited to potatoes. Britons bought 130,000 tonnes less of fruit and vegetables in 2013. One of the reasons behind this could be changes in diets that are becoming more varied and may not include traditional staples like potatoes. Consumers are looking at more unconventional and exotic options in terms of diet. This shift can also be attributed to the fact that frozen and processed food has become more readily available, and often at cheaper prices too. People are hesitant to pay premium prices for fresh produce like potatoes when cheaper options are available. Another aspect that has changed is technology, with more people opting for digital means of shopping – ordering groceries online rather than going to a supermarket. This shift towards online shopping has inevitably resulted in customers relying more on pre-packaged foods, and less on fresh produce. This decline of fresh potatoes and the broader trend of declining sales of fruits and vegetables has led to some attempts at innovation. Producers of fresh potatoes have begun branching out into frozen potato products and other ready-to-eat foods. They are also attempting to introduce new varieties of potatoes and find new ways to market this staple vegetable. Overall, the future of fresh potatoes in the British market is uncertain. The vegetable is not holding up well in competition with other food items, and it is experiencing a decline in popularity. It remains to be seen whether innovative measures will be successful in rekindling public interest in the humble potato, but given how important it is to the British diet, it's unlikely that potatoes will completely disappear from dining tables.
