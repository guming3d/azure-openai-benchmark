The series of children's books is the favourite of parents in Britain, a poll has found . It may be 70 years since they first appeared, but Enid Blyton’s Famous Five novels remain the books most favoured by parents for their children, a poll reveals. The adventures of Julian, Dick, Anne, George and Timmy the dog topped a survey in which parents were asked to name their favourite children’s books. Two other series by Blyton, the Secret Seven and Malory Towers, also made the top five, confirming her status as the nation’s best-loved children’s author. Among children, however, JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series emerged as the favourite. The survey, carried out to mark World Book Day today, suggested that children's book tastes are inherited from their parents since choices were similar across both top 10 charts. Adventure tales, such as Treasure Island, the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Blyton's 21-book series, first published in 1942, were popular among both audiences. Despite the recent popularity of futuristic titles such as the Hunger Games, the science fiction genre failed to make an impact on the children's list. Instead, classics such as Thomas the Tank Engine, the Mr Men and Little Miss books and the Gruffalo featured strongly in their top 10. Authors appearing in both sets of results were Blyton, whose Famous Five tales came fourth on the children's list, as well as Roald Dahl and CS Lewis. The poll also showed that more than three quarters of children would choose the paper version of a book over an e-book or tablet. Among children dressing up for World Book Day, The Boy Who Lived emerged as the most popular character for children to go as. Along with Harry Potter, other popular costume choices for the day were Horrid Henry, Where's Wally and Cinderella. A scene from one of the Harry Potter films: JK Rowling's series about a boy wizard was the children's favourite . The poll, by Asda, questioned 1,747 parents including 1,000 with children under 13. They answered on their children's behalf. Hayley Whittaker, Asda's childrens' books buyer, said: 'Even though hundreds of new children's titles are released every week, parents and kids alike are united in their love of classic childhood literature, with their humour and adventure proving relevant across generations. 'It's clear to see that kids still think nothing beats the feeling of having a real book in their hands.' There was less positive news about children's reading habits in a separate poll, also released today. Significant numbers of youngsters are unaware that popular characters from films and TV programmes actually originated in books. According to a survey of 500 eight to 13-year-olds, 40 per cent are unaware that Harry Potter started life in a book, and even more - 42 per cent - didn't know Winnie the Pooh is a literary character.
