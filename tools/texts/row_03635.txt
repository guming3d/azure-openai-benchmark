article: (CNN) -- "The Simpsons" co-creator Sam Simon is facing terminal illness the best way he knows how: with a sense of humor and a generous heart. It was two years ago that Simon, 59, was told that he had colon cancer and had just three to six months to live. "They showed me my scans and said, these are the scans of a dead man," Simon recalled in an interview with NBC's Maria Shriver. "I said, 'Is it curable?' And the doctor goes, 'We don't use that word.' " Though his doctor couldn't cure him, he could work to keep Simon alive. "And he's done a remarkable job of it," Simon said. "I feel great. I've never been happier." Some of that happiness comes from being "surrounded by people that love me and take care of me and would do anything for me," Simon said. "That's called happiness." But part of his peace comes from his philanthropy. When Simon learned of his diagnosis, he made a promise to give away his fortune. He never did say how much he's made over his many years in Hollywood, working on "The Simpsons" in addition to hits like "Taxi" and "Cheers." But what is clear is that however much he has, he wants it to go toward animal welfare and to feed the hungry. "Ingrid Newkirk, who is the founder of PETA and one of the most influential people in my life ... she came up with an almost therapy for me, where we planned and are still planning a series of animal liberations and actions that I get to participate in and enjoy and have something to look forward to at the same time," Simon said. There's also his philanthropic organization, the Sam Simon Foundation, which aids animals and has a "feeding families program that feeds 400 families a day in Los Angeles." His passion for these causes comes from a responsibility he feels, Simon explained, "to speak for those who can't speak for themselves." Simon was honest about how difficult his diagnosis has been -- "cancer is a horrible disease, (and) I am struggling with it," he told Shriver -- but he added that it's also been a lesson. "It has been a fight; it's been an adventure; it's been an education," Simon said. "It's been the most amazing experience of my life."

chatgpt: The co-creator of the iconic TV show "The Simpsons", Sam Simon, was given a devastating diagnosis in 2012 when he was told he had only three to six months to live. However, he refused to give up and has been fighting cancer ever since. Despite the physical toll, Simon has remained active in charitable causes and advocating for animal rights. In an interview with Maria Shriver, he opened up about how cancer has actually been a learning experience for him. "Cancer has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I've made amazing connections with people," he said. "I've got this diagnosis and I've got nothing but love and support from everybody, everywhere, all over the world. It's overwhelming." Simon has used his resources to give back to those in need. He donated millions of dollars to various charities, including Save the Children and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which aims to protect marine wildlife. He also created The Sam Simon Foundation, a non-profit organization that rescues and trains dogs to become service animals for veterans and people with disabilities. His dedication to philanthropy has not gone unnoticed, as he was honored with a lifetime achievement award at the Genesis Awards in 2014 for his animal rights work. Simon's battle with cancer has not been easy, but he takes it one day at a time, continuing to inspire others with his resilience and philanthropic efforts. "I just have to get up every day and fight it, and just keep moving forward, and just take whatever happens," he said. "I don't focus on when the end is. I don't know when the end is. Nobody knows. But I know it's coming. So, I just try to enjoy every moment that I have." Simon's positive attitude and dedication to giving back serve as a powerful reminder to cherish the present and make a difference in the world, no matter the circumstances.
