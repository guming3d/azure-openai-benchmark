article: The family of a pedestrian who was mowed down and killed by a 91-year-old has questioned why the elderly man was allowed behind the wheel. Brenda Forster, 89, was hit by Thomas Craig's car at a pedestrian crossing after he failed to notice a red light. The retired taxi driver was handed a suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving in the accident in June last year. The family of a pedestrian who was mowed down and killed by a 91-year-old has questioned why the elderly man was allowed behind the wheel . Miss Forster's daughter said in a statement read out at North Tyneside magistrates' court: 'I feel angry that someone of 91 was still driving, but feel I can't criticise too much because my mum was still driving at 89, albeit against my wishes.' She added: 'I do feel very sorry for the driver and think about how he must be feeling. I would not want him to suffer – I just want his licence taken away from him so he can't drive again.' Motorists over the age of 70 must reapply for a licence every three years, but there is no medical examination required. Instead, applicants are asked to declare medical conditions and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency may request more information. The court heard Craig does not intend to apply for a licence again. The DVLA claims there is no evidence older motorists cause more accidents. Brenda Forster, 89, was hit by Thomas Craig's car at a pedestrian crossing after he failed to notice a red light . But the case follows a warning last month from Judge Stephen Holt who told elderly drivers to 'face up to facts' if they are no longer safe on the roads. He was sentencing a woman of 84 who killed an 80-year-old man in a head-on crash. Helen Harrison, prosecuting, said Ms Forster had been on her way to some local shops at the time. She said: 'The collision occurred at a pedestrian crossing, fitted with pedestrian-operated traffic signals. There is also zig-zag markings on the approaches from both sides. 'The deceased spoke to her daughter on the phone from her home address at 10am. 'Her daughter said it was a normal conversation and there were no issues or concerns but it was not known what her intentions were for later in the day. 'Just prior to the collision, Ms Forster parked her car on Armstrong Drive, outside the local shops. 'She walked the short distance to a nearby pedestrian crossing where she pressed the button for the traffic lights. 'She paused at the curb edge before attempting to cross the road in a normal or safe manner.'

chatgpt: A 91-year-old retired taxi driver, Thomas Craig, was handed a suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to causing the death of an elderly lady. Brenda Forster, 89, was killed as she walked over a pedestrian crossing in a tragic accident. According to witnesses, Craig drove through a red light and knocked over Forster. She was rushed to a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. Craig was arrested at the scene and charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Appearing in court, Craig pleaded guilty to the charge and expressed his deep remorse and regret for what had happened. The judge acknowledged that Craig had an otherwise clean driving record and posed no danger to the public. However, he also stressed that driving requires a high level of responsibility and that the consequences of negligence could be severe. Miss Forster's daughter, who was present in court, expressed her anger that Craig was still driving at his age. She urged the government to introduce stricter laws to ensure that elderly drivers undergo regular medical check-ups and tests to determine their fitness to drive. The case has once again raised concerns about the safety of elderly drivers. In recent years, there have been numerous incidents of elderly drivers causing accidents due to poor eyesight, reduced reflexes, and other age-related health issues. To address these concerns, some have called for stricter legislation to limit the driving rights of elderly citizens. However, others argue that such measures would be discriminatory and that everyone should be judged on their individual ability to drive. In the wake of this tragedy, it is clear that there are no easy solutions to this complex problem. However, one thing is certain - all drivers, regardless of their age, must take responsibility for their actions on the road. The consequences of negligence can be severe, as demonstrated by the tragic death of Brenda Forster.
