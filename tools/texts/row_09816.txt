article: (CNN)  -- South Korean star Park Ji-sung has signed a two-year contract extension at English Premier League champions Manchester United. The 28-year-old Park has been handed a contract extension at Manchester United. The attacking midfielder is now tied to Old Trafford until 2012 as reward for his dogged displays for United since joining from PSV Eindhoven in 2005. "I am so pleased to have a new contract," Park told www.manutd.com. "We have achieved great success over the last four years and won many trophies." Park has had to work hard to establish himself as a regular member of United's starting line-up and was devastated to be left out of the squad for their 2008 Champions League final success against Chelsea. But last season he was a key figure as United completed a hat-trick of Premier League titles. Park also gained selection for the Champions League final against Barcelona, becoming the first player from Asia to play in the European club showpiece. His popularity in his home region is undoubted and United have been able to capitalize with two highly-profitable visits to the continent with Park a key draw. Park, who will be a driving force in South Korea's World Cup challenge in South Africa next year, has played 127 times for United, scoring 12 goals. "We are always pleased to secure the future of our star players and Ji-Sung has proved himself to be a fantastic professional as well as an important versatile player in our squad," said manager Alex Ferguson. Park has been rewarded with an improved deal worth a reported $5.9 million per year.
