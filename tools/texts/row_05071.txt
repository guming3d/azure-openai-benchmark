An iconic British manufacturing giant that dates back to 1887 has been sold to an American investor. A majority share in bread and flour firm Hovis, which is best known for its nostalgic advert featuring a boy pushing a bicycle up a hill, has been sold by cash-strapped Premier Foods to US investment firm The Gores Group for £30million. The move safeguard's the future of the firm, which has spent the past six years selling off assets, but it is a blow to British manufacturing, which has lost several iconic brands to overseas investors recently. Scroll down for video . Hovis, the iconic British bread manufacturer dating back more than 125 years, has been sold to US investors . In 2010 chocolate producer Cadbury was sold to American giant Kraft Foods for £12billion, and last year Weetabix was sold to China's state-owned Bright Foods for £1.2billion. Hovis' previous parent firm, Premier Foods, which employs around 9,000 staff in the UK, has sold a 51 per cent stake in Hovis to the Americans, and will keep the rest. Despite having spent the past six years selling off assets, Premier still has a pension deficit and debt pile of £1.3billion, but bosses there say the deal is good news for the business. Premier chief executive officer Gavin Darby said today: 'We believe it's a win-win for both halves of our business. They say the cash injection for Hovis will be reinvested in its grocery brands including Mr Kipling cakes. Premier plans to invest about £20million in a new line for Snack Pack cake slices at a factory in Carlton, Barnsley. The two parties are locked into the venture for at least three years. The iconic British bread brand is best known for its Ridley Scott-directed advertisement, Boy on the Bike . Hovis - the name comes from the Latin 'hominis vis', meaning strength of a man, began in the late 1880s when Richard Smith found a way to cook bread with its wheatgerm without losing any of its nutritional value. He teamed up with Macclesfield miller Thomas Fitton, and in 1887 they registered Smith's Patent Process Germ Flour. The name was deemed too much of a mouthful, so in 1890 they staged a national competition to come up with a name.  A man named Herbert Grime suggested the winning name, Hovis, and the bakers not only gave him his £25 prize but also gave his wife an annual pension after Mr Grime's death. By 1895 sales of Hovis had exceeded one million loaves per week, and the firm's sales were boosted further when, in 1924, scientists discovered that there was Vitamin B in wheatgerm. In 1973, an advertisement for the bread directed by Oscar-winning film director, Ridley Scott, boosted the bread firm's fortunes further.  The 'boy on the bike' advertisment, featuring a small boy pushing a bike up a cobbled hill in Dorset, was later voted Britain's favourite television advert.

chatgpt: Hovis, the iconic British bread producer that has been in operation since 1887, has witnessed a change of ownership as The Gores Group, a US private equity firm, has acquired a 51 per cent stake in the company. The previous owner, Premier Foods, will retain a 49 per cent stake in the business. This move comes as part of Premier Foods' strategic plan to focus on its core grocery business, which includes well-known brands like Mr. Kipling and Oxo. Following the transaction, Premier Foods aims to use the proceeds to pay down debt and invest in the growth of its other businesses. Hovis is a highly recognized brand in Britain, with a long-standing history, and is known for its distinctive orange packaging. The bread maker also has a highly recognizable slogan – "As good today as it's always been" - which has been in use since the 1970s. However, the acquisition of Hovis is not without controversy, as it is the latest British food brand to be sold to foreign investors recently. The sale of Hovis follows other high-profile deals, including the acquisition of Cadbury by Kraft Foods in 2010 and the purchase of Weetabix by Chinese firm Bright Food in 2012. While some critics have raised concerns over the loss of British companies to foreign investors, others suggest that such deals are beneficial for the UK economy, as they can provide access to new markets and stimulate growth and innovation. "We are excited to partner with Premier Foods and support the management's plan to grow the business," said Alec Gores, Founder and CEO of The Gores Group. "Hovis is an iconic brand, and we believe it has significant potential for growth." The Gores Group is a global investment firm with a portfolio of companies across a range of sectors, including technology, healthcare, and manufacturing. The acquisition of Hovis marks its first investment in the UK's food and beverage sector. Premier Foods CEO, Alex Whitehouse, stressed that the deal would provide a significant boost for Hovis and enable it to reach new consumers and markets. "The partnership with The Gores Group is a strong endorsement of our strategic plans for Hovis, and testament to the dedication and professionalism of our colleagues in the business," he said. The bread market in the UK is highly competitive, with several major players, including Warburtons, Kingsmill, and Allinson's. Hovis currently holds around 13% of the UK's bread market share, with its most popular products including its iconic sliced loaf, wholemeal bread, and seeded batch bread. Despite its longstanding history, Hovis's sales have fluctuated in recent years, with the company facing challenges from changing consumer tastes and rising competition in the market. However, the acquisition by The Gores Group is expected to provide a boost for the company, enabling it to invest in new products, expand its distribution channels, and secure its position as a leading player in the UK bread market. The acquisition of Hovis by The Gores Group marks an exciting time for the historic bread producer. With a solid strategy in place, the brand is poised to move forward under new ownership and continue to be a major player in the UK's bread market for years to come.
