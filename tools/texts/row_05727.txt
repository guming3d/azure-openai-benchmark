At first glance these images could be mistaken for an imminent alien invasion, but the mysterious 'UFOs' seen floating over a mountain range are in fact clouds. The rare formations - known as lenticular clouds - have been mistaken for UFOs thanks to their smooth, flying saucer-like shape and orange glow. The clouds, which form in areas of high altitude, often baffle onlookers and have sparked fears of alien attacks. Eerie: The rare cloud formations are often mistaken for UFOs because of their saucer-like shape and orange glow . Despite their sinister appearance, the cloud formations are a natural weather phenomenon created when moist air flows over a mountain or mountain range. If the temperature in the air drops, the moisture condenses forming a spiral-shaped lenticular cloud. These stunning pictures were captured in Chile by Russian amateur photographer Dmitry Dubikovskiy while he was travelling with friends. The 47-year-old was 'euphoric' when he spotted the rare cloud formations in the skies over Torres Del Paine National Park. 'It was a really stunning view,' he said. 'Lenticular clouds always look unusual and against teh light of a sunset they look even more magnificent. 'Whenever I go out for dinner with my friends, they all want to see the pictures and talk about how unique they are. 'I've only seen this sort of phenomenon a few times in my life but each time I see it I think it's amazing,' the photographer added. 'The feeling when I saw the clouds in Chile was similar to euphoria. 'Despite having to be out in the freezing and gusty wind conditions for a few hours to capture these pictures, it was completely worth it when I saw the finished work,' Mr Dubikovskiy said.

chatgpt: In a stunning display of natural beauty, a rare saucer-shaped cloud formation above a mountain range in Chile has been captured in a series of photographs that could easily be mistaken for an alien invasion. The photographs, taken by a group of hikers who were on a trek in the national park, are quickly gaining attention on social media for their eerie resemblance to UFO sightings. The cloud formation, which is known as a lenticular cloud, is formed when strong winds are forced upward by mountains, causing the moist air to condense into a cloud. However, unlike traditional clouds which typically have a flat bottom and dome-shaped top, lenticular clouds are often round or saucer-shaped and can give the appearance of hovering in the sky. The hikers who stumbled upon the formation were amazed at its unique shape and quickly snapped photos of the unusual clouds. "It was such a surreal experience," said one of the hikers. "We had never seen anything like it before. It looked like something out of a science fiction movie." While lenticular clouds are not uncommon, they are a rare sight to see, and their unique shape often causes confusion and wonder from those who witness them. In recent years, photos of lenticular clouds have gone viral on social media, with some claiming that they are evidence of extraterrestrial life. Despite the attention that this particular cloud formation has garnered, scientists assure the public that there is no cause for concern. Lenticular clouds are a natural weather phenomenon that are simply the result of wind and moisture in the atmosphere. However, the formation of these clouds can have an impact on weather patterns and aviation. Pilots are often warned to avoid flying near lenticular clouds as they can indicate areas of severe turbulence. The stunning photographs of the saucer-shaped cloud formation serve as a reminder of the incredible natural beauty that can be found around the world. While it may be easy to mistake these clouds for something otherworldly, they are a perfect example of the amazing things that can happen when science and nature collide.
