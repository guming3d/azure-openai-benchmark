chatgpt: Manchester United have announced their acquisition of Argentinian defender Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon. As part of the deal, Portuguese winger Nani will be moving back to his old club. The 27-year-old had fallen out of favour at Old Trafford and struggled to make an impact last season, scoring just one goal during the entire campaign. Nani joined Manchester United in 2007, after being signed by former manager Sir Alex Ferguson from Sporting Lisbon. He quickly became a fan favourite with his electrifying pace and skill on the ball. He was an important part of the squad that won the Premier League three times and the Champions League once under the guidance of Ferguson. However, in recent years, Nani has struggled to replicate the form that made him such a valuable asset to United. He was plagued by injuries and inconsistent performances, which led to him falling down the pecking order in the squad. With the arrival of new manager Louis van Gaal, it seemed increasingly unlikely that Nani would feature prominently in United's plans for the upcoming season. The move to Sporting Lisbon offers Nani the chance to revive his career and rediscover the form that made him such a sought-after player. He will be able to play regular first-team football and hopefully get back to the level that made him a top-class winger. For United, the signing of Rojo is seen as a shrewd move. The 24-year-old is a versatile defender who can play anywhere across the back line. He impressed for Argentina in the recent World Cup, helping his country reach the final, and he will add much-needed depth and quality to United's defence. Rojo is relishing the challenge of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. "It is a dream to play for Manchester United and I am excited about the prospect of playing in the Premier League," he said. The signing of Rojo and the departure of Nani is just the latest chapter in what has been a busy summer for United. They have already signed Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw, and are still on the lookout for further reinforcements before the transfer window closes. It remains to be seen whether Nani will be able to rediscover his best form at Sporting Lisbon, but the move offers him the chance to become a key player once again. For United, the signing of Rojo represents a statement of intent as they look to challenge for the Premier League title this season.
