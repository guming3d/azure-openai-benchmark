article: (CNN)Another of the dogs rescued in 2007 from NFL star Michael Vick's dog-fighting compound has died after spending her final years in an adoptive household in suburban Richmond, Virginia. Gracie, a black pit bull, died Monday morning, according to Amy McCracken, executive director of the Richmond Animal League. "This morning, little, old, bow-legged Gracie passed away and got her angel wings. Any words we write here could never begin to express the profound, positive and lasting impact that this little, black pit bull had on so many people who encountered her or heard the story of her suffering and triumph," said a post on the animal's league's "Gracie's Guardians" Facebook page. "We are and will be forever grateful for this little, broken black dog and everything she personified." The dog arrived at the Richmond no-kill shelter in 2007 and was quickly adopted by the group's board president, Sharon Cornett, who renamed her Gracie. "She had been used (at the Vick compound) as a breeding dog ... not as a fighter," McCracken told CNN. "She was in pretty good shape when she got here." According to McCracken, Gracie attended conferences and meetings about animal welfare and visited schools to show people they have nothing to fear from most pit bulls. "Gracie was very, very friendly," said McCracken, who estimated Gracie was 12 or 13 years old. "She loved people and was never aggressive to other dogs." Gracie was one of some 50 pit bulls seized by authorities in April 2007 amid charges that Vick, then a quarterback with the Atlanta Falcons, was operating an illegal dog-fighting ring on his Virginia property. The case sparked an outcry over brutal treatment of the dogs, some of which showed signs of injuries and other abuse. A federal judge determined the fate of Gracie and the other surviving dogs, who were taken in by animal sanctuaries, shelters, foster homes and adopters throughout the country. Twenty-two of the dogs were sent for rehabilitation and long-term care at Best Friends Animal Society's sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, while another large group went to a San Francisco pet shelter. One, named Georgia, made an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show before dying in 2013. Another, Hector, became a therapy dog and died of cancer in October. Vick pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges involving illegal dog fighting and spent 18 months in prison before resuming his NFL career. Created by the Richmond animal shelter, Gracie's Guardians is an initiative dedicated to the welfare of pit bulls, which have attracted controversy because of isolated attacks on humans and the breed's ties to dog fighting. The group chose Gracie as their namesake "in tribute to her perseverance and that of countless other pit bulls who have suffered or continue to suffer at the hands of people, yet whose spirits and love for humans remains untarnished."

chatgpt: Gracie the pit bull, who was known for becoming somewhat of a goodwill ambassador for her breed, spent her final years in Richmond, Virginia with her adoptive household. Despite her bow-legged appearance, Gracie truly epitomized the gentle nature and loyalty that pit bulls are known for. Born in 2005, Gracie spent her early years living in a kennel with her siblings before being adopted by her first family. Unfortunately, her first family was not equipped to care for Gracie and she was eventually surrendered to a shelter where she awaited her next chance for a forever home. Thankfully, in 2010, Gracie was adopted by a loving family in Richmond, Virginia. From that moment on, Gracie was a beloved member of her household and quickly began to work her magic as a goodwill ambassador for pit bulls. Despite her initial shyness, Gracie eventually warmed up to strangers and loved nothing more than receiving attention and affection from anyone she encountered. Her adoptive family described her as a gentle giant who had a way of putting anyone at ease. Gracie's gentle and loving nature made her the perfect candidate to dispel the negative stereotypes that pit bulls often face. Her charming personality was infectious and quickly won over the hearts of everyone she met. As Gracie's popularity grew, she began to play an even more significant role in changing the public perception of pit bulls. Her adoptive family often brought her to events and public places where people could meet her and see firsthand that pit bulls are not the vicious creatures that some people believe them to be. Throughout her final years, Gracie continued to shine as a goodwill ambassador for pit bulls. Her impact was felt not just by her adoptive family, but by everyone who met her and was able to see the true nature of this breed. Tragically, in 2015 Gracie passed away. Although her time on earth was fleeting, her legacy lives on as a reminder that pit bulls are capable of being amazing family pets when given the chance to thrive in a loving and caring environment.  Gracie will forever be remembered as a true ambassador for her breed and a reminder that love and kindness can go a long way in changing hearts and minds.
