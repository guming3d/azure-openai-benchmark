article: By . Reuters Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:46 EST, 8 February 2012 . Birth and abortion rates among U.S. teens fell to record lows in 2008 as increased use of contraceptives sent the overall teen pregnancy rate to its lowest level since at least 1972, a study showed today. But disparities among racial and ethnic groups continued to persist, with black and Hispanic teens experiencing pregnancy and abortion rates two to four times higher than their white peers, the Guttmacher Institute, the nonprofit sexual health research group that conducted the analysis, said. The Guttmacher researchers looked at government statistics on teenage sex, pregnancies and births, as well as the institute's own data on abortions for 2008, the most recent year the numbers were available. Historic low: Birth and abortion rates among American teens has fallen to record lows . They found that nearly 750,000 women under age of 20 were pregnant in 2008 - nearly 98 per cent of them between the ages of 15 and 19. That translated into a pregnancy rate of 67.8 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19, the researchers said, the lowest pregnancy rate seen since 1972, the year before the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade that established a woman's right to an abortion. It was also down 42 percent from 1990, when teen pregnancies in the U.S. peaked at 116.9 per 1,000 teen girls and women. The teen abortion rate in 2008 dropped to the lowest rate seen since 1972 at 17.8 per 1,000 teen girls and women, the analysis found, and was down 59 per cent from 1988 when the abortion rate peaked at 43.5 per 1,000 teen women.

The Guttmacher researchers said the decline in teen birthrates was largely attributable to increased contraceptive use by teens of both genders. 'Teens are also using more effective forms of contraception,' said Kathryn Kost, a demographer with the Guttmacher Institute who co-authored the analysis. Among women aged 15 to 17, about a quarter of the long-term decline in pregnancies, births and abortions could be attributable to reduced sexual activity, the researchers said. But pregnancy, birth and abortion rates remained much higher for teens who belonged to minority groups, even though their overall rates have fallen over the past four decades. Debate: The newest figures show the lowest pregnancy rate since 1972, the year before Roe v. Wade established a woman's right to an abortion . Birth rates for black and Hispanic teens were more than twice those of their white peers in 2008, the researchers found. The abortion rate among black teens, meanwhile, was four times higher than the rate for their Caucasian counterparts. Abortion rates for Hispanic teens were twice as high as for their white peers. The Guttmacher study was funded with grants from The California Wellness Foundation, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Ford Foundation.

chatgpt: According to new findings released by the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank dedicated to promoting reproductive health research and policy, the rate of abortions in America has hit an all-time low since the Roe v. Wade ruling of 1973. The report reveals that the decline in abortions can partially be attributed to the increased use of contraception by teenagers of both genders. The abortion rate in the United States has fallen to its lowest level since the historic 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized the practice. In 2017, the rate of abortions was 13.5 per 1,000 women aged between 15 and 44 years old. That is a decline of 20% from 2011 when the rate of abortions stood at 16.9 per 1,000 women in the same age group. In comparison, the number of pregnancies also decreased by 15%, indicating that women are increasingly using birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Experts suggest that this decrease in abortions can be largely attributed to the use of highly effective contraceptive methods, such as long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants. These methods, which are now more widely available, reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies and thus prevent abortions. Despite this overall decline in abortions, black teenagers still have a disproportionate number of abortions when compared to their white peers. According to the report, the abortion rate among black teenagers remains four times higher than that of white teenagers. In fact, the data reveals that black women and women from other racial and ethnic minority groups continue to experience higher than average unintended pregnancy rates as well as higher rates of unplanned births and unsafe abortions. Commenting on these findings, Dr. Rachel Jones, the lead author of the report notes, “The continuing decline in abortion is good news, but the stark disparities by race and ethnicity are concerning. It’s deeply concerning that black women, in particular, are disproportionately affected by unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.” The study also revealed that the overall trend in abortion numbers masks significant regional variations. The decline in abortion rates between 2011 and 2017 was greatest in the Midwest and the South, where the rates fell by 25% and 26%, respectively. In the Northeast and the West, the rates declined by 11% and 13%, respectively. Activists who oppose abortion welcomed the report’s findings. Mallory Quigley, a spokesperson for the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion, hailed the news as a "life-affirming victory that we are celebrating." In contrast, pro-choice advocates warned that conservative efforts to limit access to contraception and abortion could threaten the continued decline in abortion rates. The report highlights that the availability and accessibility of birth control, as well as quality sexual health education, play a critical role in reducing unintended pregnancies and, in turn, lowering the rate of abortions. The findings of this report demonstrate that with the right policies and advocacy, a significant reduction in unintended pregnancies, and thus, in the number of abortions can be achieved.
