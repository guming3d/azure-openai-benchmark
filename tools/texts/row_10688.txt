article: (WIRED) -- A judge on Monday ordered a Colorado woman to decrypt her laptop computer so prosecutors can use the files against her in a criminal case. The defendant, accused of bank fraud, had unsuccessfully argued that being forced to do so violates the Fifth Amendment's protection against compelled self-incrimination. "I conclude that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated by requiring production of the unencrypted contents of the Toshiba Satellite M305 laptop computer," Colorado U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn ruled Monday (.pdf). The authorities seized the laptop from defendant Ramona Fricosu in 2010 with a court warrant while investigating financial fraud. The case is being closely watched (.pdf) by civil rights groups, as the issue has never been squarely weighed in on by the Supreme Court. Full disk encryption is an option built into the latest flavors of Windows, Mac OS and Linux, and well-designed encryption protocols used with a long passphrase can take decades to break, even with massive computing power. The government had argued that there was no Fifth Amendment breach, and that it might "require significant resources and may harm the subject computer" if the authorities tried to crack the encryption. Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Davies said in a court filing (.pdf) that if Judge Blackburn did not rule against the woman, that would amount to "a concession to her and potential criminals (be it in child exploitation, national security, terrorism, financial crimes or drug trafficking cases) that encrypting all inculpatory digital evidence will serve to defeat the efforts of law enforcement officers to obtain such evidence through judicially authorized search warrants, and thus make their prosecution impossible." A factually similar dispute involving child pornography ended with a Vermont federal judge ordering the defendant to decrypt the hard drive of his laptop. While that case never reached the Supreme Court, it differed from the Fricosu matter because U.S. border agents already knew there was child porn on the computer because they saw it while the computer was running during a 2006 routine stop along the Canadian border. The judge in the Colorado case said there was plenty of evidence â€” a jailhouse recording of the defendant â€” that the laptop might contain information the authorities were seeking. The judge ordered Fricosu to surrender an unencrypted hard drive by February 21. The judge added that the government is precluded "from using Ms. Fricosu's act of production of the unencrypted hard drive against her in any prosecution."

chatgpt: A Colorado woman accused of bank fraud has been ordered by a US judge to allow prosecutors access to her computer, despite her Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. On Wednesday, Judge Robert Blackburn ruled that the accused must hand over her hard drives and other electronic storage devices to investigators within seven days, arguing that the Fifth Amendment does not apply in this case. Blackburn's ruling was based on a previous case involving child pornography, in which a man refused to hand over the password to his encrypted hard drive, claiming it would incriminate him. The court ultimately found that his Fifth Amendment right did not apply because the government already had sufficient evidence of the man's guilt. In the current case, the woman, whose name has not been released, is accused of using fake checks and fraudulent wire transfers to steal funds from various banks. The prosecution has argued that they need access to her computer to prove their case. The defendant's attorney argued that forcing her to turn over her computer would effectively force her to incriminate herself, violating her Fifth Amendment rights. However, the judge disagreed, citing the previous case involving child pornography as precedent. "It is a foregone conclusion that the defendant has possession and control of the storage devices," Blackburn wrote in his ruling. "The only question is whether the act of producing the devices will communicate some statement of fact that isn't already known." The judge went on to say that he did not believe the act of turning over the devices would incriminate the woman or provide any new information that the prosecution did not already have. Many legal experts have expressed concern about Blackburn's ruling, arguing that it sets a dangerous precedent for the future. "The Fifth Amendment protects us from being compelled to testify against ourselves, but this decision effectively erodes that protection by allowing the government to force us to hand over potentially incriminating evidence," said Paul Ohm, a law professor at Georgetown University. Others have pointed out that the ruling could have unintended consequences, as it could be used to justify similar orders in cases where the government does not have as strong a case as they do in the current one. The defendant has seven days to comply with the court's order. If she fails to do so, she could be held in contempt of court and face additional charges. The trial is expected to begin later this year.
