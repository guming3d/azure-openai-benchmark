chatgpt: A woman with a long history of criminal activity is facing serious charges after police say she tried to run down a man in a stolen vehicle last week. Marilyn Deboer, 42, was arrested on New Year's Day after she allegedly tried to steal a package containing $70 boots from outside a Florida residence. When the homeowner, identified as 58-year-old Richard Lewis, attempted to stop her from getting away with the package, Deboer reportedly stepped on the gas and struck Lewis with her getaway SUV before fleeing the scene. According to police, Lewis suffered bleeding in his brain as a result of the incident and is still fighting for his life in the hospital. The incident has left the community in shock and disbelief, with many expressing concerns about the safety of their neighborhood. "It's just sad that someone would do something like this over a pair of boots," said one resident who wished to remain anonymous. "We need to come together as a community and try to prevent things like this from happening." Deboer, who has at least 100 arrests on her record, faces charges of attempted murder in connection with the incident. The charges represent the latest entry in what is becoming an increasingly lengthy criminal history for the Florida resident. Deboer has previously been arrested on charges including theft, DUI, and drug possession, among others. Despite these past run-ins with the law, however, she remains free on bond pending trial on the attempted murder charge. The incident has prompted renewed calls for criminal justice reform in Florida, with many pushing for changes that would make it more difficult for repeat offenders like Deboer to remain free while awaiting trial. "It's clear that our current system isn't working," said one advocate for criminal justice reform. "We need to make sure that repeat offenders like this are held accountable and that they're not allowed to continue committing crimes while they await trial." As for Lewis, the victim of the alleged hit-and-run, his family is holding out hope that he will recover from his injuries. They're asking anyone with information about the incident to come forward and help police bring Deboer to justice. "We're just praying for Richard to pull through," said Lewis's sister. "No one deserves to go through something like this, especially over something as trivial as a pair of boots."
