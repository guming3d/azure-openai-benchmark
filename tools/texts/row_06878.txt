Unmarried women in many Arab countries are still expected to come home before dusk and are often suspected of engaging in sexual activities if they do not. Although there is greater freedom among the expanding middle classes in the Arab world, sex outside marriage is still considered to bring an intolerable shame on a conservative Muslim family. Between 15 and 20 women die in 'honour' murders each year in the Arab Kingdom, despite government efforts to curb such crimes. But not all those who kill the women are brought to justice. In the case of the latest victim, police know that there is no ‘victim family’ to take into consideration and often do not bother filing charges. Murder is however punishable by death in Jordan but in honour killings courts can commute or reduce sentences, particularly if the victim's family asks for leniency.

chatgpt: In the latest episode of horrific honor killings, a young woman was found murdered in Amman, her throat slit and her body stabbed multiple times. The victim's brother has been arrested as the prime suspect in the murder. Authorities in Amman confirmed that the brother was unhappy with his sister's decision to leave the house without his permission. The young woman, in her twenties, had reportedly been arguing with her family about her desire for independence and her wish to pursue her own dreams. This latest honor killing has sent shockwaves throughout the country, already reeling from another gruesome murder just two weeks ago. The body of a pregnant woman was found burned in a so-called 'honor killing', where a woman is killed by a male relative for supposedly shaming the family. The incident has sparked widespread condemnation, with activists and human rights groups calling for urgent action to address the issue of honor killings in the country. Jordan has seen a rise in such crimes in recent years, with reports of dozens of honor killings annually. The government has vowed to take action to curb the rise of honor killings, including new laws criminalizing the act and tougher sentences for perpetrators. However, critics argue that not enough is being done to address the underlying cultural and social issues that fuel such crimes. Honor killings, most often directed against women, are a phenomenon that occurs in many parts of the world. The practice is rooted in the belief that women's behavior is central to the family's honor, and that any perceived transgression can bring shame on the family. Honor killings are often carried out with impunity, with perpetrators receiving light sentences or even being allowed to go free. The United Nations estimates that 5,000 women and girls fall victim to honor killings every year, while other sources suggest the figure may be much higher. The latest murder in Amman illustrates the urgent need for concerted action to tackle this brutal form of violence against women. Only by addressing the root causes of honor killings can we hope to end this scourge and ensure that women and girls can live their lives free from fear and violence.
