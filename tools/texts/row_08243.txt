article: Schools are being urged to fly the Union Jack and sing the national anthem at every assembly as part of a campaign to foster patriotism among the young. The campaign in Bolton was launched by a Tory councillor whose grandfather was the town’s first Indian immigrant. It was approved this week despite a Labour councillor questioning whether schools with tight budgets could afford flags and poles. Schools in Bolton are being urged to fly the Union Flag and sing the National Anthem . Schools in the area will also be asked to fly the St George’s cross on April 23, St George’s Day, and the Commonwealth flag in March. Mudasir Dean said he wanted to seize the Union Flag back from the Far Right and show children it was a symbol people from all backgrounds could celebrate. ‘My grandfather came to Bolton in the 1920s from India,’ he said. ‘He lived here all his life and he was the first Asian to settle in Bolton. ‘Growing up in Bolton, I’ve seen less and less of the Union Flag. It’s been hijacked by the Far Right and it’s time we take that symbol back into mainstream British, Bolton life.’ Councillor Dean said complaints that new immigrants couldn’t settle in Britain was sometimes ‘our own fault’. ‘If we were more patriotic – if we sang our national anthem and flew our flag – and instilled it in our younger generations, they would do,’ he added. It is hoped raising the flag will boost patriotism in school children (file picture) Speaking before Wednesday’s vote, Labour councillor and school governor Chris Peacock questioned the plan on practical grounds. ‘Who will pay for these new flag poles and flags?’ he asked. ‘Schools’ budgets are already stretched. Raising the Union flag won’t raise standards – that should be our priority.’ However the Labour-controlled authority backed the motion, carried with 34 members in favour, four against and 11 abstentions. The council will now write to all schools in the area and ask them to consider flying the flag and incorporating a performance of God Save the Queen into the school day. But Mr Peacock said he remained opposed, telling the BBC: ‘If you want to inspire patriotism amongst our young people, show the clips from the Olympics again.’

chatgpt: Bolton's schools are being called upon to fly the Union Jack and recite the national anthem as part of a new campaign launched by Musdasir Dean, a Conservative councillor, and the grandson of an Indian immigrant. The campaign aims to reclaim the Union Flag, which has been associated with the far right in recent years.  Dean believes that the Union Jack represents the nation as a whole, and should not be hijacked as a symbol of division. He says it is important for young people to understand the history and values of the nation, and to show respect for the country and its traditions.  Dean himself is proud to be British, and his grandfather's story is a testament to the success of immigrants in the UK. According to Dean, his grandfather traveled to Britain in the 1920s as an economic migrant, and worked in the railway industry for over four decades. Despite facing discrimination and prejudice, he was able to provide for his family and contribute to the community.  Dean's campaign has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised his efforts to promote national pride and unity, while others argue that the Union Jack has become tainted by associations with racism and xenophobia.  However, Dean insists that the Union Flag should not be allowed to become a political symbol, and that it belongs to all Britons regardless of their background. He hopes that his campaign will encourage schools to celebrate the country's heritage and instill a sense of patriotism in the next generation.  A spokesperson for Bolton Council has stated that there is no official policy on flag-flying or national anthems in schools, but that individual schools are free to make their own decisions. It is likely that the campaign will be taken up by some schools, while others may choose not to participate.  Regardless of the outcome, Dean's campaign has sparked an important conversation about national identity and what it means to be British. It is clear that the Union Jack still holds a great deal of symbolic value, and that it has the power to inspire both pride and controversy.  As the UK continues to navigate a period of social and political upheaval, it is perhaps more important than ever to reaffirm our shared values and symbols. Whether or not schools choose to fly the Union Jack and sing the national anthem, we must all strive to remember the ideals that they represent: inclusivity, respect, and unity.
