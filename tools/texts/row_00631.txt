chatgpt: Megan Harvey, a 14-year-old girl from Birmingham, suffers from Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (CVS), a rare disorder that causes her to experience 12-hour vomiting attacks whenever she gets excited. The condition has left her unable to attend parties and even holidays, as she never knows when an episode may strike.  Megan has struggled with CVS since the age of five, and it has frequently disrupted her life. However, in the lead-up to her school prom, the excitement proved too much, and she was hospitalized for a week after a severe vomiting attack.  Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome is a type of functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) that affects only a small percentage of people. According to the CVSA (Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association), only 2% of the general population is affected, with most patients being children. The causes of CVS are still unknown, but it is thought to be related to migraines and is often linked to anxiety, panic attacks, and stress. For Megan, the condition has had a significant impact on her life. She has missed out on many social events, including family gatherings and friends' birthdays. The unpredictability of her condition has meant that she is unable to make long-term plans, and even her school attendance has been affected. Before her school prom, Megan was excited to have the chance to dress up and attend the event with her friends. She had been looking forward to it for months, but the excitement soon turned sour when she suffered a severe vomiting attack. She was rushed to the hospital and had to stay there for a week while doctors monitored her condition and tried to alleviate her symptoms.  Megan's mother, Liz, has spoken out about the challenges of living with CVS. She says that watching her daughter suffer is heartbreaking, and that it has been difficult to see Megan miss out on so much due to her condition. Liz says that they have tried many treatments in the past, but nothing has been successful in preventing the vomiting attacks. Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome is a condition that is not well-known or well-understood. Many people who suffer from it face significant challenges, and Megan's story highlights the impact it can have on a person's life. It is essential that more research is conducted into CVS to determine its causes and find more effective treatments. Despite the challenges she has faced, Megan remains positive and determined. She says that she is hopeful that one day she will find a way to control her condition and be able to attend social events without fear of a vomiting attack. Until then, she will continue to advocate for more research into CVS and raise awareness of the condition.  In conclusion, CVS is a little-known disorder that can have a significant impact on a person's life. Megan Harvey's story is a stark reminder of the difficulties faced by those living with the condition. It is essential that more research is conducted to determine its causes and find effective treatments, so that people like Megan can lead happy and fulfilling lives.
