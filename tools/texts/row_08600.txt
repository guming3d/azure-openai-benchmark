article: (CNN) -- Boston bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev has tweeted since the Boston Marathon bombings on what two friends of his tell CNN is his Twitter account. His tweets included one at 1:43 a.m. Wednesday that said, "I'm a stress free kind of guy." On Monday at 8:04 p.m. -- hours after the bombings -- he tweeted a quote from rapper Jay-Z and a 1970s R&B song, "Ain't no love in the heart of the city." The tweet added, "stay safe people." Shortly after midnight, on Tuesday morning, he tweeted, "There are people that know the truth but stay silent & there are people that speak the truth but we don't hear them cuz they're the minority." Tsarnaev uses the handle "J_tsar" and does not describe himself in the profile, which reads only, "Salam aleikum," a greeting among Muslims. The profile photo is the face of a lion with its mouth open, baring its fangs. He has tweeted a dozen times since the bombing. The most recent tweet is one he retweeted on Wednesday from Mufti Ismail Menk, who identifies himself as a Muslim scholar. "Attitude can take away your beauty no matter how good looking you are or it could enhance your beauty, making you adorable," the tweet reads. Another tweet from Tsarnaev on Tuesday was a quote from rapper Eminem: "Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say but nothin comes out when they move their lips; just a bunch of gibberish." After another Twitter account posted a photo Tuesday saying it showed a man who was going to propose to his girlfriend at the marathon in Boston and found her dead, Tsarnaev tweeted a two-word response: "fake story." Another of the suspect's tweets, an apparent response to someone else's tweet, reads, " and they what 'god hates dead people?' Or victims of tragedies? Lol those people are cooked." Also Tuesday, Tsarnaev tweeted, "So then I says to him, I says, relax bro my beard is not loaded." On Friday, another Twitter user retweeted that message, and added the words, "But my backpack is." Other items that he wrote, well before the Boston bombings, on the social media site may offer more details pertinent to the investigation. On August 10, 2012, for instance, Tsarnaev wrote -- in response to another user -- "Boston marathon isn't a good place to smoke tho." The context of this conservation, however, was not known.

chatgpt: A new development in the Boston Marathon bombing case has come to light with the revelation of a cryptic tweet last August that appears to refer to the event. The tweet was sent from an account that two friends of suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev claim is his Twitter handle. The tweet in question is vague, but it appears to refer to the Boston Marathon in some way. This has raised questions about whether Tsarnaev may have had advance knowledge of the bombing or was involved in the planning. What's more, just hours after the bombing occurred, the same Twitter account tweeted a message telling people to "stay safe." This has led some to speculate that Tsarnaev may have been trying to cover his tracks or give himself an alibi by appearing concerned for the public's safety. Another troubling tweet from the same account came just days after the bombing. In this message, the account holder claimed that a photo of an alleged bombing victim was fake. This has led some to question whether Tsarnaev may have had some role in the dissemination of false information in the aftermath of the attack. Of course, it's worth noting that just because Tsarnaev may have tweeted about the bombing and related events doesn't necessarily mean he was involved in the attack itself. It's possible that he was simply a spectator like many others and was trying to make sense of what had happened. At the same time, the discovery of this Twitter account and its messages add another layer of intrigue to an already complicated case. Investigators will no doubt be poring over the messages in an attempt to glean any additional information that could help them piece together what happened on that fateful day in Boston. For now, though, much remains unknown. It's still not entirely clear how Tsarnaev became involved in the bombing, or whether he had any accomplices. The discovery of this Twitter account may be another clue, but it's far from definitive. In the end, the Boston Marathon bombing remains a tragic and senseless act of violence that shook the nation. The investigation into the attack will likely continue for some time, as authorities try to uncover the full extent of what happened and bring those responsible to justice.
