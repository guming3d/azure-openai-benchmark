Maldon Carnival had been hoping Beyonce would be the star attraction at this year's event - until she demanded a £50,000 fee . Organisers of a town carnival in Essex thought they had pulled off a remarkable coup after global superstar Beyonce agreed to be the headline performer - only to find out her fee would be £50,000. Ambitious members of Maldon Carnival had been turned down by Britney Spears, Rod Stewart, Will.i.am, Jessie J, Taylor Swift, Justin Timberlake, Rita Ora and even the Queen before the singer appeared to show an interest. Her agent sent an email saying: 'There is a possibility that Beyonce will be available and hopefully can attend your carnival event.' But after a ten minute meeting with red-faced executives, the plans were quickly scuppered after it emerged Beyonce could not appear for free and would require a £50,000 fee. An email confirmation of the meeting read: 'After our conversation, it is apparent there is some miscommunication. 'Beyonce will require an appearance fee to attend your carnival. 'Regrettably, it is unlikely your carnival will be able to attract the audience required or have the necessary experience to handle such a large event.' The Maldon Carnival in August includes a procession, a bonny baby competition, spot-the-stranger and clairvoyant evening and last year made £1,200 for charity. Tickets for Beyonce's 11 stadium shows in the UK sold out in 15 minutes earlier this week and the singer is worth an estimated £500million with her rapper husband Jay-Z.

chatgpt: Maldon Carnival organisers recently invited a celebrity singer to perform at their annual charity gala. However, their plans hit a wall after the singer's agent revealed her staggering fee of £50,000. It was an unfortunate turn of events for the organisers who were hoping to raise significant funds for their charities. According to sources, the organisers had initially reached out to the singer's agent, requesting her to perform at their event in August. The agent replied to their email, confirming that the singer was 'available' to perform. But soon after, things took an unexpected turn. The agent reportedly informed the organisers of the singer's £50,000 fee, which was well beyond their budget. The organisers were left crestfallen, having hoped to have the popular singer headline their fundraiser. The event was supposed to raise money for local charities that support disadvantaged children and families. The fundraising goal was set high, and with the inclusion of a celebrity performer, they had hoped to smash their target. The lead organiser expressed his disappointment in a recent statement, saying, "We were thrilled at the prospect of having such a well-known singer grace our stage. Unfortunately, we were unable to agree on a fee, and we had to cancel the performance." The news of the cancelled performance was received with dismay by the local community, who had been looking forward to the event. Many had already purchased tickets or had planned on making donations at the event. The organisers have promised to refund all ticket sales and donations that have already been made. Despite the setback, the organisers are optimistic about the event's success. They have announced that they are actively seeking other performers to replace the celebrity singer who had to cancel. They have reassured the community that the event will go ahead as planned, albeit without the popular performer. In his statement, the lead organiser also expressed his gratitude to the community for their continued support. "We are incredibly grateful for the local community's continued support for our charitable causes, and we will not let this setback stand in the way of helping those in need," he said. Overall, the organisers are hopeful that they will still be able to raise the much-needed funds for their charities. They are looking forward to putting on a great show for the community and hope that people will continue to show their support at the event.
