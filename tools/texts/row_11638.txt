Heather Cho, a senior vice-president at Korean Air, is facing up to 10 years in prison over claims that she delayed a plane leaving JFK over the way she was served nuts . South Korea’s Transport Ministry announced on Monday that they are investigating if Cho violated the Aviation Safety Law, which states that passengers should not cause disturbances, including using violent language or yelling, for safety reasons. Flight 86 was already on the runway for its 12:50 a.m. departure from JFK when Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class, reports the Korean Times. The junior flight attendant's faux pas was to serve the nuts inside the bag that they came in rather than presenting them on a small dish - as is protocol. Cho screamed at the attendant and told him to bring out the company’s in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him to get off the flight. Korean Air Flight 86 was already on the runway for its 12:50 a.m. departure from JFK when Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker broke protocol and placed the snack of macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class . 'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times. Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the pilots decided to give in to her demands and return to the airport to drop off the attendant. As their investigation gets underway, the Transport Ministry must try to figure out if Cho’s behavior warrants a prison sentence. 'We’ll see whether her behavior was against the law,' a ministry official told the Korean Times. 'It is an unprecedented case, so we need to see the related regulations.' 'Even though she is senior vice president at the company, she was a passenger at that time, so she had to behave and be treated as a passenger,' they added. 'She could have taken other measures after coming back to Korea, such as strengthening service training.' Heather Cho is the eldest daughter of Korean Air Chairman Cho Yang Ho .

chatgpt: Heather Cho, a senior vice-president at Korean Air, is facing up to 10 years in prison after allegedly throwing a tantrum on a flight and demanding the removal of a crew member for serving her nuts in a bag rather than on a plate. Cho, the eldest daughter of Korean Air Chairman Cho Yang Ho, reportedly forced the Incheon-bound flight to taxi back to the terminal to drop off the employee who served the nuts in the bag. According to reports, Cho allegedly became irate after being served macadamia nuts in a bag by a flight attendant. Cho, who was seated in first class, believed that the way the nuts were served was improper and demanded that the flight attendant be taken off the flight. The pilot then returned to the gate, where the crew member was removed from the plane. The incident, which has been dubbed the "nut rage" incident, has caused a media storm in South Korea and around the world. Some have criticized Cho's behavior as being entitled and abusive. Following the incident, Korean Air issued a public apology, stating that they were "sincerely sorry" for the incident and would be taking steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Cho was subsequently charged with multiple violations of aviation safety law, including changing a flight plan, obstructing business, forcing a crew member to act against his or her will, and assault. If convicted, she could face up to 10 years in prison. The incident has also raised questions about the culture of Korean Air, which is known for its strict hierarchy and nepotism. Cho's father, Chairman Cho Yang Ho, has been criticized for giving his family members top positions within the company regardless of their qualifications. Some Korean Air employees have reportedly expressed concern that Heather Cho's actions have damaged the airline's reputation and may harm the company's long-term success. In response to the incident, Korean Air has implemented several changes to its airline policies, including providing additional training to flight attendants and changing its first class menu to include both roasted and raw macadamia nuts. The case against Heather Cho is ongoing, and it remains to be seen whether she will be found guilty of the charges against her. Regardless of the outcome, the "nut rage" incident has already had a significant impact on Korean Air and has raised broader questions about the company's culture and practices. Whether Korean Air can recover from this incident remains to be seen.
