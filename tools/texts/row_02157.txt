chatgpt: West Ham United has announced the signing of two Italian footballers, Antonio Nocerino and Marco Borriello, as they continue their push for a top-four finish in the English Premier League. Both players join the Hammers on loan deals until the end of the season. Nocerino, a midfielder who has represented the Italian national team 15 times, has joined from Italian side AC Milan. The 28-year-old has spent the majority of this season on the bench and will be looking for regular game-time with the East London outfit. Speaking to West Ham's official website, Nocerino said: "I am excited about playing for West Ham, it is a great opportunity for me. I cannot wait to play with the team and help them achieve their goals." West Ham's second signing, Borriello, has joined from Italian Serie A club, AS Roma. The 31-year-old striker has vast experience in Italian football and has previously played for a number of top clubs, including AC Milan, Juventus and Genoa. Borriello will be hoping that his experience and goal-scoring abilities can help West Ham in their quest to secure a European spot. Both Nocerino and Borriello have joined the club on loan deals until the end of the season, with the option of a permanent move in the summer. The two Italians become the latest additions to a West Ham squad that has already seen the likes of Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing and Mohamed Diame move to the club in recent seasons. West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce, is delighted with his new signings and believes they will both make a significant impact during the remainder of the season. "Antonio and Marco are two very experienced players who will provide us with quality options in key positions," said Allardyce. "I am confident that they will both prove to be valuable additions to our squad." West Ham has struggled with injuries and suspensions this season and the addition of Nocerino and Borriello will add depth to a squad that has been stretched on numerous occasions this season. The Hammers currently sit seventh in the Premier League table, just five points behind fourth-placed Liverpool. With 16 games remaining, West Ham will be hoping that their new Italian duo can help push the team towards a top-four finish and a place in next season's Champions League.
