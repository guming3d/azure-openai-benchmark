Night sky: A city in Ohio is battling a plague of crows with swarms estimated to be 60,000-strong . At war: That means there's almost one bird to every human inhabitant in the town of Springfield . However, the digital repellents which send out sounds to scare off the birds, have largely been unsuccessful. 'The crows adapted quickly and realized that’s just a fake,' Roger Sherrock, CEO of the Clark County Heritage Center and one of the leaders in the fight against the crows, told the Springfield News Sun. Ongoing problem: Roger Sherrock, CEO of the Clark County Heritage Center, is one of the Springfield residents leading the fight against the crows which leave their droppings all over buildings . Trouble-makers: The birds' overwhelming presence on trees and buildings is causing concern about damage and potential health hazards from their waste . Some have compared the crow-laden landscape to the Alfred Hitchcock movie The Birds, where the California town of Bodega Bay suddenly becomes the subject of unexplained and violent bird attacks. However, the murder of crows troubling Springfield isn't aggressive like the one in the 1963 thriller. But with tens of thousands of them at times, their overwhelming presence on trees and buildings is causing concern about damage and potential health hazards from the birds' waste. Sherrock noted that the stones swallowed by crows to help digest their food have clogged up gutters on buildings and business owners have been paying thousands to get droppings removed. Here to stay: Apparently the crow epidemic in Springfield has been an ongoing problem . Reminiscent: The Springfield scenes are reminiscent of the 1963 Hitchcock classic film, The Birds (pictured) Springfielders are now in the midst of a two-week drive to banish the crows for good. The city's service department is employing up to two workers per night during this time to fire flare guns. They hope this will convince the birds to choose a roosting place away from the downtown area. Apparently the crow epidemic has been an ongoing problem for more than a decade in the area. But Sherrock concluded: 'We’ll keep going as long as it takes.'

chatgpt: Residents of Springfield, Ohio are struggling to deal with an influx of crows that have taken over their town. Every night, approximately 60,000 crows descend upon the city, almost outnumbering the human inhabitants. The birds are causing problems for residents, business owners, and local authorities due to the mess they leave behind. The crows' droppings are prevalent throughout the town, posing a health hazard to residents and causing damage to property. Business owners have reported difficulty cleaning up the droppings outside of their establishments, which creates an unsightly and unhygienic environment. The police are concerned about the potential for disease being spread by the birds. To tackle the problem, local residents have tried a variety of methods to discourage the birds. Some have used laser pointers and sound machines to frighten the crows away from populated areas, while others have used gun flares to scare them off. However, despite these efforts, the birds continue to come back every night. One local figure who is playing an active role in trying to solve the problem is Roger Sherrock, CEO of the Clark County Heritage Center. Sherrock is leading a group of residents and business owners in the fight against the crows. He has stated that they will continue to try and rid Springfield of the birds, no matter how long it takes. The city of Springfield is not alone in having issues with crows. Many other cities across the United States have experienced similar problems with the birds. The crows can create a lot of noise, and their aggressive behavior can scare people. Experts believe that one reason that crows are drawn to urban areas is due to the warmth that is created by the heat that is released by buildings. However, despite the problems that the birds are causing in Springfield, some residents view them as a unique attraction. The sight of thousands of crows descending upon the town each night has become something of a spectacle. Residents have even organized events in the town center to watch the crows roosting, which has become a popular activity. Despite the mixed opinions on the crows, it is clear that the issue needs addressing. The negative effects of the birds' presence must be dealt with to prevent any potential health hazards. Moreover, businesses in the area must be able to operate in a clean and hygienic environment. For now, Springfield will continue to fight the onslaught of crows each night, in the hope that one day they will be able to peacefully coexist with the city's human residents.
