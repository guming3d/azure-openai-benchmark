Some patrons were still wearing their pajamas and slippers, and strangers were crowding together into booths, CNN affiliate KSL-TV in Salt Lake City, Utah, reported. "You couldn't beat it.

"To do this is amazing and not something you hear of every day, especially in today's economy -- that we're getting something free," Debbie Brugger of Essex Junction, Vermont, anticipating a hearty breakfast at a Denny's in Burlington, told CNN affiliate WCAX-TV.

chatgpt: Denny's caused quite a stir on Sunday when it announced a promotion during the Super Bowl commercial break. The restaurant chain announced that it would be giving away its signature Grand Slam breakfast for eight hours straight at locations across the country. The meal, which includes pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage, reportedly packs a whopping 770 calories.  Patrons lined up outside Denny's locations across the country to take advantage of the promotion. Many were willing to wait for hours just to get their hands on the free breakfast. At some locations, the line stretched out the door and around the block.  Once inside, patrons jammed into booths with strangers in order to take advantage of the free offer. Many of the tables were filled with groups of friends and families who had come together to partake in the promotion. Some patrons even took their meals to go, eager to try out the famous Grand Slam breakfast at home.  The promotion was a clever marketing move by Denny's, which has been struggling to compete with other breakfast chains in recent years. By offering free food, the chain was able to generate buzz on social media and get people talking about the brand.  But the promotion also highlighted some of the issues surrounding fast food and the American diet. The Grand Slam breakfast, with its 770 calories, is just one example of the heavy, high-calorie meals that are all too common in the fast-food industry.  Critics argue that such meals contribute to the obesity epidemic in the United States, with some pointing out that Denny's promotion sends a dangerous message about the importance of healthy eating. However, others see the promotion as harmless fun, and point out that it's up to individuals to make their own choices about what they eat.  Despite the controversy, the promotion was a massive success for Denny's. The chain reported a huge increase in foot traffic at its locations and generated a significant amount of social media buzz. While it remains to be seen whether or not the promotion will lead to long-term increases in sales, it's clear that Denny's is committed to doing whatever it takes to stay competitive in the fast-food industry.  For those who missed out on the promotion, Denny's is still offering its Grand Slam breakfast at its regular price. However, the lines are likely to be a bit shorter now that the promotion has ended.
