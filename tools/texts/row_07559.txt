Victoria Sams, 35 and her husband David, 38, from Meadowfield, Co Durham, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal at Darlington Magistrates Court. Their two dogs were found in such poor health they had to be put down by the RSPCA. The images show the weak and starving dogs in their last days. A veterinary examination rated both dogs' body condition at the worst possible . Serious neglect: One of the dogs cowers in the corner of a wooden kennel with no bedding . The dogs, Ebby, a collie cross and Kizzy, a Rottweiler, had been living in an outdoor kennel and pen with no bedding and surrounded by faeces. RSPCA officers found Ebby to be so emaciated and riddled with arthritis that she was unable to stand. Kizzy had a piece of bone wedged in her mouth which prevented her from eating, causing a tetanus infection. A veterinary examination rated both dogs' body condition at level one; on a scale of one to nine with one being the worst. Emaciated: The dog has a protruding ribcage and matted fur . The dogs were said to be in severe pain from arthritis. Their muscles were so wasted, they struggled to stand . Kevin Campbell, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said that when inspectors arrived at the couple's home they found Kizzy in a 'collapsed and almost rigid state'. He said: 'The dog was struggling to breathe; it would die without immediate vet's attention.' Mr Campbell said that officers returned to collect 16-year-old Ebby, who was later found to be suffering from an organ ailment known as Cushing's disease. Mr Campbell said: 'She (Ebby) would have been in severe pain and had muscle wastage and arthritis. 'She should have been on pain relief long before the vet saw her.' The dog would have died within a few days.' Unclean: The dogs had been living in poor conditions. Mr Sams said when they tried to put bedding in the kennel it would just get shredded . Mrs Sams, who appeared tearful, said she had not noticed the piece of bone wedged in Kizzy's mouth and thought that Ebby was just old. Mr Sams, said that both dogs had been eating well and that when they tried to put bedding in the kennel it would just get shredded. He told the court that he always cleaned out the dogs' living area, but had been in London for several days before the inspectors visited so had not been able to do it that week. Chair magistrate Patricia Bacon warned the pair that they could face a jail sentence due to the seriousness of the case. She advised them to seek legal representation before returning to court to be sentenced in May.

chatgpt: Victoria and David Sams have been found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to their pets after the RSPCA discovered a shocking scene in their Co Durham home. Upon arrival at the residence, officers found dogs locked in a pen covered in faeces, barely able to stand and near death. The couple was summoned to court, where they faced severe punishment for neglecting their pets. The judge deemed their actions so serious that they could face jail time. The RSPCA was alerted to the couple’s treatment of their animals after a concerned neighbor reported the neglect. Officers arrived and found the dogs in a debilitating condition, with little food or clean water to sustain them. The dogs’ coats were covered in filth, and they were living in their own excrement, making it clear that they had not been let out of the pen for some time. The smell and conditions were so shocking that it left the RSPCA officers horrified and disgusted. The couple's defense had been that their son was responsible for the care of the dogs, but the judge was not convinced, stating it was their obligation as the animals' owners to ensure their welfare. During the trial, it was brought to light that there were previous reports made against the couple. Despite warnings, they failed to improve the living conditions for their pets. As a result, the judge gave a stern warning not only to the couple but to all pet owners that animal cruelty would not be tolerated. In response to the guilty verdict, a spokesperson for the RSPCA stated that it was an essential reminder that pet owners must take their responsibilities seriously. They said that the charity would continue to prosecute those that failed to meet the basic needs of their pets. The case has once again highlighted the importance of monitoring the welfare of animals, particularly in cases where neglect may be taking place. It is the duty of the public to report any concerns to the relevant authorities, such as the RSPCA, to ensure that animals are kept safe and healthy. This case has confirmed that animal cruelty is a serious offense, and those who commit such offenses must be held responsible. Let this serve as a warning to all pet owners that they must provide their animals with adequate care and attention. Any acts of neglect will not go unpunished, and jail time may be a real possibility.
