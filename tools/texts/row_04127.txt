article: (CNN) -- Hours after Turkey's prime minister vowed to "eradicate" Twitter, Turkish Internet users began to experience widespread disruptions Thursday while trying to access the popular social networking website. Outrage and fury erupted online. Within an hour the hashtags "#TwitterisblockedinTurkey," "#DictatorErdogan" and "TurkeyBlockedTwitter" surged to the service's top worldwide trends. Meanwhile, Twitter swiftly offered subscribers a work-around via its verified policy account by advertising an alternative way to send out tweets using cell-phone instant messaging. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan first vowed to shut Twitter down at a campaign rally on Thursday in the city of Bursa. "Now there is a court order. Twitter, mwitter, we will eradicate it all," Erdogan said, using a Turkish expression that mocked the name of the social networking site. "The international community will say this and that, and it doesn't concern me one bit," Erdogan added, apparently anticipating the subsequent uproar. "They will see the power of the Turkish Republic. This has nothing to do with freedom-shmeedom. Freedom is not invading someone's privacy." Several hours later, the prime ministry released a statement accusing Twitter's management of ignoring court orders calling for the removal of web links from the website. "Twitter officials remained indifferent to these demands," the prime ministry announced, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency. "Access to Twitter may be blocked as a last resort to avert the unjust treatment of our citizens in case of a continuation of this ignorance of the court rulings." While many Twitter users reported blockages to the website, others quickly advertised workaround procedures. The Twitter crackdown follows earlier threats by Erdogan to shut down popular social networking sites Facebook and YouTube. The latest move against Twitter comes 10 days before Turks are expected to go to the polls in municipal elections that will be held nationwide. The government has also been working to block embarrassing leaks emerging on social media linked to a corruption investigation that embroiled four of Erdogan's former cabinet ministers. Erdogan claims the investigation is a "coup plot." He has sought to crush the probe by firing thousands of police officers and prosecutors. Nonetheless, embarrassing wiretaps of telephone conversations between Erdogan, his family members and top members of Turkey's ruling elite have been leaked on a daily basis on an assortment of popular Internet sites. CNN has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the recordings, some of which have been described as "immorally edited material" by Erdogan. But the prime minister confirmed some of the conversations, including a call in which he ordered the head of a TV news channel to censor the live broadcast of an opposition lawmaker's speech. On Wednesday, lawmakers from Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party succeeded in blocking an attempt by opposition leaders to read out portions of the corruption investigation indictment in an extraordinary session of parliament.

chatgpt: Turkey's Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has once again ignited controversy over his government's handling of social media censorship. In his latest move, he has announced that social media sites may be shuttered in Turkey, a country that has long been accused of suppressing its citizens' freedom of speech. The Turkish Prime Minister, who has been at the center of several scandals involving social media over the past year, has accused Twitter's management of ignoring court orders. He claims the social media giant has not acted on requests to remove content that violates the company's terms of service, particularly those that contain threats of violence or terrorism. Following his threats, outrage erupted online when service disruptions hit Twitter. Myriad users experienced difficulties accessing Twitter and other social media services, leading to speculation that the government had blocked the platforms. Many suggested that the move was part of a broader crackdown on social media dissent in the country. However, Turkey's Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK) denied the allegations that the government had blocked Twitter or any other sites. Instead, the authority said that it had decided to block certain IP addresses and domain names to address what it saw as the "violation of personal rights" in the content shared on social media. Despite the denials, many Twitter users quickly found their way around the service disruptions. Techniques such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and proxy servers were shared widely online. Meanwhile, individuals and organizations continued to speak out against the government's efforts to suppress social media. The latest developments are sure to reignite the debate over social media censorship in Turkey. Critics have long accused the government of using the legal system to stifle dissent, particularly on social media platforms. The country is routinely ranked poorly in global surveys of freedom of expression, and its laws provide authorities with broad powers over online content. The Turkish government has previously imposed Internet bans, including temporarily blocking Twitter and YouTube ahead of local elections in 2014. However, most of these bans have been overturned by courts as unconstitutional. Earlier this year, the government passed new social media regulations, which could see companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube facing fines and even blocking for failing to remove content within 48 hours of a legal order. Meanwhile, social media advocates have expressed concern about the implications of the government's latest threats. They argue that shutting down social media sites would have disastrous consequences for freedom of expression in Turkey. In conclusion, Prime Minister Erdogan's latest threats to shut down social media sites have sparked controversy and outrage in Turkey. While the government denies any wrongdoing, many Turkish citizens remain concerned about their ability to freely express themselves online. The latest developments are sure to further fuel the ongoing debate over freedom of expression and censorship on social media platforms.
