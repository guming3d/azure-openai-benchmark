An East Pennsylvania high school has outlawed toilet paper from the boys bathrooms - forcing students to check it out of the school's office as and when they need it. The new rule, intended to cut vandalism at the Mahanoy Area High School, has been criticized by some parents who say students are too embarrassed to publicly ask for tissue. One mother said she had heard of students leaving school claiming to be sick so they could go home and use the toilet there.

Instead male students need to register and collect paper from the school office . Principal, Thomas Smith, defended the measure at a school meeting on Thursday saying vandals had 'destroyed' toilets over the years blocking them up with toilet paper and sometimes even books. 'We've had serious destruction to our bathrooms for the past two years,' Mr Smith said, according to the Republican Herald of Potsville. 'We have a case pending with the police where a bathroom down by our gymnasium was absolutely destroyed.' 'I'm sure Mr. (Robert) Pastucha (district facilities director) could tell you the times that our toilets have been jammed with toilet paper and other papers.' 'And after we took the toilet tissue out of there, people were throwing books. It was our way to try to curb the destruction in the bathrooms.' Embarrassed: One parent complained that toilet rules at Mahanoy High School humiliated students. Male students have to check-out paper from the school office and check it back in when they are finished . 'I agree that it's a drastic measure,' he added. Boys have to request the paper from either the school office or the nurse signing it out - and back in again when they have used all they need, the local newspaper reports. Meanwhile Mr Smith has been doing spot checks on the toilets to ensure nothing is going on against the rules. 'We're not refusing anyone toilet paper,' Mr Smith continued. 'You would sign out and then sign back in. I randomly go in to check if anything is going on. Since we've done that, we've cut down on the destruction.' Karen Yedsena, a parent at the school of Mahanoy City, complained about the measure at the meeting. She also pointed out that the school's rule of refusing students permission to going to the toilet any other time than the first five minutes of class was equally draconian. 'We're cutting down on people walking through the hallways for no reason,' Superintendent Joie Green responded according to the report.

chatgpt: A school in suburban Colorado has implemented new bathroom regulations that require boys to sign out and sign back in toilet paper in the school office or the nurse's room. According to Principal Thomas Smith, this new rule is necessary to address the issue of male students vandalizing school bathrooms. Smith stated that male students have been caught in the act of damaging toilets, sinks, and dispensers in school bathrooms. The vandalism not only resulted in costly repairs but also disrupted the daily activities of the school's faculty and staff. The principal believes that implementing stricter bathroom policies, such as mandatory toilet paper registration, will discourage students from engaging in acts of vandalism. While the principal believes that this new policy will help to reduce instances of bathroom vandalism, some parents and students are concerned about the potential impact on student privacy. A parent of one male student at the school claimed that his son was uncomfortable with the idea of having to check in and out toilet paper in the school office, as it made him feel like he was being watched and judged. The parent also noted that some students are so embarrassed by the new policy that they are choosing to avoid using the school bathrooms altogether and are instead running home to use the restroom, which is a major inconvenience. Some students also expressed their discomfort about having to register toilet paper, citing concerns about their privacy and dignity. One male student, who preferred to remain anonymous, stated that the new policy made him feel like he was being punished for something he didn't do. He added that it was unfair to be judged and monitored for something as basic as using the restroom. Nonetheless, Principal Smith defended the new policy, saying that it was the school's responsibility to maintain hygienic and vandal-free school bathrooms. He added that the school was willing to work with parents and students to address their concerns, but the toilet paper registration policy would remain in place. Toilet paper monitoring in schools is not a new concept. Many schools across the United States have implemented similar policies in the past with varying degrees of success. However, for some students, mandatory toilet paper registration is seen as an invasion of privacy and an unnecessary measure that only serves to further embarrass and humiliate them. As the debate over bathroom privacy and vandalism prevention rages on, it is clear that there are no easy answers. While some argue that toilet paper registration is a necessary measure to keep school bathrooms clean and safe, others believe it is an infringement on personal privacy and dignity. As such, it is up to school administrators, parents, and students to come together and find a solution that addresses their concerns while still ensuring that school bathrooms are safe and hygienic places for all students.
