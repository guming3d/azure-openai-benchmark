article: (CNN) -- Republican presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman called it stupid. His rival Ron Paul denounced it. But perhaps most appalled by a "China Jon" ad on YouTube were Hindus in America. An amateurish video posted by self-characterized Paul supporter NHLiberty4Paul questions Huntsman's "American values," shows Huntsman, a former ambassador to China, speaking in Mandarin and calls him the "Manchurian Candidate." So why is that so offensive to Hindus? The ad also shows images of Huntsman with his two adopted daughters -- one from China and the other, India. The Huntsmans adopted Indian daughter Asha Bharati from the western state of Gujarat in 2006. The ad asks: "Share our values? A man of faith?" as a photograph flashes of Huntsman with an infant Asha Bharati. Both are a wearing a red tikka, a mark associated with the sacred and often seen on foreheads at Hindu ceremonies and temples. The Hindu American Foundation objected to the insinuations made in the video. "This deplorable ad is blatantly racist and religiously intolerant, and crosses all lines of acceptable political discourse," said Suhag Shukla, the foundation's managing director and legal counsel. "Instead of vilifying Governor Huntsman, he should be applauded for being open-minded enough to raise his adopted daughter as a Hindu," she said. Huntsman, a Mormon, is raising Asha "to learn about and appreciate her native culture and the faiths associated with it," his spokesman told CNN last summer. The advertisement was posted on YouTube earlier this week. An e-mail attempt to reach NHLiberty4Paul was not immediately successful. A description accompanying the video states that "Ron Paul is the only authentic conservative in this race, and the only one capable of bringing authentic change to Washington. He is the only sole alternative to flip-floppers responsible for the costly mistakes of the past." At a campaign stop Friday in Concord, New Hampshire, Huntsman told reporters that Paul should disavow the ad. "If the group is in any way affiliated with his organization, of course he should," Huntsman said. "It's just political campaign nonsense. It happens from time to time." He described how his Chinese daughter Gracie Mei was found abandoned in a vegetable market and taken to an orphanage as a newborn. Now 12, Gracie Mei is a fixture on the Huntsman campaign. The GOP contender often endearingly refers to her as his top foreign policy adviser. In all, the Huntsmans have seven children. "To attack a candidate's family, particularly his young daughters, is completely unacceptable and should be denounced by all Americans," said Samir Kalra, director of the Hindu Foundation. Paul, meanwhile, told CNN that he disavowed the ad and had no control of his supporters' actions. "Of course I denounce it ... but people do that, and they do it in all campaigns," Paul said. CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In the latest political attack ad, a Ron Paul supporter has raised questions regarding Jon Huntsman's values. The ad highlights Huntsman speaking Mandarin and with his two adoptive daughters. It then questions "a man of faith?" before showing a photo of Huntsman with his Hindu daughter. The ad has raised eyebrows and drawn criticism from a Hindu organization who have called the ad racist and intolerant. The ad, which has been shared widely on social media, features a montage of Huntsman speaking Mandarin, followed by a picture of him with his two adopted daughters, Gracie Mei and Asha Bharati. The ad then turns its attention to Huntsman's religious beliefs, focusing on his daughter Asha's Hindu faith. The narrator of the ad questions Huntsman's commitment to his faith, asking if he is truly "a man of faith" given his daughter's religion. The ad has been met with criticism from a Hindu organization known as the Hindu American Foundation (HAF). Shukla Bose, the Executive Director of HAF, has called the ad "racist and intolerant." Bose stated that "it is disappointing to see Huntsman's daughter's Hinduism being used as a wedge issue in this year's election." Bose further added that "this type of rhetoric only serves to divide and marginalize our communities." The ad is the latest in a series of negative campaign tactics being employed by supporters of various candidates in the lead-up to the 2020 Presidential Election. Negative campaigning has become a common feature in American politics, with candidates and their supporters resorting to mudslinging and character assassination to win votes and sway public opinion. Speaking to a reporter, Huntsman's daughter Asha stated that she was disappointed to see her faith being used as a political tool. She added that "my Hindu faith is an important part of who I am, and it is disappointing to see someone attack that." Huntsman himself has not yet commented on the ad. The Ron Paul campaign has also distanced itself from the ad, stating that it was not officially sanctioned by the campaign. In a statement, a spokesperson for the campaign stated that "we do not condone or support any messages that are divisive, intolerant, or disrespectful." The incident has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some defending the ad as a legitimate political attack, while others have criticized it for being racist and divisive. The use of Huntsman's daughters in the ad has also been condemned by many, with critics arguing that children should be off-limits in political campaigns. As the 2020 Presidential Election draws closer, it is likely that negative campaigning and political attack ads will only increase in frequency and intensity. However, it is important that candidates and their supporters refrain from using race, religion, or other divisive issues as tools to win votes, and instead focus on policies and the issues that matter to American voters.
