A homeless man managed to sleep in a Cambridge University library for six weeks before staff noticed he was not a student. The interloper took advantage of the 24-hour library at St John's College by 'tailgating' students entering the building for late-night study sessions before pretending to peruse books. But he was rumbled after some noticed he never changed his clothes, was pretending to read books and often fell asleep and began snoring. Fooled: The homeless man is believed to have slept at a St John's College library for six weeks before being kicked out . University authorities were alerted and he was ordered to leave by a porter after he could not prove he was a student. One member of the college said on Twitter the man had been 'living under the radar' for six weeks but has not been seen since. It is believed the man was homeless and simply seeking a warm place to spend the night. The front door of St John's Working Library is unlocked when staffed, but locked outside these hours. However students can get in and out of the library 24-hours a day, seven days a week, using their access card. 'One member of the college said on Twitter the man had been 'living under the radar' for six weeks but has not been seen since.' Students told The Cambridge Student newspaper he was frequently seen flicking through books in the History section, using the computer, but mostly seemed to be 'trying to look busy'. Second year St John's medical student Casey Swerner said the mystery man approached her once and made vague claims of working on a PhD on the topic of 'how we perceive religious identity'. Another, Ben Brindley, said: 'He used to pace around. He brought Sainsbury's bags in and ate there, and never changed his clothes.' First year natural sciences student Charlie Dowell told the Daily Telegraph: 'People said he pretended to read things and would fall asleep in the audio-visual room. 'It's very English that it took weeks of students complaining among themselves, but to the right person, before he was kicked out.' A spokesman for St John's College said: 'The presence of a male in the library was reported to the porters who asked him to leave when he was unable to identify himself as a student of the college. He has not been seen in St John's subsequently.'

chatgpt: An unwelcome visitor recently disrupted the peace at St John's College library, as a non-student allegedly tailgated students to gain access to the facility. The interloper reportedly made himself at home inside the library, rummaging through the shelves and even using a computer to carry out his activities.  According to eyewitnesses, the intruder flicked through books in the History aisle and used a computer for a long while without interruption. He even appeared to have fallen asleep at one point, adding insult to injury. Sources claim that the man appeared to be in his late 20s and was wearing casual clothing, including a hoodie and jeans.  However, the man was eventually spotted by library staff who asked him to provide proof that he was a student at St John's College. When he was unable to do so, he was asked to leave the premises immediately.  The incident has sparked concerns among students, who are calling for increased security measures at the library. "It's concerning to think that anyone can just walk in and use the library without being a student," one student said. "It makes you wonder who else has been able to do this and what they were doing while they were here." The college has released a statement in response to the incident, assuring students that it is taking security very seriously. "We are aware of the incident that took place at the library and we can confirm that the individual in question was not a student at St John's College," the statement reads. "We are currently reviewing our security protocols to ensure that this does not happen again in the future." This is not the first time that the St John's College library has been the site of such an incident. In 2018, a man was arrested for stealing books from the facility, highlighting the need for enhanced security measures.  While the college may be taking measures to enhance security at the library, students are encouraged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behavior they may witness. As the incident illustrates, anyone can gain access to the facility, posing potential dangers to the college community.
