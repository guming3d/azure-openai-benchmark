Critics say servicemen and women in the TA are not 'like for like' replacements of the armed services and say the reforms risk creating a 'Dad's Army'. Army: Soldiers in the Territorial Army are 35 years old on average, figures show (file picture) The Telegraph reports the average TA soldier is three years older than the average age of a first time dad in the UK, who is 32. Ministry of Defence plans to increase reservist troops from 11,000 to 30,000 by 2018 to make up for the cuts to the regular army have come under criticism. The MoD figures show the average age of senior TA officers is 51, junior officers are 42 and senior and junior NCOs are 46 and 38. In comparison, regular army officers are 37 years old and other ranks average at 29. Questions: John Baron, Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, raised questions about the plans . John Baron, Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, raised questions about the Government's plans. He told the Telegraph: 'The resulting capability gaps, the strong prospect of fals economies and a substantially older Army suggest the risks far outweigh any benefits.' Earlier this year, campaigners warned controversial plans to replace thousands of full-time soldiers with reservists risks creating a new wave of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim is to reduce the number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018 - an army small enough to fit inside Wembley Stadium - while doubling the number of reservists to 30,000. But experts said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond's proposals could see a massive increase in the number of troops seeking help for severe psychological trauma. An MoD spokesman said: 'Reservists have always been slightly older than their Regular counterparts, partly because they carry out so many specialist roles that require years of experience. 'However we are transforming our Reserve, strengthening its requirements and reversing its decline over the last decade. 'As part of this we are running sustained recruitment campaigns aimed at young people and are introducing higher fitness and deployability requirements. We expect that these measures will mean the average age of our Army Reserve will fall slightly.'

chatgpt: The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has plans to increase the number of reservist troops from 11,000 to 30,000 soldiers by 2018. However, critics have pointed out concerns over the age and experience levels of reservist soldiers. According to recent figures, reservists are on average six years older than regular soldiers. This has raised concerns over whether they are an adequate ‘like for like’ replacement for regular troops. The MoD has argued that it is essential to increase the number of reservists given ongoing fiscal constraints. However, critics argue that any cost savings may come at a higher price with the potential for reduced combat capabilities. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon recently acknowledged the concerns around the age of reservists, but he also highlighted the importance of experience in military operations. He stated that many reservists had valuable skills and experiences that regular troops may lack, and that they served well alongside their regular counterparts. Fallon also emphasised the need to recruit more women and to increase diversity within the ranks of the military, including among reservists. The MoD has set itself a target of 15% of reservists being women by 2020. Despite these concerns, the MoD is pressing ahead with plans to expand the role of the reserves in future military operations. The government sees the reserves as a more cost-effective solution to meeting future threats and challenges, while also reducing the burden on regular troops. The government has also introduced a range of measures to support reservists in their roles. This includes initiatives to help employers of reservists better manage their work commitments and military deployment needs. The success of these measures will depend on the willingness of the public and private sector employers to support reservists in their military roles. It will also depend on the ability of reservists to meet the physical and mental demands of military operations. Overall, the expansion of the role of the reserves is likely to be a key component of the UK’s military strategy in the coming years. However, the government will need to address concerns over the age and experience of reservist soldiers, as well as wider issues around recruitment and retention, to ensure that the reserves are an effective and valuable complement to regular troops.
