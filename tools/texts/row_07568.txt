article: Need for Speed games can be hit and miss. For every Hot Pursuit, there’s a wrong turn such as The Run. It seems that every time they start to over complicate and stray away from their core gameplay, they lose a huge chunk of what makes them appealing to race fans. That being fast, frenetic, no-holds-barred racing. Fast and the furious: if rivals start giving you a hard time, use your Evasion Tech to stop them in their tracks . And that’s exactly what Need for Speed Rivals promises to offer in spades. Developed by EA’s newest studio, Ghost Games, and powered by the Frostbite™ 3 game engine, Rivals is set in the fictional Redview County. In Rivals, gamers play as either a cop or racer, where each side of the law has its own set of high stakes challenges, rewards and consequences. As a racer, the goal is to become infamous for taking risks behind the wheel and capturing your most intense escapes on video for the world to see. Chase is on: some of the world's most powerful supercars feature in the game - and all have their own strengths and weaknesses . The more cops players evade, the more Speed Points they collect, enabling them to unlock new cars and items. As a cop, players work together as part of a team in pursuit of racers, earning prominence and rising in the ranks of the Police Force with every bust. Achieving higher ranks unlocks new police only cars and more powerful Pursuit Tech. Thankfully, there’s more customisation than ever before – with paintjobs, custom licence plates, decals, rims and performance upgrades all available. Plus, with 11 upgradeable Pursuit and Evasion Tech items – such as turbo boosts, jammers, EMPs and roadblocks, expect plenty of brutal vehicular warfare. Dodge this: the Charger, famed for its brutal, uncompromising nature, is sure to be a favourite with fans . You can even save certain configurations to ensure you have the best tools for each scenario. Ferrari also makes its long-awaited return to the Need for Speed franchise, notably the stunning F13 berlinetta. At the heart of Need for Speed Rivals is AllDrive, an innovative new online feature that allows a  seamless transition from playing alone, to playing with friends. There’s also an improved Autolog system that lets you compare stats and challenges with friends. It’s set for release on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC on November 19, and is penned for next-gen later this year. Agree with Talal? Follow us on Twitter: @DailyMailGames and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games.
