article: Australian Scott Hend edged Angelo Que in a play-off to clinch his maiden European Tour title at the Hong Kong Open. A par on the first extra hole was enough to steer the 41-year-old past the Filipino, who missed the green on the 18th and then over-hit his chip. Que's fourth-round 66 forced the play-off after an intense back-nine battle, which ended with his birdie on the 18th tying things up with Hend at 13 under par. Hend holds the trophy aloft after completing his first win on the European Tour at the age of 41 . The Australian consoles Angelo Que after beating the Filipino on an 18th hole play-off in Honk Kong . But the 35-year-old will be left lamenting the fact that his three bogeys on the day - to Hend's two - and a costly second-round 69 ultimately cost him victory. Aged 41, Hend is the oldest first-time European Tour title winner since Cesar Monasterio, who was 42 when he won the 2006 As St Omer Open. He was understandably thrilled to secure victory, but he felt bad for Que after his bogey sealed the play-off. "I felt quite calm, the only thing is that hole at the end you never want to have a go at the pin because you can make a bogey quite easily so I wasn't really sure how to play it," Hend told the European Tour website. Herd became the oldest man to win his maiden Tour title sinceÂ Cesar Monasterio in 2006 . Que played well to force a play-off but will regret his three bogeys in a round of 66 that left him on 13 under . "Unfortunately Angelo made a bogey, I would have rather one of us made a birdie because he's a great guy and it would be nice to earn the win on a positive note. But I'll take the win and I'm ecstatic." Overnight leader Marcus Fraser's double bogey on the opening hole blew the title race open and he struggled to get back in the mix with back-to-back bogeys on the 14th and 15th holes. The 35-year-old also bogeyed the play-off hole, meaning Herd's par was enough to take the title . Irishman Kevin Phelan had more success on the back nine, hitting three birdies in a row from the 16th to the 18th, but he finished on 11 under - two shots behind Hend and Que. Englishman Mark Foster's double-bogey on the ninth dented his progress and he finished one shot behind Phelan, while Fraser ended up in a four-strong cluster four shots off the pace after a disappointing final round of 72.

chatgpt: Australian golfer, Scott Hend, has become the oldest first-time winner on the Asian Tour in eight years, after he ousted Filipino, Angelo Que, with an extra-hole during the iconic Bangkok Golf Club's True Thailand Classic. Hend finished a 13-under-par 275 to match his tournament rival Que, who also carded the same score. After both players halved the 18th hole in regulation, the pair ended up with a playoff on the 18th again, where Hend eventually emerged victorious. Following the win, Hend, who is 41 years old, shared that he was "ecstatic." The Australian player also led during the second round, before falling behind Que in the third. Hend kept his nerve to come from behind and force the playoff against Que, who had been looking to take home his third Asian Tour title. Despite being pipped at the post, Que was gracious in defeat, stating that he had played well and had no regrets. The win comes as a significant milestone for Hend after a 20-year professional career that included 18 victories, including two on the European Tour. Hend remains a popular figure in the golf community, and this win is a testament to his determination and perseverance, with Hend thanking his sponsors and his family for their unwavering support in his journey as a golfer. The True Thailand Classic, which is part of the Asian Tour, is a hotly contested event that features some of the world's leading golfers. Other top performers included Thailand's Prom Meesawat and Masahiro Kawamura of Japan. Both finished just one shot adrift of the leading pair with a total score of 12 under.

The win puts Hend in good stead for the upcoming events, including the European Tour's British Masters and the Porsche European Open, both of which he is expected to participate in. This latest victory is sure to boost Hend's confidence, and we look forward to watching him perform at his best in the upcoming tournaments.
