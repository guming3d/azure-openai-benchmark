Isakin Jonsson, a self-professed Satanist, has admitted to eating the remains of a mother of five, while Michelle Gustafsson stands accused of killing a man and drinking his blood. The disturbing details of the case have caused outrage and disbelief across the country, with many questioning how such depravity could exist in their midst. Jonsson, who hails from the nearby town of Lulea, reportedly posted graphic images and descriptions of the act on the internet, proudly displaying his "trophy" to a group of like-minded individuals. Authorities have yet to release the identity of the victim or the exact circumstances surrounding her death, but sources close to the investigation suggest that Jonsson and the woman had met online and had arranged to meet in person. It is believed that Jonsson lured her to his home, where he then carried out his grisly deed. Meanwhile, Gustafsson is accused of committing her crime in the nearby town of Boden. According to reports, she and the victim knew each other prior to the incident, and had some sort of romantic involvement. It is not clear what led her to carry out such a brutal act, but authorities have described it as a "premeditated" killing. The case has sparked widespread debate about mental health care in the country, with many questioning whether the suspects had been failed by the system. Local officials have refused to comment on their treatment history, citing patient confidentiality laws. In the wake of the arrests, there has also been speculation about whether the couple's upcoming wedding will be allowed to take place. While authorities have not made an official announcement, sources suggest that the ceremony may be postponed or cancelled altogether due to the severity of the charges against them. As the investigation continues, the small town of Piteo is left grappling with the repercussions of these heinous crimes. Many residents have expressed shock and horror at what has transpired, with some describing the events as "unbelievable" and "terrifying". For now, the community is left to mourn the loss of two innocent lives, and to grapple with the disturbing implications of this case for years to come.
