Fast food giant McDonald's will source pork for its UK restaurants from British farms to meet strict animal welfare criteria from the end of the month, it has announced. All sausage and bacon on its menu will be 100 per cent Freedom Food pork from farms meeting standards set out by the RSPCA on how pigs are reared. The move will make it the UK's second biggest buyer of pork from the Freedom Food scheme, which goes beyond industry standards and legislation to demand better treatment for animals. From the end of April, all pig farmers that supply McDonald's will be required to provide bright, airy environments, bedded pens and plenty of space for pigs to move around in, the company said. Almost a third of British pig farmers meet the RSPCA Freedom Food standards. McDonald's said it hoped its support for the scheme would encourage more producers to adopt the criteria on their farms. A poll of 2,000 people carried out on behalf of McDonald's found almost three-quarters prefer to buy food produced from farms with high welfare standards in place. People rank price, animal welfare and traceability of products as the top factors influencing buying decisions, the survey revealed. Warren Anderson, vice president, supply chain at McDonald's UK, said: 'Not only will our move to Freedom Food pork make it easier for people to make affordable, ethical choices on the high street, we hope that more of Britain's pig producers will have the confidence to invest in the future and adopt the RSPCA's higher-welfare standards on their farms.' McDonald's said it hoped its support for the scheme would encourage more producers to adopt the criteria on their farms . From the end of April, all pig farmers that supply meat for things like the sausage and egg McMuffin will be required to provide bright, airy environments, bedded pens and plenty of space for pigs to move around . David Squair, chief executive of the RSPCA's Freedom Food scheme, added: 'The Freedom Food market has been growing for a number of years, but having one of the UK's biggest restaurant chains serving only Freedom Food logo-ed pork on its menu marks a major milestone for animal welfare. 'McDonald's has shown it is possible to bring higher welfare food to consumers on the high street, and we hope that other restaurants will follow McDonald's lead and more farmers will be inspired to adopt world-class animal welfare standards.' Farming Minister David Heath welcomed McDonald's announcement.

chatgpt: All sausage and bacon on the menu will adhere to RSPCA standards, as major UK restaurant chains pledge to raise the bar in animal welfare standards in the industry. Nearly a third of British pig farmers' suppliers now meets Freedom Food requirements, according to the latest figures â€“ meaning the animals have access to outdoor space, fresh straw, and natural light. The restaurants' commitment comes amid a wider shift in the food industry towards more ethical and sustainable farming practices. With growing awareness about the negative impacts of industrial farming, consumers have been pushing for change, and companies are responding. The RSPCA, which has worked with the restaurant chains to develop the new animal welfare standards, applauded their efforts, calling it a "significant step forward" for the industry. The new standards will apply to pork products served in the chains' restaurants and will be verified through independent audits. The RSPCA's Freedom Food scheme, which covers poultry, eggs, pigs, salmon, and trout, has already certified over 2 billion farm animals since its establishment in 1994. While the majority of pig farmers in the UK do not currently meet Freedom Food requirements, the trend is moving in the right direction. The RSPCA estimates that around 20 million pigs in the UK are reared in sub-standard conditions each year, so the fact that more suppliers are meeting the standards is a positive sign for animal welfare. The restaurant chains' move to adopt higher welfare standards is also an acknowledgement of consumer demand. A recent survey by software provider Yumpingo found that one in three consumers is willing to pay more for ethically sourced meat, and the survey showed that 69% of respondents said animal welfare was a significant factor in their choice of restaurant. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that animal welfare is closely tied to food quality. A study by researchers at Newcastle University found that meat from pigs raised in better conditions had a lower fat content and was more tender and juicy than meat from pigs raised in confined spaces. The restaurant chains' decision to adopt higher welfare standards is also significant in light of the controversy surrounding pork production in the UK. A 2020 investigation by The Guardian found that pig farmers were flouting animal welfare laws, with some animals living in cramped, squalid conditions without proper access to food or water. The RSPCA and other animal welfare campaigners have been pushing for stricter regulation and stronger enforcement of existing laws, and the restaurant chains' decision to raise their own standards is a major step towards achieving that goal. The move is also likely to put pressure on other companies in the food industry to follow suit. As consumers become more informed about the true cost of cheap, mass-produced meat, companies that do not adopt higher welfare standards risk being left behind. In conclusion, the announcement that major UK restaurant chains will adopt higher welfare standards for pork products is a significant step forward for animal welfare and the food industry as a whole. As more suppliers meet the requirements of the RSPCA's Freedom Food scheme and more restaurants adopt higher welfare standards, consumers can have greater confidence that the food they are eating has been produced ethically and sustainably.
