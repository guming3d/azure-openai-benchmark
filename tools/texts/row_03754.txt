article: (CNN) -- The plane is only in the shot for a few seconds. But in that time, it goes from just another small aircraft landing at a Colorado airport to a horrific fireball. New video from the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport may provide clues about what went wrong on January 5 when the crash killed a co-pilot. Two other people on board the small plane were injured. The black-and-white video shows the plane exploding in flames the instant it touches the ground. As the scorched aircraft continues down the runway, it leaves a long trail of fire shooting into the sky. The airport released images from five infrared cameras in response to an open records request filed by Aspen Journalism, which provided the video to CNN. Witnesses said the plane flipped over, and photos showed the plane upside down on the tarmac, its fuselage charred. The pilot of the twin-engine jet had reported high winds during a previous attempt to land, according to a recording of the air traffic control radio transmission obtained by CNN through FlightAware.com, a flight-tracking website. "Missed approach, N115WF.Â  33 knots of tail wind," the pilot is heard saying a few minutes before the crash. FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer said the Bombardier Challenger 600 was coming from Tucson, Arizona. The plane originated from Toluca, Mexico, roughly 40 miles west of Mexico City, according to Flightaware. The deceased co-pilot was identified as 54-year-old Sergio Carranza Brabata of Mexico. The Pitkin County coroner listed the preliminary cause of death as blunt force trauma. The injured -- the pilot and another co-pilot flying as a passenger -- were hospitalized with "moderate to severe injuries," said Alex Burchetta of the county Sheriff's Office. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation. Two celebrities who were at the small airport in the Aspen ski resort area posted Twitter messages saying they witnessed the crash. "So sad! Horrible plane crash we just saw happen at the Aspen airport," singer LeAnn Rimes tweeted. Comedian Kevin Nealon tweeted: "Horrible plane crash here at Aspen airport. Exploded into flames as it was landing. I think it was a private jet. Fire truck and ambulances were on the scene within minutes." The Aspen airport is known as a challenging place for pilots to land because of the mountains that surround the runway. The airport tarmac is often filled with private planes owned or chartered by the wealthy and famous who own vacation homes in the mountain resort community. "Airport is closed now," Nealon tweeted after the crash. "I think I'll drive back to LA after seeing that." Small plane makes forced landing on Bronx highway .

chatgpt: A tragic plane crash at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport has left a co-pilot dead, and an investigation underway by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The incident occurred on Thursday afternoon, when a small cargo plane missed its first attempt to land due to high winds. According to radio traffic, the pilot reported struggling with the plane's descent, and opted to make a second attempt. Unfortunately, during its second approach, the plane hit the runway, exploding into flames upon impact. The co-pilot, a 54-year-old from Mexico, was killed in the crash. The pilot miraculously survived the ordeal, and was rushed to hospital for treatment. Footage of the incident has surfaced online, showing the terrifying moment the plane crashed. The video captures the small aircraft coming into view, before hitting the runway and quickly bursting into flames. Onlookers can be heard screaming and shouting as the incident unfolds, as emergency services rush to the scene to put out the flames and tend to the injured pilot. The NTSB has launched an investigation into the crash, with officials arriving at the scene shortly after the incident occurred. Investigators spent several hours combing through the wreckage, collecting evidence and examining the remains of the plane. A spokesperson from the NTSB confirmed that the investigation would focus on the weather conditions at the time of the crash, as well as the mechanical condition of the aircraft. This incident marks the latest in a series of aviation accidents in recent months, which has raised questions surrounding the safety standards of the aviation industry. Just two weeks ago, a military helicopter crashed in New York, killing three National Guard members on board. Earlier this year, a passenger plane crashed in Indonesia, killing all 62 people on board. Aviation regulations require strict adherence to safety procedures, and the NTSB investigation will undoubtedly focus on whether all protocols were followed leading up to the crash. It is also expected that they will examine whether the high winds and weather conditions played any role in the incident. The tragedy has sent shockwaves through the aviation community, and condolences have been pouring in for the family and friends of the co-pilot who lost his life in the crash. The pilot who survived the ordeal is said to be in a stable condition, and is expected to make a full recovery. As the investigation into this latest aviation accident continues, many will be looking to the NTSB for answers and reassurance that measures are being taken to ensure the safety of passengers and crew across the industry. Meanwhile, tributes continue to pour in for the co-pilot at the center of this latest tragedy.
