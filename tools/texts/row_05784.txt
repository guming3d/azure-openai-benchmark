In the diet commercials of ad land portions are small and the women pushing the products even smaller. Cheesy clips of pretty girls bouncing around eating yoghurt and chatting over a lunch of lettuce leaves are the norm as food companies try to convince us that we are all too fat and should rush immediately to the supermarket to stock up on lo-cal foods. Now one Irish food brand has embraced the superficial stereotypes of these TV commercials and created a parody of the perfect women of ad land for, er, a clever new TV commercial. Muffin Gal, Smug Gal and Ditzy Gal are the three stars of a new parody of diet product commercials . Smug Gal, Ditzy Gal and Muffin Gal are the stars of the film, . Smug Gal nibbles crackers all day and bounces around on a red and white bed in her skinny jeans, Ditzy Gal loves to dance around with a yoghurt pot and Muffin Gal is obsessed with her weight and even more obsessed with cake. All three of them seem to be nauseatingly happy as they deny themselves calories and sweet treats to concentrate on their waist lines. The one minute clip opens with another deliriously happy woman singing: 'Here are the girls from ad land, selling diet dreams from *insert brand*. Prancing around with a yoghurt pot, or size zero models losing the plot.' Smug Girl looks so good in her bikini that she wears it to work . Ditzy Gal just can't get enough of her diet yoghurt, jumping on tables in front of colleages and dancing around her flat to show how excited she is . The spoof ad continues along the theme showing one of the women presenting to a board meeting in a bikini, while the others hold magnifying glasses to their love handles or pinch an inch around their hips, thighs and stomachs. The insanely happy voice-over woman continues: 'Chocolate cake, you've got to resist ... because women and muffins can't co-exist' before the ad finally cuts to a piece of text reading 'Sick of cliches? So are we' and a product shot of low fat cheese brand Kerry LowLow. Yes, it's still an advert for another diet product, but at least it gives the viewer food for thought. Sick of cliches? Kerry LowLow hopes that the tongue in cheek advert will encourage women to buy their diet products .
