chatgpt: Newcastle United manager, Alan Pardew, has expressed his interest in French striker Loic Remy. The forward managed to score 14 goals in 24 starts for Newcastle on loan last season, which helped the club finish 10th in the Premier League. Pardew is keen to bring Remy back to St. James’ Park and has been vocal about his interest in the striker. Remy is currently in limbo after his dream move to Liverpool fell through. The Reds had agreed a deal to sign Remy from QPR, but the move fell apart due to concerns about the player's medical. The 27-year-old is now back at Queens Park Rangers, with his future uncertain. Newcastle will face competition from other Premier League clubs for Remy’s signature. The striker is still highly regarded by many clubs in England, and his proven goal-scoring record makes him a valuable asset. However, Pardew remains confident that Newcastle have a good chance of signing Remy. “We’re still interested in Loic Remy. He was brilliant for us last season and we’d love to have him back. It’s no secret that we’re in the market for a striker and Remy fits the bill perfectly. He’s a proven goalscorer and would improve any team he plays for”, said Pardew. It remains to be seen where Remy will play next season, but Newcastle are in pole position to sign the striker if they can agree a deal with Queens Park Rangers. The Frenchman’s time in England has been impressive so far, and there is no doubt that he would be a valuable addition to any Premier League side.
