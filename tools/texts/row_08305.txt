article: (CNN) -- The body of a University of Georgia professor accused of killing three people was found Saturday buried in woods near Athens, Georgia, authorities said. George Zinkhan, a professor at the University of Georgia, disappeared after the slayings of his wife and two others. George Zinkhan, 57, is suspected of fatally shooting his wife and two other people last month outside a community theater in Athens, which is home to the University of Georgia. Cadaver dogs discovered the body with two guns in a wooded area of northwest Clarke County, about a mile from where Zinkhan's red Jeep Liberty was found last week, Athens-Clarke Police Chief Joseph Lumpkin said. Athens-Clarke County police confirmed the identity of the body, citing results from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The guns are like those authorities believe were used in the shootings, Lumpkin said. The body was found "beneath the earth," Lumpkin said, without any clothes. "A person who's not accustomed to the woods would never have found the body," he said. Significant "efforts" were undertaken to conceal the body's location, Jim Fullington of the GBI said. Authorities say Zinkhan fatally shot Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney, Tom Tanner, 40, and Ben Teague, 63, on April 25. The victims all were associated with the Town and Gown Players, a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings. Zinkhan arrived while the Town and Gown event was under way and got into a disagreement with his wife, police said. Police believe he went to his car -- where the couple's children apparently were waiting -- and returned with two handguns. In addition to the three deaths, two other people were wounded, police said. After the shooting, Zinkhan left with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- in the car, police said. He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived, and left the children with the neighbor. Authorities put out bulletins across the nation for Zinkhan after the shootings and revealed that he had purchased a May 2 ticket in March to the Netherlands, where he owns a house. The day of the flight passed without any sign of Zinkhan. He had been an endowed marketing professor at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business. The university fired Zinkhan the day after the shootings. CNN's Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Efforts were made to conceal the body found by cadaver dogs searching for George Zinkhan, the University of Georgia professor suspected of killing his wife and two others. The body, found buried in the woods, was unclothed and had guns with it, according to the police. The body was found a little over a mile away from Zinkhan's abandoned Jeep, which had been discovered earlier in the week. Zinkhan was believed to have been on the run since the killings, which took place at a local community theater where his wife, Marie Bruce, was a board member. The identity of the body has not been released, and the police have not indicated whether they believe it is connected to the Zinkhan case. However, the discovery of guns with the body has raised suspicions that it may have been involved in the killings. The investigation into the Zinkhan case has been ongoing since the shootings occurred on April 25th, 2009. Zinkhan, a respected professor and researcher, had been scheduled to attend a faculty meeting that morning but instead drove to the theater where he shot Bruce and two others before fleeing the scene. The police have been searching for Zinkhan ever since, but his disappearance has proven elusive. The discovery of the body in the woods, however, may provide a new lead in the investigation. The police have stated that they are continuing to search the surrounding area and ask anyone with information about Zinkhan's whereabouts to come forward. The community has been shocked by the killings, which have left a sense of unease in the normally quiet town. Zinkhan was known as a reserved and intelligent man, and his sudden and violent actions have left many questioning what may have led to his actions. In the wake of the tragedy, the University of Georgia community has come together to mourn the loss of Bruce and the other victims. A memorial service was held for them, and a scholarship fund has been established in their memory. As the investigation into the Zinkhan case continues, the community remains on edge, hoping for answers to the questions that have arisen from this tragedy. The discovery of the body in the woods may provide some clarity, but until the identity of the person is released, the town remains in a state of uncertainty.
