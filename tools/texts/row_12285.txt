article: (CNN) -- The English Premier League (EPL) have confirmed they will vehemently oppose a new move by a supporters' association to bring back standing at football matches. Following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death on terracing, it was made law in England for all top-flight stadiums to be made all-seater -- although terraces are still common place in the lower divisions. However, many supporters believe that the banning of standing up at football grounds has resulted in the atmosphere becoming diluted -- prompting the  180,000-member Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) to launch an online petition calling for the return of standing areas in the top division. Speaking to the official English Premier League website, EPL spokesman Dan Johnson said: "Our view is that the benefits of all-seater stadia far outweigh the return of standing areas. "They have led to more women and children attending the games and, no matter how safe standiing can be made, seating is always safer. We will not be encouraging the Government to change the law," he added. The FSF held a meeting on Monday with representatives from the police, the Government and footballing authorities, with their chairman Malcolm Clarke arguing that many fans still stand up despite having a seat. However, British Sport's Minister Hugh Robertson told the meeting: "Should we return to terracing, then the first time there is any significant crowd trouble, or an accident, the minister's head would be on a spike at Tower Bridge before he could draft a resignation letter!" The FSF has cited the German Bundesliga, where terraces are widespread, resulting in packed stadia and cheaper tickets, as a good example of how standing can be safer at matches. Standing is also still very much evident in Argentina and Brazil, where the most fervent supporters adorn their own respective terraces in club colours, making for a noisy, passionate, and at times, intimidating atmosphere.

chatgpt: The English Premier League has publicly opposed a petition aimed at bringing back standing at football matches, citing safety concerns. The move comes in response to a campaign led by the Football Supporters' Federation, which is calling for the reintroduction of terracing at top-flight games. The issue has been a controversial one for many years, with some fans arguing that standing is an essential element of football culture. However, others point to the horrific tragedy that occurred at Hillsborough in 1989, in which 96 people were killed due to overcrowding and lack of safety measures. Following the disaster, all-seater stadia were made compulsory in the UK, and the Premier League says it has no intention of allowing a return to standing areas. In a statement, the league said: "We support the current legislation and our position remains one of maintaining the safety and security of supporters at all times." The FSF has argued that modern technology and safety features mean that standing areas can be reintroduced safely. The group also points to examples from other countries where standing is permitted, such as Germany and Scotland. However, despite their efforts, the petition calling for standing to return has been met with resistance from both the Premier League and the government. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: "The government is committed to ensuring that all football fans can enjoy the game in safety. We have no plans to change the current legislation." In response, the FSF has vowed to keep fighting for the right of fans to stand at matches. A spokesperson for the group said: "The overwhelming majority of supporters want to see standing return, and we will continue to make our case to the authorities. We believe that with the right safety measures in place, it is possible to reintroduce standing in a safe and controlled way." Despite these arguments, it seems unlikely that a return to standing will be permitted any time soon. The Hillsborough disaster remains a painful memory for many, and the government and Premier League both seem determined not to compromise on safety.
