article: Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said the austerity drive has not gone far enough . It will take at least 20 years before the economy recovers its pre-recession strength, Britain’s top civil servant has warned. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said the austerity drive has not gone far enough and stressed it will continue for years. He said there was a ‘very long way to go’ before the economy returns to the same level as before the 2007 recession. ‘This is not a two-year project or a five-year project. 'This is a ten-year project, a 20-year  generational battle to beef up the economy in ways that we have not seen for many, many decades,’ he said. Sir Jeremy’s remarks were made to Civil Service Live, a convention for mandarins in west London. He told them: ‘There is a very, very long way to go. We were reminded only last week that the economy as a whole remains about 4 per cent below the size that it was in 2008. ‘Five years on from the bottom of the recession we have still not even near recovered all the output we lost in that terribly deep recession that we suffered in 2007-08. ‘Those are really daunting numbers that just show the size of the challenge; there is no alternative.’ He added: ‘There have been years of austerity, years of pay freezes, of pay restraint; every part of government has been told by ministers — and rightly so — to hunt out waste and tackle inefficiencies. ‘But despite all these efforts we have made over the last three years … our debt/GDP ratio is still rising, debt interest payments are rising. ‘There is still an enormous amount of work to get that deficit down to a balanced level to get the debt/GDP level falling rather than rising.’ He also warned that steering the economy away from financial services towards manufacturing was ‘much easier said than done’. Praise: Sir Jeremy described the new Bank of England governor Mark  Carney as 'the world's most impressive central banker' His gloomy prediction contrasts with recent market data which showed that UK manufacturing saw its strongest growth in two years in June. The UK economy also grew by 0.3 per cent  in the first three months of the year. This week, Bank of England figures also showed the highest mortgage approval rates for three and a half years. Sir Jeremy had more positive predictions for the new Bank of England governor Mark  Carney. He said the Canadian was ‘the world’s most impressive central banker’. He added: ‘We will give him every support he needs.’

chatgpt: Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood spoke at the Civil Service Live convention in West London on Wednesday, stating that the government's austerity drive has not gone far enough. Heywood argued that more cuts are necessary, highlighting the need for departments to reduce their headcount and cut their budgets even further in order to remain within their financial limits. Speaking to a packed audience of civil servants, Heywood said that the current austerity measures had already done a lot of work in reducing the government's deficit, but that the job was not yet complete. He underlined that the only way to achieve a balanced budget and a sustainable economy was to carry on with the cuts, whilst ensuring that public services remained efficient and effective. Heywood's speech received mixed reactions from the attending mandarins, with some expressing concern over the negative impact that further cuts could have on already stretched public services. Others, however, voiced their agreement with Heywood, stating that more needed to be done to address the country's fiscal challenges. During the convention, Heywood also discussed the government's plans for making the civil service more efficient and modern. He emphasised the need for departments to adapt to new technologies and for civil servants to develop new skills that will be necessary in the future. Heywood highlighted the government's commitment to digital transformation and the importance of data in public service delivery. He urged departments to make use of data analytics to improve their services and cut costs. The Cabinet Secretary's comments come amid growing pressure on the government to address the issue of public sector pay. With inflation rates rising, public sector workers are struggling to make ends meet. Heywood acknowledged the difficulties faced by those employed in the public sector but made clear that the country's financial situation could not be ignored. In his view, the government must "stay the course" and focus on reducing the deficit, even if that means further hardships for public sector workers. Heywood's speech was met with a mixed reception from the media. Some news outlets praised the Cabinet Secretary for his honesty and pragmatism, whilst others criticised his apparent lack of empathy for public sector workers. Nevertheless, Heywood's message was clear: the government must continue to make difficult decisions if it is to achieve its long-term fiscal goals. Whether the country's public sector workers will agree with this remains to be seen.
