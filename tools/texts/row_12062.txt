article: ANTALYA, Turkey (CNN) -- Two men who hijacked a Turkish passenger jet have surrendered to authorities after releasing the remaining passengers and crew they had been holding hostage. The passenger jet was en route from Northern Cyprus to Istanbul. The hijacking occurred earlier on Saturday when the Istanbul-bound Atlasjet Airlines flight from Cyprus was forced to make an emergency landing in southeastern Turkish city of Antalya after the hijackers claimed to have a bomb. Most of those aboard had managed to escape soon after landing, but four passengers and two crew members had been held as hostages, local government officials said. "The adventure that started early in the morning finally came to an end," Atlasjet CEO Tuncay Doganer told reporters. "With the two hijackers having surrendered, the incident ended with no bloodshed." The other 132 passengers and four crew members had fled to safety from the plane's emergency exits as the hijackers were releasing children and women. TV footage showed passengers running from the plane's side and back doors. The Turkish Ministry of Transportation said the pilots escaped through the cockpit windows. Turkish Interior Minister Osman Gunes said one of the hijackers was Turkish while the other had a Syrian passport but may have been Palestinian, Reuters reported. A civil aviation official said it was unclear whether the hijackers did have a bomb but that they appeared to have been armed with a knife. Witnesses said the incident started shortly after the flight had taken off from Ercan airport in Turkish-recognized Northern Cyprus when two men from the back of the plane rushed to the front and tried to break open the cockpit door. When their attempts failed, witnesses said the men began talking to the flight attendants in a mix of Arabic and English and asked to be taken to either Iran or Syria. Passenger Ercan Tekkan told Reuters the hijackers had said they did not want to hurt anyone. "The plane made some maneuvers and we thought the plane was going to crash ... Then the plane landed and the pilots escaped from the cockpit while the hijackers kept kicking the cockpit door," he said. Barkin Inan, another passenger, said the experience had been "terrifying." "They looked anxious and were sweating. They went towards the cockpit. I shouted 'hijackers' to warn the other passengers but most of them were asleep," he said. Antalya Governor Alaaddin Yuksel told reporters that one of the men had claimed to be a member of al Qaeda, Reuters reported. Police also arrested a passenger suspected of being linked to the hijackers, he said. E-mail to a friend . Reuters contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Two men who hijacked a Turkish passenger jet and took four passengers and two crew members hostage surrendered to authorities after the plane made an emergency landing. The plane was an Atlasjet flight bound for Istanbul, and witnesses claim the hijackers claimed to have a bomb as the plane left Cyprus. The hijackers took control of the plane shortly after takeoff from Ercan Airport in northern Cyprus. They threatened to blow up the plane and demanded that it be diverted to Iran. However, the pilots managed to send out a distress signal, and Turkish F-16 fighter jets escorted the plane back to Cyprus. The hijackers kept the hostages on board throughout the tense standoff, which lasted for several hours. Negotiations between the hijackers and authorities were carried out through a Turkish Cypriot official. Finally, the hijackers agreed to surrender after authorities promised to provide them with a guarantee of safe passage. As the hijackers surrendered and were taken into custody by authorities, the released hostages were taken to a hospital in Cyprus for medical checks. The passengers and crew members were evacuated to safety, and were reported to be safe and well. The Turkish authorities praised the professionalism and courage shown by the crew of the Atlasjet flight, and the coordinated efforts of Turkish and Cypriot law enforcement agencies in bringing the situation to a peaceful conclusion. This hijacking is a reminder of the ongoing threat of terrorism in the region, and the importance of maintaining high levels of security at airports and on airlines. While the hijackers did not manage to carry out their threats, it is clear that they were prepared to put the lives of innocent passengers and crew members at risk in pursuit of their goals. The incident is also a testament to the bravery and professionalism of the pilots and crew members who, despite the threat of violence and danger, were able to keep their cool and follow the appropriate protocols to ensure the safety of everyone on board. Passengers on the Atlasjet flight were relieved to have made it back to Cyprus safely, but the disruption caused by the hijacking is likely to have a lasting impact on their memories of the flight. It is hoped that the authorities will be able to bring the hijackers to justice and provide a sense of closure for all those involved.
