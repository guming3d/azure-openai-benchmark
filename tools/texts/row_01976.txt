Limited pieces from the line - designed in partnership with Mrs Toledo's husband and famed illustrator Ruben Toledo - are currently available in Lane Bryant stores, as well as on the retailer's site. In an interview with Fashionista.com, Mrs Toledo expressed how she feels it’s her ‘duty’ to provide larger-sized women with ‘eccentric’ and fashionable clothing. ‘The liberty, the freedom, the right to be eccentric, to be their size, and to have the freedom or opportunity to enjoy fashion at any size…I can’t imagine not having that, so I feel a duty to provide it,’ she said.

Mrs Toledo explained that ‘When I came to realize, the one thing I can do with Lane Bryant, they’ve got the size, they’ve got the proportion. ‘I was free to design without worrying about getting it right.’ The collection represents a growing push by Lane Bryant to offer its customers more fashionable designs.

chatgpt: Isabel Toledo, a Cuban-American fashion designer, passed away on Monday, August 26th, at the age of 59. Toledo was most famous for dressing Michelle Obama at the President's first inauguration in 2009, a moment that cemented her legacy in fashion history. Toledo's career began in the late 1980s, when she and her husband, Ruben Toledo, launched a clothing line called "Toledo/Toledo." The line quickly gained attention for its unique, artistic designs and was featured in prestigious department stores such as Barneys New York and Neiman Marcus. Throughout her career, Toledo remained passionate about creating beautiful, feminine garments that celebrated the female form. She once said, "I [make clothes] to celebrate the beauty of women. Not the superficial beauty, but the deep beauty that comes from their character, spirit, and strength." However, it was Toledo's collaboration with Michelle Obama that brought her work to the attention of the world. For Obama's inauguration, Toledo designed a stunning lemongrass-yellow coat and dress ensemble, which was praised for its elegance and unique, architectural design. The outfit was a shining moment for Toledo, who became known as the designer who dressed the first lady. Obama and Toledo shared a mutual admiration for each other's work. In a statement released on Tuesday, Obama said, "Whether she was creating clothes that were at once whimsical and elegant, or inventing a new form of textile art, Isabel was a true artist who brought joy, color and beauty to the world. It was an honor to wear her creations and to be a part of her world." Toledo's impact on the fashion industry extended beyond her work with Obama. She was a beloved figure in the industry, known for her unconventional approach to design and her commitment to celebrating diversity and inclusivity in fashion. She once said, "I'm not interested in creating clothes for a certain type of woman. I want my clothes to be for women of all ages, shapes, and sizes." Toledo's passing has been met with an outpouring of support and love from the fashion community. Designer Christian Siriano, who worked with Toledo early in his career, called her "a true artist and a special human being." Designer Derek Lam described her as "one of the great American designers of our time." Toledo's legacy will continue to inspire artists and designers for years to come. Her commitment to celebrating individuality and beauty in all its forms will be sorely missed but never forgotten.
