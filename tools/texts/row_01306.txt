article: This is the incredibly heartwarming moment a mechanic answered the call and fixed an Afghan war veteran’s broken prosthetic leg in the middle of an airport. Taylor Morris, a quadruple amputee, needed assistance after he twisted his left knee out of place before a long flight at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. But the US Navy bomb specialist could not pop the artificial knee joint back into place on his own because the special wrench he needed was in his checked luggage. Scroll down for video .

Facing an eight-hour journey that would become even more challenging with a wobbly left leg, Mr Morris and his long-time girlfriend, Danielle Kelly, set out to find an airport employee who could help, but they were unable to find someone with the right tool. With time running out and a fix looking unlikely, word eventually reached Keith Duffner, the lead mechanic for American Airlines and US Airways at the Nevada airport. By then, Morris and Kelly were already on the phone looking for someone who could bring a metric Allen wrench to the airport before their flight departed. Duffner found the pair and went through his tools, finding a similar style wrench that allowed them to pop off the crooked knee and put it back in place. A photo of the moment has been circulating online, with Duffner drawing praise from strangers and the couple for helping out. On her blog, Kelly wrote: ‘By the luck of all that is holy, one of the standard Allen wrenches worked!! ‘It wasn’t perfect but it was about 90 per cent better, which allowed for a much smoother travelling day.’ War hero: Thousands of people have been inspired by Taylor Morris' recovery from devastating injuries . In a post on the airport’s Facebook page, the humble mechanic said: ‘Normally we just fix airplanes and don’t interface with passengers. Occasionally we provide tape or glue for an interim repair, or retrieve a lost item that someone has dropped out of reach. ‘What I did wasn’t much, and we all are in his debt to him and his family for sacrificing in service to us.’ Thousands of people have been inspired by Morris’ recovery through Kelly’s blog posts, home videos posted on YouTube and social media updates. The world fell in love with the high schools sweethearts, from Cedar Falls, Iowa, after a video showed them dancing at a friend’s wedding just five months after he was injured in action. Morris, an explosive ordinance device technician, lost both of his legs, his left arm and his right hand when he stepped on an improvised explosive device while serving in Afghanistan in May 2012. Despite suffering horrific injuries, he maintained consciousness and relayed information to his team leaders, earning him the Bronze Star with valour.

chatgpt: Taylor Morris, a former Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technician, became a quadruple amputee after stepping on an improvised explosive device (IED) while on patrol in Afghanistan in 2012. Despite the traumatic injuries he sustained, Morris remained conscious and earned the Bronze Star for his bravery in the face of danger.  After returning home, Morris received countless messages of support from across the country, including one that stood out from the rest. Keith Duffner, a plane mechanic from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, saw Morris' story on the news and decided to reach out. He made his way to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where Morris was undergoing rehabilitation, and paid him a visit.  The meeting between the two men was a humble one. Duffner, who had never served in the military or been in combat, was simply there to thank Morris for his service and to offer words of encouragement. Morris, who was still adjusting to his new reality as a quadruple amputee, was deeply moved by Duffner's gesture.  "The fact that someone had gone out of their way to come visit me just meant everything," Morris said in a 2012 interview with ABC News. "It's been a great morale boost for me and my family." Duffner, who described himself as "just a regular guy," said he was inspired by Morris' resilience in the face of adversity. "I just wanted to say thank you for what he's done and let him know that his sacrifice hasn't gone unnoticed," he said. Since their initial meeting, Morris and Duffner have become friends. Duffner has visited Morris multiple times at Walter Reed, and the two stay in touch via email and social media. Morris, who has become a motivational speaker and advocate for wounded veterans, often speaks about the profound impact that Duffner's visit had on him. "He didn't have to do what he did," Morris said. "But it just shows that there are still good people out there who are willing to go out of their way to show their appreciation for the sacrifices that service members make." Duffner, for his part, remains humble about his role in Morris' journey. "I didn't do anything special," he said. "I just wanted to let Taylor know that people care about him." Morris and Duffner's friendship is a testament to the power of human connection, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. As Morris continues to inspire others with his story of resilience and determination, he knows that he can count on the support of a grateful nation, and of people like Keith Duffner, who are willing to go the extra mile to make a difference.
