Mourners are to be fined £147 if funerals go on longer than their allotted 40 minute time limit at a council-run crematorium. North Devon Crematorium in Barnstaple will add the additional charge to the cost of a ceremony if the time between the hearse arriving and the last mourners' cars departing exceeds 40 minutes. Devonshire funeral director David Williams says that the fine is 'not morally defensible', and has been added without warning. Fine: North Devon Crematorium in Barnstaple will add the additional charge to the cost of a ceremony if the time between the hearse arriving and the last mourners' cars departing exceeds 40 minutes . He said: 'It is not nice - we were annoyed about it because it came through on our invoice. 'They had just snuck it on, no-one was ringing us up saying the service over-ran. 'And if the service is shorter than expected, the crematorium does not give money back to families. 'A funeral is not like a kids’ birthday party. 'People are distressed but they are just saying "You have 40 minutes, get in and get out", It’s not right. Mr Williams added that funeral directors are losing money because they do not wish to impose the fines on customers. He said: 'Funeral directors have been paying the charge rather than putting it on the bill, but it means our fees might have to be increased to cover it. 'It would be horrendous for us to put it on the bill. How can you justify that to the families? Controversial: Devonshire funeral director David Williams says that the fine is 'not morally defensible', and has been added without warning . 'They have just paid £2,000 and then we give them an extra fee.' Martin Williams, procurement and services delivery manager at North Devon Council which runs the crematorium, explained that funerals are booked in 40 minute slots. Services should last 30 minutes, allowing an additional 10 minutes for mourners to come and go. But he said that services can be extended by an additional 30 minutes if prearranged. He said: 'It is the funeral director’s responsibility to assess the bereaved family’s needs and book the appropriate length of service accordingly.' He added: 'All funeral directors were informed of these changes by letter before they were introduced. So far the council has only received complaints from three funeral directors out of a total of 81 in the area, according to Mr Williams.

chatgpt: North Devon Crematorium in Barnstaple implemented a new policy in April, instituting a fine for late arrivals to funeral services. However, some funeral directors in the area have taken it upon themselves to pay the fee themselves rather than pass it on to grieving families. The late fee was introduced as a way to discourage tardiness and to ensure that funeral services run smoothly and on time. However, for some local funeral directors, the idea of adding an additional cost to the already high bills that families incur during the funeral process is simply unacceptable. David Williams, the owner of a local funeral home, has been one such director paying the fees himself. "It's just too horrendous to add it to the cost of a funeral and expect the grieving family to foot the bill," he said. Williams believes that the additional cost of the fine could cause undue financial strain on families already struggling to cover funeral costs. While some may see the fine as a way to ensure punctuality and professionalism during funeral services, it's clear that not everyone is on board with the policy. For Williams and others like him, the focus must remain on compassion and care for grieving families during their difficult time. The crematorium itself has defended the policy as a way to maintain order and ensure that services are held on time. Despite this, the fact that funeral directors are choosing to pay the fees themselves shows just how divisive the issue has become in the local community. It's understandable that the crematorium wants to maintain a level of professionalism and establish efficient practices during funeral services. However, it's important to remember that funeral services are ultimately about showing compassion and support for those who are grieving. The introduction of additional fees can detract from this in a significant way, causing families to worry about finances and detracting from the solemnity of the occasion. In the end, it's up to the local community to decide what's best for them when it comes to funeral services. While the fine policy may work for some, it's clear that others see it as an unnecessary burden on already grieving families. As the debate continues, it's important to focus on finding a solution that is both respectful and considerate of everyone involved.
