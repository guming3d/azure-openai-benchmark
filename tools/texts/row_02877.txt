article: By . Emma Glanfield . Frisbee catching has been banned from a country dog show today on the grounds of health and safety amid fears the pets could injure themselves when taking part. It is one of three events to be either dropped or altered at Scruffs Dog Show in Keswick, Cumbria, after organisers cited health and safety concerns. Show organisers took the ‘bizarre’ decision to drop both the 'highest frisbee jump' and the 'highest biggest catch' categories over fears the competing dogs could injure themselves. The Kennel Club, which has named the town the UK’s most dog-friendly on two occasions, supported the decision.

Instead of jumping to catch the biscuit, dogs will instead be sitting down when taking part. Mr Lywood said the decision was made after fellow organisers raised concerns about the competing dogs’ wellbeing. He said: ‘In shows elsewhere there have been occasions where dogs have jumped high and twisted their back, and there was one where the dog had to be put down. ‘The committee made the decision reluctantly, we were advised it was a better thing to do even though it sounds counterintuitive and bizarre. ‘I think we probably made the right decision, we just want to avoid any dogs getting hurt. ‘Health and safety has finally hit dogs.’ Organisers decided to drop both the 'highest frisbee jump' and the 'highest biggest catch' categories over fears the dogs could get hurt. More than 500 people are set to attend the show in Keswick, Cumbria (above) The Kennel Club endorsed the show's decision. A spokesman said: ‘The Kennel Club encourages fun sports and activities for dogs in order to keep them fit and healthy. ‘But it has concerns about the game of frisbee, particularly in its more extreme forms. ‘While it can be safe in controlled conditions, if it is thrown at great heights or awkward angles, leading the dog to jump and twist, it can cause strain and injury on landing so care should always be taken.’ More than 500 people are expected to descend on Fitz Park in Keswick today for the dog show, which will see 28 dogs taking part in 24 different categories. Other categories will see prizes awarded to the dog with the most appealing eyebrows, the waggiest tail, the longest tongue and the one which most looks like its owner.

chatgpt: The Scruffs Dog Show in Cumbria has made several changes to their annual competition in light of health and safety concerns. Organizers have announced that the 'Highest Frisbee Jump' category no longer exists in the competition. This decision has been taken due to concerns about the potential strain or injury dogs could face from jumping too high. The organizers claimed that the show had always been conscious about the dog's welfare and that the decision was taken with this in mind. The change comes as part of a movement across the industry to prioritise the well-being of dogs during such competitions. In addition to the 'Highest Frisbee Jump,' organizers also decided to remove the 'Highest Biggest Catch' category. This is another competition that has been deemed too dangerous for dogs. The organisers said they did not want to encourage dogs to risk their health in such an event. Furthermore, the 'Best Biggest Catcher' competition now includes a modified set of rules to ensure the dogs don't strain or injure themselves while jumping. The organisers are taking a proactive approach towards ensuring the well-being of dogs at the show. They have promised to work collaboratively with veterinarians to establish an appropriate health and safety plan. The move has been commended by various animal welfare organisations, who believe that it is necessary to make such changes to ensure the health of animals in all competitions. The RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) released a statement applauding the decision. Scruffs Dog Show is not alone in this decision. Other major dog shows have also removed risky competitions for dogs. The Kennel Club, which is the largest dog show organizer in the UK, has removed agility competitions for dogs under a year old to ensure their growth plates are not damaged. Similarly, the American Kennel Club has banned the dangerous practice of tail docking. Animal welfare experts have praised these moves as a step towards prioritising the health of animals in such competitions. They believe that greater awareness regarding the health and safety of pets is essential. Additionally, they hope more organisers adopt such measures to ensure the quality of life of animals is not compromised in any way. Scruffs Dog Show has become well-known for promoting responsible dog ownership and health. The organizers regularly engage with the community to help educate people on how to be responsible pet owners. They have also been conducting free health check-ups for dogs at their events. In conclusion, Scruffs Dog Show has dropped two categories from the competition while also making modifications to ensure the well-being of dogs in the 'Best Biggest Catcher' category. The changes come as part of a broader movement to prioritize the health and safety of animals in all competitions. It's a big step towards promoting responsible dog ownership and health. It's our collective responsibility to ensure animal welfare in all competitions, and Scruffs Dog Show is leading the charge on this critical issue.
