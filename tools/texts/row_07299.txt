article: By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 8:19 AM on 25th November 2011 . The NHS body that rations life-saving drugs has spent tens of thousands on taxpayer-funded credit cards. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence spent £78,000 on government procurement cards last year, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. They were used by staff to travel ‘for business purposes’ to destinations including Rio de Janeiro, Vietnam, California, South Korea, Chicago and Prague. But the documents reveal they were also used for such unlikely purchases as a box of toilet brushes and sink plungers at £16.92, an inflatable cushion at £11.10 for a member of staff with a sore tail-bone, a £49.99 Christmas tree from Argos and seasonal decorations costing £7.99. They were also used to pay for morale-boosting staff ‘away days’, including one costing £751 at the Eden Bar and Restaurant in Manchester and another worth £379.77 at the city’s Victorian Chop House. Other expenses included Marks & Spencer gift tokens used as prizes for staff quizzes, as well as wheat and gluten-free sandwiches from the upmarket chain. The cards were used to buy a tablecloth for £19.98 and a vacuum cleaner for £27.99, both from Robert Dyas, as well as dishwasher tablets (£7) and dishwasher cleaning fluid (£4.44) from Tesco. Officials also used the cards at Sainsbury’s to pay for fruit juice, milk and biscuits ‘for meetings’. Nice agreed to publish details of its . spending only after several Freedom of Information requests from the . Mail, our sister paper the Mail on Sunday and the TaxPayers’ Alliance. Idyllic: Staff traveled to destinations such as Rio de Janeiro, pictured, for 'business purposes' using government procurement cards . When the Mail first asked for the information in September, we were told Nice ‘does not use government procurement cards’. When the organisation finally acknowledged their use, it pointed out its bill was much lower than those of other public bodies. Last month the Mail revealed the Health Protection Agency had used the cards to spend £3.1million in two years on items such as golf equipment, clogs, nail care and even a prawn-peeling machine. And the Government Offices for the Regions quango was found to have blown £5million in three years on items including video games, yoga and skiing trips. There are thought to be around 140,000 government procurement cards in circulation and civil servants used them to spend £1billion last year alone. Nice said about 14 of its senior members of staff had the cards. Sir Andrew Dillon, the organisation’s chief executive, said: ‘Government procurement cards and other credit cards are only used when it is difficult to make a payment any other way and their use is subject to strict guidelines. 'All our expenditure is for business purposes.’

chatgpt: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has come under scrutiny after it was revealed the organization spent £78,000 on government procurement cards in the last financial year. This is despite the fact that the Mail had previously been told that NICE ‘does not use government procurement cards’ when the subject was raised in September. The use of government procurement cards has been a topic of controversy for many years, with critics arguing that they are potentially open to abuse and lack transparency. They are essentially credit cards used by government officials to purchase goods and services. The cards are intended to simplify the process of purchasing from suppliers and reduce administration costs, but they have been criticized for being poorly regulated and subject to abuse. The revelation that NICE has been using these cards comes as a surprise to many, as the organization has a reputation for being accountable and transparent. The news has prompted calls for greater transparency and accountability in the use of government procurement cards. NICE has responded to the accusations, stating that the use of government procurement cards is a legitimate means of purchasing goods and services, and that all expenditure is subject to strict controls and monitoring. The organization also pointed out that the £78,000 spent on government procurement cards represents less than 0.01% of its annual budget, and that the majority of purchases made using the cards were for small amounts. However, critics argue that the use of government procurement cards undermines transparency and accountability, and that it is difficult to monitor and regulate expenditure effectively. They also suggest that the amount spent by NICE on these cards may be higher than reported, as it is difficult to track all purchases made using them. NICE has previously been praised for its commitment to transparency and accountability. Its guidelines and recommendations are widely respected and used in healthcare settings across the UK. However, this latest revelation has prompted calls for greater scrutiny of the organization's finances and procurement practices. The controversy surrounding the use of government procurement cards is not new. Several high-profile cases of abuse of these cards have been reported in recent years, including incidents of officials using them to fund lavish meals and expensive gifts. Critics have called for better regulation and scrutiny of the use of these cards, arguing that without proper checks and balances, they can be open to abuse. The issue of transparency and accountability in public sector procurement is an important one, and the revelations about NICE's use of government procurement cards serve as a timely reminder of the need for greater scrutiny and oversight in this area. It is hoped that the controversy will prompt a wider debate about the use of these cards, and that steps will be taken to ensure that public funds are spent in a transparent and accountable way.
