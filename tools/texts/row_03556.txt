chatgpt: Tampere, Finland - Angry Birds Land has officially opened in the Sarkanniemi Amusement Park, marking a new chapter for the popular mobile game franchise. The park's expansion comes after a successful trial period last year, and the developers of the game, Rovio Entertainment, have invested heavily in the new venture. Located in the heart of Sarkanniemi Amusement Park in Tampere, Finland, Angry Birds Land offers visitors the opportunity to immerse themselves in the world of the hit mobile game. The park boasts 12 rides and attractions based on the popular game, giving visitors the chance to take on the infamous pigs in various challenges. Among the most popular rides are the Angry Birds Race car ride and the Piggy Airfield, where visitors can ride a giant pig balloon. "To see Angry Birds brought to life in such a vibrant and fun way is a dream come true for so many fans of the game," said Anna-Maija Pietilä, CEO of Sarkanniemi Amusement Park. "We have been working closely with Rovio to bring the vision of Angry Birds Land to life, and the result is a truly magical experience for visitors of all ages." The park is not just about the rides though, as there are also special events and shows taking place throughout the day. These include the popular "Angry Birds 4D Experience," where visitors are transported into the world of the mobile game through a combination of 3D film and special effects. There is also the "Angry Birds Magic Places" feature, where visitors can use their mobile devices to bring the world of Angry Birds to life in the park. This feature uses augmented reality technology to create interactive experiences, allowing visitors to interact with the characters from the game in real life. "We are thrilled to be working with Sarkanniemi Amusement Park to bring the world of Angry Birds to life in such an immersive and engaging way," said Kati Levoranta, CEO of Rovio Entertainment. "Angry Birds Land is not just a theme park, but an experience that truly celebrates the spirit of the game and its popular characters." The park has already attracted a lot of attention from visitors around the world, with people travelling from across Europe to experience the world of Angry Birds for themselves. The franchise has become a global phenomenon since its launch in 2009, with the game now downloaded over 4 billion times worldwide. The opening of Angry Birds Land is just part of Rovio's ongoing effort to expand the brand beyond its core mobile gaming roots. The company has big plans for the franchise, which includes the release of an Angry Birds movie in 2016. As the park continues to grow and develop, visitors can expect to see even more rides, attractions, and events added to the Angry Birds Land experience. For fans of the game, this is a truly exciting time, as they can now immerse themselves in the world of Angry Birds in a way they have never been able to before.
