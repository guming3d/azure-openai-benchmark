A memo has been reveals that shows how the President was warned about problems with the implementation of his signature healthcare legislation years before the website went live. One of the campaign staffers who became an expert on President Obama's health care legislation during the 2008 race wrote a memo to Larry Summers in 2010 warning that there would be catastrophic issues with the roll out. David Cutler has now shared a copy of the memo that he sent three years ago with CBS, showing how called for the inefficiencies to be addressed but was ignored. Head start: Healthcare advisor David Cutler sent a memo to Larry Summers warning him of the problems with the proposed healthcare roll out in May of 2010 . 'I do not believe the relevant members of the Administration understand the President's vision or have the capability to carry it out,' Cutler wrote in a memo to Summers, who was working as a top White House economic advisor at that point. In the wake of the massive technical problems with the website, there have been a number of memos and documents released showing the waves of unheeded warnings. The most explicit of which came from the tech contractors hired out to create and test the website before the launch on October 1. The September 6 report states that they viewed it as a 'near certainty' that problems would result from their 'limited testing timeframes' and the small number of predetermined scenarios that they were given for trouble shooting. Blame game: Larry Summers, who previously served as the Treasury Secretary, was heading up the White House National Economic Council at the time that he received the memo . The major differences between that . report, which was directed to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid . Services, and the memo written by Cutler are the time and direction. Mr Cutler's memo was written more than three years before the contractor's report, and he sent it directly to Summers. Mr Summers went on to serve as the head of the White House's National Economic Council, meaning that he worked closely with the administration and should have been able to alert his colleagues about the stern warning as they crafted their public message. 'You need to have people who have understanding of the political process, people who understand how to work within an administration and people who understand how to start and build a business, and unfortunately, they just didn't get all of those people together,' Mr Cutler told CBS News. 'It is frustrating any time you really want to see something succeed because you believe it's good for people, and it doesn't get off on the right foot.' Under fire: The President's Healthcare website has been up for more than a month and he continues to ignore calls for it to be taken down and rebooted given the major technical problems .

chatgpt: A memo sent by President Obama's healthcare aide to then-White House advisor Larry Summers in May 2010 warned that those involved in the healthcare rollout lacked the necessary skills to make the program a success. This memo, released in the wake of the healthcare website's failure, was one of the earliest warnings of the issues that would plague the program in the coming years. The memo, which was obtained by the Washington Post, was written by Jeanne Lambrew, who served as the Director of the Office of Health Reform in the White House. It detailed concerns about the lack of business acumen amongst those involved in the healthcare rollout. "The contractors' lack of experience in building large-scale systems led to many of the problems we are now experiencing," Lambrew wrote in the memo. "The administration's leadership team has not been as effective as we need them to be." The memo went on to suggest that the administration should bring in experts with experience in managing large-scale systems to help address the challenges facing the healthcare rollout. Despite the warnings contained in the memo, the healthcare program moved forward largely unchanged. The rollout was plagued by technical problems that made it difficult for users to sign up and navigate the website. The program's architects were forced to admit that they had underestimated the scale and complexity of the project. The website's poor performance soon became a political issue, with Republicans using it to attack the Obama administration's handling of the healthcare program. However, Lambrew's warning suggests that the problems were not just a matter of politics, but rather a failure of leadership and expertise within the administration itself. The memo underscores the challenges facing government agencies in managing large-scale IT projects. The healthcare rollout was one of the largest and most complex IT projects ever undertaken by the federal government. However, the program's architects lacked experience in managing such projects, leading to significant problems and delays. The lessons of the healthcare rollout have been widely studied by experts in project management and IT governance. One of the key takeaways is the need for close collaboration between government agencies and private contractors to ensure that projects are delivered on time and on budget. The memo also highlights the importance of having strong leadership and a clear vision for large-scale IT projects. Without these key components, projects can become bogged down in bureaucracy and mismanagement, leading to cost overruns and poor performance. In the end, the healthcare rollout serves as a cautionary tale for government agencies involved in large-scale IT projects. While the program ultimately achieved its goals, the road to success was rocky, and the costs were significant. Moving forward, agencies must learn from the mistakes of the healthcare rollout and implement best practices for managing large-scale IT projects, to ensure that taxpayer money is spent effectively and efficiently.
