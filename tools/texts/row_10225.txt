According to a report by dining app OpenTable, Brummies spend an average of £51.66 per person when eating out, compared to the national average of £43.62. Moreover, the survey found that one in eight people admitted that spending on entertainment, dining out and other activities gets out of control over the three-day weekend. This comes as no surprise, considering that a survey by hotel chain Premier Inn revealed that Britons are three times more likely to dine out over the long weekend than at any other time of year. In fact, the study found that 57% of those surveyed said that they will visit a restaurant or cafe over the long weekend, while 26% plan to attend a music festival or concert. Other popular activities over the weekend include shopping (39%), visiting a museum or gallery (34%), and going to the cinema (33%). The trend of dining out over the long weekend is clearly a key factor in contributing to the rise in spending. The OpenTable study also showed that people are more likely to splash out on food and drink during the long weekend, with the average spend per booking on the app increasing by 24% compared to other weekends. However, while spending may be high over the long weekend, it seems that many people are not properly budgeting for it. With one in eight admitting that spending gets out of control over the three days, it is clear that people need to manage their money better. This is particularly important given that the long weekend has become a key event in the UK calendar. It is the perfect opportunity for people to take a break from work and enjoy themselves. However, this can come at a cost, which is why it is important to budget carefully and avoid overspending. To help people manage their money over the long weekend, OpenTable has teamed up with financial advisor Martin Lewis to provide tips on how to save money when eating out. These include looking for special deals and discounts, using cashback websites to get money back on restaurant bookings, and using loyalty schemes to earn rewards. Overall, it is clear that the long weekend is a time for people to relax and have fun. However, it is important to remember to budget carefully and avoid overspending, particularly when dining out. By taking some simple steps, such as using discounts and loyalty schemes, people can enjoy themselves without breaking the bank.
