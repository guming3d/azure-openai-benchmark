article: (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court will not prosecute Israel for a 2010 raid on a Gaza-bound aid ship that left eight Turks and an American dead, even though there's reason to believe war crimes were committed, a prosecutor with the Netherlands-based court said Thursday. While conceding that war crimes may have been committed in the botched raid, the potential cases "would not be of 'sufficient gravity' to justify further action by the ICC," prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said. "In the final analysis, I have, therefore, concluded that the legal requirements under the Rome Statute to open an investigation have not been met and I am announcing that the preliminary examination has been closed," Bensouda said. The case centers on an attempt by groups including the Cyprus-based Free Gaza Movement and a pro-Palestinian Turkish charity to deliver goods to the Palestinian territory despite an Israeli blockade in May 2010. Activists organized a flotilla and departed Cyprus for Gaza, hoping to raise awareness of what it called Israel's "illegal siege on" the territory. But Israeli commandos raided one of the ships, the Mavi Marmara, because it violated the Israeli-imposed blockade on the Palestinian territory. Eight Turks and an American citizen of Turkish descent were killed in the raid. Israel said at the time that its troops fired only after they were attacked with knives and other objects after boarding the ship. The Mavi Marmara raid damaged relations between Turkey and Israel, two close allies of the United States that had previously enjoyed military, economic and intelligence-sharing ties. Last year, U.S. President Barack Obama helped broker a telephone apology for the raid from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to his Turkish counterpart. Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the militant group Hamas seized control of the Palestinian territory. It was designed to stop the smuggling of arms into the territory, the Israeli government said. But activists say Israel's embargo of goods into Gaza from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. Bensouda started examining the case last year at the urging of the Comoros, an island nation off Africa's eastern coast. Though the flotilla departed from Cyprus, the Mavi Marmara was registered in the Comoros. CNN's Ivan Watson, Gul Tuysuz and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Despite evidence of potential war crimes, a prosecutor has stated that the case of the Israeli commandos who killed nine people aboard the Gaza-bound Mavi Marmara in 2010 is not of "sufficient gravity" to litigate. The Israeli military boarded the ship because it violated Israel's blockade of Gaza, but the incident has marred relations between Israel and Turkey. The incident occurred when the Mavi Marmara, a vessel carrying aid to the Gaza Strip, was intercepted by Israeli commandos in international waters. Nine Turkish activists were killed during the operation, leading to widespread condemnation of Israel's actions, particularly in Turkey. Initially, Israel refused to apologize for the incident, sparking a diplomatic crisis between the two countries. Eventually, Israel agreed to provide compensation to the families of the victims and apologize to Turkey, although it did not admit to any wrongdoing. Despite this, Turkish officials have continued to push for accountability for the incident, with at least one of the Israeli commanders involved in the operation facing trial in absentia in Turkey. However, the prosecutor's recent announcement has dealt a blow to those seeking justice for the victims. The prosecutor's decision appears to be based on the idea that the incident was not severe enough to warrant prosecution, despite evidence indicating potential war crimes. While the families of the victims and their supporters may be disappointed by this decision, it highlights the difficulty of achieving justice for those affected by conflicts and violence. The incident also illustrates the ongoing tensions between Israel and Turkey. The two countries have had a tumultuous relationship over the past decade, with the Mavi Marmara incident serving as a particularly low point. Despite efforts to repair relations, the two nations remain ideologically and politically opposed, particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. As the prosecutor's decision demonstrates, bringing those responsible for war crimes to justice is a difficult and often contentious process. While some may argue that certain acts of violence do not rise to the level of "sufficient gravity" to warrant prosecution, others will continue to push for accountability and justice for the victims of such acts.
