A 600-year-old medieval boat has been uncovered by archaeologists working on a flooding project in the Norfolk Broads. The remains of the oak timber frame boat, said to have been well-preserved, have been hailed as a 'rare and important' find by the team. The six-metre boat, thought to date back to 1400, was found by archaeologists excavating a drainage dyke along the River Chet, near Loddon. A six-metre oak timber boat, thought to date from 1400, has been discovered along the River Chet near Loddon by archaeologists . The 'significant' find contains wooden pegs, iron nails and copper alloy nails and looks to have been waterproofed with a mixture of animal hair and tar. Archaeologist Heather Wallis told the BBC: 'No boats of this date have previously been found in Norfolk. 'This has had a strong reliance on water transport and related industries, particularly since the creation of the Broads by peat digging in the medieval period. The boat, which would have had a sail, may have been used to carry light goods along the river. 'This area has had a strong reliance on water transport and related industries, particularly since the creation of the Broads by peat digging in the medieval period,' Ms Wallis told the Eastern Daily Press. 'We cannot be entirely sure how the boat was propelled, but it is likely to have been sailed and/or rowed or quanted down the river.' The team were excavating while preparing for a flood defence project along the River Chet in the Norfolk Broads (file photo) Now the team plans to recover the boat from its resting place so they can perform tests on the wood and date it. Eventually, the boat will be freeze-dried and preserved for life in a Norfolk museum. 'Some of the planks on the side of the boat are quite loosely in place so we'll be removing them separately to put into wet storage,' said Ms Wallis. The work which led to the discovery is part of the Broadland Flood Alleviation Project to improve the area's projection from rising waters.

chatgpt: A remarkable discovery has been made along the banks of the River Chet near Loddon in Norfolk. An ancient timber frame, believed to be from the 15th century, was located in near-perfect condition. Measuring at a height of six metres, the oak structure has left many experts in awe. Archaeologists have confirmed that the frame likely served as a vital component in a larger building, potentially a barn, hall or chapel. Given that the timber frame has never been exposed to harsh elements, it remained remarkably well-preserved. Weathering over the centuries has actually served to enhance its visual appeal, as the frame has taken on a stunning silver patina. Plans are now being made to preserve the frame for posterity. It has been acquired by a team from the South Norfolk Council and may be put on display at a future museum. The frame offers a window into the ways that ancient buildings were constructed in medieval times. As the team behind the acquisition noted, the timber frame is a true testament to the skill of the craftsmen of the era. It has undergone decades of use, possibly even centuries, as it originally formed part of a larger structure. Yet, despite the wear and tear, the frame still exudes an air of strength and solidity. Experts are excited about the possibility of studying the frame further. They state that, given its exceptional condition, the timber has the potential to offer up key insights into construction techniques from the 15th century. This could be of significant value to the archaeology community as a whole. Located in a quiet spot along the River Chet, the timber frame could easily have gone undiscovered for many more years. It is a reminder that the past is never too far from the present and that, with a bit of luck, incredible discoveries may await just around the corner.
