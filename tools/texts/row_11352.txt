The 12-year-old was determined to get a snap of herself with the Queen, and with her camera at the ready, she carefully positioned herself in the hopes of capturing the perfect shot. However, things didn't go as planned for Madison as she found herself too starstruck to take the picture herself.

Together, they took the photo, and it turned out to be a cherished memory that Madison will never forget. The young schoolgirl was over the moon with the picture, which she immediately posted on Facebook. After sharing the image on social media, Madison has become the envy of all her friends, and it has even gained her some newfound fame. Madison's mother, Tracy, was stunned at the reaction the picture had received, saying, “I was never expecting it, but it's been shared all over the world in different languages, and we've had people we don't even know contacting us and asking to use the photo. It's just taken off." Despite the reaction to the picture, Madison never expected it to get so much attention, and it has taken her by surprise. “I wasn't expecting it to be shared so many times, and I think it's cool that people are thinking it's cool," she said. The Duke of Edinburgh's kindness has also caused a stir in the media, with many people commending him for taking the time to help Madison. Some have even called for him to receive recognition for his gesture, saying it reflects both his caring nature and his devotion to the British people. Madison's experience has been a truly memorable one, and she will undoubtedly treasure the picture and the memories that go along with it for years to come. As for the Duke of Edinburgh, his selflessness and willingness to go out of his way to assist a youngster is a testament to his character and serves as an inspiration to us all.
