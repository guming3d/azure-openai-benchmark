'We are currently looking into the matter, so cannot say more about the specific incident at present.' Ruby was presented with a young carers' community award in 2011.

chatgpt: A beloved therapy dog has died after being left in a car for six hours on the hottest day of the year so far. The dog, who had been helping pupils at Sittingbourne Community College in Kent, was driven in by one teacher and was supposed to have been collected by another. However, on Tuesday, the day of the tragic incident, the dog was not collected and was left alone in the car for the entire school day. She was found dead when her owner returned to collect her. The incident has sparked a debate about the safety of leaving dogs in hot cars. With temperatures soaring across the UK, it is important that dog owners take extra precautions to prevent such tragedies from occurring. Sittingbourne Community College issued a statement expressing their sadness at the incident. They stated that the dog had been a much-loved member of the school community and that her loss would be deeply felt by all who knew her. They also stressed the importance of taking extra care when caring for animals in hot weather, and urged all members of the school community to be mindful of their responsibilities towards their pets. The RSPCA has warned that leaving dogs in cars on hot days can be extremely dangerous. Even on mild days, the temperature inside a car can quickly rise to dangerous levels. The charity recommends that dogs are never left in cars, even for short periods of time, and that owners always make sure that their pets have access to plenty of water and shade. Local residents have also expressed their shock and sadness at the death of the therapy dog. One resident commented: "It's heartbreaking to hear of such a tragic incident. Dogs are part of our families and we have a responsibility to look after them properly, especially in hot weather like we've been having." The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of taking extra care when caring for animals in hot weather. With temperatures set to remain high over the coming weeks, it is important that all pet owners take the necessary steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of their furry friends.
