article: By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . Child sex offenders who attempt to change their name without receiving permission from authorities could face up to five years in prison under a new crackdown on child protection laws. The new amendments would see a significant increase to the existing penalty for such an offence, which is currently only a $550 fine. New regulations suggested for the Child Protection Bill, introduced by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services Stuart Ayres, would see the fine increased to $55,000 and include a jail term. Convicted pedophiles who change their name without permission could face up to five years in prison and a $55,000 fine . The changes come two years after the death of high-profile child sex offender Dennis Ferguson, who was twice caught using a different unregistered name while working for charities including the RSPCA and Diabetes Australia. The suggested changes to the Child Protection Bill, come as part of a crackdown on child protection laws introduced by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Stuart Ayres, on Wednesday . An individual on the child protection register must also now report 'details of any motor vehicle hired' and 'details of any telecommunications service' including registering their mobile and land-line phone numbers with police, under the new Bill. It clarifies the type of contact with someone under the age of 18 that the individual must register, which includes any type of supervision or care of a child, visiting or staying in a house where there is a child present and exchanging contact details with a child. The use of electronics, including emails and internet communications have also been covered in the Bill. Alongside convicted pedophiles, individuals who qualify for registration on the child protection register has also been amended to include those responsible for manslaughter of a child, child abduction and anyone responsible for 'wounding' or causing 'grievous bodily harm of a child under 10 years of age'. The amendments come two years after the death of high-profile child sex offender Dennis Ferguson, who was twice caught using a different unregistered name while working for charities . The announcement was met with public scrutiny however, after a spokesperson for Mr Ayres told The Sydney Morning Herald that parents and carers convicted of 'shaking' a child, would fall under this category. Sue Foley, a expert on shaken baby syndrome said registering carers for shaking a child would be 'over the top', and that educating them on coping with stressful situations would be more effective. However in his introductory speech of the Bill, Mr Ayres clarified that: ''Inclusion of these offences will ensure that offenders who may continue to pose significant risk to children are not omitted from ongoing monitoring'.

chatgpt: The Australian government recently tightened the laws surrounding child protection. According to the latest amendments to the Child Protection Bill, sex offenders who change their name without permission could face a five-year jail sentence, rather than just a fine of $550. Additionally, those responsible for "wounding" a child under 10 could be added to the registry. The changes also mean that carers found guilty of "shaking" a child would fall under this category. These latest changes were introduced as part of the ongoing drive against child sex offenders. The new legislation will make it easier for authorities to keep track of known offenders while also deterring sex offenders from changing their name to avoid detection. The new proposals have been welcomed by child protection organisations. The Child Protection Alliance noted that the changes will enable the authorities to keep much better track of known offenders, potentially preventing them from committing further crimes. Meanwhile, Bravehearts, an advocacy group for child protection, welcomed the expansion of the registry to include those responsible for wounding a child. The changes highlight the continued importance of protecting children from harm. According to the latest statistics, there were around 58,000 children who were reported as victims of abuse or neglect in 2018, highlighting the need for robust and effective child protection measures. The amendments to the Child Protection Bill underline the government's commitment to eradicating child abuse and preventing sex offenders from evading justice. These measures aim to make it harder for sex offenders to hide their identity from the authorities and help ensure that they receive appropriate punishment. Critics argue that the changes do not go far enough and that more needs to be done to protect vulnerable children. Some advocates have called for even harsher penalties for sex offenders, while others have questioned whether the government should focus on prevention rather than punishment. Despite this debate, however, it is clear that any steps towards better child protection are welcome. These measures are a step in the right direction towards protecting children, and they demonstrate the government's commitment to safeguarding the most vulnerable in our society. The Child Protection Bill is set to be implemented in the coming months, and it is hoped that the changes will have a significant impact on safeguarding children from harm. By making it easier to track known sex offenders, the new measures aim to give parents and carers greater peace of mind and ensure that offenders are brought to justice.
