Adrift in the vast Pacific Ocean for four weeks, two fishermen began to drink sea water when the rains stopped and their small supply of fresh water ran out. The salt water would have killed them from severe dehydration within three days - but just as all hope was running out the desperate men were seen by a US fishing boat. As 40-year-old Elirito Tataua and Teikauea Tegiaa, 20, recovered from their ordeal on board the Pacific Princess today, the ship's captain, Alfred Canepa, told how he found the men by chance. Survivors: Eiirito Tataua, 40, left, and 20 year old Teikauea Tegiaa, right, survived four weeks adrift by drinking rain water and eating raw fish . 'They had drifted 420 miles from Bahaba Island, in Kiribati's Gilbert Islands, where they'd been fishing,' said Captain Canepa. 'They were surviving on raw fish and rain water, but when the rains stopped and there was no fresh water they were in a lot of trouble. 'They were extremely weak and malnourished, but, surprisingly, they are in a lot better shape than I would have been, put it that way - it's a hell of an ordeal, believe me.' Captain Canepa told Radio Australia that he was lucky to find the men. 'We were searching for fish and 16 miles away on my bird radar I spotted a small flock of birds. 'As fish attract birds, I went to go and check it out and luckily I did turn that way to check because we found this small boat with two men adrift at sea, lost. We found them in the nick of time.' The pair were fishing off the coast of the Gilbert Islands in Kiribati when their engine broke down and they drifted 420 miles west towards the Solomon Islands before they could be saved and taken to American Samoa . Captain Canepa said the men were on a 14ft boat when the engine broke down and strong winds began pushing them towards the Solomon Islands. 'Once they were taken on board I gave them water straight away, just small amounts at a time. 'It was a dry spell and they weren't getting much rain and what happened was they started drinking salt water - and that's lethal. 'They wouldn't have last another three days doing that.' After rehydrating themselves the men spent an hour in a small chapel on the Pacific Princess giving thanks for their rescue. The men's board was hauled onto the Pacific Princess, which is based at American Samoa,  and Captain Canepda promised them that he and his crew would repair the engine and return it to their island home when his vessel passes by that way. The plan was to take the men to the Solomon Islands where arrangements would be made to return them to Kiribati. 'They've spoken to their families and it's turned out to be a very happy ending,' said Captain Canepa.

chatgpt: Two Kiribati fishermen, aged 20 and 40, survived for over a month at sea after drifting 420 miles away from their home. The duo's tale of survival and endurance has inspired many, as they managed to survive with very little water and food, living off raw fish and rainwater. The incident occurred when the two men went on a fishing trip, but strong winds and currents had taken them far away from their intended destination. With no way to communicate their location or call for help, the men were left stranded in the open sea. For over a month, they lived a perilous life, battling the elements as they faced the scorching sun, powerful waves, and cold nights. They had very little to sustain them, and their only source of food was raw fish that they managed to catch using their fishing gear. The fishermen were finally rescued by a passing U.S. fishing vessel near the Solomon Islands. The crew of the boat was surprised to see the men in such a state, but immediately provided them with much-needed medical attention and food. The Kiribati authorities have expressed their gratitude to the U.S. fishing vessel and its crew for their timely intervention. The two fishermen have been taken back to their home country and are currently undergoing treatment for dehydration and malnourishment. The incident has led to discussions regarding the need for improved communication and navigation systems for fishermen in remote areas. Without proper navigation tools, fishermen like these two men are vulnerable to getting lost in the open sea, and often have no way of calling for help. Many people have hailed the two Kiribati fishermen as heroes for their bravery and determination in the face of adversity. Surviving for over a month at sea with minimal resources is a feat that not many people would be able to achieve. The incident has also brought to light the importance of preparedness and survival skills for those who venture out into the sea. In this case, the two men were lucky to have survived, but not all fishermen may be as fortunate. It is essential to have proper training and equipment to ensure that one can survive in adverse situations. The story of these two fishermen is a reminder of the human spirit's resilience and the ability to endure even in the most challenging circumstances. It is a tale of hope and survival that has inspired many around the world and will continue to be a source of inspiration for years to come. In conclusion, the incident has highlighted the need for improved safety measures and communication systems for fishermen. While the two Kiribati men managed to survive, they were extremely lucky to have been rescued in time. The incident should serve as a wake-up call for authorities to take measures that ensure the safety of fishermen at sea.
