chatgpt: A shooting took place on a golf course in California, leaving one man dead and three others injured. The shooter, Jeff Fleming, apparently has no felony criminal record.  The incident happened on a beautiful Sunday morning in San Diego when golfers were out for a game at the La Jolla Country Club. While playing, one of the golfers had hit the ball into the rough and had to take a drop shot. It was during this process that the golfer was unable to find his ball, leading him to move on to the next shot.  It was at this moment that Jeff Fleming, a resident of a nearby house overlooking the golf course, opened fire. He shot at the golfers, injuring three and killing one. Police responded quickly and arrested Fleming at his house. During a search of his house, they found multiple guns and ammunition. Upon investigation, it was revealed that the shooter had no felony criminal record. He had been living in his home for over 15 years and had a history of disputes with the golf course. He was known for filing multiple complaints about golfers hitting balls into his backyard, and sometimes even into his house.  According to the Deputy District Attorney, shooting at golfers was not a justified response to the situation. "Live on a golf course and you got to expect your house to get hit every once in a while. That doesn't give you the right to take the law into your own hands." The La Jolla Country Club expressed their condolences to the victim's family and stated that the club was cooperating with the investigation. Furthermore, the club emphasized the importance of respecting fellow golfers and their property while enjoying the sport. The shooting sparked debates about gun control and the importance of background checks. San Diego Mayor, Kevin Faulconer, expressed his condolences to the families affected and stated that the city will do everything it can to prevent similar incidents in the future. The incident has put a cloud over the peaceful community of La Jolla and raised concern about potential danger lurking in the quiet neighborhoods overlooking golf courses. The investigation is ongoing, and Fleming is set to appear in court in the coming days.
