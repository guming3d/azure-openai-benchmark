article: A woman who claimed to have been tricked into thinking she had given birth by Nigerian fraudsters has lost her fight to care for the baby she brought home to the UK from the African 'clinic'. The woman, of dual British and Nigerian nationality, travelled from London to the African country in 2010 after struggling to conceive naturally. After being 'drugged' and undergoing 'a process which resembled birth', the woman returned to the UK with the infant who has severe disabilities. The woman claims to have believed she was pregnant and gave birth in Nigeria. She has lost a High Court battle to care for the baby boy she brought back to the UK after visiting the African country (file image) Within months the baby was taken into social care, with a judge ordering earlier this year the boy be permanently looked after by the state. The woman, who thought she was his biological mother despite DNA tests revealing otherwise, fought the decision, but has lost an appeal at the High Court. Today a judge ruled the woman should not have any part in the child's upbringing despite 'hoping against hope' he was her son. The court heard how the woman travelled to Nigeria in 2010 to undergo 'herbal treatment' she thought would help her conceive a baby. Despite being told by a British GP that she was not carrying a child, the woman returned to Nigeria where, following 'a process which resembled a birth', she was presented with the child. 'Her state of mind at that point was that she continued to hope against hope that it might just be the case that she was the baby’s mother. 'She closed her eyes to all of the pointers in the other direction,' Lady Justice Black said. In 2012 the pair returned to the UK where, despite her efforts, the boy's health suffered due to severe disabilities. Visits to health services raised concerns over how the woman and the child were related, and the boy was entrusted to the care of foster parents. The woman lost her appeal at the High Court today after acting in a 'hostile' way towards social workers . After launching an appeal to win back custody of the child, the woman was described as being 'hostile to social workers'. Judge Pamela Scriven QC told the court the woman 'saw the world through a narrow and self-justifying lens.' It was ruled the boy be permanently cared for by local authorities, a decision which the woman and her legal team appealed. However in a separate ruling, Lady Justice Black today said their efforts had 'no real prospect of success'. 'I consider that these various grounds of appeal have no real prospect of success on appeal. 'The judge made careful factual findings, which rightly identified the many problems in the way in which this woman approached the child’s welfare.'

chatgpt: A woman who travelled to Nigeria seeking herbal treatment in 2010 has lost an appeal to maintain custody of a severely disabled boy who is not biologically hers. The woman, whose name has not been disclosed, claimed that after the treatment, she believed she was pregnant and gave birth. Despite her general practitioner insisting that she was not pregnant, the woman maintained that she had given birth to the child. In 2012, the woman brought the severely disabled boy back to the UK where concerns were raised by health workers over the relationship between the woman and the child. After an investigation, it was determined that the child was not biologically related to the woman, and she was not his legal guardian. The boy, who requires 24-hour care due to his severe disabilities, has been in the care of local authorities since 2016. The woman has been fighting to maintain custody of the child but has now lost her appeal. The court ruled that while the woman had cared for the child for a significant period, her deception in claiming the child as her own and her inability to prove that she was related to the child were critical factors in the decision. Additionally, the court found that the woman's care of the child had not been adequate, as she had neglected to seek appropriate care, and the child had suffered from malnourishment and neglect. The decision was met with mixed reactions from those involved in the case. The woman's lawyer argued that the child had been living with the woman since he was an infant, and removing him from her care would be detrimental to his well-being. However, the local authority argued that the child's welfare should take precedence over the woman's desire to keep him in her care. The case has highlighted the potential dangers of seeking unproven medical treatments abroad and the importance of seeking proper medical advice in the UK. The woman's decision to travel to Nigeria for herbal treatment ultimately led to a situation where a child without a legal guardian was brought back to the UK, causing distress for all involved. The decision of the court to remove the child from the care of the woman raises questions about the best way to care for severely disabled children. The case has highlighted the need for more support for families caring for such children, and the importance of ensuring that adequate resources are available to ensure that their needs are met. In conclusion, the court's decision to remove the severely disabled boy from the woman's care was based on several factors, including the woman's inability to prove a biological relationship with the child, her lack of adequate care for the child, and her deceptive behaviour. The case raises questions about the dangers of seeking unproven medical treatments abroad, the importance of proper medical advice, and the care of severely disabled children. It is hoped that this case will lead to more support for families caring for disabled children and the provision of adequate resources to meet their needs.
