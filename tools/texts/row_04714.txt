Dashcam footage shows the Renault Megane travelling the wrong way around a busy roundabout in Kent . Driving instructor David Tomlinson, 51, said he was forced to swerve out of the way after the vehicle drove towards him on Cheriton roundabout in Folkestone, Kent. His dashcam recorded the vehicle's movements . Mr Tomlinson, a father of two, said the driver was in his late 60s and could have been confused after returning from the continent. He said: 'It would be understandable if it was a foreign driver but it wasn't a foreign car. 'The roundabout is quite near Dover so maybe they had just come back from France and forgot they were on the wrong side of the road. 'He was driving at about 30mph. He just had a normal expression on his face, he didn't look panicked or anything. 'It was pretty lucky that there was nobody in the left hand lane as the guy wasn't stopping and it could have been a pretty bad accident.' Mr Tomlinson said he keeps a dashcam in his car to help show those who he teaches to drive the mistakes they made. He said he was able to keep calm during the incident because of his years working as a driving instructor. He said: 'Doing the job that I do I think I'm used to these things happening unfortunately. 'I’m just glad that at the time there wasn’t a learner in the car because it probably would’ve put them off driving. The father of two said the driver appeared unfazed after driving the wrong way around the busy roundabout . 'It could’ve been a lot worse, if there had been a car in the lane I needed to move into, I wouldn’t have been able to pull across. He just kept on coming. 'The problem with the roundabout is its quite big and fast, so cars go around about 25-30mph. 'If that left lane had been blocked I would’ve been involved in a head-on or a side swipe. But luckily I was able get out of the way. 'It’s a very good system to use in the car, and it records in HD. It’s normally used to help my pupils, if they’ve made a mistake, I can show them the footage so they can see what they’ve done. MailOnline has contacted Kent Police for comment.

chatgpt: A driving instructor had a terrifying near-miss experience when a car was spotted travelling in the wrong direction around a busy roundabout in Kent. The vehicle was captured by dashcam footage, which clearly showed the car moving in the wrong direction on a roundabout in Folkestone. Driving instructor David Tomlinson was driving through the area when he spotted the car, and he quickly swerved out of the way to avoid a collision. He explained that the experience was “terrifying”, and added that he feared for the safety of other drivers on the road. In the footage, the car can be seen travelling around the roundabout in the wrong direction, with other vehicles driving around it in the correct direction. The driver continues on the roundabout before eventually exiting and driving away from the scene. The incident has sparked concerns about the safety of roundabouts and the behaviour of drivers on the road. Kent Police have issued a warning to drivers about the dangers of driving in the wrong direction on roundabouts, and have urged drivers to be cautious when driving around busy areas. Mr Tomlinson, who has been a driving instructor for more than ten years, said that he has never seen anything like this before. “This was a really frightening experience, and I feel lucky to have escaped unharmed,” he said. “I hope that this footage will serve as a warning to other drivers and encourage them to be more vigilant on the road.” The incident has also highlighted the importance of dashcam footage in capturing dangerous driving behaviour on the roads. In recent years, dashcams have become increasingly popular among drivers, and have been used to capture a number of dangerous incidents on the road. In 2018, the Government launched a consultation on the use of dashcams and other video recording devices in cars. It was revealed that nearly three quarters of drivers believed that dashcams could help reduce the number of dangerous incidents on the roads. While there are concerns about privacy and data protection, many drivers see dashcams as a useful tool for improving road safety and reducing the number of accidents on the roads. The incident in Kent has once again highlighted the importance of dashcams in capturing dangerous driving behaviour and providing evidence in the case of accidents or collisions. As the use of dashcams becomes more widespread, it is hoped that incidents like this will become less common, and that drivers will become more aware of the dangers of driving in the wrong direction on roundabouts and other busy areas.
