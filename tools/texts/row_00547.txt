Mugshot: Michael Turner was charged with DUI and speeding early Tuesday, shortly after the Falcons beat the Denver Broncos. Atlanta Falcons running back Michael Turner was hit with drunken driving charges right after his team defeated the Denver Broncos during their Monday Night Football contest. Turner was jailed on charges of DUI and speeding early Tuesday - hours after he scored a touchdown in the team's win over Denver. Turner, 30, of Suwanee, Georgia, was booked into the Gwinnett County jail in metro Atlanta just after 5am. He spent barely two hours behind bars before he was released on $2,179 bond, jail records showed. A Gwinnett County police officer pulled over Turner's black Audi R8 on Interstate 85 northeast of Atlanta after clocking the car's speed at 97 mph - 32 mph over the speed limit, said Cpl Edwin Ritter, a police spokesman. 'The officer made contact with the driver who identified himself as 30-year-old Michael Turner of the Atlanta Falcons,' Ritter said in a news release. 'The officer could smell an odor of alcoholic beverage coming from the driver and proceeded to conduct a DUI investigation.' No other details were immediately available. Hours before his arrest, Turner and the Falcons celebrated a 27-21 home victory over Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos.

chatgpt: Atlanta Falcons running back, Michael Turner, was arrested early Tuesday morning and charged with driving under the influence. According to reports, Turner was pulled over by police after allegedly driving 97 mph in a 65 mph zone. The officer who pulled him over claims to have smelled alcohol on Turner's breath. Turner, who has been with the Falcons for five seasons, was jailed for two hours before being released on a $2,179 bond. He is expected to appear in court on October 16th. The arrest came just hours after the Falcons defeated the Denver Broncos, handing quarterback Peyton Manning his first loss in his new uniform. Despite the big win, the team is now dealing with a potentially serious distraction. The Falcons have not yet released a statement regarding Turner's arrest, but it is likely that the team will face questions about the incident at their next press conference. This is not the first time Turner has been in trouble with the law. In 2008, during his time with the San Diego Chargers, Turner was arrested on suspicion of DUI. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. Turner has been a key player for the Falcons since joining the team in 2008. Last season, he rushed for over 800 yards and 10 touchdowns, helping the Falcons reach the playoffs for the fourth time in five years. The Falcons have yet to announce how they will handle Turner's arrest, but it is likely that he will face some form of discipline from the team. In the past, several NFL players have been suspended by their teams or the league for DUI offenses. This incident serves as a reminder that even professional athletes are not above the law. Turner's arrest is a significant setback for the Falcons, who are currently off to a strong start this season. It remains to be seen how the team will respond to this latest distraction.
