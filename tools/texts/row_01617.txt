article: Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel approved construction permits for more than 550 settlement units in East Jerusalem, officials said, escalating tensions with Palestinians amid negotiations. The city council committee Wednesday evening approved issuing the construction permits, which is considered the last stage before building of settlements can start. "The local planning and building committee had dealt with request of private enterprises to approve building permits for 386 units in Har Homa, 136 units in Neve Yakov and 36 units in Pisgat Zeev for plans approved years ago," the Jerusalem municipality said in a statement. The areas are considered disputed, with settlements illegal under international law. A member of the municipality council rejected the plans. "I oppose to this annexation for new buildings, what Israel and the municipality are doing is constructing unilaterally without consultation with anyone," said Pepe Alola, who also serves as chairman of Meretz party. An Israeli settlement watch group described it as another blow to peace efforts. "It's a shameful decision for a government that seeks a solution for a two-state solution would choose to issue so many permits for settlements units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. This is not the first time ... just another development of making a solution for Jerusalem much more difficult," said Lior Amihai, deputy director of Peace Now. Palestinian officials said it will sabotage ongoing talks between the two sides. "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is deliberately sending a strong message to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world that he has no intention of adhering to international law and the will of the international community," said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Executive Committee. In July, U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry engaged Israelis and Palestinians to start a nine-month negotiation process that will lead to a framework on future agreements. As the April deadline nears, efforts have not yielded any agreement. Israel seized Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed the city unilaterally, a move the international community does not recognize. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be part of their future state in any final status negotiations. Israel considers Jerusalem its "eternal and undivided " capital.

chatgpt: The Israeli government is facing a fresh wave of international condemnation following the approval of a controversial plan to build new settlements in East Jerusalem. Under international law, the construction of new settlements in the disputed area is illegal, and the move has sparked outrage among Palestinians who see East Jerusalem as an integral part of their future state. Israel considers Jerusalem its capital, a position that has been disputed by the international community. The Palestinian Authority wants to establish a capital in East Jerusalem, which they view as the capital of their future state. The Israeli government has justified the construction of new settlements in the area by citing historical and religious ties to the land. However, many critics argue that the move is a deliberate attempt to undermine the prospects of a two-state solution and further entrench Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. The announcement of the new settlement plan was met with swift condemnation from leaders around the world. The United Nations, European Union, and many individual countries have all expressed their opposition to the move, calling on Israel to halt construction in the area. The Palestinian leadership has also condemned the new settlement plan, with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas describing it as a "dangerous escalation" and warning that it could lead to a breakdown in the fragile peace process. The situation in East Jerusalem remains tense, with clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian protestors occurring regularly. The construction of new settlements in the area only serves to exacerbate existing tensions on the ground and make it more difficult to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The international community has repeatedly called on Israel to halt settlement construction in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and take steps to move towards a negotiated two-state solution. However, the Israeli government has continued to pursue policies that many view as counterproductive to the peace process. As tensions rise and violence continues to escalate, it remains unclear whether the Israeli government will be willing to make the necessary concessions to reach a lasting peace with the Palestinians. In the meantime, the situation in East Jerusalem and the wider region remains deeply troubling, with no clear end in sight to the bitter conflict.
