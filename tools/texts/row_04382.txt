article: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN) -- The government of de facto Honduran President Roberto Micheletti is not ready to sign a proposed agreement to end the country's ongoing political crisis, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno said in Honduras. Interim President Roberto Micheletti is reaching out to Costan Rican President Oscar Arias for a solution. His remarks came on Tuesday at the conclusion of a two-day visit by a delegation of the Organization of American States. "Although the commission concludes that progress was made during its visit, it must recognize that there still no disposition toward full acceptance of the San Jose Accord on the part of Mr. Micheletti or his supporters," Stagno said. The proposed San Jose Accord aims to resolve nearly two months of political turmoil that Honduras has faced following the June 28 coup that ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. The delegation, which consisted of seven foreign ministers and included the participation of OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza, met with representatives of all branches of government, presidential candidates, the military, clergy, businessmen and representatives of various sectors of Honduran society. "The majority of the actors expressed their conformity with the foundations of the San Jose Accord, although many of them expressed concerns about the same," Stagno said. The biggest obstacles were two points in the proposed agreement: one calling for Zelaya's return to power, and another calling for a temporary political amnesty for both sides. The delegation also spoke with Zelaya supporters, including his wife, who said that the ousted president was willing to accept the San Jose Accord and abide by it immediately. Originally, Zelaya's negotiators had walked away from the proposal, offered by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, citing the intransigence of Micheletti's team. In support of the OAS delegation, the United States announced Tuesday that many visas for Hondurans would be suspended. The United Nations and the European Union have condemned the coup and have refused to recognize the provisional government led by former congressional leader Micheletti. Micheletti has insisted that Zelaya was not overthrown but instead was replaced through constitutional means. The Honduran political crisis stems from Zelaya's desire to hold a referendum that could have led to extending term limits by changing the constitution, even though the country's congress had outlawed the vote and the Honduran Supreme Court had ruled it illegal.

chatgpt: The proposed San Jose Accord is aiming to put an end to nearly two months of political turmoil in Honduras. A delegation has recently spoken with supporters of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya and representatives of the Honduran government in an attempt to find a resolution to this crisis. The proposed accord comes after President Zelaya was ousted from his office in June, following a military coup. The coup was widely condemned internationally, with many calling for President Zelaya to be reinstated. The situation in the country has since escalated into a political and social crisis. The delegation that met with Zelaya supporters and government representatives was led by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who is also a Nobel Peace Prize winner. The talks focused on finding a way to restore democracy in Honduras and bring an end to the political turmoil that has engulfed the country. The United States has recently announced that it will be suspending many visas for Hondurans, citing the ongoing political crisis in the country. The move is expected to put pressure on the Honduran government to agree to a solution that would restore democracy and allow for fresh presidential elections to be held. Despite these efforts, the de facto Honduran president, Roberto Micheletti, has remained defiant, insisting that President Zelaya was replaced through constitutional means and not overthrown. He has also refused to back down on his position that new elections should be held in November, which many believe would only serve to further exacerbate the crisis in the country. The situation in Honduras remains uncertain, with many hoping that a peaceful and democratic resolution can be found soon. The proposed San Jose Accord is one possible avenue for achieving this, but much will depend on the willingness of all parties involved to come to the negotiating table and find a way forward. In the meantime, the people of Honduras continue to suffer in the midst of the ongoing crisis, with many facing economic hardship and a breakdown in essential services. The international community has called on all parties to work towards a peaceful resolution and restore democracy in the country for the sake of its people.
