A village green in a Cotswold beauty spot has been partly replaced with artificial turf after the grass was being ruined by crowds of tourists. A 100sq ft patch of public land between a path and the river Windrush in the picture postcard Gloucestershire village of Bourton on the Water was dug up and replaced with imitation grass. Councillors in the village, known as the 'Venice of the Cotswolds', voted to approve the scheme in September after spending Â£1,000 each year repairing grass which had been trampled by hordes of visitors. Popular spot for sightseers: This patch of grass was often left threadbare by tourists jostling to take pictures . This is the view they're after: Locals say photographers like to stand in this spot to capture the pretty bridges . They considered several different areas in which to trial the long-lasting fake grass before choosing one small patch most popular with sightseers photographing the river where it is crossed by several attractive low bridges. Richard Johnes, chairman of Bourton on the Water Parish Council, said the patch had been looking 'threadbare' before the work. He said: 'I think it's a very good selection for a particularly problematic area. 'The feedback we've had so far has been very positive. The fact people have been walking past without noticing it is artificial is excellent. 'I think it's blended in remarkably well. We will just wait and see how the trial period progresses before we make a decision about other problem areas.' The installed turf, made by Easigrass, won a gold medal at the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show earlier this year. No need for mowing: Bourton on the Water's grass should last for a decade, despite the hordes of sightsteers . Close up: The imitation grass is designed to look as real as possible,complete with paler 'dying' grass . It is hoped it will help the council cut down on repair costs as it is expected to last for 10 years before it needs replacing. But Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, was not so enthusiastic about the new grass. He said: 'I hope they assessed the impact on wildlife because I can't imagine that the beetles and the birds are going to enjoy foraging around among nylon turf very much.' Bourton on the Water is known for its pretty High Street and wide greens, as well as its model village that dates back to the 1930s. Other local attractions include Gifford's Circus, the Cotswold Motoring Museum, and a model railway. Beauty spot: The river Windrush passes through some of the most beautiful places in the Cotswolds, including Burford and Witney, where it was used in the manufacture of the famous Witney blankets .

chatgpt: A popular tourist destination in the heart of the Cotswolds, Bourton on the Water is famous for its picturesque high street, charming buildings, and historic architecture. However, in recent years the town has also become known for another aspect - the threadbare grass in its public areas. The increasing number of tourists visiting the town has put a strain on the local environment, leaving the grass in disrepair.  In a bid to address the problem, the town council has come up with an innovative solution - replacing the real grass with long-lasting imitation grass. The idea is that this will not only save money on maintenance costs, but also help to preserve the natural beauty of the town.  The decision to use imitation grass has been met with mixed reactions from both residents and tourists. While some argue that it is a practical solution to the problem of worn-out grass, others feel that it detracts from the charm and authenticity of the town.  One resident, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: "I understand the need to save money, but I think it's a shame that we're losing something that's so central to the character of our town. The grass has always been a feature of Bourton on the Water, and it's sad to see it go." However, councillors have defended their decision, pointing out that it is not just about saving money, but also about creating a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly town. "We know that some people will be disappointed by this decision, but we believe it's the best way forward," said one councillor. "We want to create a town that's not just beautiful, but also sustainable for future generations." The use of imitation grass is not a new concept, with many towns and cities around the world using it to create low-maintenance green spaces. The artificial alternative typically requires little to no maintenance, saving time, money, and resources, which is particularly important in times of environmental concern. Despite these benefits, some critics argue that the synthetic grass does not have the same natural look and feel as real grass, making it less appealing to some people. However, advocates of the artificial alternative argue that there are many different types of imitation grass available, with varying textures and shades, making it possible to find an option that looks and feels as close to the real thing as possible. For the time being, it remains to be seen how successful the use of imitation grass will be in Bourton on the Water. However, councillors are hopeful that it will prove to be a sustainable and long-lasting solution to the problem of threadbare grass, helping to preserve the natural beauty of the town for years to come.
