chatgpt: Two women are missing in separate incidents in California, and police are appealing for information on their whereabouts. Sarah Alarid was last seen leaving a party alone in Santa Clarita, Los Angeles. The 22-year-old was last seen by her friends at around 1:30 a.m. on February 3, 2021. She was reportedly headed to her car, but she never arrived. Her family reported her missing the following day, and police have been searching for her since. Alyssa Byrne, 19, is missing after attending a music festival in South Lake Tahoe. The Petaluma resident was last seen on New Year’s Eve, 2012, at the music festival in El Dorado County, about 120 miles northeast of San Francisco. She was staying at a hotel with friends, but she disappeared after leaving the hotel to walk to her car. Her family reported her missing on January 1, 2013, and her car was found in a nearby parking lot. Both cases remain unsolved, and police are asking anyone with information to come forward. In a statement, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said they are “concerned” for Alarid’s welfare and are “actively seeking information from anyone who may have seen or heard anything that could help in this investigation.” El Dorado County investigators are also seeking information regarding the disappearance of Byrne. Sheriff’s officials say they have no suspects or persons of interest in the case, and they are appealing to the public for help.  The missing women’s families have also taken to social media to spread awareness and ask for help in finding their loved ones. Byrne’s mother, Kimberly, has created a Facebook page called “We Love Alyssa Byrne,” which has over 40,000 followers. Alarid’s family has also been active on social media, using the hashtag #FindSarahAlarid to spread the word about her disappearance. Unfortunately, both cases are reminders of the dangers women can face when out alone at night. It is always important to stay vigilant and aware of your surroundings. If you have any information that could help in either of these investigations, please contact the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department or El Dorado County Sheriff’s Department.
