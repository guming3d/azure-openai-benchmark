chatgpt: Chelsea Manager Jose Mourinho was spotted paying a visit to London's prestigious Cartier store on his day off, just one day after he oversaw his team's 6-0 demolition of Maribor in the Champions League on Tuesday. Despite his busy schedule, it seems that Mourinho is making time for leisurely activities outside of football. However, while Mourinho may have been enjoying some shopping time, he has reportedly instructed his medical staff to refrain from calling him about injuries - at least for now. This comes as Chelsea are faced with concerns over the fitness of their key strikers Diego Costa and Loic Remy ahead of their trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United. Costa has been struggling with a reoccurrence of his hamstring injury and sat out of Tuesday's game against Maribor. Meanwhile, Remy has been absent from training with a groin problem. This leaves Chelsea with limited attacking options for their upcoming game against United. Despite this setback, Chelsea are still in a strong position in the Premier League, currently sitting top of the table with a five-point lead over Manchester City. They also sit top of their Champions League group with two wins and a draw. Chelsea's dominant performance against Maribor on Tuesday showcased the depth of Mourinho's squad, with goals coming from six different players. The likes of Didier Drogba, Andre Schurrle and John Terry all scored, highlighting the versatility and strength of Chelsea's team. As the team turns their focus towards their upcoming clash with Manchester United, it remains to be seen who will make the starting eleven. Mourinho will undoubtedly be hoping for positive news on the fitness of Costa and Remy, but may be forced to make changes if they are absent. Overall, Mourinho's recent visit to the Cartier store suggests that he is relaxed and confident despite any injury concerns. It will be interesting to see how Chelsea's squad performs in their next game, as they look to maintain their impressive run of form so far this season.
