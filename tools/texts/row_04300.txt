Police say Douglas Gutridge, 37 at the time, killed 35-year-old Carla Salazar in Santa Ana. He spoke to detectives in the aftermath of the crime â€” and while DNA evidence linked him to the scene nearly six years ago, there wasn't enough evidence to file charges until a new cold case team stepped in. 'A case isn't just made on just forensic evidence,' said Chief Carlos Rojas, of the Santa Ana Police Department.

chatgpt: After 32 years of investigation, California police say they have finally solved the murder of Carla Salazar, a phone operator who was stabbed to death in her Santa Ana home in 1989. Authorities have arrested Douglas Gutridge, 63, and say that new DNA technology has linked him to the crime scene. Gutridge had spoken to detectives in the aftermath of the murder, but at the time there was not enough evidence to charge him. However, advances in DNA testing have allowed authorities to pursue the case anew, and this new evidence led to Gutridge's arrest. Prosecutors say that Gutridge and Salazar had a brief and consensual relationship, but the motive for the killing remains unclear. The crime was brutal, with Salazar being stabbed multiple times in her own home. It has been a cold case for decades, but with the help of forensic technology, police were finally able to bring closure to Salazar's family and friends. Gutridge is now being held on $1 million bail and faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted. The Santa Ana Police Department has hailed the arrest as a major victory in the fight against unsolved crimes. "Our hearts go out to the family of Carla Salazar, who have waited for justice for over three decades," said Santa Ana Police Chief David Valentin. "We hope that this arrest will bring them some measure of closure." The use of DNA evidence to solve cold cases has become increasingly common in recent years, with new forensic techniques allowing authorities to solve crimes that were previously unsolvable. While some have expressed concerns about privacy and civil liberties in relation to these techniques, there's no denying that they have led to closure for many families and justice for many victims. The arrest of Douglas Gutridge in the murder of Carla Salazar is just the latest example of how advanced forensic technology is helping to bring cold cases to a close. It's a powerful reminder that even the most heinous crimes can be solved with perseverance, the right tools, and a commitment to justice.
