Her father, Count Heinrich von Lehndorff, joined the German resistance, reportedly after witnessing Jewish children being beaten and murdered. Later, Count von Lehndorff was executed for his involvement in the 20th July plot - a bid to assassinate Hitler in his East Prussia field headquarters which were located in the grounds of the von Lehndorff family home. Afterwards, her mother was imprisoned and the four children were put into a camp for children of resistance fighters. By the time the war ended, Veruschka and her family had lost everything. Homeless, she and what was left of her family drifted around Europe.

chatgpt: Veruschka, the 6ft 3" supermodel, was the Kate Moss of her generation with her commanding presence and stunning looks. She was the work of the model and photographer David Willis, who discovered her while she was studying art in Florence, Italy. At the height of her career, Veruschka commanded fees of up to £6,000 a day, making her one of the highest-paid models of her time. Her striking features and towering height gave her a unique look that set her apart from other models of the era. But Veruschka's story is not only about her success in the fashion industry. She was also the daughter of a man who was executed for plotting to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Her father, Count Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff-Steinort, was a member of the resistance movement against the Nazi regime and was hanged in 1944 for his involvement in a plot to kill Hitler. Veruschka was born shortly after her father's execution, and her upbringing was marked by the trauma and secrecy of her family's involvement in the resistance. She was raised by her mother and grandmother in a castle in East Prussia, where they lived in relative isolation from the rest of the world. Despite the darkness of her family's history, Veruschka found solace in the world of art and fashion. She began modeling in the early 1960s and quickly became a sensation, with photographers and designers clamoring to work with her. One of Veruschka's most notable collaborations was with photographer David Bailey, who captured her in a series of iconic images that showcased her unique beauty and style. But it was her work with David Willis that really put her on the map, with their photographs appearing in some of the world's most prestigious fashion magazines. Despite her immense success, Veruschka remained grounded and humble, using her platform to advocate for political and social causes. She was a vocal anti-war activist and was involved in protests against the Vietnam War. Veruschka's legacy as a model, artist, and activist continues to inspire new generations of women to embrace their unique beauty and use their voices to make a difference in the world. Her story is a testament to the enduring power of art, fashion, and activism to transcend even the darkest moments of history.
