He's the determined young koala who survived an 80km ride clinging to the front grille of a car in Queensland - and remarkably escaped with just a bruised nose and scratch toe nail. The four-year-old koala was hit on Thursday around Marborough, north of the Sunshine Coast, and was spotted still hanging onto the car when it pulled into a service station at Gypmie 88km away. A taxi driver took the 5.75kg koala from the driver of the car and drove him to a nearby vet clinic, before he was taken to Australia Zoo on Friday to be treated. The four-year-old koala (above) nicknamed Timber Wolf, was hit on Thursday at Marborough, north of the Sunshine Coast, and was spotted still hanging onto the car when it pulled into a service station at Gypmie 88km away . The zoo's vet, Dr Rebecca Millers, said she's never seen such a tale of koala survival in her three years at Australia Zoo. 'He's clung on to the front of the car for about 80km. It's incredible that he's survived,' Dr Millers told Daily Mail Australia. 'The driver felt a thump on the front of the car but kept going until they reached Gympie when they needed to fill up with petrol. They've got out of the car and a koala has crawled out.' A taxi driver took the 5.75kg koala (above) from the driver of the car and drove him to a nearby vet clinic, before he was taken to Australia Zoo on Friday to be treated by vets such as Rebecca Millers . Dr Millers said the koala had been named 'Timber Wolf' because he was brought to the zoo by the men who collect leaves for the animals. She said the furry marsupial would have been hit while he was searching for a mate. The zoo treats about 900 koalas each year and most of them injure themselves between July and December when they're on the move searching for a mate during the breeding season. The furry marsupial would have been hit while he was searching for a mate but remarkably only suffered minor injuries . 'Heâ€™s recovering well but we need to know where to return him. He's very lucky to be alive,' Dr Millers said. The zoo want to track down the driver to work out where the koala was hit in a bid to return him to the correct area on the Sunshine Coast. 'Koalas are territorial animals so he needs to go back to where he's come from,' Dr Millers said.

chatgpt: A four-year-old koala was hit by a car on Thursday on the Sunshine Coast, leaving him with several injuries. The 5.75kg marsupial was reportedly on the hunt for a mate when he was struck. Luckily, he was spotted on the front of the car when it stopped at a petrol station, and good samaritans were quick to come to his aid. The koala was then brought to the Australia Zoo on Friday for treatment, where veterinary staff discovered that he had sustained injuries to his head, elbow, and hand. He was immediately put on painkillers and given oxygen to help stabilize his breathing. Thankfully, the koala's injuries were not life-threatening and the zoo staff expects him to make a full recovery. The zoo's director, Terri Irwin, has stated that despite enduring such an ordeal, the koala remained calm through his check-ups and recovery process. While the koala recovers, staff and volunteers at the Australia Zoo will continue to watch over him, ensuring that he is as comfortable and relaxed as possible. The adorable marsupial has received an outpouring of love and support on social media, with fans expressing their hopes for a speedy recovery. In Australia, over 5,500 koalas are killed by cars each year, which contributes to the species' significant decline in population. The Australia Zoo offers a Koala Rescue Service to collect injured and sick koalas and other wildlife, providing them with the best care possible. According to the zoo, the best way to help koalas is to educate people on how to coexist with them in their natural habitat. This includes planting eucalyptus trees which are their main source of food, driving carefully to avoid hitting them, and keeping domestic animals inside at night to prevent them from attacking koalas. While koalas remain a treasured symbol of Australia, their survival remains in jeopardy due to habitat loss, disease, and the growing impact of climate change. The rescue and care of injured koalas, like the one hit on the Sunshine Coast, serve as a reminder that it is our collective responsibility to protect and preserve this iconic species.
