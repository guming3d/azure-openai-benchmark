article: Johannesburg (CNN) -- South Africa's president fired two ministers and suspended his chief of police Monday after they were implicated in the misuse of millions of dollars of public funds. The actions by President Jacob Zuma against ministers Sicelo Shiceka and Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde, and chief of police Bheki Cele come after instances of misappropriation cited in a report released this month by South Africa's Public Protector's office. The report found that Shiceka, the minister of cooperative governance, spent tens of thousands of dollars on a luxury trip to Switzerland "to visit a jailed lady friend," and found that Cele and Mahlangu-Nkabinde "irregularly authorized lease agreements for the procurement of police offices worth millions of dollars." Shiceka spent more than $9,000 of government money on luxury travel, according to the report, including a trip to Switzerland that he told Zuma was related to the FIFA 2010 World Cup, which South Africa was hosting, when in fact its "only aim" was to visit a friend of Shiceka's at the Anstalten Hindelbank prison in Bern, "which he did on two occasions," the public protector's report reads. In Monday's news conference in Pretoria, Zuma said he had established a board of inquiry to look into allegations of misconduct against Cele "in relation to the procurement of office accommodation for the South African Police Service, as per the findings and recommendations of the Public Protector." South Africa's previous police chief, Jackie Selebi, was convicted of corruption last year. Zuma also formally announced a commission of inquiry which will investigate the country's multimillion-dollar arms procurement contract, from which the president himself has been accused of corruptly benefiting. Corruption charges against Zuma were dropped in 2009 after prosecutors determined that the investigation was politically motivated. The Congress of South African Trade Unions praised Zuma's announcement, saying it hoped the actions mark "a turning point in the fight against maladministration and corruption." "From now on there must be a policy of zero-tolerance to the looting of public resources by anyone, in the public or private sector, no matter how senior their position," the trade union organization said. This is the second shakeup in Zuma's cabinet since he took office in 2009. He has been widely criticized in South Africa for indecisiveness and lacking authority, and he is expected to be challenged next year when his African National Congress holds an elective conference. This week, the ruling party's youth league is embarking on mass protest action against poverty and joblessness in the country.

chatgpt: South African President Jacob Zuma has dismissed two Cabinet ministers and suspended the country's police chief amid allegations of corruption and misconduct. The ministers of energy and state security were fired over their ties to a controversial nuclear power deal, while the police chief was suspended over allegations of corruption and abuse of power. According to reports, the two dismissed ministers were close associates of Zuma and were allegedly involved in shady deals involving the procurement of nuclear power stations. The energy minister was also accused of taking a luxury trip to Russia, where he allegedly struck a deal with a Russian politician in exchange for a lucrative nuclear contract. Meanwhile, the state security minister was accused of improperly awarding contracts to his friends and using his office to shield them from investigation. The suspension of the police chief, on the other hand, was allegedly due to the officerâ€™s involvement in the misappropriation of public funds in the procurement of police office buildings. In a statement released by the presidency, Zuma said the dismissals and suspension were in response to the findings of an investigation into the allegations of wrongdoing by the officials. Zuma also announced the launch of a judicial inquiry into a controversial arms procurement contract, which was awarded in the late 1990s. The contract, which was said to be worth billions of dollars, was awarded to several foreign companies including French arms manufacturer Thales. The announcement is expected to have a significant impact on the upcoming ruling party's elective conference, which is scheduled to take place in December. Many in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) have been calling for Zuma to step down following a string of corruption scandals that have rocked his presidency. Zuma has been under increasing pressure to clean up his government and restore public confidence in his leadership, but his handling of the recent scandals has brought his tenure into question. The ANC, which has dominated South African politics since the end of apartheid, is also facing a significant challenge from opposition parties and civil society groups, who have been calling for greater accountability and transparency in government. Despite the challenges ahead, Zuma remains confident in his leadership and his ability to weather the storm. In a recent interview with the BBC, Zuma said he was "not worried" about the conference and was confident that he would win the support of the party delegates. The upcoming conference is expected to be a crucial test of Zuma's political fortunes as he seeks to retain his hold on the presidency and lead the ANC into the next election cycle. Regardless of the outcome, there is no doubt that Zuma's actions have once again put the spotlight on the need for greater accountability and transparency in South African politics.
