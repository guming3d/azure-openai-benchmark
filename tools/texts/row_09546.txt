article: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie conceded his Virginia Senate race on Friday to Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, telling supporters that he has no plan to seek a recount of more than 2.1 million votes cast – even though state law entitles him to one. The final vote tally from the State Board of Elections will show Warner ahead by less than 17,000 votes, or a margin of about three-quarters of 1 per cent. 'The votes just aren't there,' Gillespie said Friday, adding that he called Warner earlier in the day to congratulate him. Scroll down for video . Virginia Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie told his supporters on Election Day that his race was too close to call, but he gave up the fight three days later . Warner has 49 percent of the vote, Gillespie has 48 percent and Libertarian Robert Sarvis has 2 percent. Sarvis played the role of spoiler, earning verbal attacks from the state's conservative Republicans. 'This is why the political right needs to be united,' a Northern Virginia GOP political operative told MailOnline in an email Friday. 'A Sarvis comes along on an ego trip and produces an anomaly like this in the middle of an otherwise devastating landslide. It's frustrating.' Warner, a former governor who is one of Virginia's most popular politicians, had been expected to handily win a second term. But Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, rode a wave of support for GOP candidates nationwide, and almost knocked Warner out of the Senate despite being outspent heavily. On Thursday, Warner told reporters he was confident that his lead would hold up. He said it would be unprecedented in Virginia for such a lead to evaporate in either the canvass, as the formal counting process is called, or a recount. Warner said he was focusing now on his next term, which would begin in January, and planned to promote a centrist agenda that could attract bipartisan support. He said he wants 'to show that we can get the Senate to actually work.' 'I will spend every day working to get the Senate back in the business of solving problems and not simply scoring political points,' Warner said in a statement. 'I will work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, to shake-up this dysfunctional Congress and move us toward common ground.' Gillespie's concession did not change the balance of the Senate. Tuesday's elections put Republicans in control with at least 52 of 100 seats in the chamber. The Alaska race between Democratic Sen. Mark Begich and GOP challenger Dan Sullivan remains uncalled, and in Louisiana, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Bill Cassidy are competing in a Dec. 6 runoff. Sen. Mark Warner, shown with wife Lisa Collis, will represent Virginians for six more years, following his razor-thin margin of victory over Gillespie .

chatgpt: In a closely contested race for the US Senate from Virginia, the Democratic candidate Mark Warner emerged victorious, after a tough fight with Republican candidate Ed Gillespie. However, the real surprise of this election was the Libertarian candidate – who scooped up 2% of the vote, playing a spoiler role for the Republican Party. Gillespie, who was once the Chairman of the Republican Party, was considered a strong candidate with a substantial backing from the GOP. However, the Libertarian candidate was able to win over a significant number of voters who may have otherwise sided with Gillespie. The final margin of the election was razor-thin, with Warner winning by a mere 16,000 votes out of more than 2.1 million cast. In his concession speech, Gillespie acknowledged that the votes simply were not there, and that the Libertarian candidate had played a role in his defeat. The Libertarian candidate's impact on the election highlights the growing disillusionment of voters with the two major parties. Many voters in Virginia and across the country are tired of the same old political rhetoric and partisan bickering. Instead, they are looking for alternative voices and candidates who will represent their interests in Washington. The Libertarian party seems to provide a viable alternative for these voters. Despite losing the race, Gillespie should be commended for running an effective campaign that came close to victory. His policies and platform resonated with many voters, particularly those who align with the conservative right. However, the Libertarian candidate's success in winning over a meaningful percentage of voters shows that there is a growing appetite for parties that represent different perspectives. The result of the Virginia Senate race has important implications for future elections in the United States. It shows that the major parties cannot afford to take any voter for granted, and that they must work harder than ever to win over their constituents. In particular, the Republican Party needs to be aware of the threat posed by third-party candidates, particularly in closely contested races. Overall, the Virginia Senate race was an important and well-contested election that had important implications for the future of US politics. While the Democratic candidate emerged victorious, the impact of the Libertarian candidate on the race cannot be underestimated. As more Americans begin to question the status quo and seek alternative perspectives, the role of third-party candidates is likely to grow, posing a significant challenge to the traditional major parties.
