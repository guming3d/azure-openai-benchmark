article: (CNN) -- U.S. prosecutors have accused the head of Guinea-Bissau's military of plotting to team up with Colombian rebels as part of a "narco-terrorist" operation. Antonio Indjai, the head of the West African nation's armed forces, conspired to sell surface-to-air missiles and store and transport cocaine for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement Thursday. Indjai "conspired to use his power and authority to be a middleman and his country to be a way-station for people he believed to be terrorists and narco-traffickers so they could store, and ultimately transport, narcotics to the United States, and procure surface-to-air missiles and other military-grade hardware to be used against United States troops," Bharara said. "As with so many allegedly corrupt officials, he sold himself and use of his country for a price." He faces conspiracy charges for alleged plans to engage in narco-terrorsim, distribute cocaine and transfer anti-aircraft missiles. Authorities said the charges stem from a sting by confidential sources of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The West African nation's government did not immediately comment Thursday. The charges against Indjai come nearly two weeks after the former head of the country's navy appeared in a New York court, accused of being a drug kingpin involved in smuggling cocaine from Latin American paramilitaries into the United States. Rear Adm. Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto, once head of Guinea-Bissau's navy, was seized on a boat on the Atlantic Ocean by officials from the U.S. DEA. Four other Guinea-Bissau citizens were also detained and extradited to the United States. Guinea-Bissau, a small coastal nation of about 1.6 million people sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, has been wracked by successive coups and attempted coups since it gained independence from Portugal in 1974. The current transitional government took over after the last military-backed coup in April 2012. A U.S. Justice Department report in 2011 highlighted West Africa's growing role in the international drug trade and put Guinea-Bissau at the center of that illegal activity. "Due to its lack of law enforcement capabilities, its susceptibility to corruption, its porous borders, and its strategic location, Guinea-Bissau remains a significant hub of narcotics trafficking on the verge of developing into a narco-state," the report said. "While many officials within the Government of Guinea-Bissau recognize the extent of the drug problem and express a willingness to address it, a crippling lack of resources and capacity remains a hindrance to real progress in combating drug trafficking." CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Umaro Djau contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Antonio Indjai, the former military chief of Guinea-Bissau, is facing conspiracy charges for his alleged involvement in a plot with Colombian rebels. According to prosecutors, Indjai "sold himself and use of his country for a price," suggesting a monetary incentive for his involvement in the plot. The charges against Indjai come after the arrest of another former military official on similar charges. Both individuals are accused of working with the Colombian rebel group known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which has been involved in a decades-long conflict with the Colombian government. The allegations against Indjai are particularly concerning given his former role as military chief in Guinea-Bissau. The country has a history of political instability and military coups, with the military often playing a prominent role in government affairs. Indjai was previously involved in a military coup in 2012, which led to the ouster of the country's then-president. He was subsequently promoted to the position of military chief, a position he held until 2014. The charges against Indjai highlight the continued threat posed by armed groups in the region, including rebel groups such as FARC. The conflict in Colombia has spilled over into neighboring countries, with armed groups seeking to engage in illicit activities such as drug trafficking and arms smuggling. The involvement of former military officials in such activities is particularly concerning, as it suggests a potential breakdown in the government's ability to maintain law and order. The charges against Indjai serve as a reminder of the challenges facing Guinea-Bissau, a country struggling to establish stable governance and combat corruption. The case against Indjai is ongoing, with a trial date yet to be set. If convicted, he could face significant prison time, further undermining his reputation as a former military chief and calling into question the actions of those in positions of authority in Guinea-Bissau. The charges against Indjai also highlight the broader issue of international cooperation in combating organized crime and terrorism. While the FARC has largely demobilized in recent years, other groups continue to pose a threat to regional stability, necessitating a coordinated effort by governments and international organizations to combat illicit activities and prevent the spread of violence across borders. As the case against Indjai unfolds, it remains to be seen how the government of Guinea-Bissau will respond, both in terms of its efforts to combat illicit activities and its ability to maintain control over its military and security forces.
