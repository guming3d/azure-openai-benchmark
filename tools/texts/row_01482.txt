article: (CNN) -- Turkey's economy, fattened with foreign investment during its boom-times, has stalled amid warnings its model is unsustainable. The country's $800 billion economy remains among the 20 biggest in the world -- but the IMF says it can't last and remains too vulnerable to dangers outside its borders. The OECD has also weighed in with concerns, saying the country's addiction to foreign money risks volatility. How did it get into this mess? Many developed countries struggled with growth after the global financial crisis. But not Turkey, which grew substantially over the last decade -- the country's GDP grew by average 5.5% per year. The government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, now a presidential candidate, was praised for its ability to attract foreign investors from Europe and emerging markets such as Russia and China. The rapid economic growth was largely fueled by cheap credit pouring into the country. As the crisis hit developed economies, investors turned to emerging markets, which promised higher returns than depressed Western markets. For years, Turkey enjoyed a foreign-funded construction boom. House prices have soared more than 50% since the end of 2009 and both the country's GDP and per capita income have increased threefold since 2003. But the party ended with the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing a scale-back in its stimulus program last summer. Suddenly, there was less cash available to invest. With more security in the U.S. economy, investors started pulling their money from the emerging markets. Turkey's growth slowed to just above 2% in 2013 and the country's currency, the lira, slumped further in January this year. That forced Turkey's central bank to ratchet up its interest rates from 7.7% to 12% -- showing the bank's determination to prevent foreign capital outflows. Erdogan strongly opposed the bank's move to raise the rates. He argued it would hurt Turkey's growth, blaming the lira's tumble on the opposition and an "interest rates lobby," and saying it was the result of a conspiracy. What's the economy doing now? The OECD expects 3.5% growth in 2014, picking up slightly from 2013, but high inflation is pushing the country back and hurting consumers. At around 9%, annual inflation is nearly double the Turkish central bank's target of 5%. This, coupled with the country's low employment rate leads to high levels of poverty. In an OECD study, one in three Turks said they were not able to afford sufficient food. The OECD average is one in seven. Furthermore, 20% of Turks live below the relative poverty line, meaning they survive on less then half of the Turkish median income. This makes Turkey the third poorest developed nation, with Mexico and Israel lagging behind. Turkey's strategic position means the country is the bridge between Asia and Europe. Its membership of NATO and candidacy to join the European Union reflect its importance. But unrest and uncertainty has already cost the country millions, with its stock market losing a third of its value last year. Opinion: Turkey's Teflon politician targets top post .

chatgpt: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently voiced concerns over the Turkish economy, stating that it remains too vulnerable to external dangers. While Turkey has experienced substantial growth over the last decade due to increased investments in emerging markets, the IMF warns that this growth is being hampered by volatility, income inequality, and high inflation rates. Turkey's economy has undoubtedly come a long way in recent years. The country has seen impressive growth rates and has attracted significant foreign investments. However, the IMF's latest report highlights that Turkey's strong macroeconomic performance remains at risk due to the country's failure to address structural issues that continue to undermine its growth potential. One of the main issues that the IMF raises is the high level of volatility present in Turkey's economy. This has been largely driven by the country's reliance on short-term investments, making it vulnerable to any changes in investor sentiment. Additionally, the IMF also highlights the problem of income inequality, which it says is a major hindrance to the growth of the Turkish economy. This is due to the impact it has on domestic consumption, which is greatly reduced when a population is faced with high levels of inequality. Meanwhile, Turkey's high inflation rates continue to pose a severe threat to the country's economic stability. The IMF recommends that Turkey takes steps to bring inflation under control, which it says will require greater monetary policy transparency and improved fiscal policy management. The IMF has also suggested a series of measures that could help the Turkish economy address these underlying issues. This includes promoting greater macroeconomic stability by tightening monetary policy and improving fiscal management. The IMF also recommends reducing income inequality through social policies that redistribute income and provide greater access to education and training. Turkey's leaders have acknowledged the challenges facing the country's economy, but they remain committed to implementing measures that will help support its continued growth. The government has already introduced a number of economic reforms, including measures to reduce the country's current account deficit and stabilize its currency. Despite these efforts, there is still a long way to go before Turkey can be considered a mature and stable developed market. In conclusion, while the Turkish economy has experienced many positive developments in recent years, the IMF's report highlights that there are underlying issues that still need to be addressed. If Turkey is to continue its growth trajectory and become a stable, prosperous nation, it will need to be able to tackle these challenges effectively. Reducing volatility, addressing income inequality, and bringing inflation under control are all critical steps that will need to be taken to ensure the Turkish economy remains on course for long-term success.
