article: (CNN) -- Health care was a huge topic during Wednesday's presidential debate. President Barack Obama said the repeal of Obamacare would cause seniors' prescription drug payments to rise. "We were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600," Obama said during his debate with GOP challenger Mitt Romney. He went on to say that if Obamacare were repealed, "those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care." The facts: . Nearly 5.4 million Medicare recipients saved more than $4.1 billion on prescription drugs as a result of the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in an August news release. "Seniors in the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the 'donut hole' have saved an average of $768," she said. The law helps make Medicare prescription drug coverage more affordable. Complete coverage of CNN's Fact Checks . People with Medicare can pay a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. In 2010, enrollees paid 100% of their drug costs up to $310. For costs above that figure, they paid 25% of the total until that total reached $2,800. Once that figure had been reached, beneficiaries were responsible for the full cost of their drugs until they had spent $4,550 -- after which, their share usually dropped to 5%. That coverage gap is referred to as the "donut hole." The Affordable Care Act changed the formula. In 2010, Medicare recipients who hit the prescription drug donut hole received a $250 rebate. Last year, people with Medicare who reached the donut hole got a 50 percent discount on covered brand-name drugs and a discount on generic drugs. Recipients will pay less and less until 2020, when they will be responsible for only 25% of the cost of their drugs until they reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit, according to a 2010 posting on healthcare.gov by Jonathan Blum, director for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services. Conclusion: Seniors, on average, would pay the $600 cited by Obama -- and then some, according to Medicare figures, if the Affordable Care Act was not in place. Fact Check: Job creation .

chatgpt: The health care debate took center stage at the latest campaign event, as the two presidential candidates sparred over their respective claims. Former President Barack Obama, who has been a vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act, touted the successes of the health care law during his time in office, including lowered prescription drug costs for seniors. "We were able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors," Obama said during the event. "That's not something that the other side will tell you, but it's true." Obama's comments were in response to his opponent's criticism of the health care law, and the Republican Party's longstanding promise to repeal it. The former president went on to argue that repealing the law would hurt the millions of people who have benefitted from its provisions. "Repealing the Affordable Care Act would hurt those savings, and it would hurt the millions of people who have gained coverage through the law," Obama said. "We can't go backwards on this." The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has been a controversial topic since its passage in 2010. The law aimed to expand access to health care coverage, particularly for individuals with pre-existing conditions. It also instituted a requirement for individuals to obtain health insurance or face a penalty. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the law, and his administration has taken measures to undermine it. In 2017, Congress passed a bill to repeal the law, but the measure failed to gain enough support in the Senate. Obama's remarks on prescription drugs also come at a time when concerns about rising drug prices have been at the forefront of health care discussions. Some lawmakers have called for measures to lower drug prices, including allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies. The health care debate is sure to continue as the presidential race heats up, with both sides offering contrasting visions for the country's health care system. The eventual winner will have a significant impact on the future of health care in the United States.
