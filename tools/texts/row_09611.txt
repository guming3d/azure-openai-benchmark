The accident occured shortly after the band left Warsaw on the 400 mile journey to the German capital, where Black Tongue were scheduled to play a concert the following evening. It is understood that Teven told his bandmates that he was getting up to go to the toilet, only to find that the cubicle was already engaged. Seconds later he opened the exit door and stepped out while the bus was still speeding along the motorway. Teven's bandmates realised what happened a short time later and stopped the coach. They found their bandmate laying injured at the side of the and administered first aid, while a local who spoke 'broken English' called the emergency services, according to the Telegraph. Local police spokesman Officer Piotr Kaciak told the newspaper: 'Judging by the manner of the victim's behaviour, speech and smell we suspect he was under the influence of alcohol.' Family members in Hull said Teven's father had travelled to Poland to help his 'battered and bruised' son return to the UK. They added that the musician's condition was 'okay'. Spoof: The incident has drawn comparisons with the fictional hard rock band in the 1984 mockumentary 'This Is Spinal Tap', which lampooned rock'n'roll excesses and the antics of heavy metal musicians . Black Tongue's most successful release today is 2014's five-track, 25-minute long EP 'Born Hanged', which includes songs such as 'Purgatory', 'Coma', and 'Foreshadow'.
