article: A BBC newsreader was left red-faced last night after her bulletin began with an empty chair. Martine Croxall was standing on the wrong side of the BBC News Channel studio for the start of her 9pm broadcast, with the cameras zooming into the seat after the titles at the top of the programme. The 45-year-old presenter then told viewers that she was ‘just going to move back to the main set’ as she spent an awkward few seconds walking around the studio, before sitting down in her chair. Scroll down for video . Oops: Newsreader Martine Croxall was standing on the wrong side of the BBC News Channel studio for the start of her 9pm broadcast last night . There's no-one there: The cameras zoomed into the empty seat after the titles at the top of the programme . Ahead of her introducing the top story about Lewis Hamilton winning his second Formula One world championship, she said: ‘Good evening and welcome to BBC News, I'm Martine Croxall. ‘It's nine o'clock. I'm just going to move back to the main set. I know this has happened before. Oh. But here we are. If I sidle in you can pretend that you haven't noticed. Here we are.’ Miss Croxall was referencing at least two previous cases of the BBC news beginning with an empty chair - the most recent of which happened last month when Joanna Gosling was presenting. Miss Gosling was not seated as the camera cut to the office chair where she should have been on October 9, and soon the sound of footsteps and rustling paper could be heard out of shot. 'Here we are': The 45-year-old presenter told viewers that she was ‘just going to move back to the main set’ as she spent an awkward few seconds walking around the studio, before sitting down in her chair . Joking: Miss Croxall told viewers of the programme, 'if I sidle in you can pretend that you haven't noticed' But as Miss Gosling sat down, around 30 seconds into the broadcast, she was cool personified - calmly apologising for a 'technical blip' and continuing as usual. And in July, the empty chair was seen again when presenter Nicholas Owen was seen standing by the studio's news wall as the cameras panned around the set, before sliding into shot and sitting down. Miss Croxall, who lives in a £450,000 house in St Albans, Hertfordshire, with her husband Stephen, 43, is a mother and has worked for BBC News since 2001. She is originally from Leicestershire. She once told in an interview of another embarrassing moment that saw her cause ear-splitting feedback by forgetting to switch off the speakers while trying to report live for BBC Radio Leicester.

chatgpt: Martine Croxall, a seasoned broadcaster for BBC, was left red-faced after mistakenly standing on the wrong side of the studio during the 9 pm news programme. As the programme began, cameras panned into an empty seat where the presenter should have been seated. It was then that the presenter informed viewers that Croxall was "just going to move back to the main set". This is not the first time that such a slip-up has occurred, and it won't be the last. However, it is still an embarrassing moment for any professional in the broadcast industry. More so for Croxall, a respected journalist who has worked with BBC for several years. Despite the hiccup, Croxall handled the situation incredibly well, and it seemed like it did not affect her composure for the rest of the broadcast. Her ability to continue without letting the incident affect her performance was a testament to her professionalism and experience in the field. Viewers took to social media to voice their opinions on the matter, with some expressing their amusement, while others praised Croxall for the way she handled the situation. One viewer wrote, "Well done to Martine Croxall for handling the situation with such grace. It is not easy to stay composed in a situation like that." Another viewer wrote, "Even seasoned broadcasters like Martine Croxall make mistakes. It is how they handle the situation that sets them apart, and she handled it like a pro." Producers of the programme also commented on the incident, saying that it was a minor slip-up and that they were proud of the way Croxall handled it. They went on to explain that in live broadcasts, such incidents can happen, but it does not take away from the quality of the content being produced. Croxall has not commented on the incident, but it is safe to assume that she will brush it off and continue to carry out her duties with the same level of professionalism and commitment that she has maintained throughout her career. In conclusion, while the incident may have caused some minor embarrassment, it did not have a significant impact on the quality of the programme, and Croxall handled it with the grace and professionalism that she is renowned for. As the saying goes, "the show must go on", and it surely did, even with a minor hiccup.
