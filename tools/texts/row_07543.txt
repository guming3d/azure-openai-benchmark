Record breaker: This poster of the 1931 film adaptation of Boris Karloff's Frankenstein has sold for a staggering $262,900 at auction after it was stashed in a horror fan's cupboard for more than 30 years . The seller, Keith Johnson of Ottawa, Illinois, says he purchased the vintage poster as a teenager for a few dollars at an Ottawa antiques shop in 1968 or 1969. Measuring 14in wide by 36in long, it is believed to be the only confirmed insert poster for the classic Universal Pictures film still in existence. The film, directed by James Whale, featured Boris Karloff as the monster, alongside Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, John Boles, Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye. Unlike typical film promotional posters, insert posters are printed on card and are designed to be slipped inside movie theatre display cases. Mr Johnson and his wife Julie are both horror film fans. She said the couple over the decades would occasionally pour themselves a glass of wine and take a look at the poster.
