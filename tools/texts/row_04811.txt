chatgpt: Former footballer Courtney Meppen-Walter has been released from prison after serving eight months of his 16-month sentence. The 24-year-old had been jailed for causing the deaths of siblings Kulsuma Ali, 32, and brother Adnan Habib, 10, in a car crash.  Meppen-Walter had been driving a Mercedes car that collided with the Nissan Micra being driven by Ali on Bury New Road, Manchester, in September 2012. The impact caused Ali’s car to collide with a tree, killing both her and her brother. Meppen-Walter had been over the drink-drive limit and driving at twice the speed limit when the accident happened.  The victims' family criticized the decision to release Meppen-Walter, saying that it was not justice as they understood it. “The time he has served is not enough, it is devastating that my children’s lives are only worth eight months in prison,” said their mother, Rozina Ali. Meppen-Walter was a former Manchester City youth team player, who had made two League Cup appearances as a defender in the 2012/2013 season, before the accident happened. He was released by Manchester City a month after the crash. Meppen-Walter initially pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced to 16 months in prison in February 2013. He had already served time on remand and was released on licence in September 2013.  However, he was recalled to prison in September 2018 after being involved in a car crash in Bury, Manchester, in which an innocent driver sustained serious injuries. Meppen-Walter admitted a charge of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 16 months in prison in March 2019. He has now been released early, having served eight months of that sentence. The brother and sister's family, however, has been left outraged by the decision to release him early. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, the victims' father, Mohammed Habib said that Meppen-Walter had shown no remorse for his actions. “He has been let off lightly,” he said. “He should not have been released early. If anyone has committed a crime with such severity, they should serve their full sentence. We are not happy about it.” In response, Meppen-Walter’s family has released a statement saying that he had taken full responsibility for his actions and was keen to move on from the tragic events of 2012. “Courtney has now served his time in full and he wishes to move forward with the rest of his life," they said. "He deeply regrets the events of 2012 and has worked hard to put them behind him.”  Despite his release, Meppen-Walter’s troubles may not be over. He is currently subject to an investigation by the Football Association (FA) for his part in a fight between players during a Manchester Amateur Sunday League clash between Chadderton Park and Manchester Gregorians in October 2019. Meppen-Walter was playing for Chadderton Park at the time.
