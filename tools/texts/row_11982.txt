chatgpt: Former England striker Alan Shearer has expressed his disbelief over Raheem Sterling being benched by England during their Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia on Sunday. Sterling was dropped due to complaining of feeling excessively "tired". In the aftermath, Shearer has expressed his shock at the developments. As a former international footballer, Shearer is well-versed in the stresses and strains put on players throughout their career. He admitted that the notion of being too tired to play in a crucial international game was something that he had never heard of before. "I simply cannot imagine anything like that happening in my day," he said. England eventually emerged victorious in Tallinn with a hard-fought 1-0 win, thanks to a second-half goal from Aston Villa's Fabian Delph. Sterling was introduced off the bench in the 65th minute but failed to make a significant impact on the game. The decision to start Sterling on the bench was made by England manager Roy Hodgson, with the Liverpool starlet having played a starring role in their recent 5-3 win over Slovenia. Hodgson revealed that Sterling approached him to state that he was feeling tired, leading to him being dropped to the bench. Hodgson revealed that he wasn't concerned about the decision, stating, "sometimes you have to make those tough decisions for the benefit of the team". England's win sees them maintain their unbeaten start to their European Championship qualifying campaign and sitting top of Group E. Despite the win, Shearer has voiced his concerns over the attitude of modern players and their attitude to fatigue, stating that "the game has become too easy for players ... they start to believe they can pick and choose their games without consequence". No matter the feelings of Shearer, Sterling seems to be a valuable asset for both Liverpool and England. His performances have been instrumental in both campaigns, and it will be exciting to see more of what he can offer in future.
