article: By . Michael Gadd For Mailonline . The amount of money spent tax-free by foreign tourists in Britain has fallen for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009, new figures show. Experts blamed political unrest and weakened currencies in key nations for the four per cent fall year-on-year for the first six months of the year. However, Britain is far from being the only country hit by the downturn in tax-free spending by tourists. Spending down: Tax-free spending has dropped in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2009 . Global Blue, which operates 'Tax Free' services in 43 countries around the world, reported a drop in spend across all leading retail tourism destinations for the second quarter of 2014, down three per cent year-on-year overall. Gordon Clark, UK country manager for Global Blue, said: 'Our figures show that political unrest and weakened home currencies are leaving shoppers from our top spending nations in a position where they are still spending more per transaction than before but are making less purchases than they would have made in the past, resulting in the UK seeing a four per cent year-on-year reduction in the sales in store from Tax Free shopping. 'More than ever now British retailers and hotels need to review their international marketing plans, product range and staff training to ensure they still continue to secure this crucial international spend.' He said China and Middle Eastern nations have continued to lead spending in the UK, but growth has slowed. Money woes: Global Blue says tax-free spending is down across all 43 nations in which they operate . Chinese spend is up eight per cent so far this year, but much less than the 20 per cent to 50 per cent growth seen in recent years. Clark added: 'However, as economies begin to recover, we expect to see growth from key nations pick up again.' Russia has been suffering a weakening economy since the end of 2013, and with the Ukraine crisis making the situation worse, the ruble reached a record low this year. Clark said Russian shoppers visiting the UK have been left disadvantaged against sterling, resulting in a 20 per cent year-on-year drop in spend seen by Global Blue.

chatgpt: Political instability and weakened currencies in key nations are being blamed for a four per cent drop in retail tourism spend in the UK for the first six months of 2014, according to 'Tax Free' service provider Global Blue. The company, which operates in 43 countries, reported an overall three per cent fall in tourist spending during this time frame. Despite the decrease in overall retail tourism spend, visitors from China and the Middle East remain the UK's top spenders. However, experts say that ongoing political unrest in these regions has contributed to the decline in retail tourism spend globally. A spokesperson for Global Blue stated that "International travel is sensitive to political unrest and insecurity, and both geo-political events and domestic political factors have continued to impact travel patterns." In recent years, the UK has become a popular destination for Chinese and Middle Eastern tourists. These visitors are known to spend significant amounts on high-end luxury items such as designer handbags and jewellery. However, the recent drop in spending may suggest that the current political climate is causing many to rethink their travel plans. Experts also point to weakened currencies in countries such as Brazil and Russia as a contributing factor to the decline in global retail tourism spend. As currencies weaken, foreign tourists are increasingly hesitant to spend money abroad, leading to a reduction in retail tourism revenue for many countries. Despite the challenges facing the retail tourism industry, many remain hopeful for a rebound in the coming months. As the global economy stabilises and domestic political situations improve, experts predict that retail tourism spending will increase. Additionally, many countries are taking steps to attract foreign tourists through new initiatives and expanded offerings. In the UK, the government recently announced plans to invest Â£40m to boost tourism in nine regions around the country. This includes a focus on attracting visitors from China and the Middle East, positioning the UK as a top destination for luxury tourism. Overall, the decline in retail tourism spend is a reminder of the impact that external factors can have on the global economy. As political unrest, currency fluctuations, and other challenges continue to affect tourism, industry leaders will need to remain vigilant and proactive in order to sustain growth and profitability.
