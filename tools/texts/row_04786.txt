article: A Perth breast imaging clinic and a former doctor have been fined a total of $100,000 for false and misleading conduct after promoting their services as an alternative to mammograms. The Federal Court on Friday ordered Breast Check Pty Ltd to pay $75,000 and former doctor Alexandra Boyd $25,000 for making claims in contravention of the Australian Consumer Law that put patient's lives at risk. In misleading pamphlets, the clinic claimed either a Thermography Device alone or in conjunction with the Multifrequency Electrical Impedance Mammograph, known as a MEM device, could assess whether a person was at risk of breast cancer. The Court also found that Breast Check had represented that there was an adequate scientific basis for using the devices as a substitute for mammography, when that was not the case. Ms Boyd was found to have been knowingly involved in the clinic's deceptive conduct. Perth clinic Breast Check Pty Ltd has been fined for false and misleading conduct after promoting their services as an alternative to mammograms and putting patients lives at risk . In his judgement, Justice Michael Barker said the key issue was the potential to divert customers from using a medically recognised form of breast imaging. 'Even if only one consumer has been so diverted to their detriment, the consequences to a person's health may be very serious, and at worst, fatal,' he said. 'That is not something that can be measured solely in monetary terms and it is of no assistance to say the conduct was only directed to a small number of individuals.' The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it was particularly concerned that Breast Check made such significant health related claims without a proper scientific basis. 'Consumers are entitled to expect that breast imaging services would be provided in a way that is consistent with credible scientific knowledge,' said ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court in a statement. 'If consumers relied on Breast Check’s representations instead of using conventional breast cancer investigation methods including mammography, then potentially breast cancers could have gone undiagnosed,' she said. If consumers relied on Breast Check’s representations, 'breast cancers could have gone undiagnosed,' said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission . Last week the Court ordered another breast imaging provider, Safe Breast Imaging Pty Ltd, to pay penalties of $200,000 for similar contraventions of the ACL. Breast Check, now called PO Health Professionals Pty Ltd, no longer provides breast imaging services.

chatgpt: A Perth clinic and a former doctor have been fined by the Federal Court for their misleading claims in using a Thermography device as a substitute for mammography. Breast Check had claimed that there was a scientific basis for utilizing the machine, which led to patient's lives being put at risk.  The Judge who oversaw the case, Justice Sarah Derrington, stated that the consequences to a person's health could be very serious and, at worst, fatal. There is no reliable evidence that Thermography is effective in the detection of breast cancer, and as a result, Breast Check's claims were false, misleading, and deceptive.  The former director of Breast Check, Dr. Alexandra Boyd, was also found guilty of being knowingly involved in misleading and deceptive conduct. The court ordered the clinic and Dr. Boyd to pay fines totaling $200,000, with $75,000 of that going towards legal fees. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and early detection can be critical for survival. Mammography is the most effective tool available in detecting abnormalities in the breast tissue, and it is recommended by health authorities worldwide as the first-line screening method for breast cancer. Despite this, breast cancer clinics have increasingly touted Thermography as a substitute for mammography in recent years. The technology behind Thermography involves imaging heat patterns on the surface of the skin using infrared cameras. Although Thermography can detect heat changes within the breast tissue, it is not a reliable method of detecting breast cancer. Breast Check is not the only clinic that has been fined for misleading claims regarding Thermography. Several others have been ordered to stop promoting it as a breast cancer screening tool, including clinics in Victoria and Queensland. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has been actively monitoring the marketing practices of clinics that offer breast cancer screening services. They have warned the public about the risks associated with using Thermography and urged individuals to ensure that they seek out reputable medical advice and services. This case highlights the importance of using scientifically validated methods of screening and diagnosing breast cancer. Patients must be aware of the potential risks and should not rely on unproven technologies for early detection. Breast Check has been ordered to remove any advertisements or references to Thermography from their website and social media channels. The clinic is now required to inform all patients who underwent Thermography in the past five years that the screening method was not effective in detecting breast cancer. In conclusion, the Federal Court's decision to fine Breast Check and Dr. Boyd sends a clear message to clinics that promote unproven technologies as cancer screening methods. It is essential that clinics prioritize patient safety and provide accurate and validated information to ensure early detection of breast cancer.
