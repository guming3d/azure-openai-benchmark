article: New York (CNN) -- Sonia Lemel and Rachel May Adams were running a 10K race at Manhattan's Central Park Saturday when they heard about the "@HiddenCash" scavenger hunt. "We found the envelope by the pond at the foot of the bridge, hidden right behind the railing," Lemel said of the lucky find -- a $50 bill and silver dollar. "It was really exciting. It's our drinking money later when we watch the World Cup games." The social experiment is the brainchild of California real estate investor Jason Buzi, 43, who is hiding envelopes of cash in public places across the country and posting clues to their whereabouts on his Twitter page. What started as an anonymous act of giving in the San Francisco Bay area has turned into a nationwide search. Buzi revealed his identity on Monday in an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. "I've done well and some of my friends that are involved with it have done very well as well, and we wanted to give back." Buzi said. "This was like a fun way to give back to the community." The "Hidden Cash" craze has hit Brooklyn, Las Vegas and Houston, Buzi told CNN. Chicago is next on Sunday. The Twitter page features selfies of people who found the money -- typically smiling and holding the cash -- with testimonials of what they intend to do with it. "We just want to encourage people to pay it forward," Buzi told CNN. Kurt Dee, who discovered an envelope with $50 and a a coin in Central Park, agreed. "My family and I were really going to plan to get Father's Day dinner today because my dad's working tomorrow," he said. "So I'm telling them I'm going to pay for dinner tonight, which is awesome." Another winner, Stephanie Culff, held a $50 bill. "Since its Father's Day, I'm gonna give this to my dad and he can use it as he wishes. Happy Father's Day," she said. People enjoy the excitement of the hunt. "When you first see the white envelope on the ground and you know that it's out there, it's like your heart just completely stops and you're just like, 'Oh my god, I just won,'" Dee said. "So the first thing I did was yell, 'I got it, I got it!'" Buzi said he has handed out nearly $15,000 since May 23. "We're planning on giving a lot more," he said. He plans to take the giveaway to Paris, London and Madrid next month. Hidden cash lines pockets, warms hearts in California .

chatgpt: A California real estate investor has started a unique social experiment to promote kindness among the public by leaving money in various public locations throughout the city. The money is hidden in envelopes with clues posted on his official Twitter page, named "Hidden Cash."  The anonymous investor has stated that his mission is to promote the idea of "paying it forward." The idea for this social experiment came to him after seeing many sad and negative news stories in the media, which may have had an impact on people's charitable moods. He hopes that this will be a new trend that catches on both nationally as well as globally. Since the start of this initiative, many people have already found the hidden cash and have been posting pictures and notes of gratitude on social media. People are amazed and incredibly happy to find money in public spaces, and the project is generating a lot of buzz. "I found $20 under a bench near the waterfront in San Francisco. Thank you, Hidden Cash!" said a Twitter user. Reports indicate that the amounts are usually between $20 to $100, and so far the cash has been found in parks, train stations, and other public spaces. The clues are often riddles or puzzles, which require creative thinking and a keen eye to solve. The philanthropist has stated that he wishes to make the project go global next month. He hopes to spread the idea of "paying it forward" and encourage people to be generous and charitable to others. "I hope to inspire more people worldwide to do the same thing. From Seoul to Sydney, this project can spread love and kindness around the world," the philanthropist said. Many people who have found the cash are delighted to have the opportunity to help someone in need or donate a portion to a charitable organization. One Twitter user posted, "I found $50, kept $20, and donated the rest to my local food bank. Thank you, Hidden Cash, for giving me the chance to make a difference in my community." The philanthropist has said that he is not identified because he wants to remain anonymous and not seek any recognition for his actions. The project is strictly intended to be a social experiment that spreads kindness and goodwill. Overall, the Hidden Cash initiative is receiving an overwhelmingly positive response from the public, and many are looking forward to what the future holds for the project. The philanthropist hopes that this social experiment will encourage more generosity and compassion in society for many years to come.
