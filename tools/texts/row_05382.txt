chatgpt: Tragedy struck the town of Middleton yesterday when a teenage boy was fatally shot in his own home. Lucas Templin, 16, was allegedly shot in the chest by one of his closest friends, who police believe accidentally discharged a firearm that had been inside the home. According to reports, Lucas and his friend, whose name has not been released, were home alone for just 10 minutes when the gun went off. The victim's family had left the two boys in charge of the house while they ran a quick errand. The friend immediately called emergency services who arrived on the scene promptly. However, it was too late. Lucas died at the scene before he could be transported to the hospital. Lucas’ family is understandably heartbroken over their sudden loss. Just a few days ago, the teenager had served as the best man at his father's wedding. Friends and neighbors have already begun to leave flowers and messages of support outside the family's home. The incident has left the community reeling, and questions have been raised about how the firearm ended up in the home. Authorities are now investigating the matter and are urging anyone with information about the source and ownership of the gun to come forward. Middleton police chief, John Matthews, spoke to reporters about the incident, saying: "This tragedy should serve as a reminder to all households about the need to keep firearms secured and out of the reach of children and teenagers. We encourage everyone to review their own gun safety practices to ensure that no other family has to go through the unnecessary pain that Lucas' family is now experiencing." Lucas has been described by friends and family as a kind and loving teenager who was deeply involved in his local community. He was a member of the school's football team and was passionate about music. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and no charges have been filed at this time. As the community mourns, they will continue to demand answers about what exactly happened inside the Templin family home yesterday, and how such a tragedy could have occurred.
