Detective Jon Sigler said that after the Ontario Police Department posted the video on Facebook on April 22, it was viewed more that two million times in just 48 hours. The department was flooded with tips following the post. 'I'm glad we got her,' Sheridan said. 'I think the only reason she turned herself in is because it was everywhere. I think there's no more hiding from it. I think if she could have, she would have kept hiding from it.' Police are unable to confirm if Shade is reponsible for the other thefts the Sheridan family has endured over the past seven years. Shade is scheduled to appear in court May 15.
