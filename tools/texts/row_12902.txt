Of course, absolutely. Will I shake his hand? Absolutely.’ Pardew will offer his opposite number a drink in his manager’s office but believes modern-day media commitments will not allow them the time to do so. ‘He’s absolutely invited for a glass of wine afterwards, but those day are going, the time is so slim now with the number of jobs we have to do after the game with the media,’ he said. ‘Managers rarely see each other now. The staff have a drink (instead)’. Pardew, though, has seen his media duties cut back by owner Mike Ashley, who is instructing his manager to only do what is contractually obliged. That being the case, there may well be time for the pair to enjoy a glass of Chilean red on Sunday night just yet.

chatgpt: Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has found himself once again in the spotlight as the new Premier League season approaches. Last season, Pardew was caught on camera making derogatory remarks about Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini, calling him a "f***ing old c**t" during a heated moment on the sidelines. The incident, which took place at St James' Park, is now being brought up again as the Toon Army prepares to face the Premier League champions once again in their opening game of the new season, set to take place on Sunday at the same venue.  The news of Pardew's inappropriate behavior was met with widespread condemnation from football fans, as well as the media. The Football Association also took notice, warning the Newcastle United manager about his touchline behavior. Pardew has since apologized for his actions, stating that he regretted his behavior and that it was not reflective of the values he holds as a manager. Despite the unfortunate incident, Pardew has maintained a positive outlook on the season ahead, highlighting the strength and depth of his squad going into the new campaign. "We know that Manchester City are one of the best teams in the world, but we're not afraid to take them on," he said in a recent press conference. "We've been working hard in training and we're ready to give it our all on Sunday." However, Pellegrini's side will undoubtedly be looking to repeat their impressive performance against Newcastle United last season, where they thrashed the Toon Army 5-0 at the Etihad Stadium. They will certainly be a tough opponent for Pardew's men to face in their opening game of the season. As kickoff draws closer, Newcastle United fans will be hoping that Pardew has learned from his past mistakes and will be able to keep his emotions in check during the game. With his future at the club being called into question by some, a strong performance from his team, coupled with a more measured and respectful approach from the manager, would go a long way in shoring up his position. Regardless of the outcome of Sunday's game, one thing is certain - the issue of touchline behavior in football will continue to be a hot topic of debate, and incidents such as the one involving Pardew and Pellegrini will only serve to fuel the fire. It is up to managers and players alike to set a positive example for the next generation of footballers, both on and off the pitch.
