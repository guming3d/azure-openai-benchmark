Animal control officers in Oklahoma City were called to the scene as the bull terrier fought hard to stay in the 100 degree Fahrenheit heat. Now at the local shelter, the dog's defiance has turned to sorrow as he displays behaviors strongly associated with mourning: he refuses to eat, to drink or even lift his head. Loyal: Oklahoma City officials are seen here struggling to get a fiercely loyal bull terrier away from his deceased owner in the searing summer heat . Sad: Even with temperatures nearing 100F, the dog stayed with his dead owner and fought hard to stay with him as officials dragged him away . 'The dog kept wanting to pull back to go back to where the remains of where the deceased owner was,' Oklahoma City Animal Shelter supervisor Sheridan Lowery told KFOR. Officials said the dog had remained at the body of his likely transient owner, who died from natural causes, despite having every opportunity to go find water and shelter from the relentless sun. After authorities arrived and eventually pried the pooch away, he was taken to the animal shelter, where he remained Monday. Mourning: The pooch is now exhibiting classic signs of grief: he won't eat, sleep or even lift his head . 'Their owner is deceased. They don¿t know what is going on. They don¿t know how to act. They don¿t know how to react,' said Oklahoma City Animal shelter supervisor Sheridan Lowery . Footage of the dog shows him unable at times to even muster the will to lift his head. They're the classic signs of grief, from which even dogs can suffer. 'Their owner is deceased. They don’t know what is going on. They don’t know how to act. They don’t know how to react,' said Lowery. The pup will hopefully next be placed with a family that can help lift his broken spirit. 'If he’s shown this kind of attachment, this kind of dedication to family he could make a really good family pet,' says Lowery. Looking up? The dog will hopefully soon find a new family if officials fail to find any living relatives of the deceased owner .

chatgpt: A loyal bull terrier was found protecting the body of his deceased owner in the searing heat of Oklahoma. It was a heartbreaking scene that transpired in a field near a busy roadway on the outskirts of the city. Animal control officers responded to a call when a passerby noticed that the bull terrier was fiercely guarding his deceased master. The officers observed that the bull terrier was panting heavily, indicating the heat was taking its toll on the poor animal. It was believed that the owner was a transient, and he had passed away due to natural causes. Despite his human's passing, the faithful bull terrier remained by his side and refused to leave him, even in death. Animal control officers realized that the dog needed urgent medical attention and tried to intervene, but the bull terrier was unwilling to leave his owner's side. The officers struggled with the dog, who put up a fight, unwilling to let go of his departed master. Finally, with a bit of coaxing and gentle reassurance, the officers managed to remove the bull terrier from his owner. After a thorough check-up, the dog was deemed healthy and well-cared-for, indicating that his owner had taken good care of him. Many people who heard about the incident were touched by the loyalty of the bull terrier to his owner. It's no secret that dogs are incredibly loyal creatures, and this was a fine example of that loyalty. It is amazing how man's best friend can sense when something is wrong, and they seem to know when their masters need them. The incident also shed light on the importance of taking care of pets, even when we no longer can. The owner of the bull terrier, despite being a transient, had taken good care of his dog, and that care had paid off as the dog was in good health. The bull terrier has been fostered by an animal rescue organization and is awaiting adoption. The rescue organization had posted pictures of the dog on social media, and many people have shown an interest in adopting him. The organization has received numerous inquiries, but they are carefully evaluating each one to ensure that the loyal dog goes to a loving home. The incident was a reminder of the incredible bond that exists between dogs and their owners, and the animal's loyalty continued, even after his master's passing. It's a testament to the faithfulness and loyalty that dogs show us throughout their lives, and it's something that we must never take for granted.
