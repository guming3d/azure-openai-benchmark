article: A 14-year-old boy who accused a teacher's aide of molesting him 'has serious behavioral issues' and is 'often suspended from school', it has been claimed. Mother-of-one Maria Contreras, 29, a substitute paraprofessional at the Bronx Academy of Letters in New York, was arrested on Saturday for her alleged affair with the mentally-ill student. But on Sunday an attorney rebutted the criminal charges and said the student is 'a special needs boy with serious behavioral issues.' Maria Contreras, a substitute teacher from New York, was taken into custody on Saturday and charged with multiple sex offenses after allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old mentally-ill student . Contreras was taken into custody  and charged with multiple sex offences for her alleged affair with the underage boy. Married Contreras, who worked for the city's Department of Education, was taken to the Bronx Special Victim's unit in handcuffs and denied the allegations as she spoke to waiting reporters. Police said the boy, who was one of Contreras's students, would walk to her apartment where they had sex at least six times in November, according to The New York Times. Officials announced she had also been fired from her job. A spokesman for The Department of Education released a statement to ABC 7 saying: 'These allegations are incredibly disturbing. 'Ms Contreras has been removed from her position and will no longer be employed.' Contreras, who was arraigned on Sunday, has been charged with six felony counts of second and third-degree rape for each alleged encounter. The 29-year-old allegedly had sex with the  schoolboy while she worked at the Bronx Academy of Letters . She is also charged with two felony counts of second-degree criminal sex act with a minor for alleged oral sex acts, court documents state. At the court hearing, a judge ordered Contreras to be held in lieu of $25,000 bond and $10,000 cash bail. But attorney Ruth Hamilton said that while the boy's accusations should be 'seriously considered', there are no witnesses, physical evidence, video or text messages to support the allegations. 'We have to keep in mind that this is the word of a special needs boy with serious behavioral issues, who is often suspended from school,' she told NBC New York. 'She has never been alone with him.' Hamilton added the school requires a teacher to be in a room with students at all times, so Contreras could not be alone with a student at the academy. 'This is an accusation that does not ring true,' she said.
