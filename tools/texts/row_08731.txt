Red-coloured sprouts are also being trialled at the company's site in Lincolnshire . The vegetable that most sharply divides opinion around the family dinner table is to get a flavour makeover in an ambitious bid to boost its popularity, according to a new report yesterday. Generations of children have groaned at the appearance of Brussels sprouts on their plate at mealtimes and determinedly pushed the leafy green vegetable to one side. But now a major new campaign is being launched to shake up the healthy sprout market and introduce a variety of different tastes to the leafy green vegetables. Trade magazine The Grocer said yesterday: 'The humble sprout is being given a makeover with new flavour strengths, and even colours, in a bid to encourage more Brits to eat the much maligned vegetable.'da . It reports that Produce World, a major supplier of brassicas and other vegetables to leading high street supermarket chains, is running field trials of mild-tasting and strong-tasting sprouts at its site in Butterwick, Lincolnshire. The new sprouts would be harvested later this year and if they performed well in taste tests, were likely to be grown commercially next year and could be on store shelves by Christmas 2014. Dara O'Doherty, new product development manager at Produce World told the magazine: 'We are just trying to make people aware and increase the marketing around sprouts and increase the fixture in store.' She said that strong-tasting sprouts would appeal to the 'sprout traditionalists.' Red-coloured sprouts are also being trialled and the firm already commercially grows the Flower Sprout - a cross between the Brussels sprout and kale, for a major retailer. Generations of children have groaned at the appearance of Brussels sprouts on their plate at mealtimes and determinedly pushed the leafy green vegetable to one side . The company is also trialling a new type of brassica that can be used both as a lettuce and as a cabbage. It is milder in flavour than cabbage but stronger than a lettuce, as well as red-veined cavolo nero and coloured kales. Sprouts became part of our staple 'meat and two veg' diet during and after the Second World War mainly due to rationing, but in the 80s and 90s their popularity was affected by changes in our eating habits and increasingly exotic diets. They also bore the brunt of schoolboy jokes which helped dampen the enthusiasm of an entire generation that led to general sales, outside of the Christmas market, falling into decline through the 90s. However, sprout popularity rose again during the noughties as a result of them often being used in recipes and TV cookery programmes by celebrity chefs. It is estimated that as much as 80 per cent of total British sprout sales take place in the two week Christmas and New Year period.

chatgpt: Produce World, a UK-based vegetable grower, is set to introduce new and exciting tastes to leafy green vegetables. As part of their campaign, they have begun trialing different types of sprouts in the Lincolnshire area. The move follows an increasing awareness among consumers about the importance of healthy eating and the need to include more vegetables in their diet. While leafy greens such as spinach and kale have gained popularity in recent years, sprouts have often been overlooked. The trials, which are being conducted in collaboration with local farmers, aim to showcase a variety of sprout types and highlight their unique flavors. The initiative comes as part of Produce World's commitment to innovation and ensuring that their customers have access to the best produce on offer. One of the new varieties being trialed by the company is the red-colored sprout. The arrival of this new strain has been met with excitement in the area, with many people eager to try these colorful vegetables for themselves. Red sprouts are known to be packed with antioxidants, which have been linked to numerous health benefits. The trials have been going well so far, and customers have been positive in their response to the new flavors. One of the biggest challenges faced by Produce World is changing the perception of sprouts as a bland and unappetizing vegetable. By introducing new varieties and showcasing their unique flavors, the company hopes to change this perception and increase the popularity of sprouts among consumers. Produce World has a long history of working closely with local farmers and using sustainable farming methods. This commitment is reflected in the current campaign, with the company only trialing sprouts that can be grown in the UK's climate and using sustainable farming practices. In addition to introducing new varieties of sprouts, Produce World is also committed to educating consumers about the benefits of incorporating more vegetables into their diets. As part of this, they have launched a social media campaign to raise awareness of the health benefits of sprouts and how they can be used in different dishes. One of the driving forces behind this campaign is the rising concern around obesity and related health issues. With a quarter of the UK's adult population classified as obese, there is a growing need for healthy food options. Sprouts are a great option, as they are low in calories, high in fiber, and rich in vitamins and minerals. The trials are ongoing, and Produce World is continuing to experiment with new sprout varieties. With the success of the campaign so far, it seems likely that more UK farmers will be inspired to grow sprouts and other leafy greens, creating a more diverse and exciting vegetable market. Overall, the introduction of new sprout varieties is a welcome development, reflecting a growing demand for healthy and innovative food options. By working closely with local farmers and using sustainable farming practices, Produce World is setting a great example for the rest of the industry to follow. As more consumers become aware of the unique flavors and health benefits of sprouts, it is hoped that we will see a greater appreciation for these overlooked vegetables.
