chatgpt: North Jackson, Tennessee â€“ In a heart-stopping moment, a suburban front garden was struck by lightning twice in one afternoon. The incident, which was captured on a security camera just after 3pm on Tuesday, has left many in the community shaken. The footage shows two bolts of lightning hitting the garden, causing explosions and a huge cloud of dust and smoke. The sound of the strikes is deafening, and the intensity of the light is blinding. Residents in the area reported feeling the ground shake, and many rushed outside to see what had happened. Several people were seen running towards the garden, clearly concerned about the welfare of those inside the property. Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, the damage to the property was significant. The explosions caused by the lightning strikes blew out windows and damaged the roof of the property. Local authorities have warned residents to take precautions during thunderstorms, urging them to stay indoors and avoid using electronic devices during the storm. They have also advised people to unplug appliances and disconnect telephone lines to avoid further damage from lightning strikes. The incident has also led to a discussion about the need for lightning rods to be installed on properties in the area. A lightning rod is a metal rod that is placed on a building to divert lightning strikes away from the structure and into the ground. Many residents are now considering installing these devices on their homes, in an effort to protect their property and loved ones from future lightning strikes. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the power of nature, and the need for vigilance during thunderstorms. Despite the damage caused by the two lightning strikes, the residents of North Jackson, Tennessee are grateful that nobody was hurt in the incident.
