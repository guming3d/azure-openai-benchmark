Now he lies, his speckled brown and white breast puffing in and out, as the acupuncture needles stimulate key points in his nervous system. 'When he first came, he couldn't stand up. Then he started taking little steps. Now he is flying again,' says Cornejo. She has given the unnamed owl 10 weekly acupuncture sessions so far. 'It stimulates self-curing mechanisms in the organism. It does not cause side-effects' as some medicines do, she says.

chatgpt: A little owl that flew into a factory stovepipe in Madrid has been receiving an unconventional treatment and is now on the path to recovery. The bird was found in a factory's stovepipe, and when it was brought into an owl sanctuary in the Spanish capital, it could not even stand. The owl sanctuary staff quickly started treating the bird with acupuncture, an unconventional treatment that has shown promising results for animals experiencing pain, inflammation, or weakness. For the last two months, the little owl has been receiving acupuncture treatments to help it regain its strength and mobility. The treatment appears to have had a positive effect on the little owl's health as the bird is now starting to fly again. According to the sanctuary's staff, the owl's condition has improved dramatically, and it now has the strength to take off and fly through the air. Although the owl is still in recovery, it is a promising sign that acupuncture worked where traditional treatments may have failed. Acupuncture has been used in humans and animals for centuries, and its effectiveness has been the subject of several studies. While there is no scientific evidence to support acupuncture's effectiveness in animals, many practitioners and pet owners have reported positive results from its use. Acupuncture is believed to work by stimulating the body's natural healing response. The little owl's recovery is an inspiring story that reminds us of the power of alternative therapies. The owl sanctuary's staff worked tirelessly to provide the bird with the care it needed to get back on its feet. Their efforts, along with the unique treatment plan of acupuncture, served as a beacon of hope for the little owl's recovery. Acupuncture has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine and has been used to treat a wide range of conditions. It involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points in the body to stimulate the body's natural healing response. It is believed that acupuncture can help improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and promote relaxation. While the use of acupuncture in animals is still not widely accepted, its potential for helping animals with various conditions cannot be ignored. With more research and testing, acupuncture could become a mainstream form of treatment for animals in the future. For now, we celebrate the little owl's recovery and the dedication of the owl sanctuary's staff in its care. The bird has come a long way from its initial state, and it is inspiring to see the results of the acupuncture treatment. As we continue to seek innovative ways to support animal health, acupuncture remains a promising and exciting option to consider.
