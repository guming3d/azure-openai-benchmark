article: (CNN) -- As a society, we do too much short-term thinking. In Washington, that has meant passing bills that paper over fiscal problems in the short term while ignoring long-term consequences for future generations. The result is a fiscal gap that places unknown financial burdens on today's young people. We may have different prescriptions for how to address our budget challenges, but from a personal standpoint, we both worry about how a lack of information about long-term budget realities will affect our children's generations and those that follow. We want Congress to do more long-term planning, like families and businesses across this country do every day. Instead of kicking the can down the road, Congress and the administration need to understand how policy decisions made today in Washington will affect future generations of Americans. On Wednesday, we are introducing a bill to bring more transparency to the budget process and ensure that members of Congress and the administration are honest with themselves and the American people about current and future budget realities. Right now, Congress only looks at the effect of legislation over the next 10 years. Rarely is information presented that reflects the longer-term impact. Our bill -- the Intergenerational Financial Obligations Reform Act, or INFORM -- would ensure that Congress, the administration and the American people have the information necessary to understand the effect that taxes, spending policies and future economic advancements will have on the fiscal health of the country and on individual Americans 20, 50 or even 75 years down the road. The INFORM Act would require the president to provide a detailed accounting of how the administration's budget and policy recommendations, and its predictions of economic health, would affect young people down the line. It would also require the Government Accountability Office to provide an annual analysis of the impact of future budget realities on generations to come and account for any fiscal gaps (the difference between spending and tax revenue). This approach -- known as a generational accounting and fiscal gap analysis -- would examine the full scope of the government's obligations, present and future, and then look at the effect those obligations will have on current and future generations. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush each used this tool in submitting executive budgets. Young Americans in their 20s and 30s deserve to know what the decisions of today's lawmakers mean for their future. And lawmakers should use every tool at our disposal to make better decisions. We believe this approach will help us improve the fiscal health of the country. Washington has spent enough time kicking the can down the road. It's time to start being honest about the long-term challenges facing future generations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.

chatgpt: Washington D.C - Senators John Thune and Tim Kaine co-authored a new bill called the "Integrating New Obligations for Relative Fiscal Maturity Act" (INFORM) that aims to address the lack of long-term perspective in budget planning. The senators believe that lawmakers and the administration need to take a more comprehensive view of their actions to account for future effects on the economy. In a joint statement, Thune and Kaine highlighted that the current approach to budget planning is too shortsighted, with a focus on the present rather than the future. They argue that their new bill would require both Congress and the administration to analyze their budget decisions and determine how they will impact the fiscal gaps in the long run. The senators noted that lawmakers must be honest about the long-term challenges facing the country, stressing that failing to account for such realities could be detrimental to the nation's economic stability. Their bill seeks to promote greater fiscal responsibility by requiring that Congress and the administration consider the long-term implications of their decisions. Senator Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, and Senator Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, agree that long-term planning is essential for sound economic policy. They noted that 'Washington's fiscal thinking doesn't account for the long term' and that this has led to the creation of unsustainable policy frameworks. Their bill, if passed, would require the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to prepare long-term budget outlook reports every four years. These reports would provide comprehensive analysis of the fiscal sustainability of current policies and would outline the potential effects of any proposed changes. The senators have called on their colleagues to support the bill and think beyond the immediate fallout of their actions. Senator Kaine further argued that "we have to start thinking beyond the next election and focus on the next generation" while Senator Thune stressed that "to make responsible decisions, we must plan for the future." The INFORM Act also builds on the work done by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which provided analysis for lawmakers on the long-term implications of various policies. The bill would strengthen the GAO's ability to provide such analysis and make it available to the public. The senators' commendable initiative highlights an undervalued aspect of effective governance, one that looks beyond the next election cycle or economic quarter, but rather thinks about how our decisions today will impact future generations. As lawmakers consider this new legislation, they will need to think beyond the present and consider the long-term challenges that Washington faces.  In conclusion, the INFORM Act aims to bring much-needed balance to the fiscal thinking of lawmakers in Washington, promoting fiscal responsibility for the sake of the country's future. The proposed legislation demonstrates the potential for bipartisanship, with both parties joining forces to promote a shared vision of a better, more prosperous future for all Americans.
