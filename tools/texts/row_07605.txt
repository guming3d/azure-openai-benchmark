The former Army chaplain, who has been a priest for more than 30 years, was relieved of his duties as a rural parish priest several months ago. Police later pulled him over in a country park, where he allegedly failed a breathalyser test. Davies was said to have 92 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, nearly three times the legal limit of 35 microgrammes. A Church spokesman said the vicar’s alleged crimes happened after he had stopped working in the village of Cockington, near Torquay, Devon. He was due before Torquay Magistrates’ Court this week but was excused from appearing in person after his lawyer submitted a letter to a district judge explaining his absence. The contents of the letter were not revealed to the court. Davies is yet to enter a plea to charges of driving in a public place while over the limit and assault by beating. He has been told not to contact three named women and not to go to the vicarage in Monterey Close, Torquay.

We do not condone the alleged actions in any way. ‘We are continuing to offer pastoral care to his family. My prayers are for David’s family and David himself in this immensely difficult time. I would ask that they be given privacy now.

chatgpt: Rev David Davies, a 49-year-old former Army chaplain, has been charged with assaulting a woman and drink driving. The incident has led to Davies being relieved of his duties as a rural parish priest in England. He was due to appear before Torquay Magistrates' Court this week, but has been bailed. The alleged incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning, according to police. Davies was stopped by officers while driving through the village of Chudleigh. He was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and assaulting a woman. Davies has been a priest in the Church of England for over 20 years, and has also served as a chaplain in the British Armed Forces. He was appointed to his current position as the rural parish priest of the Chudleigh Team Ministry just last year. The Church of England has confirmed that Davies has been relieved of his duties as a result of the charges. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Church said: "We take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously, and appropriate action has been taken in this case. Our thoughts are with all those affected by this unfortunate incident." Davies has been bailed ahead of his court appearance, and it is not yet clear when he will return to his duties. The news of his arrest has come as a shock to members of the local community, who had known him as a respected member of the clergy. Many of those who knew Davies have expressed their shock and disappointment at the allegations. One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "I can't believe this has happened. Rev Davies has always been a kind and compassionate man, and it's very sad to hear that he's been charged with these offenses." The arrest has also sparked a wider conversation about the role of clergy in the community, and what should be expected of them. Some have argued that those in positions of authority, such as priests, should be held to a higher standard of behavior than the general public. In the wake of the incident, the Church of England has reiterated its commitment to upholding high standards of behavior from its clergy. A spokesperson said: "We expect all those who serve as leaders in our church to live honorable lives and act with integrity at all times. If any allegations of misconduct are made against our clergy, we will always take them seriously and take appropriate action." As the case unfolds, residents of Chudleigh and members of the wider Church community will be watching with interest to see what the outcome will be. For now, Rev Davies is waiting for his court appearance, and the people who knew him are coming to terms with the shocking news.
