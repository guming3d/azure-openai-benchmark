article: (CNN) -- At least 12 people were killed in violent clashes between Yemeni troops and militants secessionists in the southern Yemeni province of Dhaleh on Tuesday, two Defense Ministry officials told CNN. Among those killed were six troops and six militants. A top army colonel was among the government troops killed. The Defense Ministry issued a statement in which it said that 14 soldiers were kidnapped by the secessionists. The ministry described the incident as a sabotage attack against a military supply truck. Residents told CNN that artillery shelling started in the morning hours and continued until the evening. "Bullets have entered through our home windows," said Saber Jamal, a resident in Dhaleh province. A ministry official said that clashes with the militants took place in four different fronts in the province. In January, the military shelled a funeral tent, allegedly by mistake, killing more than a dozen separatist supporters in Dhaleh. Clashes in the province have taken place on numerous occasions since, killing more than 30 over the past month. Earlier this month, the international community hailed Yemen's successes in the National Dialogue Conference, which aims to mainly solve the worries of southerners. The dialogue was launched one month after President Abdurabu Hadi came to power in 2012. Hadi took office as part of a internationally supported political deal that led to the ouster of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who departed a year after mass protests broke out. But secessionists say NDC resolutions have failed to address the southern issue in a manner conducive to trust. Political experts say that implementation of dialogue resolutions would need patience from all political sides. "Security is tense and factions who stand against reforms in Yemen will attempt to spread chaos and destabilize the country, said Nabil al-Khamery, a senior Yemeni politician, told CNN. "Political factions need to support the government and the transitional president Abdurabu Hadi as Yemen passes through this critical time," he added .

chatgpt: In the southern province of Dhaleh in Yemen, violent clashes have erupted in four different areas. A Ministry official has confirmed that 14 soldiers have been taken captive in the latest round of fighting. As the military continues to battle with separatist fighters in the region, many local residents are expressing frustration and fear for their safety. One resident of Dhaleh reports that bullets from the gunfight have entered their home, putting their family in danger. "We can hear the sounds of the fighting outside and it's very scary," the resident shared. "It's not safe here for anyone." The military's shelling of a funeral tent in January has sparked numerous clashes in the region, leading to a rise in violence and tension between government forces and separatist fighters. The latest round of fighting is just the most recent example of this ongoing conflict. Despite peace negotiations and diplomatic efforts, violence has continued to plague Yemen for years, particularly in the south of the country. The current conflict is rooted in a civil war that began in 2015, when Houthi rebels took over the capital city of Sanaa. Since then, Yemen's government forces have been battling against the rebels to regain control of the country. However, separatist fighters in the south have also been seeking greater autonomy and control over the region, leading to divisions within the country's military and political establishment. Over the years, Yemen has seen numerous deadly attacks and humanitarian crises, with millions of people in need of food, shelter, and medical assistance. The ongoing conflict has made it difficult for aid organizations to provide assistance to those in need, leading to widespread suffering among the Yemeni people. As the latest round of fighting unfolds in Dhaleh and elsewhere in the country, many are calling for an end to the violence and a renewed commitment to peaceful resolution of the conflict. However, with the situation seemingly worsening by the day, it's unclear what the future holds for Yemen and its people.
