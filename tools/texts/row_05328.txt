article: By . Chris Waugh . Nothing will give Arsenal fans more pleasure than knowing that one of their own helped humiliate Manchester United on Tuesday night as MK Dons hammered Louis van Gaal's side 4-0. Benik Afobe is the second Gunners striker this year to down a United side while on loan at another club after Joel Campbell netted against the Reds for Olympiacos in a 2-0 win for the Greek side. But, with Olivier Giroud struggling with a foot injury and Arsenal struggling for options up front, Gunners fans will be left wondering why Arsene Wenger cannot select Afobe in the first-team right now. VIDEO Scroll down for Jack Wilshere's thoughts on Benik Afobe and other Arsenal youth . Brace: Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe netted twice for MK Dons during their 4-0 victory over Manchester United . Celebration: Afobe showed his pace, power and strength during the Capital One Cup tie on Tuesday evening . Afobe - a 21-year-old striker who is enjoying his sixth loan spell in four years - bagged a brace for the Dons to wrap up a famous win for the League One side. The forward now has three goals in six games this season. He showed his pace, power and strength as he tormented United's young defence and opportunistically capitalised on two mistakes to score twice. For the first goal, Afobe ran in behind the United defence and took a wonderful through-ball in his stride before coolly slotting past David de Gea. His second strike was perhaps even more impressive. After James Reece misjudged a long ball down the right-hand side, Afobe ran in behind him, nicked the ball and held off the challenges of three players as he advanced into the box and fired home. Cool: Afobe slots home his first, and MK Dons' third, after collecting an excellent through-ball . Opportunism: Afobe nicks in behind the United defence before beating three defenders to score his second . Born in Kent, Afobe was picked up by Arsenal's academy at the age of just six. He was signed professionally in 2010 and has since spent time on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, Huddersfield Town, Reading, Bolton and Millwall. His career return of 15 goals in 71 games is not overly impressive, but the potential he showed against United means Wenger must be contemplating why he allowed to let him leave on a season-long loan. Having represented England from U16 through to U21 level - and having scored once already for the oldest of those sides - he has shown he can rise to the big occasion. But even if Arsenal fans do not see Afobe play at the Emirates for the remainder of this season, they will laud him as a hero after downing United in such devastating fashion. Finish: Afobe raced into the box, beating three men on the way, before unleashing an unstoppable shot . VIDEO Robinson in shock as MK Dons stun United .

chatgpt: English football giant, Manchester United, suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of MK Dons in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday. The Dons dominated the game with a 4-0 victory, in a match that highlighted the stark differences between the two teams. The game was brimming with excitement from the start, with both teams eager to assert their dominance. However, it was MK Dons' Benik Afobe who drew first blood only seven minutes into the game, following a swift counter-attack. Afobe, who is currently on a season-long loan from Arsenal to MK Dons, proved to be a thorn in the side of Manchester United throughout the match, scoring two goals and further cementing his place as one of the brightest young talents in English football. The 21-year-old forward has already scored three goals in six appearances for MK Dons this season and has also scored one for England U21s during his two caps. The Dons were not content with just a one-goal lead and continued to put pressure on Manchester United's defence. The home team's persistence was rewarded in the second half when Will Grigg doubled the lead, before scoring a second goal just fifteen minutes later to put the game beyond any doubt. It was a night to forget for Louis van Gaal, who is yet to win a game as the Manchester United manager. The veteran Dutch coach had gone into the game believing his team had a good chance of progressing to the next round of the cup, but was left reeling by the magnitude of the loss. The defeat was Manchester United's worst since they were trounced 6-1 by Manchester City in 2011. The loss has cast a shadow over the club, with fans expressing their frustration and disbelief at the poor showing. Some fans have taken to social media to vent their anger and call for the club's management to take decisive action. But despite the outrage, van Gaal remains steadfast in his belief that Manchester United will bounce back from this setback. The defeat is a major blow to Manchester United's already-dented reputation and leaves them with a lot of work to do ahead of their next match. The club has a rich history of success, but this loss serves as a reminder that no team is invincible and that they must work harder if they are to maintain their position in the top tier of English football. In contrast, the future looks bright and promising for MK Dons, who can be proud of their performance and their burgeoning talent in players like Afobe and Grigg. The Dons will now look to build on this impressive victory as they progress to the next round of the Capital One Cup, while Manchester United will be left to reflect on a night they will want to forget.
