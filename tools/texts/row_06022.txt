article: (CNN) -- Former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky arrived in Switzerland Sunday, according to a statement posted on his website. Khodorkovsky was pardoned and released from a Russian prison on December 20 after spending 10 years in jail after a fraud and tax evasion conviction. Less than a week after his release, Khodorkovsky was granted a Schengen visa -- which allows him to travel throughout the European Union -- by Swiss authorities. Khodorkovsky "is grateful for the principled positions taken by the Swiss authorities over the many years of his unjust imprisonment," read the statement. "Swiss judicial authorities were quick to recognise the politicised nature of Mr. Khodorkovsky's prosecution." According to the statement, "the purpose of his visit is a family matter, as he and his wife are accompanying their two sons back to school in Switzerland." Khodorkovsky has two twin sons studying in a Swiss school. Khodorkovsky and his wife traveled by train from Berlin, where they have been since Khodorkovsky's release. After Russian President Vladimir Putin's December pardon, the country's Supreme Court will take a second look at cases against Khodorkovsky, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. The court cited the European Court of Human Rights' criticism of the tax evasion and fraud case. The statement said Khodorkovsky has not made plans for permanent residency in Switzerland. Russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, with countries including the United States accusing it of selective prosecution and abuse of the legal system. Khodorkovsky's release was one of dozens, part of Putin's new amnesty law that some critics have described as a public relations campaign ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. In past statements to CNN, Khodorkovsky has said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of Yukos, the oil company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s.

chatgpt: Former Russian oil tycoon, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, has arrived in Switzerland to visit his family after being released from a Russian prison where he served a 10-year sentence. Khodorkovsky had been jailed on charges of fraud and tax evasion, but many of his supporters believed the charges were politically motivated. Once one of the richest men in Russia, Khodorkovsky fell out of favour with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the early 2000s. His arrest in 2003 sent shockwaves through the business community and was seen by many as a warning to those who opposed Putin's rule. Khodorkovsky was eventually released in 2013 after his sentence was reduced. Since his release, Khodorkovsky has become an outspoken critic of Putin's regime and has been actively involved in supporting Russian opposition figures. However, he still faces charges in Russia and has been living in exile in Switzerland and the UK. Khodorkovsky's visit to Switzerland to see his family is a significant milestone for the former oil tycoon. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival, he said that he was grateful to be able to travel without restrictions and to see his loved ones. He also expressed his hope that one day he would be able to return to Russia without fear of persecution. Despite his release from prison, Khodorkovsky remains a controversial figure in Russia. Many Russians see him as a symbol of the oligarchic system that dominated the country during the 1990s, and his support for opposition figures is viewed with suspicion by those who support Putin's regime. Khodorkovsky's visit to Switzerland is likely to be viewed as a victory by his supporters, who argue that his release from prison was a miscarriage of justice. Nevertheless, the former oil tycoon's future remains uncertain, and he may never be able to return to Russia unless significant political changes take place. As Khodorkovsky continues to advocate for political reform in Russia, his story will serve as a reminder of the complex relationship between power, wealth and politics in the country. Nevertheless, his visit to Switzerland is a sign of hope that change is possible, even in the face of significant adversity.
