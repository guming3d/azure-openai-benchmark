Cech, 32, is said to be keeping his options open on the day the window closes. The Blues hero is currently in Prague on international duty with the Czech Republic, but a move away from Chelsea is still possible. Cech would give little away when questioned about his future on Monday, however. 'I've been at the club for 10 years, the situation is now new to me,' he told sport.cz. 'The three opening matches I could not play for the team. I have no reason to panic, pack up and leave. 'I am a Chelsea player, where I have two more years of contract. Bright future: QPR have already signed England Under 21 keeper Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million . 'In football, nothing can be predicted in advance, nothing is ever perfect. 'A lot of players go on representative duty, yet still many transfer clubs. 'The offer would have to be right for everyone. I do not exclude anything (or) know the answer.' QPR have already signed Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million and Robert Green is their first choice. They recently allowed Brazilian World Cup goalkeeper Julio Cesar to leave for Benfica. Legend: Cech has gone down in history at Stamford Bridge after a glittering career with Chelsea . Appearances: 477 . Clean sheets: 220 . Trophies: . 1x Champions League . 1x Europa League . 3x Premier League . 4x FA Cup . 2x League Cup . 2x Community shield . It is believed that Cech was offered to QPR last week, ahead of them completing the signing of McCarthy from Championship club Reading. Paris Saint-Germain are set to test Cech's resolve to stay in England. They want to bring in the player - as well as Chelsea goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon - and would prefer to do a loan deal as it would help them in meeting UEFA's Financial Fair Play restrictions. PSG were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure. PSG see Cech as the ideal man to help them win the Champions League, deeming him better than current No 1, Italian Salvatore Sirigu, and would have no problem matching his wages.

chatgpt: Chelsea have reportedly offered their veteran goalkeeper, Petr Cech, to Queens Park Rangers. The 32-year-old has lost his place to the younger Thibaut Courtois and is looking for a new club before the transfer deadline day. Cech has spent 11 years at Stamford Bridge and is considered one of the greatest goalkeepers in the Premier League history. However, with Courtois firmly established as the first-choice keeper for Chelsea, Cech has been relegated to the bench and is now looking for a new challenge. It is understood that Cech prefers to stay in London instead of moving abroad, which has opened up the possibility of a switch to Queens Park Rangers. However, this move seems unlikely after QPR signed Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6m earlier this week. McCarthy was signed to provide competition to current QPR goalkeeper, Rob Green, and it would be hard to justify bringing in another goalkeeper, especially one with Cech's pedigree, when they have just spent a significant amount of money on McCarthy. If Cech is unable to join Queens Park Rangers, then he may have to look beyond London for potential suitors. Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur have all been linked with the Czech international in the past, and they may be interested in signing him on loan or on a permanent deal. Wherever Cech ends up, he will be a valuable addition to any squad. The 32-year-old is still an outstanding goalkeeper and has the experience and leadership skills to be a valuable asset to any team. He has won four Premier League titles with Chelsea as well as a host of other domestic and European honours and would be a fantastic addition to any team looking to improve their defensive capabilities. Chelsea manager, Jose Mourinho, has stated that he will not stand in Cech's way if he wants to leave the club, as he has been a loyal servant to the Blues over the years. Cech is a popular figure amongst Chelsea fans, and they will undoubtedly be sad to see him leave, but they will understand that he needs to play regular football at this stage of his career. In conclusion, Petr Cech's future remains uncertain, as he looks to move away from Chelsea before the transfer deadline day. A move to Queens Park Rangers seems unlikely after their recent signing of Alex McCarthy, but other London clubs including Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United, could be potential suitors. Whatever happens, Cech will go down as one of the greatest goalkeepers in Premier League history and will undoubtedly be missed by Chelsea fans.
