It wasn't until the following day that her body was found, after a bus driver raised the alarm upon noticing tire tracks leading off the road and onto the icy river below. According to reports, Ahmann had been driving home from work at the time of the accident.

Despite the efforts of emergency responders, Ahmann was pronounced dead at the scene. Friends and family of the young woman have been taking to social media to express their condolences and remember the kind and charismatic person that Ahmann was. One friend described Ellen as "always smiling and always had something nice to say about everyone". The tragic accident has brought the issue of road safety and winter driving conditions to the fore once again. With icy roads and snow-covered highways becoming more common during the winter months, it's important for drivers to take extra precautions when they're on the road. This includes reducing speed, ensuring that vehicles are equipped with good quality winter tires, and avoiding unnecessary trips if road conditions are particularly hazardous. Minnesota State Patrol's Lieutenant, Gordon Shank, emphasized the importance of staying safe on the roads in winter weather. "We can't stress enough the importance of winter driving safety, and how even the smallest of missteps can lead to tragic consequences," he said. A spokesperson for the bar that Ahmann worked at expressed deep sadness at the news of her passing. "Ellen was an incredible employee and a wonderful person. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time," they said. The tragic accident has left a community in shock and sadness. Ellen Marie Ahmann, described as a beacon of positivity and kindness, will be deeply missed by all who knew her. As winter continues to bring treacherous driving conditions, it's up to all of us to take the necessary precautions to ensure that we arrive at our destinations safely.
