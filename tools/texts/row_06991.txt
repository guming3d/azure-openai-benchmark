When Jeremy Clarskon showed off his personally-designed robotic car on a recent episode of Top Gear it was described as the world's smallest. But inventors in Japan have gone one better - developing a tiny car that can automatically take passengers from A to B without them having to do a thing. Japanese tech conglomerate Hitachi today revealed its new Robot for Personal Intelligent Transport System (Ropits, for short) in the city of Tsukuba in the Ibaraki Prefecture.

Looking uncomfortable within the car's miniscule frame, Clarkson said: 'I’m just staggered that Ford, GM, Toyota, all of the automotive giants haven’t thought to make a car like this yet.' The Japanese robot is equipped with GPS to allow it to find its way, as well as laser distance sensors to look out for obstacles and a gyro sensor to help it stay upright while negotiating uneven ground. Passengers need only specify their desired destination on a touch-screen map and the machine will automatically drive them there. Similarly, anyone who needs a ride will be able to call a Ropits vehicle from any number of computer-networked 'stops' dotted around the city. The vehicle is also equipped with 'active suspension' which controls each wheel individually to enable it to tackle curbs and uneven ground while keeping passengers comfortably upright.

chatgpt: Hitachi, a leading technology company, has recently revealed its new Robot for Personal Intelligent Transport System. The Robot is designed to carry passengers and navigate them through the busy streets of Tsukuba, a city in the Ibaraki Prefecture of Japan. This new system will play a vital role in alleviating congestion on the streets of Tsukuba, as the robot will be able to navigate through the traffic and find the quickest route to its destination. The Robot uses GPS technology to calculate the optimal route for each trip, ensuring that passengers are able to get to their destinations quickly and efficiently. Hitachi's Robot for Personal Intelligent Transport System is a significant step forward in the development of autonomous transport systems. The technology behind the robot allows it to operate independently, without the need for a human driver. This not only makes the system more efficient, but it also reduces the risk of accidents on the streets. However, Hitachi isn't the only company making waves in the world of transportation. Jeremy Clarkson, best known for his role as a presenter on the popular TV show Top Gear, recently unveiled his latest creation - the P45. According to Clarkson, the P45 is allegedly the world's smallest car. It measures just 1.3 meters long, making it significantly smaller than most other cars on the market. Despite its size, however, the P45 is still capable of reaching speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. The P45's small size means that it's perfect for navigating through tight spaces and congested urban areas. In fact, Clarkson himself was able to take the car through the BBC Television Centre in London, which is known for having narrow and winding corridors. While the P45 may not be as high-tech as Hitachi's new Robot for Personal Intelligent Transport System, it still represents a significant step forward in the world of transportation. It's clear that both companies are committed to creating innovative solutions to the challenges of urban transportation. As our cities continue to grow and become increasingly congested, it's clear that more and more people will be looking for new and innovative ways to get around. Hitachi's new Robot for Personal Intelligent Transport System and the P45 are just two examples of the many solutions that are being developed to meet this need. It's an exciting time for transportation, and it's clear that there's still plenty of room for innovation and development in this field. Whether it's through high-tech solutions like Hitachi's new Robot, or more creative options like the P45, it's clear that the future of transportation is going to be both exciting and innovative.
