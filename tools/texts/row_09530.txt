article: (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy's oldest nuclear aircraft carrier has given a piece of itself to one of the younger carriers in the fleet. Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding said this week that its workers had transferred an anchor from the USS Enterprise (CVN-65), the Navy's first and oldest nuclear carrier, to the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), a Nimitz-class carrier launched in 1988. The Enterprise, which was launched in 1960, was inactivated in 2012 and is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2016. Once its nuclear fuel and reactors are removed, it will be cut up for scrap. It has been at the Virginia shipyard for the de-fueling process. The Lincoln is in the same shipyard for what is called a refueling and complex overhaul. "During this multi-year process, every inch of the carrier is updated or refurbished, including its two massive anchors," the shipyard said in a statement. When it was found that one of the Lincoln's 30-ton anchors needed to be replaced, crews turned to the Enterprise, which had an exact match that would have been headed to the scrap heap with the rest of the five-decade-old ship. "With this anchor, both ships will be linked, and Lincoln will carry Enterprise's spirit as it returns to the fleet," Chris Miner, Newport News' vice president of in-service aircraft carrier programs, said in a statement. That anchor move may assuage some Navy enthusiasts, who have pushed for a new Navy vessel to carry the name Enterprise once the current ship finally leaves the fleet. The carrier now docked in Newport News is the eighth American warship to carry the Enterprise name. The Naval Vessel Register, the service's official list of ships, shows the Enterprise name assigned to hull number CVN-80, a proposed aircraft carrier yet to be authorized or funded by Congress. The Lincoln's overhaul is expected to be complete in 2016, when the ship is scheduled to head out for sea trials, according to a shipyard statement. Meanwhile, the Enterprise will be towed down the East Coast and all the way around the tip of South America and up the Pacific Coast, with a final destination of Puget Sound, Washington. There its nuclear reactor will be removed and buried at a disposal site on the former Hanford nuclear production complex on the Columbia River.

chatgpt: In a rare move, the US Navy has transferred a massive 30-ton anchor from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise to the USS Abraham Lincoln, which is currently in a shipyard undergoing a major overhaul. The anchor, which is almost five decades old, was removed from the Enterprise, which is in the process of having its nuclear fuel removed before it is decommissioned.  The transfer of the anchor was a complex operation, requiring specialized cranes and rigging, including a multi-point sling to support the heavy load. The USS Abraham Lincoln was positioned adjacent to the Enterprise in the shipyard, making it possible to transport the anchor in a safe and efficient manner. The USS Abraham Lincoln, which was commissioned in 1989, needed a new anchor as part of its overhaul, and the transfer from the Enterprise was seen as a cost-effective solution. The anchor from the Enterprise was still in good shape, despite being almost as old as the Lincoln itself, and was a perfect fit for the 100,000-ton ship. The transfer of the anchor was not without its challenges, as the Enterprise anchor's shape and size required the Lincoln's chain locker to be modified. The Navy also had to make sure that the anchor met all safety requirements and was properly attached to the Lincoln's chains. The USS Abraham Lincoln is undergoing a major overhaul that includes upgrades to its weapons systems, engines, and other critical components. The ship, which was recently deployed to the Middle East, will return to service with improved capabilities following its overhaul. The USS Enterprise, which was commissioned in 1961, is in the process of being decommissioned after more than 50 years of service. The removal of the ship's nuclear fuel is a complex and time-consuming process that will take several years to complete. Once the fuel has been removed, the Enterprise will be dismantled and recycled. The transfer of the anchor from the USS Enterprise to the USS Abraham Lincoln is a testament to the Navy's commitment to maintaining its fleet and ensuring that its ships are equipped with the best possible equipment. The transfer also highlights the importance of recycling and repurposing materials to reduce waste and save resources. In conclusion, the transfer of the anchor from the USS Enterprise to the USS Abraham Lincoln is a noteworthy event that demonstrates the Navy's dedication to maintaining its fleets and its commitment to resource conservation. The Navy's decision to repurpose the anchor from the Enterprise for the Lincoln's overhaul is a cost-effective solution that will enable the ship to return to service with improved capabilities.
