With quite so many bundles of joy all lined up together, a bonny baby contest will inevitably involve the odd tantrum. In the Wiltshire town of Devizes, however, it’s not the toddlers who are throwing their toys out of the pram – it’s the grown-ups. The annual event has provoked a row after carnival organisers cancelled it for being ‘unfair’ to the children deemed less than bonny. Last year's winners: Organisers of Devizes Carnival, in Wiltshire, have ruled the 'bonny baby' contest is 'no longer an appropriate item' for the event. Pictured are last year's winners . But they reckoned without the mothers of Devizes, who have accused the committee of excessive ‘political correctness’ – and launched their own unofficial bonny baby contest. Stephanie Gale, 28, is the mother of one of last year’s winners, Toby. She said: ‘It’s a bit of fun and everybody likes looking at pictures of babies.’ Support: The alternative pageant has won the backing of Devizes Mayor Pete Smith (pictured), who said the event brings the community together . But Dave Buxton, of Devizes Outdoor Celebratory Arts, which organises the carnival, said: ‘It’s a really modern carnival with hundreds of people taking part. ‘Do you really think it is a good idea to judge babies and decide which ones are the best? 'We are a community arts organisation and it is not really appropriate. ‘It just doesn’t seem a very nice thing to do. Everyone believes that their baby is the best baby. 'How do you feel if your baby isn’t the one that has won?’ Organisers have also abolished the role of Carnival Queen this year as it does not ‘fit with the ethos’ of the event. The carnival procession will be held on August 31, with an unofficial ‘Mayor’s Baby Show’ four days beforehand. The alternative event has been organised by the former chairman of Devizes Carnival, Jeanette Von Berg, and endorsed by mayor Peter Smith. He said: ‘The committee are doing a good job, but people like the old-fashioned stuff. ‘They like to take their kids along and say “Granny did this when she was a little girl”. ‘The mums said it was political correctness gone mad and I agree – it’s absolutely stupid.’ Devizes: Committee members have also abolished the role of Carnival Queen as it does not 'fit with the ethos' of the event (picture shows general view of Devizes)

chatgpt: The annual Devizes Carnival in Wiltshire, known for its colorful floats, music, dance performances, and family-friendly entertainment, has long been a major draw for local residents and tourists alike. However, this year's event has sparked controversy following the decision by organizers to scrap the popular baby pageant, which has been a feature of the carnival for many years. The Devizes Carnival committee, made up of local volunteers, unanimously voted to end the baby pageant, citing concerns about the appropriateness of the competition and the pressure it puts on babies and their parents. The decision was announced on the carnival's website, and received a mixed response from the community. Some members of the public expressed disappointment and frustration at the committee's decision, arguing that the baby pageant was a harmless and enjoyable aspect of the carnival that had been a part of the event for as long as they could remember. Others welcomed the move, saying that it was the right thing to do and that it would help to promote more inclusive and diverse forms of entertainment for all ages. Despite the decision by the committee, a group of mothers has taken matters into their own hands by organizing an unofficial baby pageant to coincide with the carnival. The organizers of the 'unofficial' contest argue that it is a way of celebrating the cultural and social significance of the baby pageant, while also giving parents and their babies the chance to be recognized for their efforts and achievements. However, the move has sparked division within the community, with some criticizing the mothers for going against the decision of the carnival committee and others supporting their right to organize an alternative event. It remains to be seen whether the 'unofficial' baby pageant will gain traction and become a permanent fixture of the carnival or whether it will be dismissed as a one-time event. In response to the controversy, the Devizes Carnival committee has defended its decision, saying that it is committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all attendees of the carnival, no matter their age or background. The committee has also announced several new events and activities for this year's carnival, including live music performances, food and drink stalls, and a children's area with games and attractions. Despite the absence of the baby pageant, organizers are confident that this year's Devizes Carnival will be a success, with plenty of entertainment on offer for visitors of all ages. As one committee member put it, "The Devizes Carnival is all about celebrating our community and having fun, and we're excited to see what this year's event will bring." Whether or not the controversy over the baby pageant will continue to cast a shadow over the festivities remains to be seen, but it is clear that the issue has sparked a wider debate about the role of traditional entertainment in modern society.
