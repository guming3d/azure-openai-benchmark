article: The sometimes deadly MERS-CoV virus has spread to Italy, the World Health Organization said in statements this weekend. Sunday's announcement that two female patients had contracted the virus follows one Saturday that said a 45-year-old man, who had recently traveled to Jordan, had become infected. They are the first three known cases in Italy. Middle East respiratory symptom coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, acts like a cold virus and attacks the respiratory system, the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. But symptoms, which include fever and a cough, are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Opinion: Why virus is so scary . Of the 53 known infections with the virus, 30 have resulted in death since September 2012, the organization said. Precise data are not available on the total number of people who have been infected because it is difficult to tell how many get a mild form of the infection. A patient died May 28 in France after having contracted the virus during a trip to the Middle East. MERS: Your questions answered . The health agency said the three Italian patients were all in stable condition. The two cases reported Sunday were a 42-year-old woman and a 2-year-old girl who are close contacts of the man, the WHO said. The virus is "a threat to the entire world," the WHO's general director said last week. 5 things to know about the coronavirus . It "is not a problem that any single affected country can keep to itself or manage all by itself," Margaret Chan said Monday in her closing remarks at the 66th World Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in four European countries and Tunisia. However, "all of the European cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East," the WHO said earlier this month. But "in France and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in contact with a traveler recently returned from the Middle East." Coronaviruses cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, as well as a variety of animal diseases. Health officials do not yet know much about how the newly discovered virus spreads, which makes it hard for scientists to prevent infections, Chan said. The WHO is calling for the world to pull together its resources to study and tackle the virus. New virus is a 'threat to the entire world'

chatgpt: In a worrying turn of events, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has made its way to Italy. Three patients tested positive for the virus, marking the first cases of MERS in the country. This brings the total number of countries affected by the virus to 27. MERS first emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, and since then, there have been 53 known infections worldwide. Unfortunately, 30 of these cases have ended in death, sparking concern amongst healthcare professionals and the World Health Organization (WHO). Symptoms of MERS can be deceivingly similar to those of the common cold, namely fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, the severity of the virus can lead to more serious symptoms, such as pneumonia and kidney failure, making it a cause for concern. The WHO has warned that MERS is "a threat to the entire world," and since its first outbreak, the virus has continued to spread to new areas, including the United States and Europe. The Italian government has taken swift action to isolate the three patients and prevent the spread of the virus. However, the WHO has stressed the importance of continued vigilance, as the virus can sometimes spread before symptoms become apparent. In countries where MERS has already taken hold, such as Saudi Arabia and South Korea, measures have been put in place to prevent the spread of the virus. These include increased screening at airports and healthcare facilities, as well as public education campaigns to raise awareness about the virus. As the global health community works to contain the spread of MERS, research is continuing into the origins of the virus and potential treatments. A recent study found that camels may be the primary source of the virus, as many individuals infected with MERS have had contact with the animals. The WHO has urged individuals traveling to areas where MERS is endemic, including the Middle East and Africa, to take precautions to avoid contracting the virus. This includes avoiding contact with sick individuals and practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly. While the emergence of MERS in Italy is certainly cause for concern, healthcare officials are optimistic that with swift action and continued vigilance, the spread of the virus can be contained. It remains to be seen what impact the virus will have on the global health community in the coming months and years, but researchers and policymakers alike are committed to finding a solution to this growing threat.
