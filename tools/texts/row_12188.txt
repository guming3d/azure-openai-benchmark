Police are pictured clearing a Werrington home after searching the property . Turnbull was charged with possessing a prohibited weapon and possessing an explosive for unlawful purpose. In refusing bail, Magistrate Dorelle Pinch took into account previous failures by Turnbull to appear in court, his lengthy criminal record and the serious nature of the offence. "There are no bail conditions that can mitigate these unacceptable risks and bail is refused," Ms Pinch told the court. After the decision, Turnbull, sporting a shaved head and facial tattoos, swore at the magistrate before his audio visual link was turned off. The court heard Turnbull obtained the "improvised explosive device", allegedly containing 50 ball bearings, in a bag from a silver car outside his house, took the bag into his bedroom, and later left in the car. The court was told Turnbull's mother later entered the bedroom, opened the bag, and called police. Investigators carried boxes and bags out of the property in Sydney's greater west .

The court heard that when shown a picture of the homemade bomb in an interview with police after his arrest, Turnbull said the device "looked cool" and "could be a bunger". In arguing for bail, Mr Mallinson said his client didn't know "what he was in possession of" and that there would be "huge delays" before the case next came to court because forensic evidence needed to be collected. Police prosecutor Ben Seabury said he held "grave concerns" for the community if Turnbull was released, describing the possible injuries sustained if the device had exploded as "catastrophic". He said the device had the potential to "kill or maim", adding that "50 ball bearings would have caused major damage". The matter returns to Parramatta Local Court on February 27.

chatgpt: Harley Roy Turnbull, a 22-year old man, was refused bail on Thursday, after his mother allegedly found an improvised explosive device (IED) in his bedroom. Turnbull’s mother reportedly alerted the authorities after she discovered the device, leading to his arrest on Wednesday. Police have described the device as a homemade bomb, with prosecutors alleging that it was packed with ball bearings, making it even more dangerous. The discovery of the IED has raised concerns over terrorism threats, as the use of homemade bombs is often associated with terrorist activities. The incident took place in Australia, which has recently been on high alert following a series of terrorist attacks in various parts of the world. Turnbull’s arrest has only added to the anxiety of the local community, as they fear the possibility of a terrorist attack on their soil. When Turnbull appeared in court, he reportedly swore at the magistrate as he was refused bail. The prosecution argued that there was a risk of Turnbull fleeing or committing further offences, and that he posed a significant threat to the community. The defence argued that Turnbull had no previous record of criminal activity and that he would comply with bail conditions if released. However, the magistrate was not convinced and refused bail. The investigation into the case is ongoing, with police conducting a thorough search of Turnbull’s home and questioning his family and associates. The authorities are trying to determine how Turnbull acquired the materials for the bomb and whether he was acting alone or with others. The incident has once again highlighted the need for increased vigilance and security measures in the fight against terrorism. The use of homemade bombs, particularly those packed with shrapnel, can cause mass casualties and destruction, as seen in several terrorist attacks in recent years. This case serves as a reminder that terrorism is not limited to specific regions or groups, and that it can happen anywhere and at any time. It is essential for individuals to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. As the investigation into Turnbull’s case continues, the local community awaits answers and assurances that measures are in place to prevent any future attacks. The incident has left many people on edge and emphasises the need for authorities to remain vigilant and proactive in the fight against terrorism.
