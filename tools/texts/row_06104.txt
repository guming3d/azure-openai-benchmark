It is believed to have formed from a collision, 4.5 billion years ago, between Earth and an impactor the size of Mars, known as 'Theia'. However, over the past decades scientists have simulated this process and hit major problems known as the 'lunar paradox' - finding the moon appears to be made up of material that would not be expected if the current collision theory is correct. Researchers have shed new light on the collision which they believed caused the moon 4.5 billion years ago, when a massive collider known as 'Theia' collided with the earth. A recent study published in the journal Icarus proposes a new perspective on the theory in answer to the paradox. If current theories are to be believed, analyses of the various simulations of the Earth-Theia collision predict that the Moon is mostly made up of material from Theia. However, studying materials from both Earth and the Moon, shows remarkable similarities. In fact, elements found on the Moon show identical isotopic properties to those found on Earth. Given it is very unlikely that both Theia and Earth had identical compositions, scientists say this paradox casts doubt over the dominant theory for the Moon formation. A group of researchers from the University of Bern, Switzerland, have now made a significant breakthrough in the story of the formation of the Moon, suggesting an answer to this Lunar Paradox. They used simulations to examine different geometry of collisions. They also examined the so-called 'hit-and-run collisions', where a significant amount of material is lost into space on orbits unbound to the Earth. The researchers believe their simulation could finally solve the 'lunar paradox' which has baffled scientists . 'Our model considers new impact parameters, which were never tested before,' said lead author Andreas Reufer. 'Besides the implications for the Earth-Moon system itself, the considerably higher impact velocity opens up new possibilities for the origin of the impactor and therefore also for models of terrestrial planet formation, . 'While none of the simulations presented in their research provides a perfect match for the constraints from the actual Earth-Moon-system, several do come close,' adds Alessandro Morbidelli, one of the Icarus' Editors. 'This work, therefore, suggests that a future exhaustive exploration of the vast collisional parameter space may finally lead to the long-searched solution of the lunar paradox.'

chatgpt: A recent study by German researchers proposes a new theory on the formation of the moon. The generally accepted theory posits that the moon was formed by debris from a collision between a Mars-sized object and the early Earth, known as the Giant Impact hypothesis. However, the new analysis suggests that the moon’s creation may have been even more violent than previously imagined. The researchers, led by Dr. Gerrit Budde from the University of Münster, contend that the impact with the theoretical object, called "Theia," was more akin to a "hit and run" collision than a simple impact. According to their hypothesis, Theia did not simply collide with Earth and then blend with it as previously thought, but instead struck the planet at an oblique angle before its debris was ejected into space. This created a disk of debris that eventually coalesced to form the moon. To support this theory, Budde and his team studied the isotopic composition of moon rocks brought back during the Apollo missions, analyzing the ratio of various isotopes of tungsten and oxygen. They compared these samples to those taken from Earth and found that they were strikingly similar, suggesting that Theia and Earth had similar isotopic makeups. Furthermore, the researchers also found that the moon had a composition that was distinct from Earth, with a lower content of volatile elements such as sodium, potassium, and zinc. This indicated that the moon was formed from material that was somehow separated from the Earth's mantle during the impact. The researchers believe that their findings could provide a more accurate account of how the moon was formed, dispelling some of the long-held misconceptions about the event. The study also highlights the crucial role of Theia in this process, which is thought to have been obliterated during the impact. It is possible that pieces of Theia may still exist in the area where it collided with Earth, but as the researchers note, they would be difficult to identify. This latest research provides additional insights into one of the most significant events in our planet's history, which occurred nearly 4.5 billion years ago. The moon's formation dramatically altered the Earth's orbit and revolutionized the planet's tides, among other effects. Understanding how it was formed is therefore of great significance for scientists, as it offers a glimpse into the early stages of the solar system's evolution. It remains to be seen whether the new theory of a "hit and run" collision will be widely accepted in scientific circles, but it is clear that this latest study offers a fresh perspective on a fascinating subject. As more data is collected and analyzed, it is likely that we will continue to refine our understanding of how the moon came into existence.
