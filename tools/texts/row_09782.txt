article: Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Somalia's Parliament ousted the country's Prime Minister in a vote of no confidence Monday after a dispute between him and the President over Cabinet picks. The move against Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon is the latest government shake-up for a country that has struggled to achieve an effective central government since a dictator's overthrow two decades ago. Shirdon, in office less than 14 months, lost the confidence vote 184-65, Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari said. He said the current government will remain until a new prime minister takes office. Somalia's constitution gives President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud a month to appoint a new prime minister, who would need to be confirmed by Parliament. Al-Shabaab attack on Somali police station kills at least 12 . Mohamud appointed Shirdon to the post in October 2012, just a month after lawmakers elected Mohamud to his office. But relations between the two leaders soured when Shirdon, who was supposed to serve a four-year term, refused to put Mohamud's picks into the Cabinet, which was going to be reshuffled and expanded. "Some members of the Cabinet who are looking for their own interest, and not the interest of the nation, are the ones behind" the no-confidence vote, Shirdon told reporters in his office on Monday. He said before the vote that he would comply with whatever decision the Parliament made. Mohamud said Monday that he recognized "the effort and the dedication of the outgoing Prime Minister and his Cabinet." "I also congratulate the speaker and his deputies (for) their leadership of the Parliament's deliberation in this critical time of the Parliament's history," Mohamud said in a news release. Shirdon is the fifth Somali prime minister removed from his post without finishing his term since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown 22 years ago. When he accepted the position in 2012, Shirdon, an economist who used to run an import business in neighboring Kenya, told the Parliament that his government would do more to ensure the security of the country and to fight against terrorism and piracy. Somalia plunged into chaos after Barre was overthrown in 1991. After his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and nationwide mayhem. Central governance has been shaky since then. One of the largest challenges is Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab, which is fighting the government in hopes of turning Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state.

chatgpt: In a latest shake-up for a country that has struggled with effective central governance, Somalia's Prime Minister, Abdi Farah Shirdon, has been removed from his position less than 14 months into his four-year term. This decision comes after a clash with President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud over the selection of new Cabinet members. The disagreement between the two leaders highlights the ongoing challenges facing Somalia, a nation long plagued by civil war, poverty, and political instability. Mohamud, a former academic and civil society activist, has been president since 2012 and is tasked with overseeing the country's transition to a more stable, democratic government. However, progress has been slow, and his government has been criticized for failing to address the country's many challenges. Shirdon, on the other hand, was seen as a relatively popular and competent leader, having worked previously as a businessman and aid worker. Over the past year, he had overseen the development of a new national security plan, signed a deal with Kenya over a maritime boundary dispute, and presided over the creation of a new telecommunications regulatory agency. Despite these accomplishments, Shirdon found himself at odds with Mohamud over the composition of the new Cabinet. According to reports, the Prime Minister had put forward a list of candidates that included some individuals known for their reformist views, but also some who were seen as controversial. Mohamud reportedly objected to several names on the list, and the two leaders were unable to come to a compromise. In a statement, Mohamud thanked Shirdon for his service and announced that he would be replaced by Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, a former Prime Minister who had previously served in the administration of President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. In his own statement, Shirdon expressed his disappointment at the decision, but also thanked his colleagues and the Somali people for their support. The decision to remove Shirdon comes at a difficult time for Somalia, as the country continues to grapple with a variety of challenges, including ongoing violence from militant groups like Al-Shabaab, a weak economy, and political divisions. While Ahmed is a respected figure with experience in government, he will face many of the same challenges that his predecessor did, and it remains to be seen whether he will be able to make significant progress in improving the lives of the Somali people. For now, the removal of Shirdon is likely to be seen as a setback for those who had hoped for a more effective and stable government in Somalia. As the country continues its transition to a more democratic system, it will be important for leaders to work together and find ways to address the many challenges that confront them.
