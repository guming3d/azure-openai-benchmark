article: (CNN) -- A large turkey unexpectedly arrived at a New Jersey home one morning in August, but the homeowner wasn't giving any thanks. Huddled in her bedroom, Marie Manco, 70, was instead calling the police about the live intruder, which had entered her home by flying through a second-floor window. "A wild turkey came through my skylight and it's flying around my house right now, destroying everything! I'm in my bedroom, but I'm afraid to come out," a frightened Manco told the 911 operator. "I just hear a banging, and it's just destroying my whole house!" Police arrived at her Kinnelon home shortly after and observed that a large window had been broken above the front door. When officers went in with a blanket to catch the turkey, it ran off into the kitchen and smashed through a 5-by-5-foot picture window, according to Sgt. David Crouthamel of the Kinnelon Police Department. Police said that the turkey was "one of the biggest birds" they've ever seen. When one officer, who is nearly 6 feet tall, attempted to grab it, it came up to his hip, Crouthamel said. The giant gobbler proved to be no chicken when it trashed Manco's home, leaving an estimated $6,000 to $7,000 in damages before trotting away. Three large windows were shattered, walls were cracked, and the floor was littered with feces, broken glass and feathers, according to police. Manco was home alone at the time of the incident and remains shaken up. "Violated. I felt violated. And frightened. And I'm still frightened," Manco told CNN affiliate WCBS. Police believe that the bird saw its reflection in the window glass and became aggressive. Turkeys are not able to recognize their own image and will respond to a reflection as they would to an intruding or competing turkey, according to the New Jersey Wildlife Control Operators Association. "It's mating season for turkeys, and we're attributing the aggression to that," Lt. John Schwartz told WCBS. Manco has been having difficulty getting her insurance to cover the damage to her home, police say. While police took photos of some turkeys in the surrounding area, the "suspect" is still at large.

chatgpt: A wild turkey has caused extensive damage to a home in New Jersey after it busted through a window and began attacking the property. The incident took place on Tuesday morning, and when the homeowner called 911, the extent of the damage was immediately apparent. "It's just destroying my whole house!" the frightened homeowner reported to the emergency services. The large turkey had broken three windows, cracked walls, and left a trail of feces and feathers in its wake. According to wildlife experts, the turkey's behavior may have been due to an interaction with its own reflection. "During the breeding season, male turkeys can become aggressive and territorial, and they may see their reflection as a rival," explained a spokesperson for a local wildlife group. The turkey was eventually captured and safely released into nearby woods. However, the cost of the damage caused by the bird amounts to thousands of dollars. While turkey sightings are not uncommon in New Jersey, it is rare for them to cause such significant destruction. Wildlife officials remind residents that while turkeys may seem harmless, they can become aggressive and should be avoided. This incident serves as a reminder for homeowners to keep their property secure and to take precautions against wild animals. Experts suggest keeping windows closed and preventing birds from seeing their reflections in the glass. Overall, this is an unusual story showcasing the unpredictable nature of wildlife and the importance of being prepared for unexpected encounters. The homeowner's nightmare of a wild turkey breaking into their home highlights how quickly things can get out of control and the damage that can result from even the smallest of creatures encountering the comforts of human habitation.
