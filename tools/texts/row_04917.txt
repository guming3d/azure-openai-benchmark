The operation was carried out in more than 300 cities, ports, airports and border crossings and involved 20,000 policemen from all 28 countries of the European Union and six non-European countries. Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) played a big role in Operation Archimedes, which over the past nine days has seen more than 1,000 arrests in a continent-wide sweep against organised crime . Crime sweep: The scale of Operation Archimedes was unprecedented . Police identified 200 victims of human trafficking and saved 30 Romanian minors from trafficking. Some faced forced worked in prostitution or begging gangs, Europol, Europe's police organisation, said. 'It's the single largest coordinated assault on organised crime ever seen in Europe,' Britain's Rob Wainwright, the head of Europol, told a news conference at the organisation's headquarters. He said the operation was made necessary by the increasing sophistication and interconnectedness of Europe's crime groups, many of whom were using the hard-to-monitor 'dark net' - or encrypted internet - to communicate with each other. 'Months in the planning, it was a carefully coordinated series of attacks on key nodal points and crime sectors that underpin the underground crime economy in Europe,' he said. 'What we have seen emerging is an integrated underground criminal economy,' he said. Police identified 200 victims of human trafficking and saved 30 Romanian minors from trafficking . Arrests were concentrated on criminal middlemen and go-betweens, as crime kingpins are not typically caught in sweeps but in operations designed to ensnare them. Dubbed 'Operation Archimedes', 1,027 arrests were made between September 15 and 23. Authorities seized 599kg of cocaine, 200kg of heroin and 1.3 tonnes of cannabis. The operation yielded leads that would result in further investigations and arrests, Europol said. Authorities in United States and Colombia also helped in identifying new drug trafficking routes to Europe, including drugs increasingly being shipped in parcels sent by post. An NCA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We have been involved in Operation Archimedes, sharing intelligence and working to help disrupt criminal activity. 'Serious organised crime doesn't recognise boundaries - cybercrime for instance affects everyone - so we have to have a joint approach to tackle it. We all need to work together to protect ourselves. No UK nationals have been arrested so far as we're aware.'

chatgpt: Europol's Operation Archimedes has yielded impressive results, with 20,000 police officers carrying out a simultaneous crackdown on gang activity in over 300 cities, ports, airports, and border crossings.  Hundreds of gangsters have been rounded up in what has been hailed as a significant victory in the fight against organized crime. The operation, which was coordinated by Europol, saw police forces from across Europe working together to target criminal networks involved in a range of illegal activities, from drug trafficking and money laundering to human trafficking and arms smuggling. The operation was carried out over the course of several weeks, with police officers using a variety of tactics to track down and apprehend the suspects. These included surveillance, intelligence gathering, and undercover work. The results of the operation have been impressive, with hundreds of gangsters arrested and taken into custody. They are now facing a range of charges, including drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking. Europol has hailed the operation as a major success, highlighting the importance of international cooperation in the fight against organized crime. Speaking to reporters, Europol's Executive Director, Catherine De Bolle, said: "The success of Operation Archimedes demonstrates the benefits of close cooperation between law enforcement agencies across Europe. By working together, we can disrupt criminal networks and bring those responsible for serious crimes to justice." The operation has also been praised by national leaders, with several European countries expressing their support for the crackdown on organized crime. French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the news, saying: "The arrests made as part of Operation Archimedes are a clear signal to criminals that their activities will not be tolerated. We are committed to working together to fight organized crime and keep our citizens safe." The operation is just the latest in a series of efforts by law enforcement agencies across Europe to tackle organized crime. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need for greater coordination and cooperation between national police forces in order to combat the increasingly sophisticated and globalized nature of organized crime. Despite this progress, however, there is still much work to be done. Organized crime remains a major threat to the security and stability of Europe, and police forces will need to continue working together in order to stay ahead of the criminals.  In conclusion, the success of Operation Archimedes represents a significant step forward in the ongoing fight against organized crime in Europe. It is a clear example of the importance of international cooperation and demonstrates that by working together, law enforcement agencies can disrupt criminal networks and bring those responsible for serious crimes to justice.
