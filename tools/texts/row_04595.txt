Many dieters attempt to fill themselves up with water in the belief it will help them lose weight. But one nutrition expert says it is simply a myth that drink water aids slimming. Dr Beth Kitchin, at the University of Alabama, has stated that drinking water is not a magical key to weight loss. She said: ‘There is very little evidence that drinking water promotes weight loss - it is one of those self-perpetuating myths. It is a myth that drinking water aids weight loss, according to a nutrition expert . ‘I'm not saying drinking water isn't good - but only one study showed people who drank more water burned a few extra calories, and it was only a couple of extra calories a day.’ Dr Kitchin added that it is also a myth that people should drink eight glasses of water a day. She said: ‘Yes, people do need to get fluids - but it does not have to be water. There's no evidence that it melts away fat or makes you feel fuller, so if you don't like water it's OK.’ She explained that water is the best liquid to drink to hydrate but that green tea, coffee and squash are also hydrating. She said: ‘People think coffee doesn't count, but actually it does. ‘When you drink coffee, your body is retaining much of that fluid - especially for people who are habituated to drinking caffeine, as the body adapts, resulting in a reduced loss of fluids.’ Dr Kitchin said some people also believe that drinking very cold water can help them lose weight. Dr Beth Kitchin says drinking very cold water can cause a dieter to burn a few more calories but not enough to make a tangible difference to weight . She believes this can increase the number of calories burned but that it does not have sufficient impact to aid weight loss. The bad news for dieters is that Dr Kitchin says the only way to lose weight is to eat fewer calories. She suggests focussing on eating fruit, vegetables and soups. Dr Kitchin's claims contradict 2013 research which found that drinking two cups of water before a meal can help people lose weight. The research, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, suggested drinking water can reduce hunger meaning dieters consume fewer calories.

chatgpt: Have you ever heard that drinking water can aid in weight loss? This belief has been circulating for years, but according to Dr. Beth Kitchin, a registered dietitian at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, this is simply a myth. While staying hydrated is undoubtedly essential for our overall health, claiming that water can contribute to weight loss is not entirely accurate. Dr. Kitchin has explained that drinking water can, in fact, increase our calorie burning rate slightly, but the increase is not significant enough to make any notable difference in weight loss efforts. Therefore, relying solely on drinking water to lose weight is not effective. It can be helpful to consume water alongside a well-balanced diet and regular exercise routine, but it will not lead to significant weight loss alone. Moreover, Dr. Kitchin debunked another widely accepted myth: that we should drink eight glasses of water every day. She stated that this is not necessarily required as the water needs vary from person to person based on factors such as their activity level, age, and overall health. Instead, Dr. Kitchin suggests monitoring urine color to ensure proper hydration as urine should be light yellow or clear. It is crucial to remain hydrated as water plays a crucial role in our bodies, from transporting nutrients and oxygen to removing waste products. However, it is important to note that consuming too much water is also not healthy, as it can dilute the electrolytes in our bodies, which can lead to issues such as headaches, nausea, and confusion. While drinking water is not a magical elixir for weight loss, it certainly plays a vital role in maintaining good health. Rather than relying on water intake to shed pounds, people should focus on adopting healthy habits such as a balanced diet and regular exercise routine. Staying hydrated by drinking enough water is undoubtedly an essential component of these healthy habits, but it is not a magical solution for weight loss. In conclusion, while it is essential to stay hydrated, it is essential to understand that water's influence in weight loss is not significant enough to make any noticeable difference on its own. Instead, adopting a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and regular exercise is the key to achieving sustainable weight loss.
