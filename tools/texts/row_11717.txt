While it claims to be homeopathic, the the Good Dog Pet Calming Supplement (above) is 13 percent alcohol . Petco spokesperson David Hallisey said in a statement; 'In light of recent concerns expressed by some of our customers with regard to Good Dog Pet Calming Supplement, and this product's alcohol content, we have decided to issue a voluntary recall, effective immediately.' He then added; 'While we are unaware of any instances of this product causing illness when used as directed, customers can return this product to any of our stores for a full refund of their purchase.' The ASPCA has previously warned against the ingestion of alcohol by animals, saying even the smallest amount can be fatal. This comes just two weeks after the San Diego-based company removed all Chinese-made dog and cat treats from its website and stores over fears they were linked to 1,000 dog deaths since 2007 - and an unknown number of animal illnesses. The illnesses and deaths were linked to a number of treats, including chicken, duck or sweet potato jerky. 'We know some pet parents are wary of dog and cat treats made in China, especially Chicken Jerky products, and we’ve heard their concern,' said Petco CEO Jim Myers in a statement last May. 'As a leader in the industry and the trusted partner for our pet parents, we’re eager to make this transition and to expand our assortment of safe and healthy treats, the majority of which are made right here in the U.S. 'Very simply, we feel this decision is in the best interest of the pets we all love and, ultimately, for our business.' Treats at the store now come from the U.S. or places such as the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and South America.
