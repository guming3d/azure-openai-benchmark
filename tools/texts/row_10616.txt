Charged: Christopher Bingley, left, is accused of using the name of his late wife Joanne, right, on four speeding offences . Mrs Bingley, 39, was killed when she threw herself in front of a train near Huddersfield in April 2010 following a battle with post-natal depression. Bingley blamed his wife’s death on post-natal depression (PND) and set up a charity to highlight the illness in February last year. Huddersfield Magistrates Court heard father-of-one Mr Bingley continued to drive his late wife's Jeep Cherokee car and when caught speeding had the points credited to her licence. The first count against Mr Bingley alleges that on April 14, 2011, Bingley falsely completed speeding notices addressed to his wife regarding offences on February 20, 2011 and April 9, 2011. The widower was also accused of the same offence for a speeding ticket on August 2, 2010 and the third count relates to speeding on August 6, 2010. Huddersfield Magistrates Court heard Mr Bingley used his dead wife's name after being caught speeding four times in Huddersfield in 2010 and 2011 . No indication of plea was made and the case was adjoured to Bradford Crown Court on March 28. Mr Bingley, a management consultant, has spoken about how his wife struggled with severe depression following the birth of their baby daughter Emily. He launched the Joanne (Joe) Bingley Memorial Foundation to highlight the illness and support those affected by it and also produced a leaflet to outline international guidelines on PND as he claimed local guidance was inadequate. He said he blamed health professionals for Joanne’s death and said she could have been cured if she had been admitting to hospital. An inquest into her death ruled she had not been neglected.

chatgpt: A man has been revealed to have used his late wife's name to avoid punishment for his speeding offences. Christopher Bingley, from Leeds, reportedly used his wife Joanne's name for several traffic infringement notices after she tragically committed suicide in 2019, following her battle with post-natal depression. It has been reported that the incidents came to light after Bingley was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. The court heard that Bingley had used his wife's name several times, even after her death. The deception came to light after he was caught while driving at 40 mph in a 30 mph zone. The prosecutor in the case highlighted the seriousness of Bingley's actions, saying that he had shown a complete disregard for the law and attempted to escape punishment for his own misconduct by using his late wife's identity to avoid fines and penalty points. The court also heard how Bingley had been struggling to deal with the loss of his wife and the impact it had on him and his family. In a statement read out to the court, Bingley expressed his remorse for his actions and apologized to his family and the court for his behavior. Reports suggest that Bingley's actions have caused significant distress to his family and friends, who have been forced to witness the consequences of his behavior. The case has been described as tragic on all sides, with two lives destroyed by a single act of deception. Joanne Bingley's death highlights the importance of addressing mental health issues and seeking help when needed. It is a reminder that more needs to be done to support people who are struggling with mental health issues, especially post-natal depression, which affects many new mothers. In conclusion, the actions of Christopher Bingley are a sobering reminder of the serious consequences of attempting to escape the law by using false identities. While Bingley may have been struggling to cope with the loss of his wife, his actions have caused significant harm to those around him and serve as a warning to others who may be considering similar actions in the future. Ultimately, this tragic case reinforces the need for greater support and understanding of mental health issues, so that others may not face the same tragic outcome as Joanne Bingley.
