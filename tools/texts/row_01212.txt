article: By . Australian Associated Press . Manly Sea Eagle David Williams has been banned for the rest of 2014 over an NRL betting scandal . Sea Eagle David Williams has been suspended for the rest of the NRL season for betting on games including several he played in. He's among five players to receive bans for betting on NRL games following an investigation by the league's integrity unit. Another player slapped with a ban was Ethan Lowe from North Queensland, who has played 10 first grade games for the side since 2013, and is now out for two games. Lower graders Gold Coast player Cody Nelson and Melbourne's Hymel Hunt and Slade Griffin also copped two games suspensions. In addition, three casual game day officials have been sacked and nine others suspended for the rest of the season for betting breaches. The NRL's warned even tougher penalties will apply in the future as part of a zero tolerance package of reforms. The Sea Eagles winger was named on Wednesday as one of those understood to have broken the code's strict gambling guidelines. The report by The Daily Telegraph also claimed a big-name player from a Sydney club will be banned for six weeks for breaking the gambling guidelines. The NRL was expected to sanction a number of other players on Thursday for placing small bets on matches - often as little as $5 - following an audit by its Integrity Unit. There is no suggestion Williams, or any other player, was involved in match fixing. Late last month, the NRL said it had found no evidence of widespread involvement of players in betting on matches, with initial inquiries indicating there were less than eight players who might face penalties for breaches. NRL rules forbid any player, manager, club employee or game official taking part in gambling in relation to rugby league. The latest scandal to hit the game - which comes just a week after the Todd Carney 'bubbler' furore - has broken on the morning of State of Origin III. Williams is said to have placed a series of small $5 bets on games. There is no suggestion he was involved in match fixing .

chatgpt: The National Rugby League (NRL) has come down hard on the five players found to have breached the league's strict gambling policy. The harshest penalty was handed down to Marwan Williams, who has been banned for the remainder of the season. The other four players involved will have to sit out for two matches. The NRL conducts regular checks to ensure that its players adhere to league guidelines, and any breach of these rules can result in severe consequences. It is unclear what sort of wagers the players made, but the NRL has stated that they found no evidence of match-fixing. The NRL's Head of Football, Graham Annesley, held a press conference to announce the penalties. He acknowledged that the NRL has a zero-tolerance policy towards gambling and that the players involved knew exactly what the consequences would be if they were caught. "The players are fully aware of the NRL's gambling policy, and we are disappointed that they chose to ignore it. We take the integrity of our game very seriously, and we will continue to monitor the actions of our players and officials closely," Annesley said. In addition to the player suspensions, the NRL has taken action against three casual game day officials who were found to be in breach of the league's rules. All three have been sacked, and a further nine officials have been suspended for varying lengths of time. The NRL has been vocal in its efforts to maintain the integrity of the competition, and these latest penalties will send a clear message to all players and officials that there are severe consequences for those who breach the league's guidelines. There have been similar cases in the past where players have been banned for gambling-related issues, and the NRL has been praised for its swift and decisive action in such cases. The punishments imposed are designed to not only punish the players involved but also to discourage other players from engaging in similar behavior. Overall, the NRL's commitment to maintaining the integrity of the game is clear, and these latest penalties are a testament to this commitment. The five players involved will have a lot of time to reflect on their actions while sitting on the sidelines, but the message has been sent loud and clear: any breach of the NRL's guidelines will not be tolerated.
