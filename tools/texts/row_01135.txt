article: The future of NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space observatory was in question Wednesday after a part that helps aim the spacecraft stopped working, the U.S. space agency said. Controllers found Tuesday that Kepler had gone into a "safe mode" and one of the reaction wheels needed to orient the spacecraft would not spin, Associate NASA Administrator John Grunsfeld told reporters. NASA engineers are trying to figure out whether they can get the balky part back into service or whether they can resume control by another method, Grunsfeld said. "We're not ready to call the mission over," he said. But at roughly 40 million miles from Earth, "Kepler is not in a place where I can go up and rescue it." Another Earth called a certainty . The Kepler mission has identified 132 planets beyond our solar system since its launch in 2009, leading scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them. It has gone into a "safe mode" with its solar panels facing back at the sun, giving controllers intermittent communication with the craft as it spins. Three new planets could host life . The probe was built with four reaction wheels and needs three of them -- one for each axis -- to aim its telescope precisely at a distant star, deputy project manager Charlie Sobeck said. One failed in July 2012, leaving it with only two functioning wheels at this time, Sobeck said. Kepler shut itself down after it was pointing in the wrong direction, Sobeck said. He said it was "reasonable to suspect" the failure of the reaction wheel was the cause, but scientists hadn't confirmed that. More news about Kepler . The $600 million mission was designed to operate for three and a half to six years. Even if controllers are unable to return it to service, NASA said the mission has produced enough data to keep scientists busy for up to two years. "Another four years would have been frosting on the cake, but we have a nice cake now," said William Borucki, the project's principal scientist. More space and science news from CNN Light Years .

chatgpt: The Kepler space observatory has made a significant discovery, identifying 132 new planets. However, a setback has occurred with the spacecraft's control wheel, leaving it unable to accurately aim at stars. The Kepler telescope has been instrumental in finding new planets since its launch in 2009, discovering over 2,600 potential exoplanets. The latest discovery of 132 new planets, announced by NASA on Tuesday, adds to this impressive tally. However, news that Kepler's control wheel has stopped responding is a concerning development. The wheel is one of four used to keep the spacecraft pointed in the correct direction, ensuring that the sensitive instruments on board can gather clear data. "Our engineering team has exhausted every possible option and is now investigating the health of the spacecraft's remaining systems," said Charlie Sobeck, a project system engineer on the Kepler mission. Despite the challenge posed by the malfunction, NASA officials remain optimistic that the mission can be continued. "We're not ready to call the mission over," said Paul Hertz, astrophysics division director at NASA Headquarters. "The wheels are a problem we know how to solve." The Kepler mission, which was initially planned to last just three and a half years, has already exceeded all expectations, lasting over nine years and contributing invaluable knowledge to the field of astronomy. The spacecraft uses the transit method of detection to identify planets, which involves looking for tiny dips in the brightness of stars as planets pass in front of them. This method requires Kepler to be pointed precisely at the star for a prolonged period, making the control wheel failure a significant challenge. Engineers at NASA are now working on a solution to the problem, exploring alternatives to the control wheel system. They are also considering new uses for the spacecraft, which could still collect valuable data even if it is no longer able to accurately point at individual stars. The latest announcement of new planets by Kepler is a reminder of its enormous contribution to the understanding of our universe. Despite the setback encountered with the control wheel, the Kepler team remains committed to continuing the mission and making further discoveries.
