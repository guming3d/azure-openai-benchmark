article: They say good looks run in the family and the Le Bons proved that as they took to Gyunel's catwalk last night. Yasmin and Amber, the mother daughter duo whose good looks have made them world famous, opened the Azerbaijan designer's SS15 show at the Bloomsbury ballroom yesterday evening. Watched from the front row by the likes of Millie Mackintosh, Roxie Nafousi, Rosie Fortescue, Lilah Parsons and Donna Air, the 49-year-old catwalk stalwart and her 25-year-old daughter were the perfect fit for the show, which aimed to convey a strong and adventurous woman. Scroll down for video . Two of a kind: Amber (left) and Yasmin (right) appeared as a mother/daughter duo at last night's Gyunel show . The collection told the story of a nomadic traveler traversing the desert and shirt dresses, relaxed blouses and flowing maxis were appropriately emblazoned with scorpions, a symbol inspired by Gyunel Rustamova's Zodiac sign. Hair too, created by Wella's team of stylists, was braided across the face to depict a scorpion – sounds creepy, looked cool (even Millie Mackintosh was coveting the look). Gowns in midnight blue, maroon and beige were juxtaposed with sculpted separates, reinventing that much-loved sportsluxe vibe for SS15, while layers of crochet and leather gave the collection a tough edge. She's still got it! Yasmin Le Bon is 49-years-old but gave the young 20 something models a run for their money . Yasmin, 29, proved that good looks do run in the family as she joined her mother on the catwalk . The designer, who studied Economics before finding her calling at Central Saint Martins, also worked as an artist - a talent and passion that didn't go amiss on last night's catwalk. Leather trousers and soft leather jackets in titian orange and brittle green were given an artistic edge, while chunky gold and silver jewellery adorned model's arms and necks. 'I like to think of the Gyunel woman as a nomadic traveler with a strong adventurous attitude,' said the Baku-born designer. 'I was inspired by the idea of journeys through places steeped in culture and the creatures that inhabit them.'

chatgpt: Iconic model Yasmin Le Bon took to the runway last night during Gyunel's SS15 collection showcase. Despite nearing 50, the mother of three looked absolutely breathtaking as she strutted her stuff alongside her daughter, Amber. Gyunel's collection was inspired by the nomadic traveler, and it showed in the unique pieces that graced the catwalk. Scorpion motifs were seen on several pieces, including dresses, tops, and even accessories like bags and jewelry. But perhaps the most eye-catching detail was the scorpion-inspired hair that models sported as they made their way down the runway. The collection was an eclectic mix of textures, fabrics, and colors, with each piece showcasing Gyunel's signature style. The designer is known for her avant-garde designs that stand out from the crowd, and SS15 was no exception. But it was Yasmin and Amber who stole the show. Yasmin, who has been in the modeling industry for over 30 years, showed why she is still one of the most sought-after models today. Her flawless complexion and toned physique were on full display as she confidently walked the runway. And her daughter Amber, who is following in her mother's footsteps, proved to be just as stunning with her piercing blue eyes and supermodel height. Speaking about the collection, Gyunel said: "I wanted to create something that embodied the spirit of the nomadic traveler- someone who is not afraid to explore the world and take risks. And I knew that Yasmin and Amber would be the perfect muses to bring this vision to life." And the designer wasn't wrong. Yasmin and Amber exuded a sense of adventure and exploration as they confidently walked the runway. The crowd was left in awe, and social media was buzzing with comments about how stunning they looked. Yasmin, who has been married to Duran Duran frontman Simon Le Bon for over 30 years, continues to defy age and inspire women worldwide. She has previously spoken about how important it is for women to embrace their natural beauty and not give in to societal pressures to look a certain way. With this latest appearance on the runway, Yasmin and Amber have once again proven that age is just a number, and that beauty truly comes from within. Gyunel's SS15 collection may have been inspired by the nomadic traveler, but it was Yasmin and Amber who stole the show with their effortless elegance and undeniable style.
