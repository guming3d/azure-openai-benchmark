Two lawyers at the heart of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards should have declared their burgeoning relationship to avoid perceptions of bias, a leading QC said last night. Carine Patry Hoskins, an adviser to Lord Justice Leveson, went on a Greek island holiday with top barrister David Sherborne. But he was representing victims of phone-hacking, including Hugh Grant, while she was contributing to the landmark report on the future of media regulation. The couple later began a relationship but neither told the judge about it and it remained a secret until this week. John Cooper, QC, a leading human rights lawyer, said: ‘I’m not saying they have acted inappropriately but if the situation was pertaining during Leveson it should have been brought to the tribunal’s attention. ‘The perception of bias, even if it is not proven, is considered to be a very serious matter in conventional courts.’ The Bar Council warns barristers it is ‘very unwise’ to start a relationship with opposing counsel during a case because of the risk of clients perceiving ‘a danger of breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, and Mr Sherborne, 44, appeared in the High Court hearings into press standards that took place between November 2011 and July last year. Miss Patry Hoskins became an internet sensation after cameras caught her repeatedly looking at Grant during his questioning. In August she and Mr Sherborne – who are now divorcing their spouses – flew to Santorini. But they insist they only discussed ‘the possibility of a future relationship’ and decided against it. Once back in England, Miss Patry Hoskins helped write parts of Lord Justice Leveson’s final report, dealing with the recent relationship between newspapers and politicians. After the report was published in November, Miss Patry Hoskins and  Mr Sherborne began seeing each other. Actor Hugh Grant arrives with David Sherborne to give evidence to the Leveson inquiry . Hoskins and Sherborne went on holiday together to the Greek island of Santorini . Tory MP Douglas Carswell called  for the Leveson press regulation  plan to be scrapped in the light of the revelations. He said: ‘This gives the impression that press regulation was foisted on us by a cosy clique of lawyers and legal experts.’ He added the legal team was supposed to be ‘dispassionate,  not passionate’. Thais Portilho-Shrimpton, formerly of Hacked Off who worked with  Mr Sherborne during the inquiry,  said: ‘Given they both had access to information they shouldn’t have been sharing with each other, they perhaps should have told the judge about it. ‘It could have been that Leveson would have thought it was appropriate to replace her.’

chatgpt: Carine Patry Hoskins, a barrister in London, and Hugh Grant barrister David Sherborne, have been causing a stir in the legal world after they reportedly started a romantic relationship during a high-profile case in which they were working as opposing counsels. The pair went on a luxurious Greek holiday together, much to the dismay of their colleagues. The relationship was slammed by a QC who accused the pair of failing to declare their status to avoid any perceptions of bias. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the QC said, "It is extremely disappointing that two highly respected attorneys would jeopardise the integrity of the legal system in this way. Not declaring their relationship is a clear breach of professional conduct." The Bar Council, which oversees the conduct of barristers in England and Wales, has also weighed in on the matter, warning that it is "very unwise" for opposing counsel to start relationships during cases. In a statement, the council said, "The potential for conflicts of interest is obvious and can undermine the trust and confidence of both clients and the wider public in the legal system." The scandal has raised questions about the conduct of lawyers and the ethical standards of the legal profession. Some legal experts have suggested that Hoskins and Sherborne's actions could be in breach of the Bar Standards Board's code of conduct, which requires barristers to uphold high ethical standards and avoid any actions that may bring the profession into disrepute. Meanwhile, the media has been abuzz with speculation about the couple's relationship, with several tabloids publishing photos of the pair on their Greek holiday. However, both Hoskins and Sherborne have declined to comment on their alleged relationship, and there is no confirmation on whether they are still seeing each other. Some legal commentators have pointed out that relationships between lawyers are not uncommon, and that the pressures of high-profile cases can sometimes lead to close bonds between opposing counsel. However, the failure to disclose such a relationship is a serious issue, and could damage the reputation of the lawyers involved and the wider legal system. The case in question involved a highly publicised dispute between two well-known public figures, and the involvement of two high-profile barristers like Hoskins and Sherborne added to the interest in the proceedings. The case has now been settled, but the revelations about the relationship between the two opposing lawyers have left a bad taste in the mouths of many legal professionals. The scandal has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the legal profession, with some calling for stronger regulations to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain ethical standards. Ultimately, the Hoskins-Sherborne affair is a cautionary tale for lawyers everywhere, reminding them of the importance of integrity and professionalism in all aspects of their work.
