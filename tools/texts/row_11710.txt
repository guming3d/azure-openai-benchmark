article: (CNN) -- Six Chinese Communist Party investigators have been sentenced to between four and 14 years in jail after they drowned a local official during a botched interrogation that has shone light on China's secretive extrajudicial processes. Cheng Wenjie, the deputy director of the Commission for Discipline Inspection in the eastern city of Wenzhou, received the longest sentence of the six for his role in the death of Yu Qiyi, according to a copy of the court verdict given to CNN by the victim's wife. All the defendants pleaded guilty. Yu, 41, the chief engineer at a state-owned company in the same city, died at a local hospital on April 9, a month after being detained over his role in a land deal. After early interrogations failed to yield any admission of guilt, Cheng summoned other investigators April 8 and ordered Yu to strip naked and sit in a bathtub filled with icy water. At Cheng's behest, three other investigators-- Li Xiang, Nan Yu and Gu Chenfu -- grabbed his neck, arms and legs and held him under the water. The two other defendants -- Wu Zhiwei and Zhang Fangchao -- entered the room later the same evening, the verdict said. When Cheng left he told his subordinates: "I'm leaving now; you all have fun with it." Yu was sent to hospital an hour later and died at 3am the next day, the verdict, which has not been officially released, said. The court said that the six interrogators attempted to drown Yu in order to force him to admit that he had violated the law. Yu's wife, Wu Qian, told CNN the sentences handed down were not long enough, adding that many important facts about the case had not been aired in court. She said she wanted to plan for her late husband's funeral but the Commission for Discipline Inspection had not returned his remains. Wu Pengbin, a lawyer acting on behalf of the deceased man, said that he had heard the six defendants had appealed their sentences as they believed they were too harsh. Yu was placed under investigation as part of a secretive process known as shanggui or dual designation that allows for Communist Party members to be detained and interrogated by Party investigators. It is based on the Party's own regulations rather than laws and procedures, making it even less transparent than China's judicial system. Legal experts view the prosecution of Yu's interrogators as a step forward but say that the key to preventing similar abuses is to address the root cause of his death - the rarely publicized shanggui system. "The six investigators arrested were mere scapegoats," Pu Zhiqiang, one of the lawyers representing the Yu family, told CNN in September. "Shuanggui is an illegal process -- abuse and torture during interrogation have become standard operating procedure." With reporting by CNN's Beijing bureau .

chatgpt: Six Communist Party investigators from China have been given jail time after their botched interrogation led to the death of a local official named Yu Qiyi. Qiyi was detained for his involvement in a land deal and died a month later in custody. The investigators were found guilty of repeatedly holding Qiyi under icy water in a bathtub during their interrogation, which ultimately led to his drowning. The verdict in this case has shone a light on China's secretive and often extrajudicial processes. Investigators often resort to brutal tactics to extract confessions, and it is not uncommon for detainees to die while in police custody. The case of Yu Qiyi has brought this issue to the forefront of China's political and legal systems. The six investigators, who were all members of the Communist Party, were sentenced to between five and fourteen years in jail. It is said that they were interrogating Qiyi for his involvement in a land deal that was seen as corrupt. Qiyi was held underwater multiple times during the interrogation, which led to his drowning. The investigators then tried to cover up the incident by claiming that Qiyi died from a heart attack. The case has raised concerns about the Communist Party's influence in China's legal system. The party has long been criticized for interfering in legal proceedings to protect its own interests and maintain control over the country's justice system. The fact that the investigators in this case were all party members only adds to these concerns. Chinese authorities have responded to the case by promising to crack down on illegal and unethical interrogation practices. The government has also pledged to increase transparency in the legal system and ensure that the rights of all citizens are protected. Human rights groups, however, remain skeptical of these promises, given that the party's control over the judiciary remains strong. The case of Yu Qiyi is just one example of the challenges facing China's legal system. While the country has made progress in recent years, there is still much work to be done to ensure that justice is served fairly and impartially. The Communist Party's influence over the legal system must be curtailed if China hopes to build a legal system that is respected both at home and abroad. The verdict in this case sends a strong message that the Chinese government is committed to holding those who abuse their power accountable. However, for real change to occur, China must address the systemic issues that have led to abuses of power in the first place. Only then can the country build a legal system that is fair, transparent, and just.
