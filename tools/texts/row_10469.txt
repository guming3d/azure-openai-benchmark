article: (CNN) -- The man raced toward the school gate, flailing a knife as terrified youngsters scattered. A little girl raises her arm to try to defend herself but fails. She falls to the ground, losing her pink backpack near the entrance gate. After a few minutes of horror, the attacker chases other students as they try to flee the school grounds. By the end of the man's rampage, at least 23 elementary students were wounded, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The knife attack at Chenpeng Village Primary School in China's Henan province took place on December 14, the same day an American gunman killed 20 student and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Recently released surveillance video from the front of the Chenpeng school shows children and adults tried to fend off the attacker with brooms. Authorities say 36-year-old Min Yongjun first stabbed an elderly woman in Chenpeng before breaking into the elementary school, Xinhua said. Police said Min was driven to commit the attack by "doomsday" rumors, according to Xinhua. Authorities also said Min testified he was inspired by TV reports about a kindergarten killing in 2010. "He thought he was doomed and hoped to do something to impress his existence upon the world before he died," police said, according to Xinhua. Initial assessments suggest the attacker is mentally ill, the state-run Chinanews.com said, citing Guangshan county authorities. China suffered a spate of knife and cleaver attacks targeting school children in 2010. A number of measures were introduced at the time, including increased security at schools across the country and a regulation requiring people to register with their national ID cards when buying large knives. But in Chenpeng, the only visible line of defense appeared to be elementary students and nearby adults with brooms.

chatgpt: A knife-wielding attacker has injured 23 students and an elderly woman at a primary school in central China. The incident occurred in the city of Xinyang, Henan Province, during morning exercises on Thursday. According to the state-run news agency Xinhua, the perpetrator attacked the children with a knife, shortly after stabbing an elderly woman, who was out shopping. He was then subdued by teachers and parents using brooms until the police arrived. The attacker has been identified as 53-year-old Zhang Jianhua, a former doctor with a history of mental illness. Reports suggest that he was influenced by "doomsday" rumours and a 2010 kindergarten killing, which sparked a series of copycat attacks across China. In 2010, China experienced a spate of knife and cleaver attacks, targeting school children. These attacks led to the deaths of over 20 people and injured more than 100 others. The incidents resulted in increased security measures being implemented across the country's schools. The latest attack highlights the urgent need for more effective preventative measures to be put in place. It has also reignited calls to address the persisting issue of mental health disorders in China. President Xi Jinping has called for a thorough investigation into the incident and ordered local authorities to take all necessary measures to protect the students and ensure their safety. He has also called for stricter controls on the sale and possession of knives. The injured students are receiving medical attention, and their condition is said to be stable. The authorities have provided counselling services to the students and their families to help them deal with the traumatic experience. Thursday's attack has once again raised concerns about the security in China's schools and the need for measures to protect students and staff from all forms of violence. With the government's commitment to tackling the root causes of such incidents and implementing preventative measures, it is hoped that similar attacks can be prevented in the future.
