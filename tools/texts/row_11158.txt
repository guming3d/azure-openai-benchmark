article: (CNN) -- A 15-year-old boy who survived a flight from California to Hawaii by hitching a ride in the plane's wheel well said he was trying to get to Somalia to see his mother, a law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. He remains in a hospital in Hawaii, Kayla Rosenfeld, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services, said Tuesday afternoon. The teen, who has not yet been identified, spent more than six hours on the ground before the Maui-bound jet took off, another government official says. The boy jumped an airport fence in San Jose, California, shortly after 1 a.m. on Sunday, hours before Hawaiian Airlines Flight 45 took off at 7:55 a.m., the official said. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, didn't know when the teen climbed into the wheel well, but said the plane already was at the airport at 1 a.m. Investigators say they don't think the teen knew where the plane was heading and just went to the nearest aircraft. Teen stowaway raises questions about airport security . Authorities said the boy came out of the wheel well of the Boeing 767 about an hour after it landed at the Kahului Airport on the island of Maui. He is in the custody of child welfare services workers, said Kayla Rosenfeld, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services. The teen told authorities he was from Santa Clara, California, and ran away from home on Sunday, FBI Special Agent Tom Simon said. Emanuael Golla, a senior at Santa Clara High School who told CNN he had met the boy but isn't good friends with him, described him as extremely shy and quiet and said he had just transferred to the school within the past few weeks. The boy told authorities that he crawled into the wheel well and lost consciousness when the plane took off. He survived the nearly five-hour flight in subzero temperatures at oxygen-depleted heights -- as high as 38,000 feet -- against the odds, authorities believe. Since 1947, 105 people are known to have attempted to fly inside wheel wells on 94 flights worldwide, the Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute says. Of those, 25 made it through, including a 9-year-old -- a survival rate of 24%. One of the flights went as high as 39,000 feet. Two others were at 38,000 feet. The conditions at high altitudes can put stowaways in a virtual "hibernative" state, the FAA said. 5 stowaway attempts that didn't end tragically . CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A 15-year-old boy is recovering in a hospital in Hawaii after surviving a flight from California to the island state in the wheel well of a plane's landing gear hold. The unidentified teenager, who reportedly told investigators he was trying to get to Somalia to see his mother, jumped the fence at San Jose airport shortly after 1 a.m. on Sunday, according to an official statement. Despite temperatures dropping to as low as minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the wheel well during the five-and-a-half hour flight, the teenager survived. When he emerged from the plane, he was spotted wandering around the Maui airport before being hospitalized in critical condition. "While everyone is stunned by this story and many questions remain unanswered, our focus now is on the well-being of the boy," said Tom Simon, an FBI spokesperson. Aviation experts were amazed by the teenager's survival, with some suggesting that his youth may have aided his chances. "It's a miracle. Not many people could survive a flight like that," said aviation consultant John Nance. The jump highlights the security risk posed by perimeter fences at airports, which often have vast stretches of open land that can be easily breached. According to reports, the teenager chose the San Jose airport because of its proximity to his home in Santa Clara, but it is unclear how he was able to evade detection until he reached the plane's wheel well. The incident also raises concerns about the adequacy of airport security measures. With millions of passengers passing through US airports every day, experts say it is impossible to completely eliminate the risk of a determined individual slipping through the cracks. As news of the teenager's journey spread, social media users reacted with a mix of shock and awe at his survival. Some expressed sympathy for the boy's plight, while others condemned his actions as reckless and dangerous. Despite the teenager's remarkable survival, experts warn that stowing away in a plane's wheel well is a highly dangerous and potentially deadly endeavor. The risk of hypothermia, hypoxia, and other medical conditions, as well as the danger of falling from hundreds of feet in the air when the landing gear deploys, make the act almost certain to result in death. As the investigation into the incident continues, questions remain about how the teenager was able to evade security and make his stunning journey across the Pacific. Regardless of the circumstances, one thing is certain: the boy's journey will go down in history as one of the most remarkable and daring feats of aviation survival ever recorded.
