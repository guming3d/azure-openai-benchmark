chatgpt: Manchester United's star winger Angel Di Maria scored a superb goal in the team's 2-0 win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday afternoon. The Argentine celebrated the goal with a unique heart-shaped gesture, which fans recognized from his time in Real Madrid. Interestingly, Di Maria's celebration was similar to the one adopted by his former teammate Gareth Bale at Tottenham Hotspur in 2010. The heart-shaped gesture has since become synonymous with the Welshman's goal celebrations, and fans were quick to notice the similarities between the two players. Furthermore, it has been noted that Di Maria had already been using the heart-shape celebration a year earlier than Bale, during his time at Benfica. This has added to the intrigue and debate around who truly originated the iconic gesture. Regardless of its origins, the celebration was a fitting tribute to Di Maria's stunning goal, which came in the 24th minute of the match. The Argentine received the ball just outside the box and swiftly evaded the QPR defense, before firing an accurate shot into the bottom corner of the goal. Di Maria's strike was his second goal in two games, following his impressive performance in the team's 4-0 victory over Club Brugge in midweek. The 27-year-old has quickly established himself as a vital component of United's attacking play, and his performances have drawn praise from fans and pundits alike. Speaking after the match, Di Maria expressed his delight at scoring the goal and contributing to the team's victory. "I am very happy with the goal, of course, but most importantly we got the three points," he said. "We have a strong team and we are determined to win every game." Manchester United's next game is against Leicester City, with Di Maria likely to feature prominently once again. As for the heart-shaped celebration, it remains to be seen whether it will become a permanent fixture in the winger's goal-scoring repertoire.
