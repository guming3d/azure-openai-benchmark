chatgpt: As the sun was setting over Ashton-on-Mersey School's athletics track, history was in the making. 15-year-old sprinter, Jude Williams, broke the school's long-standing record in the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.99 seconds, knocking 0.02 seconds off the previous record set by former sprinter and Olympic gold medallist, Darren Campbell. Campbell, who won gold in the men's 4 x 100-meter relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics, held the Ashton-on-Mersey School record for an impressive 25 years. However, his reign has now come to an end with Williams' incredible performance. Williams has been on the books of Manchester United's academy since the age of nine, and his love for football is what brought him to the club. However, as he got older, his talent for sprinting became apparent, and he began to focus on track and field. Speaking after his record-breaking run, Williams said, "I'm absolutely thrilled to have broken the record, it's something I've been working towards for a long time. Manchester United has been a massive part of my life, but athletics has become my main passion. I hope to one day represent England and maybe even compete in the Olympics." Campbell, who has been following Williams' progress through his social media accounts, was quick to congratulate the youngster on his achievement. "I'm delighted for Jude. It's always great to see young athletes pushing themselves to achieve their goals. I wish him all the best for the future, and who knows, maybe one day he could follow in my footsteps and represent his country on the world stage." Williams' coach at Manchester United, Nicky Butt, was equally as pleased with the teenager's success. "Jude has been working incredibly hard in training, and it's great to see all of that hard work paying off. He's got a bright future ahead of him, and we'll continue to support him in any way we can." Ashton-on-Mersey School's record may have been broken, but it's safe to say that Williams has a long and successful career ahead of him. With the support of his coaches, teammates, and former Olympic champions, there's no doubt that he'll go on to achieve great things in the world of athletics.
