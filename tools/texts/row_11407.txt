Linebacker: Andrew Sweat, a standout at Ohio State University, says he won't play in the NFL . A college football standout is causing a fan frenzy after deciding that he would rather hit the books than opposing players. Andrew Sweat, a talented linebacker at Ohio State University, was brimming with excitement when he was offered a free-agent deal with the Cleveland Browns last month, but has since changed his mind. Sweat, 23, announced that he is now declining the offer, saying that he cares more about his own well-being than a career in the gridiron. He took to Twitter on Monday morning, telling his followers: 'Concussion symptoms didn't want to risk it.. Thanks to the Browns for the opportunity. Health trumps football any day'. Instead, Sweat will enroll in law school - and he's got five to choose from, The Columbus Dispatch reported. While many football fans praised Sweat for his decision and offered their support, others could not help but shake a finger at the young athlete. Among them was Elie Mystal, an editor at AbovetheLaw.com, who wrote in a blog post that Sweat was making ‘the biggest mistake of his life.' Mystal also drew comparisons between a lawyer drowning in student loan debt to a rookie football player making at least $390,000 a year.

chatgpt: Former Ohio State linebacker Andrew Sweat has decided to turn down a free-agent deal with the Cleveland Browns in favor of attending law school. Sweat, who is set to graduate from Ohio State on June 1st, announced his decision in a statement on Monday. "It was a difficult decision, but I've decided to pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer," Sweat said in the statement. "I'm grateful for the opportunity that the Cleveland Browns gave me, but ultimately, I believe attending law school is the best path for me." Sweat was a standout linebacker at Ohio State, where he played alongside current NFL players like Ryan Shazier and Bradley Roby. Despite going undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft, he was quickly picked up by the Browns as a free agent. However, after spending a brief stint in the Browns' training camp, Sweat suffered a concussion and decided to retire from football. He has since been pursuing his law degree at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio. "I've always been interested in the law and how it can help people," Sweat said. "I'm excited to start this new chapter in my life and see where it takes me." Sweat's decision to pursue law is not uncommon among former football players. Many have found success in the legal profession, using their experience on the gridiron to help them in their legal careers. Some of the most notable former NFL players turned lawyers include Alan Page, who played for the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears in the 1970s before becoming a justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court, and Jack Kemp, who spent over a decade in the NFL before eventually serving as a congressman and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George H.W. Bush. Sweat's decision to pursue law also underscores the challenges that many former football players face when transitioning out of the sport. While some, like Sweat, are able to find success in a new career, others struggle to adapt to life outside of football. According to a 2019 study by the NFL Players Association, the average NFL career lasts just 3.3 years. Many players are forced to retire due to injury or simply because they are no longer good enough to compete at the highest level. Without a solid plan for what comes next, many players find themselves struggling to adjust to life outside of football. Fortunately, resources are available to help former players make this transition. The NFL's Player Engagement program offers a variety of career development services, including internships, job shadowing, and financial education. For players like Sweat, who have a clear vision of what they want to do after football, the transition can be a little easier. "I'm excited to start this new chapter in my life," he said. "I feel like I'm on the right path, and I'm grateful for the experiences that football gave me."
