article: By . Allan Hall . PUBLISHED: . 07:10 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:07 EST, 19 August 2013 . Europe's high-speed rail network is the latest top target for Al-Qaeda terrorists. Germany's Bild newspaper reported today how U.S. intelligence services bugged a conference call between leading operatives of the terror group behind the 9/11 outrages as they discussed bringing death and destruction to the European rail network. The group was possibly targeting trains and tunnels, or planning to sabotage railway tracks themselves and the electric cabling serving them. Bugged: The conference call involved Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, seen in a 2006 file photo, and 20 other operatives, according to reports . The newspaper said the planned terrorist attacks were a 'central topic' of a conference call intercepted by the NSA involving high-ranking Al-Qaeda operatives. According to other media reports, Deutsche Bahn - German Rail - has already responded to the threat with plain clothed police officers at main stations and along major routes serviced by the high-speed ICE - Inter City Express - trains. The conference call involving Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and some 20 of the group's operatives was intercepted by the National Security Agency. Deutsche Bahn: The German rail firm is said to have introduced plain clothes police officers across the network in response to the threats . On August 1, the US issued a worldwide alert about a terror plot in the Middle East or Africa, prompting the closure of 19 US embassies. U.S. allies, including Germany, closed diplomatic buildings for almost two weeks. Only Spain has baggage screening for its high-speed Targa trains: Deutsche Bahn and SNCF in France have no such measures in place. With security ever more difficult to circumvent at international aiports, Al-Qaeda plotters believe strikes on railways would yield enomrous casualties and strike fear into hated Allies of America. 'European express trains carry nearly 500 passengers a time and derailment at high speed would have horrifying consequences,' an anti-terrorism expert said on Radio Bavaria on Monday. 'Horrifying consequences': The conference call was intercepted by the U.S. intelligence services at the National Security Agency .

chatgpt: U.S. intelligence services recently intercepted a conference call between Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and 20 other operatives, during which they discussed plans to bring destruction to the European rail network. According to anti-terror experts, the planned derailment of these trains would result in "horrifying consequences." It is still unclear when the conference call took place or how the U.S. intelligence services gained access to it. However, the details of the conversation have since been shared with European authorities in an effort to prevent any potential attacks. The Al-Qaeda operatives discussed a plot to target train lines in Europe, specifically those with high-speed trains that connect major cities. They reportedly spoke of a plan to place bombs on the tracks, causing the trains to derail and resulting in serious harm to passengers and infrastructure. The call between al-Zawahiri and the other operatives is believed to be part of a larger effort by Al-Qaeda to expand its operations outside of the Middle East. The group has increasingly focused on carrying out attacks in Europe, and this intercepted conference call suggests that they are continuing their efforts to target the continent. Anti-terror experts have warned that the potential destruction of European train lines would have devastating consequences. Not only would the attack itself be horrific, but the impact on travel and commerce throughout the continent would be significant. It is unknown how many people could be affected if such an attack were to occur. While the details of the Al-Qaeda plot remain unclear, it is clear that the U.S. intelligence services are committed to preventing any potential attacks. The sharing of information with European authorities is a testament to the cooperation and collaboration between intelligence agencies around the world in the fight against terrorism. This intercepted conference call serves as a reminder that threats from extremist groups still exist and that vigilance is needed in order to prevent further attacks. The potential consequences of an attack on the European rail network cannot be overstated, and measures must be taken to ensure that such an event does not occur.
