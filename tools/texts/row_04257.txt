chatgpt: An urgent call for help was sent out at 7am this morning as the engine room of the Sea Breeze, a cargo vessel, began to flood. At the time of the incident, the ship was 11 miles south-east of The Lizard in Cornwall.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) immediately dispatched lifeboats to the scene, accompanied by coastguards and a search and rescue helicopter. Despite their prompt response, the situation proved to be too dangerous to resolve, and a decision was taken to abandon the ship an hour after the rescuers arrived. The precise cause of the flooding is as yet unknown, but it is thought to have been caused by a ruptured pipe or similar malfunction. Unfortunately, the damage proved too severe to be contained by the crew members alone, and the water soon began seeping into the engine room, where vital components are stored. Thankfully, all crew members were able to evacuate the vessel safely, with no injuries reported. A spokesman for the RNLI described the rescue operation as "a textbook response to an urgent and potentially life-threatening situation". The crew has since been taken to a nearby port and is receiving medical checks and support, while an investigation into the cause of the incident has been initiated. The ship itself has been left adrift and is currently being monitored by the coastguard to prevent any potential hazards to other vessels in the area. The Sea Breeze is a well-known cargo vessel that regularly operates in the surrounding waters. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by seafarers, even in the safest and most familiar of operating environments.  The RNLI is a charity organization dedicated to saving lives at sea, and their swift response and the expertise of their crews has once again proven to be invaluable. Their actions have undoubtedly saved lives and prevented further damage to the vessel and the surrounding area. This incident is a testament to the importance of safety procedures, training, and emergency response protocols, which must be adhered to at all times. It is also a reminder of the bravery and dedication of the emergency services and the vital role they play in protecting lives and communities both on and off-shore.
