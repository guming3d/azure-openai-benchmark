article: Serious: Ben Monksummers was alarmed when he saw his high-velocity rifles on the baggage carousel . A Team GB rifle shooter accused easyJet of committing a 'serious offence' after they put his £11,000 guns arsenal on a public airport baggage carousel. Ben Monksummers, 22, of Gillingham, Dorset, who is currently on a placement in the Netherlands as part of his law degree, booked a return flight back to the UK to see his family, with the no frills airline. But on his return trip to the Netherlands, Mr Monksummers, who has competed in international rifle events for Team GB, was shocked to see his high-velocity rifles making their way around the public luggage collection carousel at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. 'Anyone could have walked out of that building with restricted firearms of a value of £11,000. 'This is a very serious offence' he said. And it wasn't the first event in which the budget carrier had left him reeling. Ben, a diabetic, had already been fined 55 euros (around £44) to take his medication on board the flight to the UK. The sportsman has since lodged a formal complaint with easyJet over the incidents, which occurred at the end of October. An easyJet spokesman said: 'We apologise for any inconvenience Mr Monksummers experienced. 'We have procedures in place to ensure that any firearms baggage goes through specific channels, therefore we are currently investigating why this didn't happen on this occasion. Mr Monksummers' arsenal included rifles such as the 50m rifle prone (file picture) Anyone could have walked out with restricted firearms of a value of £11,000, Mr Monksummers said .

chatgpt: Dorset native Ben Monksummers, 22, is no stranger to rifle contests on an international level. Having competed worldwide, he's become accustomed to the routine of transporting his high-velocity rifles through airports. However, his recent flight with easyJet to Schipol Airport in Amsterdam turned out to be an unpleasant surprise. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, Monksummers made his way to the luggage collection belt, where he was shocked to find his rifles waiting for him alongside his luggage. He had checked in the rifles as part of his luggage, but had assumed they would be kept in a secure area until he could retrieve them privately. Feeling uneasy about the safety of his firearms, Monksummers lodged a formal complaint to easyJet, demanding an explanation for how his rifles had ended up on the public luggage belt. Luckily, no one had tampered with the guns or caused any damage – but for Monksummers, the potential safety risk was too high. Speaking to local news sources, Monksummers expressed his disappointment with the airline's handling of the situation. He said, "I'm shocked that something like this would happen, especially with airline security being tightened so much in recent years. There's no way I'm going to take this lightly – I need to be confident that my guns are in safe hands, and that they're not going to be compromised by careless handling." Following Monksummers' complaint, easyJet issued an apology and have promised to investigate the matter fully. A spokesperson for the airline said, "We take all complaints seriously, and we're sorry that Mr. Monksummers was not satisfied with our handling of his luggage. We will be conducting a full review of our procedures to make sure that nothing like this happens again in the future." Despite the apology, Monksummers is understandably frustrated with the situation. He emphasised that his concern wasn't just for his own guns, but for the safety of other passengers as well. "Imagine if someone with malicious intentions had managed to snatch my rifles off the luggage belt before I got there? It's a scary thought. Airline security should be a top priority, and it's disappointing that easyJet failed to live up to those expectations." For now, Monksummers is taking stock of the situation and deciding whether or not he'll continue to fly with easyJet in the future. He's hopeful that the airline will take steps to improve its procedures and assure him that his guns will be handled with the utmost care. Until then, though, he'll be keeping a close eye on his luggage – and his firearms – whenever he travels.
