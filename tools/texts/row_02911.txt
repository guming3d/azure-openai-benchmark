Several tourists have been spotted clambering up a massive landslip which collapsed under the cliff top property. The home, Ridgemont House, has been left uninhabitable after a mass rock slide under its front garden at the 150ft Oddicombe Cliffs in Torquay, Devon. Disaster: The house is a death trap since the landslide underneath the front garden left it uninhabitable . Daredevils: reckless tourists were spotted (circled) climbing the 150ft cliff face to investigate the house . Tourist trap: people are using the mud at the front of Ridgemont House to climb up and take a peak inside . Concerned council chiefs have warned the public to steer clear of the doomed property that could come plunging down at any moment. Officials have been forced to rope off the entire home after the stress of the collapse caused the brick house to start falling down. But people have seen been spotted trying to access the fragile house - by walking UP the landslide from the beach. Local resident Charlotte Osborne, 15, snapped two people climbing up the cliff-face on Sunday afternoon as she took photos from a safe vantage point. Her mum Jenny said: 'We couldn't believe our eyes. We went to take photos of the house and saw people climbing up the rocks. Beauty spot: The house had a stunning view over the sea in Torquay before the land slide . Collapsing: The local council says that the house is in danger of plunging down the cliffs at any moment . 'I guess these people - we think it was a girl and a boy, perhaps in their late teens - were trying to see how high up the cliff face they could get. 'We couldn't believe how stupid they could be. They must have seen the warning sign. It was so dangerous. 'The sooner the house goes the better because people are going to look at it.' Ridgemont House has been at the centre of a bitter legal battle ever since it was deemed unsafe by a landslide one week after being sold at auction. The six-bedroom pile, just 50 yards from the cliff edge, was bought for Â£155,000 in February 2010 - via a telephone bid by a woman who had never been there. But the new owner later became engaged in a legal war with the builder who sold it to her - but a judge ordered her to pay him what she owed. A spokesman for Torbay Council said: 'We understand the privately-owned property is in a dangerous position and we would advise members of the public not to enter the site. 'The site is contained by fences and walls which can be reasonably expected to protect the public from danger. 'As further rocks falls occur, we anticipate the building will suffer further collapse.'

chatgpt: In the small town of Milton, locals have reported an unusual influx of tourists in recent weeks. Tourists have been spotted attempting to catch a glimpse inside the famous Ridgemont House, which is known for its stunning architecture and beautiful gardens. However, what is most intriguing to visitors is the massive rock slide that has occurred under the front garden of the estate. The 150ft landslide, which took place last month, has prompted many visitors to attempt a climb up the rocky terrain in order to get a better look at the damage caused. Despite being warned by authorities of the potential danger involved in attempting such a climb, many tourists have been undeterred and have sought out the challenge. According to local residents, the landslide has brought an unexpected wave of interest to the town. Many businesses have reported an increase in foot traffic, and some have even introduced new services specifically catering to tourists. However, the unconventional attraction has also caused some concern among residents. Ridgemont House, which is a private residence, has become a popular spot for visitors. The owners have expressed their frustration over the increased attention, as well as their concern for the safety of those attempting to climb the slide. They have issued a statement asking tourists to respect their privacy and avoid trespassing on their property. Despite this warning, many tourists have still been attempting to climb the rocky terrain. In response, local authorities have ramped up efforts to prevent visitors from gaining access to the site. A fence has been erected around the front garden, and signs have been posted warning of the potential danger of approaching the landslide. The town council has also issued a statement discouraging visitors from attempting to climb the landslide, citing the potential hazard to both the climbers and first responders in the event of an accident. In addition, the council has urged visitors to respect the privacy of the residents and avoid disrupting the quiet community. The Ridgemont House landslide has become a prime example of how one event can have a ripple effect on an entire community. While the increased attention has brought a boost in business for local shops, it has also caused concern for the safety and wellbeing of both visitors and residents. As such, it is important for both tourists and locals to exercise caution and respect the boundaries of property owners.
