Holder Jason Dufner’s menu included a ‘Butt Rubbed’ Filet Mignon — Butt Rub being a barbecue seasoning. The choice was presumably inspired by last year’s celebration, during which he was photographed patting his wife’s rear end.

chatgpt: Golf legends and fans alike were treated to a mix of excitement and humor at the recent golf tournament in Orlando, Florida. Tiger Woods, who is known for his temper on the golf course, let an F-bomb slip during his second hole. Meanwhile, Colin Montgomerie showed his versatility by hitting a round of 70, then putting his commentating skills to the test for Sky Sports. But perhaps the biggest surprise of the day was seeing Darren Clarke dressed up as Santa Claus. Woods, who is on the road to recovery from back surgery, was playing in the PNC Championship with his 11-year-old son, Charlie. The father-son duo got off to a rocky start when Woods hit his second shot into the sand at the second hole. Frustration got the better of him, and he let out an audible F-bomb. The expletive was picked up by the microphones, leaving fans and commentators alike surprised. However, the slip-up did little to deter Woods' performance. He quickly regained his composure and continued to play a solid round, ending the day with a score of 62. Father and son finished seventh in the tournament, but it was clear to fans that Woods was on his way back to top form. Meanwhile, Montgomerie, who is known for his commentating skills, put them to the test while still performing on the course. The veteran golfer hit a round of 70 before taking to the commentary box to offer his insights on the other golfers' performances. Fans were impressed by Montgomerie's versatility, and some even suggested that he could have a future in sports broadcasting if he ever decides to retire from playing. But the biggest surprise of the day came from Darren Clarke, who was seen walking around the course dressed as Santa Claus. Clarke, who is known for his love of betting, had lost a bet with fellow golfer Lee Westwood. As a result, he was forced to dress up as Santa and carry a sack full of presents for the other golfers. Clarke embraced the role, laughing and joking with his fellow players as he made his way around the course. Despite the humorous moments, the PNC Championship was fiercely contested by some of the world's top golfers. Justin Thomas and his father, Mike, emerged victorious with a score of 25 under par. Second place went to defending champions Matt Kuchar and his son, Cameron, while third place went to Vijay Singh and his son, Qass. The tournament was a much-needed showcase of talent and camaraderie amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While fans were not allowed to attend the event in person, they were able to watch it on television and get a taste of the action. Overall, the PNC Championship was a mix of excitement, tension, and humor. From Woods' F-bomb to Montgomerie's commentary skills and Clarke's Santa outfit, the tournament delivered plenty of memorable moments. Fans are already looking forward to next year's event and can't wait to see what surprises the golfing world has in store.
