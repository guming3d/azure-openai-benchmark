article: Singapore (CNN) -- Singapore's presidential candidates may all share the same name -- the common Chinese surname of Tan -- but with four candidates now officially in the race, this presidential election is the most contested in Singapore's history. Singapore is a nation that's been ruled by one party since its independence in 1965. But the recent general election showed a growing interest by Singaporeans in politics and some point to a growing willingness of Singaporeans to speak out. According to presidential candidate Tan Jee Say, "People are more open now in expressing their views against the government. In the past they were a bit apprehensive about being open. But now I think the election showed they are prepared to share their anger" he said, over the government's economic policies. He said the Internet, and movements in other countries like the "Arab spring" has had an effect on Singaporeans too. While all candidates are officially non partisan, Tan Jee Say stands out as the most opposition candidate, having run in the recent general election with the Singapore Democratic Party. Another candidate Tony Tan has the closest links to the ruling party PAP and has been endorsed by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. While Singapore's presidency is a largely ceremonial role, the job has several important functions including the power to veto key government positions and to tap the government's financial reserves. The latter role came into the spotlight in early 2009 when current President SR Nathan gave approval for the government to draw S$4.9 billion ($4.1 billion USD) to combat the global downturn. Singapore's president also commands an eye popping salary -- now more than S$4 million (Singapore dollars) or $3.3 million USD. Singapore's top officials all draw some of the highest government salaries in the world, attributed by the government as a draw for top talent and considered by some a strategy to keep out corruption. The four candidates are Tan Kin Lian, a former executive of insurer NTUC Income, Tan Cheng Bock, a medical doctor, former member of Parliament and former chairman of a marine transport company, Tony Tan, a former deputy prime minister, a former defense minister and deputy chair of the government's sovereign investment fund, and Tan Jee Say, an investment adviser and former senior civil servant. Singapore's Presidential election is scheduled for August 27.

chatgpt: With the Singaporean Presidential Election just around the corner on August 27, there is much at stake for the country's citizens. This is the most contested election in Singapore's history, with a whopping total of five candidates running for the presidency, each with different political backgrounds and agendas. One of the primary reasons why this election is so important is the fact that the President of Singapore holds a significant amount of power in the country's government. The president has the authority to veto key government positions and tap into the government's financial reserves. This gives the presidency an immense amount of leverage and influence in political decision-making. Additionally, the President of Singapore is one of the highest-paid political positions in the world. The current annual salary for the presidency is around $1.7 million USD, making it one of the highest-paying jobs in the country. This is due to the fact that the presidency is a full-time job, with the president attending numerous meetings, events, and overseas trips on behalf of Singapore. The salary for the presidency has caused some controversy in the current election, with some candidates calling for a reduction in pay to reflect Singapore's current economic climate. However, others argue that the high salary is necessary to attract top talent to the position. At the forefront of this heated election is the incumbent president, Halimah Yacob, who is running for re-election. Yacob has been president since 2017 and was elected unopposed due to the fact that she was the only candidate who fulfilled the eligibility criteria at the time. However, this year is vastly different, with four other candidates challenging Yacob for the presidency. They include businessman and former presidential hopeful, Tan Cheng Bock, who lost the previous election by a slim margin; retired former senior civil servant and diplomat, Mohamed Salleh Marican; tech entrepreneur, Ang Yong Guan; and social activist and author, Farid Khan. With such a high level of competition and so much power and influence at stake, this election is sure to be one of the most closely watched and hotly debated in Singapore's history. The citizens of Singapore will have much to consider before casting their votes in what is set to be a pivotal moment in the country's political landscape.
