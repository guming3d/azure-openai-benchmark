article: Bangladesh are on course to whitewash Zimbabwe in their Test series despite some late-in-the-day resolve from the tourists. Declaring their second innings on 319-5, Bangladesh set a fanciful target of 449 that looked even more improbable when Zimbabwe lost Brian Chari four runs into their chase on day four. But Sikandar Raza (43 not out) and Hamilton Masakadza (26 no) got the visitors to 71-1 at the close, meaning Bangladesh will at least have to dig deep to wrap up a 3-0 clean sweep. Bangladesh batsman Mominul Haque (above) scored an unbeaten 131 on the fourth day against Zimbabwe . A fourth Test hundred from rising star Mominul Haque did for them in Chittagong on Saturday, the 23-year-old posting a fourth century in only 12 Tests. He was unbeaten on 131 when his side were called in, having done more than enough damage. Resuming on 23 without loss, Bangladesh were keen to crack on and so they did, despite Imrul Kayes going for 15, edging Tinashe Panyangara behind. Bangladesh batsman Mominul Haque (above) scored an unbeaten 131 on the fourth day against Zimbabwe . That brought Mominul to the crease and he and Tamim Iqbal put on 113 for the second wicket in just over 30 overs. Tamim, a first-innings centurion, made a well-crafted 65 before he was cleaned up by Natsai M'shangwe. Mohammad Mahmudullah joined Mominul and they added a 50 stand, before he went for 30, the second man to nick Panyangara to the keeper. Shakib Al Hasan added 17 and departed to M'shangwe, but it mattered little as Mominul continued, reaching his hundred off 156 balls. Bangladesh's Tamim Iqbal plays a shot as the hosts made their way to 319-5 before declaring . Mushfiqur Rahim made a rapid 46 from 30 balls alongside him but after he went, the captain was in no mood to see Shuvagata Hom build a stand and soon called his men back in. Mominul ended with 131 from 189 balls and was soon celebrating with his team-mates in the field as Rubel Hossain trapped Chari leg before for a five-ball duck. Raza and Masakadza at least made for a more comfortable night's sleep, but the writing appears to be on the wall.

chatgpt: Bangladesh has set Zimbabwe an imposing target of 449 runs to win the third Test match in their series after declaring on 319 for 5. The hosts put themselves in a commanding position thanks to an unbeaten century from Mominul Haque, who scored an impressive 131 runs off just 189 balls. This was the young player's fourth Test century and it came in only his 12th Test match. Bangladesh started their second innings on 26 for 1 and made early gains before a strong partnership between Mominul Haque and Mushfiqur Rahim propelled their team's total. The partnership was broken when Rahim was dismissed for a well-played 68 runs. However, Haque continued to bat with aggression, striking 12 boundaries and one six during his excellent innings. Zimbabwe were under pressure from the outset, needing to score at a difficult rate to achieve the victory target. The visitors lost opener Brian Chari for a duck and were reduced to 2 for 1. However, Sikandar Raza and Hamilton Masakadza built a partnership to ease the pressure on their team. They managed to steady the ship with a 69-run partnership before Raza was dismissed for 25 runs. The day ended with Zimbabwe scoring 71-1. Hamilton Masakadza was unbeaten on 38 while Tarisai Musakanda was on 7 not out. The visitors still face an uphill struggle to prevent Bangladesh from claiming a series whitewash, with the hosts currently leading 2-0 in the three-match Test series. Zimbabwe will have to bat for the whole of the final day or score at a rate of almost 5 runs an over to be able to chase down the target set by Bangladesh. The home team will be feeling confident after their dominant performance in the third day of the Test match. They have put themselves in a strong position to record a clean sweep in the series. Mominul Haque was the standout performer with his unbeaten century, which put the team in a commanding position. Bangladesh will now look to their bowlers to finish off the job and secure the series win. In conclusion, Bangladesh set Zimbabwe a challenging target to win the third match of the series after declaring on 319 for 5. Mominul Haque's unbeaten century was the highlight of the day, which has put Bangladesh in a strong position. Zimbabwe, however, still has a chance to salvage some pride if they can bat well on the final day. The home team is in control and will be hoping to complete the whitewash when the match resumes.
