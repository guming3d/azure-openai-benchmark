A study in Philadelphia has found each person interprets smells differently . It is an age-old problem. Why is it so difficult to buy perfume for a loved one? Well, scientists may have come up with the answer - but it doesn’t make picking a gift any easier. We all think we know how certain things smell. But to someone else that same bottle of perfume - or piece of cheese, or glass of wine - may smell completely differently. American scientists have discovered that we all experience odours in a completely different way. Their paper, published in the Nature Neuroscience journal, reveals that 30 per cent of smell receptors differ between any two people. Each single receptor can alter the way each person perceives an odour. Dr Joel Mainland, a molecular biologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia, said: ‘For different items there is a big gap between what you smell and what I smell. ‘The amount of variation was really surprising to us - it was about 30 per cent of receptors are different between two individuals at random. That is a pretty high number.’ The human nose contains 400 different olfactory receptors - and Dr Mainland’s team found that changing a single receptor could dramatically change the way a person perceives a smell. Good or bad? While some detect the aromatic smell of sandalwood from a scented candle, others smell it as pee . Dr Mainland said: ‘The activation pattern . of these 400 receptors encodes both the intensity of an odour and the . quality – for example, whether it smells like vanilla or smoke – for the . tens of thousands of different odours that represent everything we . smell.’ Changing one particular receptor meant . that some people smell a specific type of steroid as a pleasant . sandalwood - while others thought it smells like pee. ‘It is very different,’ Dr Mainland said. ‘One person might find it to be mild and pleasant and by changing that single receptor another might find it to be as a very strong and urinous.’ The researchers cloned 511 receptors and embedded them in host cells in the laboratory. They then measured how each receptor responded to a panel of 73 different odours. The process identified 28 different ways that each array of receptors would respond to the different odours. The team used mathematical models to extrapolate the findings, and came up with the result that 140 of their 400 receptors - about 30 per cent - of any two individuals would be different. Dr Mainland said the results may enable scientists to accurately create different smells. ‘The long-term goal is to figure out how the receptors encode odour molecules well enough that we can actually create any odour we want by manipulating the receptors directly.’

chatgpt: The human nose is a remarkable organ that plays a crucial role in how we perceive the world around us. It can detect up to 10,000 different scents and identify them with incredible precision. However, as scientists from the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia have discovered, even the slightest change in one of the 400 different types of receptors found in the human nose can drastically alter how we interpret a scent. In a recent paper published by the centre, researchers found that a single change in a person's genetic makeup can cause them to perceive a scent in a completely different way to another person. For example, something that smells like sandalwood to one person could be interpreted as urine by another. Dr Joel Mainland, an author of the study, explained that this finding could have important implications for scientists who are working to create new smells. By understanding how the nose interprets different scents, researchers may be able to develop fragrances that appeal to a wider range of people. "Smell is an incredibly complex process," said Dr Mainland. "Our noses contain many different types of receptors that work together to identify different scents. By understanding how these receptors function, we may be able to create fragrances that are more universally appealing." The Monell Chemical Senses Centre is a world-renowned research institution that has been studying how the senses of taste and smell work for over 50 years. The team of scientists at the centre uses a range of advanced techniques to investigate how these senses work, including genetic sequencing, brain imaging, and behavioural studies. The recent study by the Monell team is part of a broader effort to better understand how the human body processes sensory information. By identifying the specific receptors involved in scent detection, scientists hope to gain a deeper understanding of how the brain develops and maintains these sensory abilities. While this research is still in its early stages, the implications could be far-reaching. In addition to creating new fragrances, these findings could lead to new treatments for conditions like anosmia (the loss of the sense of smell) and hypersensitivity to certain odours. "Understanding how the nose works is incredibly important," said Dr Mainland. "Our sense of smell is tied to so many aspects of our lives, from our memories and emotions to our appetite and overall well-being. The more we can learn about this sense, the better equipped we'll be to improve people's lives." Of course, there are also commercial implications to this work. Companies that produce fragrances and scented products could use this knowledge to create new and exciting scents that appeal to a broader range of consumers. This could lead to a wider variety of perfumes, soaps, and cleaning products on the market. While it's still early days for this research, the findings of the Monell team offer a glimpse into the incredibly complex and fascinating world of scent detection. As scientists continue to probe the mysteries of the human nose, we may gain a deeper appreciation for the role that smell plays in our lives, and perhaps even unlock new ways to enhance our sensory experiences.
