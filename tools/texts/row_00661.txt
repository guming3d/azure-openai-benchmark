chatgpt: Southampton Football Club is preparing to offer Nathaniel Clyne a new contract as they look to tie the England international to the club beyond the end of next season. The full-back has impressed for both club and country in recent years, leading to interest from other teams. The Saints are keen to keep hold of one of their prized assets, who has been a key member of the squad since joining from Crystal Palace in 2012. In addition to the new deal for Clyne, the club is also offering new contracts to Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez as they seek to secure the future of their key players. Clyne's impressive performances have not gone unnoticed by manager Ronald Koeman, who praised the player following England's 3-1 victory over Scotland on Tuesday. The defender played the full 90 minutes and demonstrated his attacking abilities by creating a number of chances. The 23-year-old has proven himself to be one of the best right-backs in the Premier League, and his inclusion in Roy Hodgson's England squad is testament to his ability. He has made 7 appearances for the national team so far and is expected to be a key part of the team's future plans. Southampton will be hoping that the new contract offer will persuade Clyne to stay at the club for the long term, following the departure of a number of key players over the summer, including Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren. The Saints have made an impressive start to the season, currently sitting second in the Premier League table, and will be keen to maintain that form as they look to secure European football for next season. Keeping hold of players like Clyne, Schneiderlin and Rodriguez will be vital to their success. Clyne's current contract runs until the end of the 2015-16 season, which means that he would be free to leave the club on a free transfer next summer if a new deal is not agreed. However, the defender has publicly stated his desire to stay at Southampton, saying that he is happy at the club and enjoying his football. The negotiations for the new contracts are currently ongoing, but it is expected that Clyne will be offered a significant pay rise as well as an extended deal. This would be a sign of the club's commitment to their star player and would help to secure his future at St. Mary's. Southampton fans will be hoping that the negotiations are successful and that Clyne will be wearing the red and white stripes for many years to come. His impressive displays for both club and country have shown that he is a player with a bright future ahead of him, and the Saints will be keen to ensure that future is with them.
