article: (CNN) -- The Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, office of a Lebanese television station was shut down after the station aired an interview with a Saudi man who bragged about his sex life, authorities said. Saudi authorities closed the office of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., or LBC for two reasons, Abdul-Rahman Al-Hazza, spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Culture and Information, told CNN: "No valid operating license and a violation of media policy in Saudi Arabia." LBC is mainly owned by Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal. Al-Hazza said LBC violated the media policy by filming and subsequently airing an episode of its popular show, "A Thick Red Line," featuring Mazen Abdul Jawad, a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four who spoke openly about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14. Abdul Jawad also is shown in his bedroom, where he holds sexual aids up to the camera. The episode ends with him cruising the streets of Jeddah in his car looking for women. The episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where Shariah, or strict Islamic law, is practiced. Premarital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. The segment in question has been posted on the video-sharing site YouTube since its initial broadcast last month and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Local media reported Abdul Jawad was arrested a few days after the program aired and has been detained since last week. Some reports have suggested he could face punishments as severe as flogging or even the death penalty for the alleged crime of publicizing vice. Suleiman Al-Mutawae, acting spokesman for Jeddah police, told Arab News, an English-language daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia, that speaking about promiscuous acts "is a violation of the Shariah regulations on the one hand and against Saudi customs on the other." All newspapers require government permission to publish in Saudi Arabia. Before Abdul Jawad's detention, Arab News reported he initiated a damage-control campaign, apologized for his comments and was considering filing a complaint against the show's producers for presenting him "in the worst possible manner by taking two hours of footage and condensing it down to a minute-long segment." CNN has been unable to reach Abdul Jawad or his lawyer for comment. LBC has not commented on the situation. Asked how long LBC's Jeddah offices will be closed, Al-Hazza said it was "too early to ask that question" but noted that only the Jeddah offices of the channel had been shut down. LBC's Riyadh office remains open, he said.

chatgpt: The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. office in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia has been ordered to shut down. This comes after the station aired an interview with a Saudi man who boasted about his sex life, causing uproar in the conservative country. In the interview, Abdul Jawad was shown in his bedroom holding various sexual aids up to the camera. He brazenly spoke about his sexual experiences and preferences, which quickly went viral on social media.  The episode sparked outrage in Saudi Arabia, where sexual discussions are considered taboo and indecent. Many people took to social media to express their disgust and call for action. The Saudi Arabian authorities swiftly responded by shutting down the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp.'s office in Jeddah. They also arrested the man who conducted the interview and the man who boasted about his sex life. The Saudi Arabian government is known for its strict censorship laws and its restrictions on the public discussion of sexual matters. The authorities view such discussions as immoral and against Islamic teachings. As a result of the incident, many people are calling for a review of the country's censorship laws. They argue that such strict laws only serve to stifle free speech and prevent important discussions from taking place. However, others believe that the censorship laws are necessary to preserve the country's traditional values and culture. Regardless of the political implications, the incident has sparked a national conversation about the role of censorship in Saudi Arabian society. Some are calling for a more open and inclusive discussion about sex in the country, while others are urging caution and adherence to traditional values. For now, the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp.'s office in Jeddah will remain closed. It is unclear whether the station will be allowed to reopen in the future, or whether the incident will have a lasting impact on the country's censorship laws. As the debate continues, one thing is certain: the incident has demonstrated the power of social media to spark controversy and provoke change in even the most conservative societies.
