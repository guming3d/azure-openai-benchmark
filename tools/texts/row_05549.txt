A California man was forced off a cross-country flight in Denver after allegedly groping multiple women seated near him. Gregory Meyer, 47, of Studio City, CA, was arrested Friday after his boorish behaviour turned lewd, causing the plane to make a pit stop at Denver International Airport, in Colorado. Meyer is alleged to have fondled two female passengers. When refused service from flight attendants because he was 'visibly drunk,' Meyer broke out his own bottle of vodka, according to an announcement from the US Attorney’s office in Denver. Not so lucky: Gregory Meyer's luck appears to have run out after his flight was diverted and he was arrested . The flight, from Burbank Bob Hope Airport to John F Kennedy International Airport in New York, was diverted to Denver when pilots decided to eject him after flight attendants complained of his ‘assaultive behaviour.’ The last entry on Meyer's Facebook page was him checking in to Bob Hope Airport saying 'Here we go.' Smelling of alcohol when he boarded the flight, Meyer is alleged to have stroked a female passenger’s arm, grabbed her waist and tried to grab her hand. The startled woman was sitting next to the purported pervert, but across the aisle. Rebuffed by the first object of his drunken desire, Meyer then allegedly grabbed the head of a female passenger seated in front of him. Meyer then supposedly refused to follow the requests of flight attendants, causing the pilot to land the plane. Here we go!: Meyer was already loaded when he boarded the flight . He might want to cut back: Meyer, seen enjoying another one, might want cut back on his drinking in the future . During further questioning, investigators discovered that Meyer had also taken an Ambien sleeping pill, it is not clear if he had a prescription for the medication. Meyer was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, placed into federal custody and arraigned Friday on two charges of simple assault, each charge carries a maximum 6-month prison sentence and a $5,000 fine. It is not known if Meyer, originally from New York, continued on with his trip or returned home to California. Meyer's Facebook page says he is the owner of Meyer Consulting.

chatgpt: A JetBlue airline passenger has been arrested and is now facing charges of grabbing two female passengers, one on her waist and the other on her head. The accused, identified as Gregory Meyer, had allegedly taken Ambien and brought his own bottle of vodka onto the plane. The incident occurred during a JetBlue flight from the Dominican Republic to New York, where Meyer was originally from. While on the flight, Meyer allegedly took Ambien, a prescription medication used to treat insomnia. According to one of the female passengers, Meyer appeared to be intoxicated and was acting inappropriately. At one point during the flight, Meyer reportedly grabbed the waist of one female passenger and the head of another. The female passenger whose head was grabbed by Meyer was reportedly in shock and began to cry shortly after the incident occurred. The crew on the flight immediately contacted law enforcement once they became aware of what had happened. Upon landing at JFK airport, Meyer was taken into custody and placed under arrest. He is now facing charges of unlawful imprisonment and harassment, as well as disorderly conduct. It is unclear at this point whether or not Meyer will face additional charges for bringing his own bottle of vodka onto the plane. JetBlue prohibits passengers from bringing their own alcohol on board, as it is a violation of Federal Aviation Administration regulations. A spokesperson for JetBlue released a statement regarding the incident, saying, “The safety and security of our customers and crew members is our top priority. We take all incidents of disruptive behavior seriously and follow strict guidelines to ensure that those who disrupt a flight are held accountable for their actions. We are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their investigation of this incident.” The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of following guidelines and regulations on flights, and the potentially dangerous consequences that can result from inappropriate behavior. Meyers is expected to appear in court to face the charges against him in the coming weeks.
