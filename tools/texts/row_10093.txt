A study out this summer from Ohio State University says smokers cost their employers around $6,000 per year more than non-smokers. Researchers led by Micah Berman, who will become an assistant professor at the university’s College of Public Health this month, used the findings of previous studies to take a comprehensive look at the financial burden smokers put on their employers. Coming as no surprise, smoke breaks cost employers the lion’s share of the six grand, followed by higher healthcare costs, absenteeism, and lower productivity. Cost defective: An Ohio State University researcher has concluded that smokers cost their employers an average of $6,000 per year . ‘This research should help businesses make better informed decisions about their tobacco policies,’ Berman said. ‘We constructed our calculations such that individual employers can plug in their own expenses to get more accurate estimates of their own costs.’ The study came up with some precise numbers for how much absenteeism, lost productivity, smoke breaks and health care cost employers each year. On average, smoke breaks cost employers $3,077 per year, while the second highest expenditure, health care, costs employers an average of $2,056 per year. And while absenteeism caused by ill health made up around $500 of the costs, ‘presenteeism’—or reduced productivity—accounted for $462 of the researchers’ calculations. Breakdown: The study, led by researcher Micah Berman, came to some very specific dollar amounts about how smokers cost their employers money . But not them all: By dying, some retired smokers could could save their employers money by offsetting the pension costs of longer-lived non-smokers . All told, the annual costs could range from $2,885 to $10,125 per smoker, according to the study. Some smokers, however, can actually save their employers money the study also found. Though they have to be dead. When a retiree who receives a set amount of pension each year from his or her former employer dies, that employer saves around $296. This happens because of the difference in lifespan between smokers and non-smokers because the shorter-lived smokers actually help offset pensions of the longer-lived non-smokers. Meanwhile, Berman urged employers not to start fuming right away. ‘Employers should be understanding about how difficult it is to quit smoking and how much support is needed,’ he said. ‘It’s definitely not just a cost issue, but employers should be informed about what the costs are when they are considering these policies.’

chatgpt: Researchers at Ohio State University have compiled data from various studies to determine the exact costs to employers when it comes to retiree smokers. Surprisingly, the data suggests that dying could actually save their employers money by offsetting the pension costs of longer-lived non-smokers. According to the research, employers spend approximately $5,800 more per year on retired smokers compared to non-smokers. This is due to increased healthcare costs, absenteeism, and reduced productivity. Additionally, because smokers tend to have shorter life expectancies, they often collect less in pension benefits. However, the study points out that when smokers die earlier, their employers actually save money. This is because their pension benefits end upon their death, meaning that their employers no longer need to pay out the same amount of money over the smoker's longer life expectancy. In contrast, non-smokers often outlive their pension benefits, leading employers to bear the cost of continued payments. The lead author of the study, Dr. Micah Berman, commented on the findings, saying, "While it's certainly not within an employer's legal or ethical responsibilities to actively promote their employees' premature deaths, it's important for employers to understand the financial implications of smoking among their retiree population." The study also found that current smoking employees cost employers an additional $3,400 per year compared to non-smokers. This suggests that incentivizing employees to quit smoking could have significant financial benefits for employers. The findings of the Ohio State University research support previous studies that have shown the high cost of smoking to society as a whole. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking-related illness and death costs the United States more than $300 billion per year in direct medical expenses and lost productivity. Overall, the study highlights the financial impact of smoking on employers, particularly when it comes to pension costs. While employers cannot actively encourage their employees to die prematurely, incentivizing smoking cessation could have significant financial benefits for both parties in the long run.
