article: By . Lizzie Edmonds . London's commuters are well known to be a hard-nosed bunch. And this video perhaps proves that theory - as even a man dancing wildly to techno doesn't seem to rouse these commuters on the packed Underground. In hilarious footage, the gentleman - thought to be called Nathan - jumps around, throws his arms in the air and even does the robot on a central London platform to the dance track Sandstorm by Darude. Scroll down for video . Surprised - and often bemused - commuters watch on as a man, thought to be called Nathan, dances outrageously to techno on the London Underground . Despite his smooth moves to dance track Sandstorm by Darude, many of those waiting for a train just ignore the man (pictured) - instead looking straight ahead in a bid to avoid him . His moves certainly gain some strange looks - but few even crack a smile let alone join him in his performance. At one point, two alarmed looking women and a man tentatively make their way past the dancer - attempting not to look directly at him as they pass. Another woman then stares at the man as he moves past her before rapidly turning her attention back to her newspaper. One man, wearing a pair of large headphones, completely ignores all the action as it takes place next to him - instead focusing on the tube tracks ahead. The footage later shows the man flailing around outside Oxford Circus tube station. There, commuters made a point of moving out of the man's way - keeping quiet a distance between themselves and the dancer as they trudge past him. At one point, the footage shows three teenagers glaring at the man before making their way in to the station. The man continues to strut his stuff up and down the station, despite many commuters glaring at him . Later, the man can be seen dancing outside Oxford Circus tube station (pictured) - where shoppers look equally unimpressed with the dancer's moves . The dancer later takes to the lift to show off his moves - much to the evident disdain of one main (bottom left) who looks terrified at the man's moves . Later in the video, which has gained over 20,000 views since it was posted online two days ago, the man can be seen dancing in a lift. There, one man looks terrified at the man's impressive moves - scratching his chin and occasionally looking tentatively into the camera lens. The video was filmed and posted by Trollstation Vlogs. Many viewers have reacted to the footage - which was posted on YouTube by the site. Rikkerry25 said: 'All these people are lame as f***. It just goes to show you how so many people get so caught up in the daily grind that they forget to have fun and do something out of the ordinary.﻿' Another, Sebastian Strnad, wrote: 'Would of joined in but that's just me.' Carl Geers added: 'Dance your ass off man! Dance till you drop!﻿'﻿ .

chatgpt: A wild and unexpected scene unfolded on the London Underground earlier this week, as a man burst into an impromptu dance performance on a packed platform. According to witnesses, the man began dancing wildly to the 90s dance hit "Sandstorm" by Darude, busting out classic robot moves and energetic jumps as commuters watched on. While some onlookers appeared unimpressed or even irritated by the spectacle, others were reportedly transfixed or even terrified by the gyrating dancer. One witness spoke to reporters, saying, "It was like something out of a movie. This guy just started dancing out of nowhere, and at first everyone was kind of annoyed because the train was running late. But then after a minute, you could see people starting to loosen up and even chuckle a little bit." The scene was captured on video by several commuters, and quickly went viral on social media. Within just two days, the footage had amassed over 20,000 views on YouTube alone. Many online commentators have praised the dancer's enthusiasm and willingness to inject some much-needed levity into a frustrating situation. "It's so refreshing to see someone let loose and dance like nobody's watching," said one commenter. "We need more of this kind of energy in our daily lives!" However, others have criticized the dancer for potentially causing a safety hazard on the crowded platform. Transport officials have also issued warnings against performing stunts or displays on the transportation system, noting that they can be dangerous and disruptive to fellow passengers. Despite these concerns, the video has continued to circulate online, with many viewers praising the dancer's deft footwork and creative spirit. The incident serves as a reminder of the unexpected moments that can happen in daily life, and the power of a little bit of spontaneity to brighten up an otherwise dull or frustrating situation. As the city of London continues to navigate the challenges of a busy and often hectic commuting system, perhaps this dancing daredevil has given us all a reason to smile and dance, even when things don't go according to plan.
