Artist Valerie Graves, 55, was found dead in a ground-floor bedroom at a waterside property in West Sussex . Police found the filthy claw  hammer at an undisclosed location near the murder scene in Bosham, near Chichester, West Sussex, a  village where Midsomer Murders has been filmed. Officers appealed to police, prison staff, probation officers and mental health professionals who may have heard someone speak of an assault using a hammer, sparking speculation that the weapon may have been used in another attack. Police are also probing the theory that the hammer could have been stolen or lost by an innocent  resident in the village and retrieved by the killer. The development came hours after Sussex Police released a  22-year-old suspect on bail. Detectives spent four days quizzing Daniel Pereira, who lives in a three-bedroom cottage 400 yards from the murder scene with his father Simon Miles, 44. The cottage was also searched. Family say Mr Pereira, who works for a local electrical supplies firm, is a ‘nice guy’ who would never harm anyone and his arrest is a ‘joke’.

Yesterday Detective Superintendent Nick May from Surrey and  Sussex Major Crime Team revealed that the hammer could have been bought at a Screwfix store nearby. He said: ‘We need to know the origins of this hammer. Do you  recognise it?... The hammer is about 30cm in length. It has a distinctive red and black handle and is embossed with the words Forge Steel with a picture of an outline of an anvil.’ Police refused to say if any traces of a potential killer were found on the weapon, and whether it had been used to force entrance to the property. Yesterday Miss Graves’s family were said to be hopeful that the appeal would lead to a breakthrough.
