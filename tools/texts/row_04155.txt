article: Scuba divers have uncovered the largest treasure trove ever discovered off Israel's Mediterranean coast - but won't get a penny. The group initially thought they had found a toy coin on the ocean floor before tests confirmed the gold pieces were treasure. Experts who eventually counted 2,000 pieces, dating back more than 1,000 years, described the discovery as 'priceless.' The coins are now property of the state with no finder's fee for the divers. Gold: Divers uncovered almost 2,000 gold coins in different denominations, circulated by the Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled much of the Middle East and North Africa from 909 to 1171 . Members of a diving club in the Roman-era port stumbled across the treasure, weighing nearly 20 pounds, by pure chance while on a dive. 'The largest treasure of gold coins discovered in Israel was found in recent weeks on the seabed in the ancient harbour in Caesarea,' said a statement by Israeli Antiquities Authority. 'At first they thought they had spotted a toy coin from a game and it was only after they understood the coin was the real thing that they collected several coins and quickly returned to the shore in order to inform the director of the dive club about their find'. Experts from the authority called to the site uncovered almost 2,000 gold coins in different denominations, circulated by the Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled much of the Middle East and North Africa from 909 to 1171.

Kobi Sharvit, director of the marine archaeology unit at the Israel Antiquities Authority, said excavations would be carried out in the hope of shedding more light on the origin of the treasure. 'There is probably a shipwreck there of an official treasury boat which was on its way to the central government in Egypt with taxes that had been collected,' said Sharvit. 'Perhaps the treasure of coins was meant to pay the salaries of the Fatimid military garrison which was stationed in Caesarea and protected the city. Treasure: It is the largest treasure trove ever discovered off Israel's Mediterranean coast with the country's antiquities authority calling it 'priceless' 'Another theory is that the treasure was money belonging to a large merchant ship that traded with the coastal cities and the port on the Mediterranean Sea and sank there,' he said. The Israeli Antiquities Authority declined to put a cash value on the coins, which it said had been exposed as a result of winter storms.

chatgpt: Divers off the coast of Israel have uncovered the largest haul of ancient coins ever found in the Mediterranean. The discovery of the gold coins, which date back more than 1,000 years, was made by chance. Initially, the coins were thought to be toy coins, but after experts were called in to examine them, it was confirmed that they were indeed genuine coins made of gold. The coins, which were found during a storm, have yet to be fully analyzed, and work is ongoing to trace the origins of the treasure. The valuable haul, which is now the property of the state, is estimated to be worth millions of dollars. However, the divers who made the find will not receive a finder's fee, a decision that has caused controversy among some in the diving community. The discovery of the coins is a reminder of the rich history of the Mediterranean, which has been a hub of trade and commerce for thousands of years. The coins themselves offer a glimpse into the past, and the ongoing work to trace their origins may shed new light on the ancient civilizations that once thrived in the region. For now, the location of the discovery is being kept secret, as authorities seek to protect the site from looters and treasure hunters. However, it is hoped that one day the coins may be put on public display, so that everyone can appreciate their beauty and historical significance. The discovery has also sparked interest among archaeologists and historians, who are eager to learn more about the context in which the coins were created and used. It is not yet clear whether the coins were part of a larger hoard or were used as currency in everyday transactions. Despite the controversy over the lack of a finder's fee, the divers who made the discovery are said to be thrilled with the outcome. For them, the discovery of such a valuable and historically significant haul is reward enough. As work continues to trace the origins of the treasure, it is clear that the discovery of the coins marks a significant moment in the history of the Mediterranean. It is a valuable reminder of the rich cultural and commercial heritage of the region and a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of the ancient civilizations that once called it home.
