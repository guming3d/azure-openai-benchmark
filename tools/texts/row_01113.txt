Complaint: Adam Shropshire collapsed in a NHS walk-in centre after they turned him away and had to call for an ambulance when he came round . Mr Shropshire said: 'My illness was not life-threatening - but what if it had been someone having a heart attack?' The 39-year-old was left disabled after contracting pneumonia and a virus last year. Mr Shropshire, who with wife Tanya runs a pub in Leeds, West Yorkshire uses a wheelchair or crutches. On March 19, he fell and cut his knee, which needed stitches. A few days later his leg was red and swollen and he felt ill. He rang NHS Direct who told him to go to a walk-in centre in nearby Bradford. Mr Shropshire took a taxi to Hillside Bridge Health Centre, which is commissioned by NHS Bradford and Airedale but run by a private firm. On arriving just after 2pm on March 24, Mr Shropshire explained he had been sent by NHS Direct. 'The woman said "they are always doing that, we have got no appointments and you’ll have to go elsewhere",' he said. He says he struggled towards the exit on his crutches, but felt faint and collapsed in a corridor. After coming round he called NHS Direct and the operator sent an ambulance. Mr Shropshire said he was advised to visit Hillside Bridge Health Centre by NHS Direct but they said they had no spare appointments . That took him to Bradford Royal Infirmary, where he was diagnosed with the skin infection cellulitis. He was treated with antibiotics before being discharged last Monday. Mr Shropshire is now making a complaint about the centre. Yorkshire Ambulance Service confirmed an ambulance was sent to the centre that afternoon. A spokeswoman for Local Care Direct, which runs the facility, said: 'We treat any incident reported to us very seriously and although we have not received a formal complaint about this matter, we are grateful it has been raised and have launched an immediate investigation to establish what happened. 'We would be pleased to discuss this with the patient if they contact us directly.' She said if the investigation showed issues with the care provided, lessons would be learned.

chatgpt: A man from West Yorkshire was left helpless and stranded after being refused treatment at a walk-in centre. The incident occurred in Bradford, where 52-year-old Richard Shropshire, who had just collapsed, was informed that the centre was too busy to admit him. Mr Shropshire, who is a resident of Keighley, had earlier contacted NHS Direct via phone seeking medical advice. He was then directed to visit the walk-in centre for treatment, which he did. Upon arriving, he was informed by staff at the centre that he would have to wait for a long period, as they were already overwhelmed with patients. Due to feeling unwell, Mr Shropshire decided to rest in the centre while waiting for his turn. Unfortunately, he collapsed in the waiting room and became unconscious. This prompted other patients in the room to try and revive him, and soon after, a call was made to NHS Direct asking for an ambulance to be sent immediately. It is alleged that Mr Shropshire was refused an ambulance on the grounds that he had already visited the walk-in centre and should have received treatment there. This made things worse, as the medical staff at the centre were unable to offer any assistance due to long queues, leaving him in a dire situation without any assistance. According to Mr Shropshire, the ambulance service provided by the NHS Direct was extremely unhelpful- a portrayal strongly disputed by the organisation responsible. He expressed his frustrations regarding the lack of urgency by the NHS, stating that he was left stranded for hours. "The service was absolutely pathetic. It took them approximately five hours to get me the help I needed. I feel let down by the NHS," said Mr Shropshire. He was then taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was admitted for observation. He is currently at home, recovering, and spoke about his ordeal to highlight issues within the NHS. A spokesperson for NHS Direct, responding to the allegations, said that while they could not discuss individual cases, they strongly refuted suggestions that NHS staff were in any way unhelpful, saying: "We take all complaints seriously and investigate them fully. However, we would like to emphasise that NHS Direct is staffed by fully trained professionals who work hard to provide high-quality service to all patients." Mr Shropshire’s unfortunate experience is a reminder of the long queues and waiting times that patients are often subjected to in the National Health Service. The incident also highlights the need for emergency response and ambulance services that are more responsive and adaptable to critical situations.
