article: A mother has told of her three-day ordeal with her daughter when they became lost in the middle of the Australian Outback, saying they had to survive on leaves from gum trees and lit fires from an aerosol can. Tammy Reiss, 41, and Karlee-May Durnan, 16, had to continue their journey from Haasts Bluff to Alice Springs on foot after their four-wheel-drive became stuck as they tried to cross a body of water. They were 40 kilometres from their starting point and 200km west of their destination. Tammy Reiss, 41, and Karlee-May Durnan, 16, had to continue their journey from Haasts Bluff to Alice Springs on foot after their four-wheel-drive became stuck . The pair were driving to Alice Springs so Karlee-May could catch a flight back to Queensland and return to school after the holidays. Northern Territory police raised the alarm on January 9 when they had not been heard from after two days. But drawing from her Girl Guides training, Ms Reiss and Karlee-May survived the 10-kilometre hike from their stranded vehicle by sipping water off gum leaves and finding an aerosol can on the side of the road to light their fires at night. The mother was a Girl Guide and used that experience to survive, drinking water off gum leaves . The mother told NT News she and her daughter got little shut-eye on the first night as they were 'petrified by the dark'. 'But as soon as daylight came through [after the first night] I said to Karlee "Right, go and get that deodorant", and she replied with "Mum you’re never going to light a fire",' Ms Reiss said. 'I said "mate, I’m a Girl Guide from way back" - and I sprayed the can and lit it.' But Ms Reiss advised people against lighting a fire in this fashion as 'they could blow their heads off'. Adding to their terror, the pair said a wild bull started tracking them for about three kilometres of their trek. 'By this stage we had a huge bull that was following us, zig-zagging back and forth across the road and occasionally letting out a loud "moo",' Ms Reiss said. As for keeping their energy up, they came pretty close to eating bugs if they had not been found on the third day of their trek. 'There is sugar on gum leaves so we got some energy from that, but if worse came to worse we would have been eating the grasshoppers.' The mother and daughter were saved when a stranger drove past them when they had walked 10 kilometres from their 4WD. They were taken to Glen Helen Resort, 138 kilometres west of Alice Springs, where they enjoyed their first meal in three days and two nights - a steaming hot, homemade pizza. The pair went missing after they left Haasts Bluff - almost 230 kilometres west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory .

chatgpt: Two women who were stranded in the Australian Outback after their car got stuck on a remote dirt road have been found after surviving for three days with nothing but their wits and some survival skills. Tammy Reiss, 30, and Karlee-May Durnan, 27, got caught out when their car became bogged down on a dirt track towards Alice Springs from Haasts Bluff in the Northern Territory. The pair decided to abandon the car and set out on foot towards Alice Springs. They walked for 10 kilometers through tough terrain under extreme weather conditions. Despite being lost and stranded without supplies, the two women managed to stay alive for three days. Ms. Reiss drew from her training as a member of the Girl Guides to help them survive. She said that she had learned survival skills including how to find water, shelter, and food. Ms. Reiss said that they lit fires to keep warm during the cold nights, and that they found sustenance from gum leaves. When they were found by a police search party, they were dehydrated and their feet were blistered, but otherwise unharmed. The two women were flown to Alice Springs for medical treatment. The incident serves as a cautionary tale for those who plan to venture out into remote areas without adequate planning, preparation, and supplies. Experts say that it is important to carry water, food, and clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and to let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return. NT Police told the media that the area where the women were stranded is a "very remote and harsh environment", and that it was fortunate that they were found before their situation became more serious. The search for the women was conducted by the NT Police and a helicopter crew from the Western Australian Police. The use of helicopters in rescues is becoming increasingly common in the Outback, where the vast distances and harsh terrain make ground transport difficult. The Australian Outback is known for its unique and harsh environment, with temperatures often exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in the summer months. The terrain is rugged and unforgiving, and it is common for those who venture into the Outback unprepared to become lost or stranded. In conclusion, the story of Tammy Reiss and Karlee-May Durnan serves as a reminder of the importance of being prepared when venturing into harsh and remote environments. The two women were fortunate to have survived their ordeal, and their story should serve as a cautionary tale for others who may be tempted to venture off the beaten track without adequate planning and preparation.
