article: (CNN) -- Everyone -- and we mean everyone -- puts their proverbial best foot forward online. And why shouldn't they? They say that first impressions are everything, and in today's screen-welded-to-your-face age, you may not even be present when someone first makes your acquaintance. A Facebook photo, blog post, or tweet is as good as a handshake. But that handshake that seemed so firm and reassuring online? Yeah, it could be limp as hell in real life. It's probably pretty safe to say that we've all been intrigued by someone's online presence at one time or another: a cute mutual friend on Facebook, a blogger with a particularly attractive headshot, a minor celebrity with a penchant for oversharing. Some of us may have even struck up relationships with said objects of affection, trading e-mails, texts and phone calls into the night -- forming attachments with people we've never, essentially, met.

So how should you prepare to take an onscreen relationship off? To supply you with the necessary tools, we turned to the experts: Nev Schulman and filmmaker Max Joseph, from MTV's new reality series, "Catfish: The TV Show." "Catfish" (airing on Monday nights at 11 p.m. ET/PT), is based on the documentary by the same name. In the movie, Schulman meets and falls in love with a woman online who is not exactly (or at all) who she says she is. After the release of the film, thousands of people turned to him and asked if he would help them meet their online beaux IRL. Here are some of the lessons Schulman and Joseph have learned along the way. 1. Ask to Skype or video chat before meeting . "If the person is hesitant or reluctant, reconsider meeting," Joseph says. 2. Don't be scared to stalk . "Spend a good two hours looking the person up on Facebook, Google, Myspace, and Instagram. It's not spying, it's virtual contraception." Joseph says you may want to reconsider if: . -- They have fewer than 100 friends on Facebook, . -- They are a model-slash-something else incredible (e.g. model/doctor) -- None of their photos are tagged . -- They are talking primarily to a ton of other guys or girls who don't seem to know them personally . 3. Dress down . "You would be shocked how casual people tend to be when meeting their online crushes and you don't wanna feel awkwardly overdressed," Schulman says. 4. Don't do it at your home . "The last thing you want is some stranger knowing where you live," he says. 5. Have an activity planned . "Sitting across from somebody for coffee or dinner can get real awkward real fast. Better to make it a social event and go bowling or something," Schulman suggests. 6. Bring a friend and an open mind . "You never how things will go down," Joseph notes.

chatgpt: The creators of the popular MTV show "Catfish" are warning viewers to play it safe when it comes to meeting online acquaintances in the real world. The show, which is based on a 2010 documentary of the same name, follows people who have been in online relationships with individuals they have never met in person, as they finally come together to see if their virtual connections can survive in the real world. The show's hosts, Nev Schulman and Kamie Crawford, have seen countless instances where people's online crushes turn out to be completely different to who they claim to be. They advise that while it can be exciting to finally meet someone who you have been talking to online, it's important to take precautions to ensure your safety. One of the most important pieces of advice that the hosts give is to "stalk" your online acquaintance before meeting them in person. This may sound extreme, but it's crucial to gather as much information as possible to ensure that the person is who they say they are. Schulman suggests doing a quick Google search and checking out their social media profiles to get a better idea of who they are and what kind of person they appear to be. Another tip is to never meet someone for the first time at your home. In fact, Schulman advises against even divulging your full address until you feel fully comfortable with the person. Instead, try to pick a public location, such as a coffee shop or restaurant, where there will be plenty of other people around. And if you're still feeling unsure about meeting your online crush, bring a friend along for the ride. Schulman and Crawford often recommend bringing a trusted friend or family member with you to a first meeting, not only for safety reasons but also to help ease any potential nerves. It's important to remember that people often aren't what they seem from behind a computer screen. "Catfish" has documented countless cases where individuals have pretended to be someone they're not, often for nefarious reasons. This is why it's so important to take safety precautions when meeting someone for the first time. Despite the risks, the show has also documented some heartwarming success stories. Couples who have been talking online for years but were too scared to meet in person finally take the leap and their relationships thrive. It's a reminder that online connections can be just as real as in-person ones, but that it's crucial to approach them with caution. In the end, the key message from "Catfish" is to be safe and smart when it comes to meeting online acquaintances in person. By following some basic precautions, you can avoid potentially dangerous situations and ensure that your virtual connections have the best chance at turning into meaningful relationships in the real world.
