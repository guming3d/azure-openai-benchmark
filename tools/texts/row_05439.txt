article: By . MailOnline Reporter . A New Jersey man who sparked controversy among his neighbors for flying a flag that is now associated with the jihadist group Islamic State says the whole thing has been a big misunderstanding. Mark Dunaway, of Garwood, says he's been flying the flag most Fridays and during the holy month of Ramadan for 10 years, since long before ISIS militants adopted the symbol as their own. For Dunaway, the flag — which says in Arabic, 'There is only one god, Allah, and the prophet Muhammad is his messenger' — is just a symbol of his faith. 'Every Muslim uses that black flag,' Dunway, 44, told NJ.com. 'You'll find it in any mosque in world. 'I am an American citizen and I love my country,  but I am also a Muslim and I use that flag to say I’m a Muslim.' Mr Dunaway has been flying this flag outside his Garwood, New Jersey, home for years. His neighbors recently noticed it and thought Dunaway was supporting ISIS jihadists . Kashmiri demonstrators hold up a flag of the Islamic State during a demonstration against Israeli military operations in Gaza. Although the group adopted the flag, it has long been a symbol of Islam and is was not historically associated with terrorist groups . The controversy began on Tuesday when investment manager Marc Leibowitz tweeted a photo of the flag and commented: 'Scary!' 'Jihadists are now in Garwood,' wrote one commenter on the photo. 'I think it's not right at this time to be flying that type of flag,' local resident James McHugh told News 12. 'Especially with what's going on at this time.' Neighbor Diana Figueiredo says Dunaway and his flag are harmless — but she does worry about the people making a stink out of the situation. 'He goes to work every day, he never bothers anyone, he keeps to . himself,' she told NJ.com. 'I'm more . concerned about the crazy people saying they're going to retaliate and . set his house on fire,' she added. 'They're the extremists.' Dunaway has since voluntarily removed his flag. 'If people are that offended by it, it is censorship," he told News 12. 'But I might not have to fly it for a while. Maybe one day I'll be able to fly it again.'

chatgpt: After receiving complaints from his neighbors, Mark Dunaway, a resident of a small town in Georgia, voluntarily removed a black flag with Arabic writing from his property. The flag had caused concern among his neighbors who thought that he was displaying support for the Islamic State militant group. Dunaway, a 44-year-old employee of a local warehouse, has been flying the flag for the past 10 years. He said that the flag had nothing to do with the Islamic State but was intended to represent his love for Arabic calligraphy. The flag had been a gift from a friend who had brought it back from a trip to Saudi Arabia. "I understand why people might mistake it for the Islamic State flag, but that was never my intention," Dunaway said. "I just liked the way it looked, and I wanted to display it on my property." Neighbors, who were concerned about the flag's symbolism, reportedly contacted the local police and the FBI. However, after interviewing Dunaway and inspecting his property, authorities confirmed that the flag did not pose any threat. "We received reports from concerned citizens about a possible connection between Mr. Dunaway's flag and the Islamic State. However, our investigation concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that he was affiliated with any extremist group," said a spokesperson for the local police. Despite the authorities' assurance, Dunaway decided to remove the flag, citing the potential harm that it could cause to his family and his community. Dunaway acknowledged that he hadn't been aware of the negative connotations associated with the flag when he had first put it up. "I didn't think much of it when I first received it as a gift, but I understand now that it can be interpreted in a negative way. I don't want to cause any harm to my community, and I am sorry if I have," said Dunaway. The incident highlights the complexities of cultural symbols and the need for context to understand their meanings. While some may interpret the flag as a symbol of terrorism, others may see it as a nod to Arabic calligraphy. In the end, Dunaway's decision to remove the flag shows that he values his community's safety and well-being above his personal preferences.
