article: (CNN) -- Thailand and Cambodia have called for dialogue as tensions continued to escalate over an ancient border temple on disputed land. Cambodian soldiers stand guard near Preah Vihear temple, close to the Thai border. The countries agreed to meet Monday even as each side deployed more troops to the site of the Preah Vihear temple, the national Thai News Agency reported Thursday. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962, but the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Last week, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- places the U.N. says have outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing.  Watch Thai villagers block anti-government demonstrators Â» . A Thai court overturned the pact, prompting the resignation of Thailand's foreign minister, Noppadon Pattama. He had endorsed the application. Cambodia, meanwhile, is preparing for general elections on July 27. And Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since the mid-1980s, has portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph. The current flare-up began Tuesday, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the trio refused to leave the territory, the Thai News Agency said. The Cambodian state-run news agency, AKP, said that Thailand sent troops to retrieve the men and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies the charge, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory. The standoff continued Thursday, with each side asking troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon, the news agencies said. Thailand has put its Air Force on standby to evacuate its nationals from Cambodia if tensions worsen, TNA said. So far, the only casualty has been a Thai soldier who was injured Tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the Khmer Rouge occupied the area. The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, won power through a guerrilla war. It is remembered for the deaths of as many as 1.5 million Cambodians.

chatgpt: Tensions between Cambodia and Thailand have once again escalated as both sides continue to deploy more troops to the Preah Vihear temple. The 11th-century temple holds great historical significance for both countries and has been at the center of a long-standing territorial dispute. While the International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962, Thailand has refused to accept the ruling and still lays claim to the site. This has led to several conflicts over the years, with both countries deploying troops and engaging in skirmishes near the temple. The current row began when Cambodia briefly held three Thai soldiers who had crossed into the area. Thailand responded by sending in more troops and demanding the release of their soldiers. The situation soon escalated as both countries continued to deploy more troops and engage in standoffs near the temple. In an effort to defuse the situation, representatives from both countries agreed to meet and discuss the issue. The meeting, which took place on Monday, was held in a cordial atmosphere and both sides expressed their desire to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. "We hope that both Cambodia and Thailand can find a peaceful solution to the issue of the Preah Vihear temple," said Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn. "We want to avoid any further escalation of tensions and work towards resolving this long-standing dispute." His Thai counterpart, Don Pramudwinai, echoed these sentiments, saying that Thailand also wanted to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. "We are here to listen to each other's concerns and find a way forward that is fair and equitable for both countries," he said. Despite the positive tone of the meeting, analysts remain skeptical about whether any real progress can be made towards a lasting solution. The territorial dispute over the Preah Vihear temple has been ongoing for decades and remains a deeply emotive issue for both countries. With both sides continuing to deploy more troops to the area, there are concerns that the situation could escalate further. The international community has called on Cambodia and Thailand to exercise restraint and work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict. As for the three Thai soldiers who were briefly held by Cambodia, they were released unharmed and have returned to Thailand. However, the incident has once again highlighted the fragile nature of the relationship between the two countries and the need for a long-term solution to the conflict over the Preah Vihear temple.
