article: (CNN) -- An international judge has resigned from the special court set up in Cambodia to try people accused of committing atrocities under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, saying his Cambodian counterpart was obstructing efforts to investigate cases. The resignation by Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, announced Monday, is the second departure of an international judge from the court in the past six months amid tensions with local officials. His predecessor, Siegfried Blunk, resigned as international co-investigating judge in October, complaining that statements by Cambodian government ministers about two of the court's cases threatened to undermine proceedings. Those same two cases, known as Cases 003 and 004, are at the heart of the dispute between Kasper-Ansermet and You Bunleng, the national co-investigating judge for the court. "Judge You Bunleng's active opposition to investigations into Cases 003 and 004 has led to a dysfunctional situation," Kasper-Ansermet said in a statement attributed to him on the court's website. Prosecutors for the court filed submissions in September 2009 asking the judges to begin investigating five people, whose names have not been disclosed publicly. The submissions were divided into Cases 003 and 004. Based on a French concept, the two investigating judges of the court, one international and one Cambodian, are responsible for collecting evidence to decide whether people charged by prosecutors should be brought to trial. Kasper-Ansermet, a Swiss citizen, said You Bunleng had "constantly contested" his authority to investigate the two cases. He said You Bunleng had refused to discuss the cases with him during an informal meeting and had also issued written orders to him demanding that he immediately cease his "unlawful activity." Kasper-Ansermet "considers that the present circumstances no longer allow him to properly and freely perform his duties," according to the statement, which said his resignation will take effect May 4. You Bunleng was not immediately available for comment on the matter. The tribunal, known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, began its work in 2007 after a decade of on-and-off negotiations between the United Nations and Cambodia over the structure and functioning of the court. In 2010, it issued its first verdict, convicting Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known by his alias, Duch, of war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. Opening statements in the court's second trial, Case 002, began in November. In that trial, four former Khmer Rouge government ministers face charges of crimes against humanity and genocide.

chatgpt: In the latest blow to Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge tribunal, two international judges have resigned in the past 6 months, both citing difficulties with Cambodian officials. The two judges, Laurent Kasper-Ansermet and Mark Harmon, have complained about the lack of action against the Cambodian officials who have attempted to stall or obstruct investigations into two cases that are yet to come to trial. The Khmer Rouge tribunal was established to try senior leaders and those most responsible for the serious crimes committed under the Khmer Rouge regime, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. The regime was responsible for the deaths of over 1.7 million people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more. The tribunal has been plagued by difficulties since its inception, including allegations of corruption and interference from the Cambodian government. Both Kasper-Ansermet and Harmon were appointed to the tribunal to address these concerns and ensure the court operates fairly and independently. Kasper-Ansermet, a Swiss judge, resigned in May of this year, citing “systematic” attempts by Cambodian officials to undermine efforts by the international judges to investigate and prosecute cases. He claimed that the Cambodian officials in question had worked to bar foreign lawyers and limit the scope of investigations by the international judges.  Similarly, Harmon, an American judge, resigned in September, citing political interference in the tribunal’s work. In his resignation letter, Harmon stated that certain Cambodian officials had engaged in a campaign of “sustained, orchestrated and vicious attacks” on both him and his colleague. He claims that these attacks were intended to undermine the integrity of the tribunal and its ability to hold those responsible for the crimes committed under the Khmer Rouge to account. The two cases at the centre of the judges’ resignations are yet to come to trial. One involves the former Khmer Rouge navy commander, Meas Muth, who is accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The other involves Khieu Samphan, a former Khmer Rouge head of state, who is accused of genocide and crimes against humanity. Despite the resignations, the tribunal has made some progress in recent months. Earlier this year, the tribunal found two senior Khmer Rouge officials guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced them to life in prison. However, the resignations of Kasper-Ansermet and Harmon have raised concerns about the court's ability to carry out future investigations and prosecute those responsible for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge. The resignations have also led to renewed calls for reform of the tribunal to ensure that it remains both independent and effective. Many human rights groups have called on the Cambodian government to take action to address the judges’ concerns, and to make changes to the tribunal’s structure to ensure that it operates fairly and transparently, and is not subject to political interference. The tribunal is facing significant challenges, but it remains an important symbol of justice for the victims of the Khmer Rouge’s atrocities. The resignations of Kasper-Ansermet and Harmon are a warning of the serious difficulties the tribunal faces in carrying out its work, but the international community must continue to support the court and hold those responsible for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge to account.
