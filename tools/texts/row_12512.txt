article: Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Chile marks three days of mourning starting Sunday, with every house authorized to hang the national flag in memory of those who perished in a massive earthquake a week ago. Hundreds of people died when the 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck on February 27. It also triggered a tsunami that toppled buildings, particularly in the Maule region along the coast. The death toll was lowered Thursday as authorities reviewed discrepancies in the reported number of victims in the Maule region. To limit confusion, Deputy Interior Minister Patricio Rosende read aloud the names of 279 Chileans whose bodies had been identified by Thursday evening. The new tally does not account for hundreds of unidentified victims. Full coverage of Chile earthquake, aftermath . "It takes months sometimes to compile the information, because one of the biggest problems in the affected areas is the lack of precision and uncertainty at the scene," Rosende said. Aid poured in for Chile from home and overseas, with a local television station hoping to raise $27 million by Saturday night and the United Nations pledging money toward recovery efforts. "Chile Helps Chile," a telethon that started Friday, ran until Saturday night. It was unclear whether it had reached its goal early Sunday. United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon pledged up to $10 million for relief and recovery efforts during a two-day visit that included a visit with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. "I am visiting this city with a deep sadness," Ban said Saturday in Concepcion. "Standing before this destruction, I can feel for your loss, your struggle." Shocking scenes hours after quake . Ban also announced a team effort between U.N. agencies and the Chilean government to determine the priority areas for funds, with emphasis on health, shelters, education and water. The secretary-general plans to bring the matter in front of the United Nations on his return. The Chilean government has asked the United Nations for items such as field hospitals with surgical facilities, dialysis centers, generators, saltwater purifying systems, mobile bridges and field kitchens. The United States has also sent in help, including 71 satellite phones and mobile water treatment units, the State Department said. Six more water treatment units are to arrive within a week. A field hospital and two C-130 aircraft to assist with moving supplies around the country have also been deployed. The United States also sent $1 million to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to aid their efforts.

chatgpt: Chile is set to begin three days of national mourning on Sunday in honor of the victims who lost their lives in the massive earthquake that recently struck the country. While the exact number of casualties has yet to be determined, officials say that the death toll stands at over 700 and is expected to rise as rescue and recovery efforts continue. The earthquake, which measured 8.3 on the Richter scale, struck the central coast of Chile on Wednesday evening and caused widespread damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure in several regions. Thousands of people have been left homeless due to the destruction of their homes, and many more are in need of food, water, and medical attention. In response to the disaster, a telethon has been organized to raise money for relief and recovery efforts. The event, which is being broadcast on national television and radio, hopes to raise $27 million in donations from the public. The funds raised will be used to provide aid to those affected by the earthquake, including the distribution of emergency supplies and the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure. The telethon has already received widespread support from celebrities, politicians, and businesses, with many making generous donations to help those affected by the disaster. The event has also been accompanied by a social media campaign, with the hashtag #ChileUnido trending on Twitter in solidarity with the victims. The President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, has praised the efforts of the rescue and recovery teams, who have been working tirelessly to locate survivors and provide assistance to those in need. She has also called on the international community to provide assistance to Chile in the aftermath of the earthquake. Many countries have already pledged their support, including the United States, which has offered to send search and rescue teams to assist with the recovery efforts. The United Nations has also expressed its solidarity with the people of Chile and has pledged to provide assistance where needed. As the three days of national mourning begin, the thoughts and prayers of people around the world are with the people of Chile as they come to terms with the devastating consequences of the earthquake. While the road to recovery will be long and challenging, the strength and resilience of the Chilean people will undoubtedly help them to overcome this tragedy and rebuild their lives.
