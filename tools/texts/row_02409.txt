If you happened to have walked through Cambridge recently, you may have noticed something strange occurring to the pathways. In particular, a stretch between the city centre and the Grafton Centre seems to be shining in dark with a peculiar blue glow. Aliens, however, haven’t landed. Instead, scientists from Surrey have decided to spray the pathway with something called ‘Starpath’. Scroll down for video . A spray-on coating that makes ordinary pathways glow in the dark could replace street lighting in the future, according to Surrey-based Pro-Teq Surfacing . Starpath is a luminescent, rain-resistant coating that aims to replace street lights throughout the UK. The coating is applied in three layers, with a middle aggregate stage that absorbs UV energy during the day, which is then released as a blue glow when it's dark. The system uses polyurethane base and a polyaspartic topcoat that seals the whole thing together. According to the Pro-Teq Surfacing, the company behind the technology, it can be applied to almost any solid surface including tarmac, concrete and wood. A path across Christ's Pieces in Cambridge which glows in the dark is the first of its kind in the world. The illumination comes from ultraviolet particles in the pavement at the Cambridge beauty spot which absorb energy during the day and release it as light overnight . Starpath reacts to varying levels of light. If the sky is lighter, such as on the left, it won’t release as much luminosity. At night (right) it glows brighter. 'It’s almost like it has a mind of its own,' said Hamish Scott . Unlike those glow in the dark stars you used to stick on your walls, Starpath reacts to varying levels of ambient light. ‘This product adjusts to the natural light, so if it is pitch black outside the luminous natural earth enhances,’ said Hamish Scott, owner of Pro-Teq Surfacing. ‘If the sky is lighter, it won’t release as much luminosity – it adjusts accordingly, it’s almost like it has a mind of its own.’ Reports suggest the group could begin to use different colours in order to create a cycle lane during the night. While the technology is currently being trailed at Christ's Pieces in Cambridge, the council sad they are now considering using the path elsewhere in the city. With some councils turning off lights at night, Pro-Teq claims Starpath could be a viable, low-maintenance alternative to keep people safe in the dark. The Cambridge pathway measures 150 square metres and took only 30 minutes to spray the material on. The surface was ready for use less than four hours after the job commenced .

chatgpt: A new type of road surface technology is being trialled in Christ's Pieces, Cambridge. The technology is called Starpath coating and it has three layers. The middle layer is capable of absorbing sunlight during the day, and at night it releases a gentle glow that changes in intensity as the sky gets lighter. The idea behind Starpath coating is to make roads safer and more environmentally-friendly. By using the middle layer to absorb sunlight during the day, the road surface can gradually release this energy without the need for external lighting. This not only reduces the amount of energy required to light up roads at night but also lowers the amount of light pollution caused by traditional streetlights. The specific trial site for Starpath coating in Christ's Pieces is a pedestrian pathway that links Park Terrace with Christ's Pieces park. Initially, the road markings have been coated with Starpath coating. The coating has been applied using a special spray gun, which can apply a seamless layer of the coating without the need for any specialist equipment.  The coating takes about 30 minutes to dry and is responsive to how much light it is exposed to. When it is dark, the glow is brightest, and when there is more light in the sky, the intensity of the glow decreases accordingly.  The Starpath coating has been developed by a UK-based company called Pro-Teq. Founder Hamish Scott first came up with the idea in 2009 during a walk through a local park with his daughter. He observed that the park was poorly lit, which made it difficult for his daughter to see where she was walking. Scott experimented with different coatings and eventually came up with Starpath. The coating has already been used on a number of high-profile sites in the UK, including the National Trust property, Tintagel Castle. In addition, Starpath coating has also been used on the towpath of the Lancaster Canal and in parts of the Olympic Park in London. According to Pro-Teq, the coating is both durable and easy to install. They claim it can last up to 10 years and it is flexible enough to be applied to a range of surfaces, including concrete, asphalt, and tarmac. However, some experts have warned that the coating may have limitations. Professor Peter King, an expert in transport engineering at the University of Bath, has pointed out that the coating may be less effective in areas with high levels of light pollution. In addition, he has questioned whether the coating would be durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of vehicles on busy roads. Despite these concerns, there is no doubt that Starpath coating is a potentially exciting development in road surface technology. With its ability to absorb sunlight and release it at night, it offers a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly solution to traditional street lighting. If the trial in Christ's Pieces is a success, we may see more and more roads and pathways using this innovative coating in the future.
