Gobsmacked: Jamie O'Connell had to look twice after spotting the obscene hand gesture in the sky . The National Lottery's 'It Could Be You' advertising campaign was one of the most recognisable of its time, where a cloud formed the shape of a hand and pointed to an unsuspecting winner. The cloud's over Fort William in Scotland came up with their own take on the idea, when they formed the shape of a hand and made the sort of gesture that suggested its photographer, Jamie O'Connell, probably need not bother buying a ticket this week. Mr O’Connell was walking his dog along the Caledonian Canal near Neptune’s Staircase when the cloud well and truly gave him the finger. The 23-year-old had to look twice to make sure he wasn’t imagining the rude hand gesture. Mr O'Connell, an offshore steward, said: 'I was just walking the dog when I looked up and saw this cloud. 'I was absolutely gobsmacked. I had to double look at it, and I nearly wet myself. 'A lot of people have said it might be a sign - I must have annoyed someone!' The cloud, which broke through a rainy sky, has become a viral sensation since being Mr O'Connell posted it online. It's you: Daniel O'Connell was amazed when he spotted this offensive cloud formation in the skies above Fort William . He said: 'It’s so lifelike, it’s hard to believe it’s actually a cloud. It really looks like someone swearing, the detail is unbelievable. 'I think I’ve seen clouds that look a bit like dinosaurs in the past, but no-one has ever flipped off at me through the sky.' He is now keeping a close eye on the clouds in the hope he will be able to spot other lifelike figures. He added: 'I’ve always wanted to see Mufassa from The Lion King. He’s been my favourite film character since I was younger. It’s the best film of all time.'

chatgpt: A man from Scotland has gone viral on social media after capturing a peculiar sight in the sky above Fort William. Jamie O'Connell, the man in question, was out for a walk when he noticed a cloud formation of what he believed to be an obscene gesture. O'Connell quickly took a picture of the cloud and shared it on social media, where it quickly gained traction. The image, which has been shared thousands of times on social media, has garnered mixed reactions. Some people found the cloud formation amusing, while others found it inappropriate. Regardless, O'Connell said he was "absolutely gobsmacked" by the attention his picture received. Now, O'Connell hopes to spot another figure in the clouds: Mufasa from the beloved animated film The Lion King. "It would be cool to see something like that in the clouds," O'Connell said. "I'm going to keep looking up and see what I can find." While some may dismiss O'Connell's search for Mufasa as a silly hobby, there is a scientific explanation for seeing shapes and figures in the clouds. Pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon, refers to the tendency of the human brain to perceive familiar figures and patterns in otherwise random stimuli, such as cloud formations. It is not uncommon for people to see animals, faces, or other recognizable objects in clouds, and some even take the hobby of cloud-watching quite seriously. Regardless of his motivations, O'Connell's picture of the obscene gesture in the clouds has gone viral, spreading smiles and laughter across the internet. People are fascinated by the coincidence of the clouds' formation, and many are finding humor in the situation. For now, though, O'Connell continues his search for Mufasa, gazing up at the clouds in the hope of spotting the animated lion. Whether or not he succeeds, his original picture has already made a lasting impression on the internet.
