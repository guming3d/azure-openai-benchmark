article: (CNN) -- The PlayStation Vita is extending its reach into video and voice calling with the release of a Skype app for the mobile gaming device. The free app is expected to be available through the PlayStation store Tuesday in North America and Wednesday in Europe and Asia. It will work for both the Vita's 3G and Wi-Fi only models. The Skype app will use the Vita's front and rear cameras for video calling. The app will also run in "background mode," so users can pause a game, and then take a call. There is no functionality at this time to continue playing a game while taking a call. Since it runs in "background mode," Skype will also alert users to calls when the Vita is in sleep mode. No word yet on how it will affect the device's five to six hours of battery time. On the Skype blog, legendary gamer Fatal1ty (Johnathan Wendel) shows off the features of the new app. The PS Vita already has voice chat and text chat through its built-in Party application. However, developer Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, told CNN in February that there were restrictions to that voice chat by broadband providers (only one person can be on a 3G connection). "The Vita isn't a phone," he said. It appears that the Skype app may be trying to change that. Do gamers really want to be bothered during a "Unit 13" gun battle by a call from a friend? Or is this a partial admission by Sony that a dedicated games-only device may not be what users want?

chatgpt: PlayStation Vita users in North America are in for a treat as Skype's video calling app becomes available on the PlayStation store starting from Tuesday. The Skype app will enable users to make video calls and take advantage of the Vita's front and rear cameras. The app brings another layer of communication to the Vita's Party application, which already offers voice chat and text functions. The app has been widely anticipated since it was first announced in October 2013. The Skype app for PlayStation Vita can be downloaded free of cost from the PlayStation Store. Users will require a reliable Wi-Fi connection to use the app for video calling. This means users will need to be in range of a Wi-Fi signal, such as in their homes or at public hotspots, to use the service. The Skype app for the Vita will also allow users to make voice only calls, making it a versatile tool for communication on the go. The app is not only useful for personal communication, but it can also be used for business purposes, enabling Vita users to make video conference calls. The launch of the Skype app for the PlayStation Vita is a major development. It will enable Vita users to stay in touch with friends, family and business associates while on the move. With the ability to make video calls using the Vita's front and rear cameras, users can easily share their experiences in high definition. In conclusion, Sony's PlayStation Vita is now more than just a gaming device. The addition of Skype's app will transform it into a powerful communication tool that can be used for both personal and business communication. It is now a must-have for users that demand convenience, flexibility and high-quality communication capabilities.
