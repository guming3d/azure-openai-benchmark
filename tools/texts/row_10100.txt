Health chiefs are investigating after Darren Langabeer, 40, was told he could have been 'paralysed for life' by the botched diagnosis. Landscape gardener Darren was rushed to hospital in agony after allegedly being beaten up in broad daylight. Darren Langabeer, returned to hospital five days after they sent him home with pins and needles and numbness in his arms . He was given medical scans - and sent home after doctors told him he had a 'trapped nerve.' But Darren returned to hospital five days later with pins and needles and numbness in his arms. The father-of-three was told he had a broken neck and needed immediate treatment. Darren said: 'The doctor told me I could have been paralysed. They said I was lucky to be walking. 'They rushed me straight to the spinal unit in Cardiff and I had to have an operation to fix my neck. 'I’m only 40, and with a young family I was really scared to death. I could have been left in a wheelchair for the rest of my life - how would my family cope?' Darren said he was assaulted outside shops in his home town of Llanelli, near Swansea. He was rushed to Glangwili General Hospital in Carmarthen where he was treated and discharged just eight hours later. Darren, who is self-employed landscape gardener, carried on with his job until the pain became too much for him. When he returned to the hospital doctors realised their mistake and rushed him to a specialist spine unit in Cardiff. Darren spent a week recovering at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and has been told he cannot work or drive for at least three months. Mr Langabeer was treated at Glangwili General Hospital. Doctors failed to pick up from medical scans that he had a broken neck . He added: 'I carried on working because they thought it was a trapped nerve. I had days of absolute agony, I’d been carrying around lawn mowers and things. 'I’ve built my business up for three years, and I don’t know what will happen to it now, I don’t know how we’re going to manage if I can’t work.' Hywel Dda Local Health Board are now investigating why Darren was allowed to be sent home. A spokeswoman said: 'The health board cannot comment further at this time as a full investigation is ongoing.' A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman confirmed a man had been arrested in connection with the alleged assault.

chatgpt: A man was sent home from the hospital after being diagnosed with a "trapped nerve," only to return five days later with more serious symptoms. Darren had been experiencing pins and needles, as well as numbness in his arms, leading him to seek further medical attention. Upon his return, doctors discovered that Darren had actually suffered a broken neck, which had gone undiagnosed during his first visit. He was informed that he would be unable to work for a minimum of three months while he recovered. This incident has raised concerns about misdiagnosis and inadequate medical care. Despite Darren's presenting symptoms, he was not properly examined or diagnosed during his initial hospital visit. This could have resulted in long-term damage or even death, had he not returned to seek proper treatment. In a statement, the hospital acknowledged that mistakes had been made in Darren's case and pledged to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. They also extended their apologies to Darren and his family. Experts say that cases of misdiagnosis and inadequate medical care are unfortunately all too common in the healthcare industry. Patients are reminded to be vigilant about their own health and to seek a second opinion if they feel they are not receiving adequate care or attention. Darren's experience serves as a cautionary tale for others to speak up if something doesn't feel right. It is also a reminder that medical professionals must be diligent in their examinations and diagnoses, to ensure the best possible outcomes for their patients. For Darren, the road to recovery will be a long and difficult one. He now faces months of rest and rehabilitation to regain full mobility and function. His story is a sobering reminder of the importance of proper medical care and diagnosis, and of the need for patients to advocate for their own health and well-being.
