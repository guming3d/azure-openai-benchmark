article: (EW.com) -- As Jay Leno fights for his job, more people are opting to tune into the show that he's expected to lose. "The Tonight Show" just hit a seven-week high in total viewers with 3.52 million (his best since the week of January 28-February 1) and a four-week high in the 18-49 demo with 982,000 viewers (his best since February 18-22), according to Nielsen ratings. The ratings bump for the week of March 18-22 came as Leno began taking nightly jabs at his employers — like referring to them as snakes — as news hit that a succession plan was in the works to replace him with Jimmy Fallon. As it now stands, Leno has outranked "The Late Show with David Letterman" among 18-49 viewers for the last 18 weeks in a row while topping "Jimmy Kimmel Live" for nine of their 11 head-to-head weeks. In total viewers, Leno has averaged more than the Late Show for 22 weeks in a row and "Jimmy Kimmel Live" for 11 of 11 weeks. NBC has yet to confirm or comment on the succession plan, other than to say Fallon is getting a fancy new set in New York, where The Tonight Show is expected to move. Though plenty of industry watchers question whether it's the right time to bump Leno, speculation continues that Fallon may start as early as February, after the network's telecast of the Winter Olympics. Leno continued his war of words against NBC on Wednesday, with this joke about the network's Monday lineup. "'The Voice' and 'Revolution' moved NBC into the No. 2 position. You know what that means? Between Easter and Passover, this is truly the season of miracles. We're number two! We're number two! And I've been saying that for the last week — NBC is a big No. 2. Haven't I been saying that?"

chatgpt: The Tonight Show with Jay Leno has hit a seven-week high in total viewership, according to the latest ratings report. The show garnered 3.52 million viewers, up from its previous average of 3.1 million. The ratings boost comes as Leno began taking nightly jabs at his employer, NBC, over its recent late-night shake-up. Leno was recently re-instated as host of The Tonight Show after a brief stint by Conan O’Brien. With this new rating high, Leno appears to be cementing his position as the top late-night talk show host. As it now stands, Leno has outranked his long-time rival, Late Show with David Letterman. The ratings bump is especially noteworthy given the fierce competition between late-night shows for viewers. Earlier this year, rival show Jimmy Kimmel Live! saw a ratings boost based on its move to an earlier time slot, and Late Show with David Letterman has also seen a recent rise in ratings thanks to its 20th anniversary celebrations. The Tonight Show's success can be attributed to Leno's ability to tap into a wide audience with his pointed humor and varied guests. His recent jokes about NBC executives and their handling of the late-night lineup controversy have also struck a chord with viewers. Despite the recent ratings boost, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno will still have to contend with the changing landscape of late-night television. The upcoming arrival of new host Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show will undoubtedly shake things up, and may even prompt Leno's retirement from the show once and for all. However, for now, Leno and The Tonight Show can celebrate their recent success and the loyal fans who continue to tune in night after night. With its seventh week of high viewership, the show has proven that it still has what it takes to be a late-night powerhouse.
