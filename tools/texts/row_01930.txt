article: A company has developed tracking devices for towels that alert managers to the whereabouts of their linen at all times. The concept was initially designed to help keep an eye on linen as it left  hotels to be cleaned, but it is now proving a powerful preventative measure for robe raiders. The new technology may be bad news for opportunistic thieves, but it's good news for hoteliers who lose up to 20 per cent of their linen every month. Linen Tracking Technology has designed a chip that alert hotel managers to the whereabouts of their linen . Most losses are though wear and tear, but two per cent are through theft, estimates William Serbin, executive vice president of Linen Tracking Technology, the company behind the tracking chip. If you've  stolen a towel or robe from a hotel room, you are far from alone. A poll by myvouchercodes.co.uk found that 68 per cent of Britons cannot resist taking a towel or item of linen when they check out of a hotel. That number is set to plummet, as 2,000 hotels now use the tracking technology although William Serbin won't name which. He told MailOnline: 'Our properties like to remain anonymous. They benefit from the gained efficiency and don’t want to alarm guests that they have this technology.' He revealed while there are no UK hotels currently using the chips  they plan to enter the UK market as soon as they find a partner and gain a license. 2,000 hotels use radio frequency tracking in linen although company chief William Serbin won't name which . Linen Technology Tracking, a Miami-based company, has patented the chip  which, once inserted allows managers to real-time track each and every towel using UHF Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. A poll found 68% of Brits steal linen from hotels . The tiny chip send signals to antennae positioned at the hotel's entrance or exit, letting owners know if a towel has left the property. Towels are bendable, chips last up to 300 washes and tags can be read by sensors up to six feet away. As well as catching guests out, they are helpful for housekeeping if they want to find out when a towel has been removed from the wardrobe, so it can be restocked. William says, 'Our solution not only provides total inventory information, but provides additional data like dwell time, wash count and laundry reconciliation which assists properties become more efficient.' He estimates that, although each property is different, most save about $50,000 (£33,300) a year in lost linen. Although Linen Technology Tracking does not tell hoteliers the exact coordinates of a missing towel or robe, several thieves have successfully been  asked to return pilfered hotel property. 'It's been phenomenal,' William also told CNN. 'The chips create a lot of conversation. When my friends travel, they'll call and ask, 'Are you guys at my hotel?'

chatgpt: Linen Tracking Technology has been revolutionizing the hotel industry with its latest cutting-edge chip that allows hotels to track their linen and robes in real-time. Over 2,000 hotels have already adopted the technology, which uses radio frequency technology to track linens and robes across their facilities. The new technology is expected to put an end to the longstanding issue of towel theft, which has plagued the hotel industry for years. However, the company will not disclose which hotels are using the technology to maintain the privacy of their clients. According to Linen Tracking Technology, the primary aim of the chip is to monitor the whereabouts of their linen and robes. The hotel managers can use the chip to check if a particular set of linen or robe is in the laundry, in guest rooms or elsewhere. This information will enable hotels to track their linen usage more efficiently, ensuring it stays clean and hygienic. Towels thieves, who have been notorious in stealing hotel towels, may not be fined, but they are encouraged to return any stolen property. The company understands that some guests may inadvertently take the towels or robes once they leave the hotel room or pool area, and they want to avoid any issues with guests or visitors. The company believes that the technology is essential, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the virus spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, the tracking chip becomes paramount in preventing guests' exposure. Hotels have also welcomed the tracking technology as it helps them keep track of their inventory and curb any large-scale linen theft. Theft of robes and towels in some hotels was sometimes enough to warrant some staff members losing their jobs. Linen Tracking Technology has proven its worth, with its technology offering hotels the means to improve inventory management, reduce losses, and streamline operations. In 2019, studies estimated that hotels lose almost $2 billion per year to towel theft, and the new technology is a step in the right direction if the hotel industry is to address this major problem. With this technology, hotels can track their linen usage, from laundry to room delivery and guest usage. The device sends real-time information to the hotel management, allowing them to monitor the status of the hotel's linen inventory in real-time. This information will help predict usage patterns, which will help hotels improve their guest services while saving operational costs. In conclusion, Linen Tracking Technology has developed a revolutionary chip that allows hotels to track their linen and robes in real-time, easing their inventory management, and reducing losses due to towel theft. The company says that the technology is imperative during the COVID-19 pandemic and encourages guests to return any stolen property. While the technology is currently in use in over 2,000 hotels, the company will not disclose the identities of these hotels for clients' privacy.
