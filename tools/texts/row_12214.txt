During their time together Parker, 56, showered his fiance with other gifts including a $70,000 Porsche and a Weimaraner dog that cost $3,500 to train. Divorced Claude 'Jack' Parker III treated Kimberly Herbstritt, an employee at his Orlando eye center, to a $60,000 diamond engagement ring when he proposed in 2012 . Three months ago Herbstritt moved out of Parker's 5,400-square-foot home in Longwood, Florida, after breaking off their engagement. Last month he filed a lawsuit and is suing her for the return of not only the ring, Porsche and dog, but also his Keurig coffee maker, two ladders, a $400 flower arrangement and $2,350 worth of Christmas decorations and tablecloths from Pier 1. Herbstritt isn't willing to hand the gifts back and on Monday her attorney filed paperwork asking for the suit to be dismissed. She argues that Parker has provided nothing in writing to show that he owns the items. 'It's my stuff,' she told the Orlando Sentinel. Parker has refused to comment on the legal action, but according to the suit he wants the 31/2 diamond carats ring he gave Herbstritt when he proposed on her 47th birthday returned because he paid for it. Among the items that Parker and Herbstritt are fighting over is a Weimaraner dog, pictured, that he claims he paid $1,500 for and then invest another 43,500 on 'extensive training' According to his personal profile on his business' website, Parker enjoys boating, fishing, working out, and he has a special interest in fast exotic cars. According to the suit, the Porsche he bought Herbstritt this year is jointly registered in both their names. The father of two college age sons also says the dog he bought Herbstritt is worth $5,000 after he paid $1,500 and then invested another $3,500 on 'extensive training.' Parker divorced his wife in 2009, while Herbstritt started working at his clinic in 2008. According to the suit, the couple hadn't set a wedding date and Herbstritt left without advance warning when she moved out on September 16.

chatgpt: A legal battle is brewing between former lovers Claude 'Jack' Parker III and Kimberly Herbstritt. The couple had been engaged to be married, but now Parker is suing Herbstritt for the return of numerous gifts that he purchased for her during their relationship. The list includes some high-value items, such as a $70,000 Porsche, a $60,000 diamond engagement ring, and a Weimaraner dog that was trained at a cost of $3,500. In addition to these expensive gifts, the list also includes more humble items such as a coffee maker, ladders, and $2,350 worth of Christmas decorations and tablecloths from Pier 1. The total value of the gifts is estimated to be over $160,000. Parker claims that since the couple never got married, the gifts were given with the expectation that they would be returned if the relationship ended. Herbstritt, however, refuses to give back the items, and even asked for the case to be dismissed on Monday. Herbstritt's defense is that Parker has not provided sufficient proof that he owns the items in the first place. While it may seem strange that someone would need to prove ownership of gifts that they gave to another person, it is actually a common issue in legal disputes over gifts in relationships. Under the law, gifts are typically considered the property of the recipient. However, if a gift was clearly given with the expectation of it being returned under certain circumstances, such as if the relationship ended before marriage, then the giver may have a legal claim to the item. In Parker's case, it remains to be seen whether he can make a successful claim for the return of the gifts. He may need to provide evidence that he explicitly communicated to Herbstritt that the gifts were given with the expectation of return if the relationship ended before marriage. For Herbstritt, the case represents a potentially expensive legal battle. If Parker is successful in his claim, she may be required to return all of the gifts, including the Porsche and diamond ring. As for the coffee maker, ladders, and Christmas decorations, there is no word yet on whether they will also be subject to the lawsuit. But for now, it seems that this dispute over gifts in a failed relationship is headed to court.
