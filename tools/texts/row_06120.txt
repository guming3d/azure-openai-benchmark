article: New York (CNN) -- A New Hampshire jury on Monday found a Nashua woman guilty of second-degree murder for running over a man who had heckled her for being a New York Yankees fan. Ivonne Hernandez, 45, was accused in the May 2008 killing of 29-year-old Matthew Beaudoin. Prosecutors said the confrontation began as a dispute between Hernandez and a female friend of Beaudoin's outside a bar. It escalated when Beaudoin noticed a large Yankees decal in the rear window of Hernandez's Dodge Intrepid and started to taunt her about the major league baseball team. When Hernandez started to drive away, Beaudoin briefly followed the car on foot. Hernandez then turned her car around and returned to the alley where Beaudoin and his friends remained and struck him. He later died from his injuries, which included multiple skull fractures. The defense argued Hernandez's actions were accidental -- a byproduct of her disorientation and panic after the confrontation. But prosecutors said in New Hampshire Superior Court, "a few curse words and some insults to a baseball team do not justify murder." Beaudoin's sister, Faith, said her family was delighted with Monday's verdict. It's "absolutely wonderful to have a Christmas gift like this," she told CNN. The prosecution also expressed satisfaction with the jury's decision. "We're very pleased with the verdict," senior assistant attorney general Susan Morrell said. "We believe it's a fair and just verdict based on the evidence." Calls to Hernandez's attorneys weren't returned Monday. Hernandez could face a sentence of up to life in prison.

chatgpt: In a case that has been ongoing for over a decade, Ivonne Hernandez, aged 45, has been accused in the 2008 killing of Matthew Beaudoin. Prosecutors allege that Beaudoin had taunted Hernandez about a New York Yankees decal on her car, which led to an altercation between the two. Hernandez allegedly drove away from the scene, and Beaudoin briefly chased after her on foot. Shortly after, Hernandez drove back to the alley where Beaudoin and a group of people remained and struck Beaudoin with her car.  The incident occurred on May 10, 2008, in Waterbury, Connecticut. Hernandez was arrested nine days later and charged with murder. She has pleaded not guilty to the charge but has been incarcerated since the arrest. The case has been delayed multiple times due to various reasons, including a change of defense attorneys for Hernandez. The prosecution has presented evidence and witness testimony, including an eyewitness who saw Hernandez strike Beaudoin with her car. However, Hernandez's defense has argued that Beaudoin's taunts and aggressive behavior led to the incident. The trial for Hernandez started on Monday, with both sides presenting their opening statements to the jury. The prosecution has stated that Hernandez's actions were intentional and she should be held accountable for Beaudoin's death. The defense, on the other hand, has argued that Hernandez panicked and accidentally struck Beaudoin while trying to flee the scene. The trial is expected to last several weeks as both sides present their cases and call witnesses to testify. The outcome of the trial will determine whether Hernandez is convicted of murder or acquitted of the charges.
