article: When foreign dignitaries spend private time with the Queen, protocol dictates they remain silent about their stay. Unfortunately that was not the case when New Zealand premier John Key and his family spent a weekend at Balmoral. No sooner had they left the Scottish retreat, than a picture was  released of Mr Key posing with a casual-looking Queen in her sitting room.

The room – complete with clashing carpet, rug and cushions – also  features a pot of silk flowers. Quick to reveal all about his visit, Mr Key said: ‘They were extremely generous hosts and we had a  fantastic weekend. ‘We were invited in as guests in their private family time.’ Prince . Philip rolled up his sleeves for a barbecue on Friday night, he said, . and the Queen gave him and his wife a tour in her Land Rover. ‘They . all pitched in. We helped lay the table.

His son Max went grouse shooting with Prince William, while his daughter Stephanie hiked with the Duchess of Cambridge. Even the notoriously snappy royal pets behaved well. ‘The corgis were everywhere. They were very friendly,’ Mr Key said.
