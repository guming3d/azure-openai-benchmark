article: (CNN) -- A Saudi court sentenced a female journalist Saturday to 60 lashes for her work on a controversial Arabic-language TV show that aired an episode in which a man bragged about his sex life, two sources told CNN. The court in Jeddah also imposed a two-year travel ban on Rosanna Al-Yami, according to a Saudi Information Ministry official, who could not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The ban prevents her from traveling outside Saudi Arabia. This official identified Al-Yami as a fixer, who helps journalists obtain stories, and a coordinator for Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., the network that aired "A Thick Red Line," a popular show on social taboos. On one episode, a Saudi man, Mazen Abdul Jawad, bragged about sex and got into trouble with Saudi authorities for his boasts. Abdul Jawad was put on trial and sentenced to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes. Suleiman Al-Jumeii, the attorney who represents Abdul Jawad, also confirmed the sentence against Al-Yami, saying he believes she is the first Saudi journalist ever to be sentenced to lashes. While the charges include involvement in preparing the program, she was not involved in setting up the episode in which Abdul Jawad appeared, the lawyer said. Al-Jumeii doesn't represent Al-Yami, but he said he is keeping tabs on all aspects of cases dealing with "A Thick Red Line." The lawyer is attempting to pursue an appeal for his client and get his case heard in a special court that deals only with media matters. CNN has attempted to get comments from Al-Yami and her attorney. Abdul Jawad, a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four, spoke openly about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14 on "A Thick Red Line." That episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where Shariah, or Islamic law, is practiced. Premarital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. Saudi authorities shut down the Lebanese network's offices in Jeddah and Riyadh after the interview aired a few months ago. Abdul Jawad was arrested shortly after the program aired and charged with violating Saudi Arabia's crime of publicizing vice.

chatgpt: Saudi journalist Rosanna Al-Yami was not involved in the production of a controversial TV episode that led to the imprisonment of a man who made sexual boasts, her lawyer has said. Al-Yami was working for the network that produced the show which explored topics that are considered taboo in Saudi Arabia. The man, whose identity has not been revealed, was sentenced to five years in prison after making explicit comments during a segment of the show. The episode had sparked outrage in the conservative kingdom, and authorities shut down the offices of the network in Jeddah and Riyadh after it aired. While Al-Yami did not play a role in setting up the episode, she came under fire on social media for her work at the network. Many criticized her for promoting topics that were considered inappropriate in Saudi society.  However, according to her lawyer, Al-Yami was simply a journalist doing her job, and had no control over the content of the show. He added that she had been caught up in a situation that was beyond her control. This incident highlights the challenges faced by journalists working in Saudi Arabia, where freedom of expression is severely restricted. The country has strict laws governing the media, and journalists can face imprisonment or other forms of punishment if they publish content that is deemed to be inappropriate or offensive. Al-Yami is not alone in facing such challenges. In recent years, a number of journalists and bloggers have been arrested and detained in Saudi Arabia, often on charges of insulting the ruling monarchy or inciting public unrest. While the Saudi government has made some efforts to relax its strict media laws in recent years, many believe that more needs to be done to protect the rights of journalists and promote freedom of expression in the country. In the meantime, Al-Yami remains in the public eye, with many questioning her role in promoting a show that tackled such sensitive topics. However, her lawyer insists that she is innocent and was simply doing her job as a journalist.
