article: Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- Africa's passenger airline industry may still be awaiting full take off but Boeing has identified the continent as a market ripe with potential. The U.S. company -- one of the world's biggest airplane manufacturers -- has found its order book filled with an increasing number of African clients in recent years. But with airlines based on the continent still only accounting for a fraction of overall air traffic between Africa and the rest of the world, the company's Vice President of Sales for Africa, Van Rex Gallard believes there remains plenty of room for further expansion. "Right now the African market for the airlines is quite small," he says. "African airlines only have around 2% of the total of revenues of the traffic between Africa and the rest of the world, so to me the potential is huge," he adds. The latent "potential" that Gallard refers to is confirmed by industry statistics and future passenger projections. According to research conducted by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in February 2011, Africa is now the second fastest growing region in the world in terms of commercial aviation, behind China. The Airbus Global Market Forecast published earlier this month meanwhile reported that sub-Saharan Africa alone will require at least 542 new aircraft by 2020 to meet rising passenger numbers. By providing the technology and expertise to meet these increased capacity requirements, Gallard believes that Boeing and the African airlines they provide for can jointly reap the benefits. "We have a lot of customers in Africa and this is actually a very exciting period," he says. "The numbers, if everything stays the way it is right now ... without the African airlines growing faster and the way they should, it would be around 800 airplanes for the next 20 years (and) worth around 100 billion dollars," he adds. Gallard cites airlines such as Nigeria's Arik Air -- which recently purchased two 747-8 Passenger Airplanes, Boeing's biggest passenger planes ---, Ethiopia Airlines, Kenya Airways and Rwanda Air as some of the companies striving to meet Africa's burgeoning aviation and connectivity needs. But while bullish about the potential of these companies in the years to come, he remains wary of the infrastructure, political and technological challenges they must first navigate if they are to fully meet their potential. Gallard cites a lack of trained pilots, poor safety records, African governments unwilling to open their skies and foreign competitors -- particularly from the Middle East -- who can undercut the prices of African airlines, as some of his most pressing concerns. Yet in spite of these issues Gallard remains optimistic about what can be achieved if airlines, manufacturers and governments work together for the good of continent as a whole. "Aviation ... is a machine that will develop the region," he says. If governments and African airlines can combine their interests and meet these challenges, he adds "they will be able to find growth and development," across Africa, taking full "advantage of this machine."

chatgpt: According to recent reports, Africa is emerging as one of the fastest growing regions for commercial aviation, providing a significant opportunity for major players in the global aviation industry like Boeing. The continent's potential for growth is huge, with a rapidly developing middle class and a steadily increasing demand for air travel. Speaking to reporters, the Vice President for Commercial Sales at Boeing, Ihssane Mounir, highlighted the enormous potential for African airlines and their role in driving economic growth and job creation.  Africa's growing middle class and urbanisation are driving up the demand for air travel, leading to a projected increase in passenger traffic of up to 350 million by 2035, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). With more people travelling and more destinations becoming accessible, the continent's commercial aviation sector is poised for explosive growth.  Boeing, which is one of the world's leading aircraft manufacturers, has a long-standing relationship with the African aviation industry, supplying some of the region's major airlines with its state-of-the-art aircraft. The company is committed to investing in and supporting the continent's booming aviation industry, with its full range of commercial aircraft, services, and technologies that will help African airlines deliver the best air travel experience to their passengers.  However, despite the enormous potential of Africa's aviation industry, there remain political and technological challenges that must be addressed if the continent's airlines are to fulfil their full potential. African airlines are often seen as high-risk investments, with political instability and regulatory uncertainty among the key challenges facing the industry. But Mounir said that the African aviation industry also needs better infrastructure, including airports and airspace management, as well as stronger government support and policies that encourage investment.  Another major challenge for African airlines is access to technology. Aviation technology is advancing at a rapid pace, and airlines need to keep pace with the latest developments in order to remain competitive. Advanced technology can improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the passenger experience. But acquiring the latest technology can be a significant financial burden for African airlines, and many are struggling to keep up with their counterparts in other regions.  Despite these challenges, however, the future looks bright for Africa's aviation industry. The growth potential is huge, and there is a growing recognition among governments and investors of the importance of the aviation industry to economic development. With the right policies and investments in infrastructure and technology, Africa's airlines can deliver an exceptional air travel experience for passengers and become major players in the global aviation industry.  In conclusion, Africa's commercial aviation industry has significant growth potential, but must overcome political and technological challenges to fulfil that potential. Boeing is committed to investing in Africa's aviation industry, and will continue to work closely with the region's airlines to support their growth and development. With the right policies and investments in infrastructure and technology, Africa's airlines can achieve great success in the global aviation industry, contributing to overall economic development and job creation across the continent.
