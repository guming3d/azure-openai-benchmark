article: (CNN) -- Cricket Australia has trademarked the term "63 not out" in an attempt to prevent people cashing in on the death of its Test batsman Phillip Hughes. The 25-year-old Hughes died after being hit on the head by a ball in a domestic match in Sydney last month. He had reached the score of 63 runs when the tragic accident occurred. His untimely death stunned the sporting world and the scheduled first Test between Australia and India in Adelaide had to be postponed as his teammates struggled to cope with their grief at his passing. Tributes on social media initially centered around a campaign #putyourbatsout on Twitter as thousands of people photographed cricket bats in unusual places to mark their respect for Hughes. But 63 not out also became an iconic symbol of the batsman's life and when the first Test eventually took place, spectators were asked to stand for 63 seconds of applause before the start. Australian players reaching that score during their innings also marked its significance with gestures and many in the crowd wore T-shirts or held up signs with 63 not out featured. However, cricket authorities in Australia and Hughes' representatives have become concerned about the volume of unlicensed memorabilia, mostly clothing and stickers, and the use of online auction sites to promote the various offerings. Cricket Australia said the agreement was purely "defensive" to prevent others trying to exploit Hughes' memory. "CA registered the trademark in conjunction with Phillip's management to prevent others trying to exploit Phillip's memory," a spokesperson told CNN. "There was some evidence of that starting," it added. The entire Australia-India series has been played out with continuous reminders of Hughes. The Australian team is wearing shirts with the number 408 stitched in. Hughes was the 408th player to represent his country in Test matches, the highest level of international cricket. Australia's players, especially those closest to Hughes, have also produced inspired performances against India, taking a 2-0 lead and dominating the Third Test which started on Boxing Day in Melbourne. Stand-in captain Steve Smith reached his Test-best 192 on Saturday as the home team posted a formidable first innings of 530. He was supported by innings from Brad Haddin (55), Mitchell Johnson (28) and Ryan Harris (74) as Australia scored quickly against the Indian bowling attack. India fought back to reach 108 for one wicket by the close, but its chancing of winning the match and attempting to square the four-match series is effectively over.

chatgpt: Cricket Australia has recently filed a trademark application for the term "63 not out", the score reached by the late Phillip Hughes in his final innings. The governing body has been quick to clarify that this move is not about profiting from Hughes' death but about preventing opportunists from profiting on the tragedy. Hughes was a much-loved and respected member of the cricketing community, with an impressive record in the sport. His untimely death in 2014 sent shockwaves through the cricketing world, prompting tributes from across the globe. Cricket Australia's move to trademark the term "63 not out" has raised eyebrows, with some critics arguing that it is a cynical ploy to cash in on Hughes' legacy. However, the governing body has been quick to distance itself from any such suggestion. In a statement released to the media, Cricket Australia said: "We have applied for the trademark '63 not out' to prevent anyone else from using this term for their own commercial purposes. This is not about profiting from Phillip's death, but about protecting his memory and his legacy." The move has been welcomed by many within the cricketing community, including former Australian captain Steve Waugh. Speaking to reporters, Waugh said: "I think it's a sensible move by Cricket Australia. We need to protect the legacy of our great players, and Phillip Hughes was certainly one of the greatest." Meanwhile, on the field, Australia are in a strong position in the third Test against India. The team put in an impressive performance on the first day, with Steve Smith scoring a century to help secure a commanding lead. Despite a late fightback from India, Australia remain in control of the match, with the visitors likely to face an uphill battle to salvage a result. The trademark application is just the latest in a series of moves by Cricket Australia to protect the sport and its players. The governing body has been vocal in its efforts to crack down on match-fixing, player misconduct and other issues that threaten the integrity of the game. As the sport continues to grow, with millions of fans tuning in around the world, it is vital that governing bodies take a strong stance on these issues. Whether it's protecting the legacy of a fallen hero, or clamping down on cheating, the role of cricketing authorities has never been more important.
