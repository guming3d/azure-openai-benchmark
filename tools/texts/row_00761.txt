article: Murder suspect: Raymond Zimmerman allegedly fled an Ohio hospital then took a 70-year-old hostage . A 17-year-old murder suspect who fled from police allegedly kidnapped an elderly woman, assaulted her, then made her drive him to his hideout in an apartment building. Raymond Matthew Zimmerman, who was being held at a hospital in Springfield, Ohio, was seen fleeing in his orange jumpsuit without any shoes on after being treated for an ankle injury which authorities now suspect was faked. After fleeing Friday night, police say Zimmerman, who is accused of murdering his uncle, sneaked to the house of the unnamed 70-year-old in the early morning. They then say he broke in, attacked her, then forced him to drive him away. According to local station WDTN, Zimmerman had hid in her house all night and changed clothes before kidnapping her. The alleged victim told police that he had held her hostage, then forced her to take him to an apartment block in the neighboring town of Ohio before letting her go. Police later tracked him down to the block, and arrested him around two hours after the alleged kidnapping. According to the woman's partner, Zimmerman arrived halfway through an 8:30am phonecall in which he warned her to be on the lookout for him. A police report said the man, halfway through arranging a breakfast meeting, mentioned the fleeing prisoner, only to be met with the response 'he is here' and a dead phone line. The report said there were signs of a struggle at her home - and a missing car. The woman returned while police were investigating - and officers say she had obviously been assaulted. Captured: Zimmerman was caught at a block of apartments in Fairborn, Ohio, near to where the allegedly captured woman had taken him . After giving her testimony, the woman was sent to hospital to be treated. Her injuries were not considered life-threatening. The Clark County sheriff's office and detention center pledged to work together to ensure 'such escapes never occur in the future'. Zimmerman had been in transit from Clark County Juvenile Detention Center for treatment of an ankle injury, which authorities now believe never really existed. According to a Clark County Sheriff's Department spokesman, Zimmerman made his escape after he had his handcuffs removed so he could use crutches. He and 18-year-old Robert V. Winbush, of Fairborn, were arrested last week in connection with the shooting death of William Henson, Zimmerman's uncle. Deputies found Henson's body in his home, which they said was robbed of 38 rifles, various other firearms and a large amount of ammunition. Besides the earlier murder charge, Zimmerman now faces felony charges of escape, aggravated burglary, kidnapping and auto theft.

chatgpt: A manhunt has finally come to an end with the arrest of a murder suspect who had fled from a hospital while receiving treatment. Raymond Zimmerman was discovered hiding in a woman's apartment in Fairborn, Ohio, on Friday night. The police have accused him of murdering his own uncle, whose body was found in Dayton, Ohio, earlier this month. Reports state that Zimmerman allegedly faked an ankle injury to escape from the hospital during treatment. After his escape on Friday night, he reportedly assaulted a woman who was present in the apartment he hid in. The victim later revealed that she was able to escape and call the police only after the suspect's 70-year-old accomplice drove him away from the scene. The Fairborn Police Department worked swiftly to locate the suspect, using a combination of witness accounts and local security footage. They managed to track him down to a nearby apartment building, where he was finally apprehended. The case had initially been dismissed as nothing more than an unfortunate family dispute, but it later turned into a murder investigation after the discovery of Zimmerman's uncle's body. As a result of the manhunt, Zimmerman is now facing additional charges for assault and fleeing police custody. Authorities have speculated that the suspect may have had help from other individuals during his escape from the hospital. Police are currently investigating whether or not there are other accomplices involved in the case. The community has expressed relief at Zimmerman's capture. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident as shocking but also praised the police for their quick response. "We're all glad that he's been caught and brought to justice. This sort of thing doesn't happen very often in our town, so it's been really unsettling for everyone". In light of the recent events, authorities have advised residents to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the police. The investigation into the murder of Zimmerman's uncle is ongoing, and anyone with information is encouraged to come forward. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of timely and effective police work in maintaining public safety. The authorities have promised to work tirelessly to bring those responsible for this heinous crime to justice.
