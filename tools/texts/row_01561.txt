Scientists at University College London (UCL) looked at how likely people were to quit smoking, start being active, or lose weight in relation to what their partner did . The findings, published in the journal Internal Medicine, show that people were more successful in swapping bad habits for good ones if their partner made a change as well. Among women who smoked, 50 per cent managed to quit if their partner gave up smoking too at the same time, compared with 17 per cent of women whose partners were already non-smokers, and eight per cent of those whose partners were regular smokers. The study found that men were equally affected by their partners and were more likely to quit smoking, get active, or lose weight if their partner made the same behaviour change. The research looked at 3,722 couples, either married or living together and over the age of 50. Researchers found people are more successful in taking up healthy habits if their partner makes positive changes too . Study co-author Professor Jane Wardle, director of Cancer Research UK's Health Behaviour Research Centre at UCL, said: 'Unhealthy lifestyles are a leading cause of death from chronic disease worldwide. 'The key lifestyle risks are smoking, excess weight, physical inactivity, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. 'Swapping bad habits for good ones can reduce the risk of disease, including cancer.' Dr Sarah Jackson, lead author of the study at UCL, said: 'Now is the time to make New Year's resolutions to quit smoking, take exercise, or lose weight. 'And doing it with your partner increases your chances of success.' Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's head of health information, said: 'Making lifestyle changes can make a big difference to our health and cancer risk. 'And this study shows that when couples make those changes together they are more likely to succeed. 'Getting some support can help people take up good habits. For example if you want to lose weight and have a friend or colleague who's trying to do the same thing you could encourage each other by joining up for a run or a swim at lunchtime or after work. 'And local support such as stop smoking services are very effective at helping people to quit. 'Keeping healthy by not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight and being active can all lower the risk of cancer, and the more people can help and encourage each other the better.'

chatgpt: Scientists at University College London have conducted a study that investigated the impact of partner support on individual health goals. The study, which focused on smoking cessation, weight loss, and improving overall fitness, found that those who had a partner with them in making positive changes were more likely to succeed. The study involved over 3,700 couples who were given a target to quit smoking, lose weight, or increase their physical activity. The results showed that when the partner joined in with the efforts, women were twice as likely to give up smoking compared to the control group whose partners were already non-smokers. In contrast, only 17% of women were successful in quitting smoking when they were not supported by their partners. The findings suggest that having a supportive partner can make a significant difference in achieving personal health goals. The researchers noted that this could be due to the social influence that partners have on each other, a phenomenon known as the "ripple effect." "It's really important to have supportive partners when trying to improve health behavior," said lead author Dr. Sarah Jackson. "Not only can they provide assistance and motivation, but they can also create a positive and encouraging environment." The study also found that the same positive impact was not observed for weight loss or physical activity. However, it was noted that having a supportive partner still had a beneficial effect on overall health. Dr. Jackson explained that this may be because giving up smoking is often a shared goal between partners, while weight loss and physical activity may be more individually driven. "For weight loss and physical activity, it may be more about creating an environment conducive to healthy living," she said. The study emphasizes the importance of social support and the need for couples to work together in achieving their health goals. The researchers hope that their findings will encourage individuals to involve their partners in their health journeys. "It's important to have that support system in place, not just for medical reasons, but for personal motivation and encouragement," said Dr. Jackson. In conclusion, the University College London study suggests that having a supportive partner can increase the likelihood of successfully quitting smoking, while also having a positive effect on overall health. Therefore, it is recommended that couples work together to create a healthy living environment and positively influence each other towards achieving their health goals.
