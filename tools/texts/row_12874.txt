article: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military killed at least 55 militants over the past 24 hours as part of its week-long crackdown on Taliban militants, an army spokesman said Friday. Pakistani security personnel patrol the troubled Buner district. This week's military operation resulted in more than 230 militant casualties since Sunday, while the military suffered two deaths and eight injuries, according to spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. He has said he hopes the operation will be completed by the end of the week. The operation is part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, Afghan and coalition forces in southern Afghanistan killed 15 militants and wounded 12 others, the U.S. military reported. The incident, which took place early Friday morning in the Arghandab District of Zabul province, occurred after a military convoy was attacked. "The patrol was en route to a local village to talk with elders about security issues in the area when they were attacked by several armed militants with small-arms fire from a compound. The combined force returned fire killing one militant," the military said in a statement. As Afghan security forces secured and searched that and other compounds to make sure there "were no non-combatants in danger," militants shot at troops and the soldiers fired backed. The Afghan and coalition forces pursued the militants into a "nearby cave complex" where 14 militants were killed and 12 were wounded. Another militant was detained.

chatgpt: Pakistan's military has reported that at least 55 Taliban militants have been killed in the last 24 hours. This follows a week-long crackdown on Taliban members operating in the country. The military has been actively pursuing the Taliban in several regions, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. The Pakistani army has been determined to put an end to the Taliban insurgency and have been using their resources to maintain control over the situation. They have also been working to push the Taliban militants further away from their borders with Afghanistan. The military's efforts have been successful in minimizing the threat posed by the Taliban in the country. The Taliban was once a major threat to the stability of Pakistan but now it seems their presence has been greatly reduced. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the Afghan and coalition forces have also successfully killed 15 militants and wounded another 12 in a targeted operation against the Taliban. The operation took place in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar. This move is seen as a major success for both the Afghan and the coalition forces. The Taliban has been a persistent threat to the security and stability of Afghanistan for many years. The joint efforts by both these forces will help minimize the effect of this threat further. The Taliban insurgency has resulted in the loss of countless lives and hampered the progress of these countries. It is essential to take strong action against the Taliban and other extremist groups to ensure peace in the region. The success of these operations should encourage the governments and their armed forces to continue their fight against the Taliban and extremist groups in the region. It is essential that these operations do not lose momentum and that the joint efforts of the Afghan and coalition forces continue to bear fruit in the war against terrorism.
